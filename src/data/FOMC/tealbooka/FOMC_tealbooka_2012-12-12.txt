Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received si nce the October Tealbook has been mixed 
but, taken as a whole, suggests that economic activity has been slightly softer than we 
anticipated.  October’s employment report and the most recent reading on orders and 
shipments of capital goods were somewhat bett er than projected.  However, data on both 
consumer spending and households’ real dispos able income have been notably weaker 
than we expected.  In addition, Hurricane Sandy temporarily disrupted activity in the 
Northeast at the end of October and probabl y will leave some small imprint on real GDP 
for the fourth quarter as a whole.  In all, real GDP growth is projected to rise at an annual 
rate of 1¾ percent over the second half of this  year, about ¼ percentage point less than in 
the October Tealbook. 
In the first quarter of next year, the rebound in farm output from last summer’s 
drought is, by itself, expected to contribute ¾ pe rcentage point to the growth of real GDP, 
and the recovery from the hurri cane is projected to chip in another ½ percentage point.  
As a result, real GDP is expected to increas e at a 1¾ percent pace despite the substantial 
tightening of fiscal policy that we assume. 
We have propagated the recent weakness in consumer spending and disposable 
income forward into our medium-term projectio n.  In addition, we now expect financial 
conditions to be a little less supportive than  we anticipated in the October Tealbook.  In 
particular, while we have maintained our  assumption that the FOMC will purchase 
$85 billion per month of longer- term assets through the middl e of next year, financial 
market participants, as best we can judge, e xpect purchases to con tinue at roughly this 
rate through the end of 2013.  Accordingly, we assume investors will  gradually realize 
that cumulative purchases will be about $500 bi llion less than they currently appear to 
have factored in.  Over time, this realizati on is expected to lead to a small amount of 
upward pressure on long-term interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar and a 
small amount of downward pressu re on stock market prices.   
The potential effect on business and cons umer spending of downside risks from 
the “fiscal cliff” has loomed large in our de liberations on both the near- and medium-term 
projections.  Anecdotes suggest  that many firms have put investment and hiring on hold 
as they wait for uncertainty about the size of  the fiscal contraction next year to be 
resolved.  While we do not doubt that cliff -related uncertainty ha s weighed on firms’

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  last published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP) following  the 
September  FOMC meeting.   The table  below summarizes  revisions  to the staff 
economic  projection  since the  September  Tealbook.    
The September  Tealbook  projection  did not assume any additional  monetary  
accommodation  such as was announced  following  the September  FOMC meeting.   
Accordingly, the  staff’s federal funds  rate assumption  is now appreciably  lower than  
in September, with the  funds rate remaining  at its effective  lower  bound until the 
fourth quarter of 2015 and reaching  only ½ percent by the end of that year.    
Although  the  key financial variables  underlying  the projection  became more 
accommodative  following  the anno uncement  of the FOMC’s new policy stance, some 
of these variables have  since retraced  part of that improvement,  and the 
conditioning  assumptions  for our projection  are now only a little more  
accommodative  than in September;  in addition,  incoming  economic  data have been 
to the soft side of our expectations  on balance.  In all, the staff projection  for real 
GDP growth is substantially  unchanged  from September.  The unemployment  rate 
has been revised down  throughout  the medium term, mainly reflecting  the surprises  
to the unemployment  rate  that we have  received since September.  As  before, 
significant  slack remains even at the end  of 2015. 
The staff projection  for infl ation is about unchanged  since September.  The  lower 
path for the unemployment  rate has only a small effect  on our inflation projection,  
given our estimate of  a relatively  flat Phillips  curve and stable inflation expectations.

  decisions of late, we judge that general pessimism—about the Eu ropean situation, the 
ability of the domestic economy to generate robust growth, and the e ffects of fiscal policy 
on economic growth in both the near term and years to come—is the primary factor 
restraining the recovery.  As a result, while the resolution of the fiscal cliff is expected to 
answer one set of concerns  about the path of the economy—and hence to contribute 
somewhat to the pickup in activ ity over the first half of next year—we project pessimism 
about the outlook more generally, as well as other headwinds, to fade only slowly and, 
therefore, we expect the journey back  to full employment to be quite slow. 
The broad contour of our forecast is simila r to that in the October Tealbook.  Real 
GDP growth is projected to step up to an annual rate of 2½ per cent next year, as a 
lessening of strains in Europe, improving dom estic financial conditi ons, rising consumer 
and business confidence, and a rebound from  the drought and Hurricane Sandy more than 
offset the anticipated drag from fiscal policy.  Thereafter, with fiscal restraint expected to 
diminish and the factors supporting the recove ry still in place, real GDP growth is 
expected to step up to 3¼ percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in 2015.  The slower pace of 
output growth in this projection relative to the previous one generates a commensurately more drawn-out reduction in the unemployme nt rate; at the end of 2015, we expect the 
jobless rate to stand at 6½ percent, about ¼ percentage poin t higher than in our previous 
forecast. 
On the price front, crude oil prices have come down some in recent weeks and 
gasoline margins have narrowed.  As a result, we have trimmed our near-term forecast for overall PCE inflation.  Otherwise, the outlook for inflation is essent ially unchanged from 
the October Tealbook:  Anchored  inflation expectations a nd wide margins of economic 
slack lead core PCE prices to rise 1.6 per cent both next year a nd in 2014, and 1.7 percent 
in 2015.  Given expected declines in crude oil prices over the medium term, total PCE 
inflation is expected to run a little below core inflati on—and, accordingly, a little below 
the Committee’s 2 percent objectiv e—over the next three years. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Our assumptions about the conduct of m onetary policy are close to unchanged 
from the October Tealbook.  With respect to  the balance sheet, we assume that the 
Federal Reserve will complete the maturity extension program (MEP) as scheduled at the 
end of December and purchase another $40 billio n of agency MBS over the course of the

  month.  And as in October, we further assume that the Federal Reserve will then purchase 
about $85 billion of longer-term secu rities per month through June 2013. 
Results from the primary dealer survey s uggest that market participants expect a 
longer-lived asset purchase pr ogram than the one we have assumed.  More specifically, it 
appears that investors currently expect that  cumulative asset purchases will be about 
$500 billion larger than in the baseline.  As  a result, we have incorporated gradual 
learning among financial market participants  through next summer, as they come to 
realize that the program will not continue past  midyear.  This learning effect causes long-
term interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar to be hi gher than they would 
otherwise be and causes stock prices to be lo wer.  By itself, this learning effect is 
expected to add between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point to the unemployment rate at the end of 2015 and subtract less than  0.1 percentage point from PCE inflation in that year.
1 
With respect to the federal funds rate, a nd consistent with our approach in the 
previous Tealbook, we adjusted the outcom e-based rule so that it reflects the 
Committee’s forward guidance in the October FOMC statement.2  On this adjusted basis, 
the rule implies that liftoff of the target federal funds rate from its effective lower bound 
will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015, one qua rter later than in the October Tealbook.  
Although different policy rules yield different pa ths for the federal funds rate, nearly all 
of the rules we typically c onsult—absent any adjustment  to reflect the Committee’s 
forward guidance—call for an earlier liftoff of the federal funds rate than is generated by 
the adjusted outcome-based rule.  In contrast, in our standard optimal control exercise, increases in the federal funds rate woul d not begin until early 2016.  (See Book B for 
more details on other monetary policy rules.) 
                                                 
1 These effects are somewhat smaller than those reported in the November 30, 2012, FOMC memo 
“Options for Continued Open-Ended Asset Purchases in 2013.”  In that memo, FRB/US model simulations 
with a similar $500 billion difference in purchases led to a 0.3 percentage point difference in the 
unemployment rate at the end of 2015 and a 0.2 percentage point difference in PCE inflation for that year.  Some, but not all, of these differences can be explained by differing assumptions regarding when market participants learn about the $500 billion difference in purchases.  We are currently reviewing both the FRB/US model’s structure and our judgmental procedures to better understand the sources of the differences.  We expect that this exercise will result in purchase-program estimates that lie somewhere 
between those now produced by the two approaches. 
2 The federal funds rate follows the estimated ou tcome-based rule described in the appendix on 
policy rules in Book B, with an intercept adjustment  that reflects the Committee’ s latest forward guidance 
about the likely date of tightening.  The adjustment was calibrated to delay the first increase in the federal funds rate until the third quarter of 2015 based on the economic outlook in the October Tealbook.  This intercept adjustment gradually declines beginning in the third quarter of 2015 and is zero starting in the 
fourth quarter of 2017.  We have not adjusted the rule to incorporate quantitative thresholds on either the 
unemployment rate or inflation.

  Other Interest Rates 
The 10-year Treasury yield ha s decreased about 15 basis points since the time of 
the October Tealbook to about 1½ percent.  We pr oject that this yield will rise to about 
4 percent in the fourth quar ter of 2015.  This projected in crease primarily reflects the 
movement of the 10-year valuation window th rough the period of extremely low short-
term interest rates and a gradual waning of the effects of unconventi onal monetary policy.  
In addition, downward pressures on Treasury rates should lessen  next year as concerns 
diminish about both the crisis in  Europe and the economic effect s of the fiscal situation at 
home, and as investors learn that the asset purchase program will be smaller than they 
currently appear to expect. 
Yields on investment-grade corporat e bonds are about unchanged since the 
October Tealbook amid a torrent of new issuance .  We expect these yields to rise to 
5¾ percent by the end of 2015.  Conventional 30 -year mortgage rates have edged down 
to the historically low level of about 3¼ pe rcent since the Octobe r Tealbook, but spreads 
of primary mortgage rates over MBS yields ha ve remained large.  Although we expect 
that these spreads will narrow somewhat in coming quarters, we project that mortgage 
rates will rise to about 5½ percent by the end of 2015 as MBS yields normalize gradually 
over the next two years. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad indexes of U.S. stock prices have decreased about 2¾ perc ent, on net, since 
the October Tealbook, with essentially all of th at decrease occurring between the close of 
that Tealbook and the subsequent FOMC mee ting.  With concerns about the European 
crisis and the U.S. fiscal situation anticipated  to lessen next year, we  project that equity 
prices will increase about 10 pe rcent in 2013, even as invest ors are disappointed by the 
size of the asset purchase program.  We project that equity prices will then increase at an 
average annual rate of about 8 percent in 2014 and 2015.  On average, the trajectory of 
equity prices over the entire projection peri od is about 4½ percent lower than in the 
October Tealbook, with about half of this revision reflecting ma rket disappointment 
about the size of the asset purchase program. 
Recent readings on home prices from Co reLogic, along with other house price 
indicators, have come in above our expecta tions, and, as a result, we have boosted our 
projection for the pace of hous e price gains this year a nd next to 7½ percent and 
4½ percent, respectively.  That said, we continue to project that home prices will be restrained by the large supply of distressed properties for sale  and tight credit conditions

  (see the box “Supply of Mortgage  and Consumer Credit”), and therefore expect house 
prices to rise at a 2½ percent pace in  both 2014 and 2015, unrevised from October. 
Fiscal Policy 
There remains considerable uncertainty about how and when the Administration 
and the Congress will resolve the issue of the fiscal cliff, and we e xpect uncertainty about 
fiscal policy to remain heightened into the first half of next year.  Nevertheless, we still 
assume that a legislative agreement will eventu ally be reached to avoid the full force of 
the fiscal cliff, and our policy assumptions are essentially unchanged from the October 
Tealbook.3  In particular, we assume that federal fiscal policy will exert a substantial drag 
on economic growth next year, reflecting the expiration of the payroll tax cut and the 
EUC program at the beginning of the year as we ll as declines in real federal purchases 
owing to the discretionary spending caps in  the Budget Control Act and reduced spending 
on overseas military operations.  But we also assume that key elements of the fiscal cliff will be replaced by much smaller fiscal adjustments.  Specifically, we assume that most federal tax provisions set to expire at the end of this year under cu rrent law, notably the 
2001–03 tax cuts, will instead be extended, a nd that the provisions of the spending 
sequestration will be replaced by much smaller tax increases and spending reductions.
4 
Reflecting both the assumed fiscal policy tightening and an anticipated 
acceleration in tax revenues as the economic recovery strengthens, the federal budget 
deficit is projected to narrow  from $1.1 trillion (7 percent of GDP) in fiscal year 2012 to 
about $600 billion (a little over 3 percent of GDP) in fiscal 2015.   We continue to expect 
that fiscal policy at all levels of government will directly restrain the rate of real GDP 
growth (excluding multiplier effects) by the amounts shown in the table “Total Fiscal 
Impetus.”

3 We assume that negotiations will also lift the debt ceiling in time to avert a disruption in the 
timely payment of all federal obligations, including the federal debt. 
4 These tax increases and spending cuts are assumed to generate a similar amount of deficit 
reduction as the sequestration over 10 years but to be implemented more gradually than the sequestration 
cuts.

 Supply of Mortgage  and Consumer  Credit 
The supply  of credit to U.S. households  tightened  substantially  during the financial crisis.  Over the 
past two years  or so, households’  access to credit has improved  somewhat,  but the recovery  has 
been slow  and unbalanced.   Specifically,  the supply of mortgage  and credit card debt has generally  
remained  very tight except  for borrowers  with the highest credit  scores, whereas  auto loans  and 
government ‐originated  student loans  have been much  more widely available.   We expect these 
credit conditions  to persist  into the near future as the economy  and labor market continue  to 
recover slowly  and as some important  regulatory  uncertainties  resolve only gradually.  
The supply  of mortgage  credit has remained  extremely  tight for borrowers  without very clean  
credit histories.  Borrowers  with credit  scores higher than 680 appear  to have ample access  to 
mortgage  credit, particularly  if they are financing  homes with down  payments  of at least 
10 percent  (lower‐left figure).  However,  potential  borrowers  with credit  scores of 620 or lower, 
who comprise  nearly 30 percent of all consumers, continue  to face more‐stringent credit  
conditions.   Even now,  only about 60 percent of  mortgage  lenders are willing to extend  credit to 
individuals  with a credit  score of 620 and a down payment of  10 percent.  (A year ago, the fraction 
of lenders willing to serve potential  borrowers  with FICOs  of 620 was closer to 50 percent.)   
Furthermore,  borrowers  unable to qualify  for prime  mortgages  have also faced tighter 
underwriting  on FHA‐ insured mortgages.  For  example,  the vast majority of respondents  to the 
October Senior  Loan Officer Opinion Survey  on Bank Lending Pract ices (SLOOS)  reported  that, 
compared  with 2006,  they were currently  less likely  to approve  FHA loan applications  from 
borrowers  with credit  scores of 620 (lower‐right figure).   
A key factor affecting  the availability  of mortgage  credit is that lending capacity remains nearly 
40 percent below its 2006 level.  Moreover,  given the sluggish reco very in the housing market, 
lenders have been expanding  their capacity only at a modest  pace.  With more‐stringent 
underwriting  standards  and longer origination  timelines, capacity  is likely to be strained for some  
time.

 Tight credit conditions  have also  continued  to prevail  in the credit card market.  Many borrowers  
(other than those with  the very highest credit  scores) saw their  lines of credit reduced in 2008 and  
2009 and have yet to see any restoration  at all (lower‐left figure).  Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  
that many lenders have  been focusing  on retaining  existing high‐credit‐quality customers  and have 
not been eager  to acquire  new customers  with potentially  lower credit  quality.  Indeed, one  
indicator of the supply of credit card debt is the mail volume  of credit card offers, and this measure  
has moved sideways at  a subdued  level this  year.  As  a result of stringent underwriting  over the  
past few years,  the composition  of credit card debt has shifted substantially  to borrowers  with 
more‐pristine credit records, which has driven delinquency  rates on existing credit card debt down 
to historically  low levels. 
By contrast,  consumers  have seen more  accommodative  conditions  in the auto loan market.  
Originations  of auto loans  have increased  notably since earlier this  year, and  aggregate 
outstanding  loan balances  for prime  and subprime  borrowers have  turned higher (lower‐right 
figure).  During the past two years,  SLOOS respondents  consistently  reported  a net easing  of 
lending standards  of auto loans.  Furth er, interest rates on such loans  have remained  at fairly low 
levels.  Moreover,  according  to surveys  of households,  consumers  no longer cite tight credit  
conditions  as their primary concern when making car purchase decisions.   The recovery in  the auto 
loan market is  due partly to the apparently strong  investor demand and favorable  conditions  in the 
market for asset ‐backed securities. 
Finally, the student loan market  experienced  profound  changes after the Department  of Education  
became the sole originator  of government ‐backed loans in 2010.  Since  then, student loans held by 
the federal government have  risen dramatically.   These loans  are provided  with essentially  no 
underwriting—a feature  motivated  by allowing  potential  students  to invest in their human capital 
and to increase  their earning power over  time.  That said, the  Survey of Consumer  Finances  data 
suggest that the share of households  having student loans  increased  about 70 percent and  real 
student loan  balance per borrowing  household increased  more than 50 percent  over the past 
decade.  Moreover,  delinquency  rates on student loans  remain elevated  while delinquency  rates on 
other consumer  loans have declined  substantially.   Therefore, a continued  rapid increase of  
student loan  debt could be of concern.

  Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP is expected to expand at  a below-trend annual rate of 2 percent 
in the current quarter, a bit higher than the subdued pace of the previous two quarters.  
Recent indicators tentatively point to some  improvement in emerging Asia; however, we 
expect economic activity in the near term to c ontinue to contract in the euro area, and we 
anticipate only weak growth in several other economies.  Financial stresses in Europe have eased slightly since the time of the October Tealbook, as European and IMF 
officials managed to reach agreement on aid to Greece.  However, financial conditions 
are expected to continue to restrain euro-area growth in coming months and to improve 
sufficiently to support a rebound only later next  year.  Europe’s recovery, when it does 
occur, along with the effects of faster U.S. growth, should help push total foreign 
economic growth up to nearly 3 percent in  2013 and about 3½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  
This outlook is little cha nged from the October Tealbook. 
The nominal exchange value of the dollar has risen slightly, on net, since the time 
of the October Tealbook.  In addition, the market’s learning about the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchases is assumed to put upward pressure on th e level of the dollar 
beginning next year.  As a resu lt, the trajectory for the dollar is about 1 percent higher, on 
average, over the forecast period than in the October Tealbook.  S till, the broad real 
dollar is projected to depreciate at about a 2¾ percent annual ra te over the medium term.  
This pace reflects some further trend deprec iation of the dollar against the emerging 
market currencies and our assumption that fina ncial stresses in the euro area will abate 
next year, unwinding safe-haven support for the dollar. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
Crude oil prices have moved down since the October Tealbook amid 
accumulating inventories and market concerns about a weaker global outlook, notwithstanding a flare-up of violence in the Middle East.  On ne t, the spot price of Brent 
crude oil closed at about $110 per barrel on December 4, about $6 per barrel lower than 
in the October Tealbook.
5  In response, we revised dow n our forecast for the price of 
imported oil by $3 per barrel in early 2013 and by less later in the forecast period.  Overall, the price of imported oil is projected to be about $97 per barrel for much of 2013 
and then to decline slowly over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching $87 per 
                                                 
5 The price of West Texas Intermediate has fallen $3 per barrel from its level at the time of the 
October Tealbook, closing on December 4 at $88 per barrel.

  barrel at the end of 2015, a path consistent wi th the downward slope of the Brent futures 
curve. 
On balance, nonfuel commodity prices are little changed from the time of the 
October Tealbook, as lower prices for agricultural products and, in partic ular, a fall in the 
price of soybeans on an improved outlook fo r global supply were balanced by higher 
metals prices, with prices for steel and iron ore moving up sharply on market 
expectations for stronger Chinese infrastructure investment.  Going forward, nonfuel 
commodity prices are projected to remain relatively flat through 2015. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK  
After rising at an annual rate of 2¾ per cent in the third quarter, real GDP is 
projected to increase 1 percen t in the fourth quarter, reflecting the effects of Hurricane 
Sandy and a sharp swing in federal government purchases.  Looking ahead to the first 
quarter, the anticipated expira tion of both the payroll tax cu t and the EUC program at the 
end of this year is expected  to reduce households’ disposable income and thus restrain 
real PCE growth considerably.  In contrast, farm output is projected to rebound from last 
summer’s drought, and activity that had been depressed by the hurricane is expected to recuperate.  As a result, we expect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of 1¾ percent 
next quarter. 
The Labor Market 
The labor market appears to be improving at a slightly faster pace than we had 
expected in the October Tealbook.  Privat e payroll employment increased 184,000 in 
October, and upward revisions to previous months brought the average increase over the 
three months ending in October to 150,000, up 40,000 from what we had written down in 
October.  And, while the unemployment rate edged back up to 7.9 percent in October, it 
was still a little below its third-quarter averag e.  Meanwhile, the workweek held steady at 
34.4 hours in October, down a bit from earlier in the year.6 
                                                 
6 The Affordable Care Act mandates that, beginning in 2014, businesses with more than 50 full-
time-equivalent workers provide their full-time workers (those employed at least 30 hours a week) with 
affordable health insurance or pay a fine based on the number of full-time employees not obtaining health 
insurance from the firm.  Some anecdotes suggest that  employers in industries where part-time employment 
is common and employer-provided health insurance relativ ely rare (for example, lodging and food services) 
are already reducing employee hours to below 30 hours per week to test how shorter workweeks would 
affect their business operations.  Thus far, aggregat e data on weekly hours and the share of part-time 
employment in the retail and food services sectors do not show any downward shift in weekly hours in

  Going forward, a number of temporary influences will likely buffet employment 
growth, making it difficult to discern the underlying trend.  For example, a spike in initial 
claims for unemployment insurance in the firs t half of November suggests that Hurricane 
Sandy likely held down employment last month (we have penciled in a hurricane effect 
of negative 75,000).  Going in the other dir ection, distortions to published seasonal 
factors stemming from the recent recessi on will likely increase published payroll 
employment gains in November and December and reduce published increases in the first quarter.  Looking through these temporary in fluences, and pending Friday’s employment 
report, our projection of underl ying employment growth is close to 150,000 per month in 
the fourth and first quarters, up about 15,000 from the October Tealbook.  Meanwhile, 
the unemployment rate is projected to edge  up to 8.0 percent in November and December 
and then slip back to 7.9 percent in the first quarter.
7 
The Industrial Sector  
Manufacturing production fell nearly 1 percent in October, reflecting disruptions 
associated with Hurricane Sandy.  However, nearly all of the facilities idled by the storm are now back on line, and some undoubtedly have raised output to make up for production lost during the hurricane.  Ex cluding the effects of the hurricane, 
manufacturing IP is estimated to have been little changed in October after declining at an annual rate of 1 percent in the third quarter.  November readings on the new orders indexes from the national ISM and regional manufacturing surveys, on balance, suggest 
only sluggish growth in factory output goi ng forward.  As a result, we project 
manufacturing IP to be little changed this quarter and then to rise moderately in the first quarter, the latter increase reflecting the pos t-hurricane bounceback in  factory output and 
some boost to production from rebuilding efforts. 
Household Spending 
Consumer spending appears to be increasi ng at a noticeably slower pace than we 
had expected in the October Tealbook.  In the third quarter, real PCE rose at an annual 
rate of 1½ percent, 1 percen tage point below our Octobe r projection, and weaker-than-
                                                                                                                                                 
either absolute terms or relative to other industries.  However, it is possible that we will see a shift in the 
composition of hours worked toward greater employment and fewer hours per worker in these industries as 
the effective date of the mandate approaches. 
7 The expected expiration of the EUC program by the beginning of next year is anticipated to 
contribute to the reduction in meas ured unemployment, as some unemp loyed workers currently receiving 
EUC benefits drop out of the labor force once these benefits expire.

  expected news about income points to less spending going forward as well.8  As a result, 
excluding hurricane effects, real PCE is expe cted to increase 2¼ percent in the current 
quarter and ½ percent in the first quarter, ¾ percentage point weaker, on average, than in 
the October Tealbook.9  As in the previous Tealbook, th e sharp deceleration in real PCE 
in the first quarter reflects our fiscal policy assumptions, including the anticipated 
expiration of the payroll tax cut and the EUC program. 
Housing activity has continued to st rengthen, although the level of activity 
remains quite low.  Following a large jump in September, single-family housing starts 
were roughly unchanged in October, while multif amily starts rose to their highest level 
since 2008.  Data on house prices, home sales, and builder and realtor sentiment, as well 
as expected rebuilding following Hurricane Sa ndy, all point to continued increases in 
residential construction activity  going forward, though we expect  the pace of increase to 
be restrained by tight mortgage credit for some households, a still large inventory of 
vacant homes, and concerns about the economic outlook.  All told, total housing starts are 
projected to rise from an annual rate of  780,000 units in the third quarter to 940,000 units 
in the first quarter.10 
Business Investment 
Investment in equipment and software (E&S ) looks to increase at an annual rate 
of 2 percent in the second ha lf of the year, up a bit from the October Tealbook.  Both new 
orders and shipments of nondefense capital good s excluding aircraft were stronger than 
expected in October.  Nevert heless, orders remain below the level of shipments, and 
surveys of capital spending plans have remain ed soft.  In addition, concerns about the 
fiscal cliff, the European situation, and the sl ow pace of the recovery  will likely continue 
to inhibit investment; expiration at the turn of the year of bonus depreciation is also 
expected to weigh on investment  next quarter.  As a result , we project growth in E&S 
spending to change little in the first quarter. 
                                                 
8 Data on income through October suggest that fourth-quarter nominal disposable income will be 
$90 billion lower than what we had written down in October, with lower labor compensation accounting for 
all of the revision.   
9 In October, Hurricane Sandy pushed down sales of  motor vehicles and other goods as well as the 
consumption of energy services.  Motor vehicle sales snapped back sharply in November, and we expect 
that the other affected components of  PCE also posted strong increases last  month.  In all, hurricane effects 
are expected to subtract ¼ percenta ge point from real PCE growth in the current quarter and add a similar 
amount to growth in the first quarter. 
10 We expect rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy (largely improvements to existing structures rather 
than starts) to boost the annual rate of residential investment by about 4 percentage points in the first quarter.

  We estimate that real nonresidential build ing investment declined 2 percent last 
quarter, and data on nominal spending thr ough October suggest another small decrease 
this quarter.  Both declines are smaller than  we had expected in the October Tealbook.  
Readings from the architectural billings index—a useful leading indicator—have moved 
up into neutral territory recently, and rebui lding in the wake of Hurricane Sandy should 
provide a small boost to outlays going forward.  As a result, we expect nonresidential 
building investment to edge up in the first quarter.  In the drilling and mining sector, 
continued application of new drilling technol ogies and recent incr eases in natural gas 
prices lead us to project solid gains in structures investment over the near term. 
Nonfarm business inventory investment moved up sharply in the third quarter, 
adding 1¼ percentage points to real GDP growth, a larg er contribution than was 
projected in the October Teal book.  Inventory-to-sales rati os from Census Bureau book-
value data and the staff’s flow-of-goods system , as well as reports on dealer inventories 
of motor vehicles, do not point to significan t inventory imbalances.  But given the slow 
pace of final sales growth that we project  this quarter and next, we expect nonfarm 
inventory investment to move lower, on ne t, over the fourth and first quarters.   
Government 
With defense spending rising sharply in the third quarter, total real federal 
purchases increased at a much-stronger-tha n-expected annual rate  of 9½ percent.  
However, recent monthly data on defense outlays  suggest that much of the third-quarter 
surprise will be unwound in the current quart er, and thus we have marked down our 
projection of real federal purchases to show a decline of ab out 9 percent.  In the first 
quarter, real federal purchases are expected to fall about 5 percent, a pace that would be 
consistent with our assumptions about budge t appropriations for di scretionary federal 
spending. 
After declining over the preceding two and a half years, real state and local 
government purchases look to have flattened out in  the second half of this year, largely in 
line with our expectations in the October Tealbook.  Real state and local purchases are 
estimated to have edged up at an annual rate of ½ percent in the third quarter, and recent 
data on employment and construction outla ys suggest that purchases by these 
governments will remain close to flat in the fourth and first quarters.

  Foreign Trade 
Real exports of goods and se rvices grew only 1 percent in the third quarter (held 
back in part by a steep falloff in exports to the euro area), but are e xpected to increase at 
an annual rate of 3 percent in the current quarter and then acce lerate to a 5 percent pace in 
the first quarter of 2013.  This projection is  supported by continued growth in emerging 
market economies as well as by the lagged effect of past declines in the dollar.  Real 
imports of goods and services were about flat in the third quarter; in both the fourth and first quarters, they are expected to increase a little less than 3 percent, supported by a 
rebound in imports of oil and computers.  Overall, the external sector is expected to be about neutral for GDP growth in the current quarter and then add ¼ percentage point to 
growth in the first quarter of next year; these contributions are more positive than in the 
previous Tealbook, largely reflecting the depr essing effect on imports of the lower 
projection for U.S. GDP growth.  This proj ection includes a modest adjustment for the 
port strike on the West Coast, which is assu med to depress trade sl ightly in the current 
quarter and boost trade early next year.   
Prices and Wages 
Total PCE inflation is projected to di p temporarily from an annual rate of 
1½ percent in the second half of  this year to about 1 percent in the first quarter, reflecting 
a deceleration in consumer energy prices.  After increasing at the end of the summer, 
gasoline prices are projected to fall sharpl y over the last two mont hs of the year in 
response to both falling crude prices and some further expected reduction in retail margins.
11  As a result, PCE energy prices are proj ected to increase at an annual rate of 
4½ percent this quarter (versus 12 percent in the October Tealbook) and then fall about 
9 percent in the first quarter, sim ilar to our projection in October. 
Food prices—after increasing at an annual rate of only ½ pe rcent in the third 
quarter—rose 0.3 percent in October and are pr ojected to increase at  an annual rate of 
2½ percent for the fourth quart er as a whole, close to what we had expected in the 
October Tealbook.  We think that October’s incr ease in food prices re flects the beginning 
of the pass-through to consumer food prices of the sharp run-up in crop prices from the 
summer’s drought.  We expect this pass-through to continue in the first quarter and to 
push up food price inflation to 3½ percent.  Gi ven the relatively small share of food in 
                                                 
11 While Hurricane Sandy has disrupted gasoline retailing and electricity supply in the New York 
and New Jersey area, we expect it to have little eff ect on energy prices at the national level.

  PCE (less than 8 percent), the effect on total PCE prices fr om the step-up in food price 
inflation should be small. 
The recent data on core PCE prices have b een largely as we had anticipated in the 
October Tealbook.  After rising at an annual ra te of 1¼ percent over the second half of 
this year, core PCE prices are projected to increase at a 1¾ percent rate next quarter, as 
some transitory factors current ly holding down inflation fade.12 
Wages continue to increase at modest  rates.  Average hourly earnings were 
unchanged in October after increasing 0.3 pe rcent in September, while two broader 
measures of compensation—nonfarm business compensation per hour and the 
Employment Cost Index for private-sector workers—increased at annual rates of just 
1 percent and 1¾ percent, respectively, in the third quarter.  The latest data were 
somewhat softer than we had expected and have led us to trim our projection for all three 
measures of compensation growth over the f ourth and first quarte rs, when we expect 
nonfarm business compensation to rise  about [2] percent on average. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK  
We have trimmed our projection for real GDP growth over the medium term in 
response to somewhat less supportive financia l conditions and our expectation that some 
of the near-term weakness in consumer spending and real income will persist.  As noted earlier, we assume that investor surprise at the size of the Federal Reserve’s asset 
purchases will put a small amount of upward pressure on longer-term interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar, and a littl e downward pressure on equity prices.  All 
told, real GDP is projected to increase 2½ percent next year, 3¼ percent in 2014, and 
3½ percent in 2015.
13  The slower pace of growth over the projection leaves the level of 
real GDP ¾ percentage point lower at th e end of 2015 than in the October Tealbook. 
Nevertheless, the broad contour of our medium-term forecast remains similar to 
that in recent Tealbooks.  We continue to expect real GDP to accelerate gradually over 
the projection period as a number  of restraining factors ease in an environment of highly 
                                                 
12 In part, our expectation of a little faster core in flation next quarter is due to our prediction that 
the pattern in recent years of weak year-end inflatio n followed by higher readi ngs early in the succeeding 
year (often termed residual seasonality) will continue .  Also contributing to the step-up in first-quarter 
inflation is our expectation that the destruction of automobiles caused by Hurricane Sandy will temporarily 
boost prices of used cars. 
13 Recovery from last summer’s drought and Hurri cane Sandy are each forecast to contribute a 
little under ¼ percentage point to real GDP growth next year.

  accommodative monetary policy.  We assume that European financial and economic 
conditions will improve gradually, and that th e restraint from the tightening of U.S. 
federal fiscal policy will diminish considerably after next year.  In a similar vein, the creditworthiness of households and firms should continue to slowly improve, and 
lenders’ willingness to extend credit to risk ier borrowers should increase, as the 
economic outlook brightens.  Finally, the drag  on new construction from the overhang of 
vacant homes should diminish further, as the foreclosure process continues and these properties are gradually sold off.  These deve lopments are expected to lead to a growing 
sense among households and firms that threat s to the recovery have diminished, which 
should, in turn, help to lo wer asset risk premiums, boost consumer and business 
confidence, and contribute to greater household consumption as well as business 
investment and hiring.  These improvements in  economic activity are then expected to 
lead to a self-reinforcing cycle in which faster  job and sales growth contribute to further 
improvements in consumer and business conf idence, credit availability, employment 
gains, and economic growth.   
The largest portion of the fiscal drag that  we anticipate next  year, reflecting the 
expiration of the payroll tax cut and the EUC program, is expected to show through in the 
form of restraint on households’ disposab le income and thus their spending.  
Nevertheless, these drags are offset by the re duction in concerns a bout U.S fiscal policy 
and developments in Europe that we anticip ate to occur later next  year, which—together 
with our assumption that many households will  increasingly come to believe that the 
recovery is on a firmer trajectory than they  previously thought—are  projected to boost 
consumer confidence, job growth, and househol d wealth.  Thus, we project a small step-
up in real PCE growth next year to a still re latively modest rate of 2¼ percent.  In 2014 
and 2015, as the effects of fis cal restraint on growth fade and the effects on income and 
job growth from the self-reinfo rcing cycle take hold, we e xpect real PCE to increase 
around 3½ percent. 
The eventual fading of downside risks a nd a gradual pickup in expected sales 
growth are also anticipated to lead to  an acceleration in E&S spending to roughly 
7 percent per year over the medium term.  However, because of still-elevated vacancy rates, low prices of commercial real estate , and difficulties in financing new construction, 
nonresidential building investment is expect ed to accelerate much more slowly, reaching 
only 3¼ percent growth by 2015.

  Growth in residential constr uction spending is also projected to benefit from the 
fading of downside risks and the self-reinforc ing cycle described previously; in addition, 
this sector should receive support from a slow reduction in the overhang of vacant homes.  
However, these effects are offset to some extent by a substantial increase in mortgage 
interest rates over the medium term as well as by a continued tight supply of mortgage 
credit to less-creditworthy borrowers.  As a result, we expect the recovery in housing to 
be gradual.  Although resident ial investment is forecast to increase an average of 
14 percent per year over the medium term, th e level of starts even at the end of 2015 
(at 1½ million units) is only sufficient to rough ly absorb what we estimate to be the 
demographically generated demand for additional housing units. 
The downward trend in real federal purchas es is projected to continue over the 
medium term, reflecting fiscal policy actions  intended to reduce the federal deficit and 
the winding down of spending on overseas milita ry operations.  These expected declines 
in federal purchases are only pa rtially offset by a gradual acc eleration in state and local 
spending, which we anticipate will be s upported by rising income- and sales-tax 
revenues.  In all, decreases in total real government purchases are expected to subtract 
¼ percentage point from real GDP growth in both 2013 and 2014.  In 2015, total 
government purchases are anti cipated to be about flat. 
Meanwhile, the external sector is expect ed to be neutral for growth in 2013 and 
2014 and then to make a small positive contribution to growth in 2015.  Both exports and 
imports are projected to accelerate over th e medium term reflecting strengthening 
economic growth at home and abroad, while the dollar’s expected depreciation helps 
support exports over imports.  Our projection fo r net exports is little changed from the 
October Tealbook, as the negative effect of a high er path for the dollar is largely offset by 
weaker import growth stemming from th e downward revision to U.S. growth. 
AGGREGATE SUPPLY , THE LABOR MARKET , AND INFLATION  
Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment 
We have not changed our estimates of pot ential output, structural productivity, or 
the natural rate of unemployment in this projec tion.  We continue to expect that a gradual 
increase in investment (and hence capital deepening), as well as a reduction in the natural rate of unemployment in 2015, will boost potential output growth from 1¾ percent this year to 2 percent in both 2013 and 2014, and to  2¼ percent in 2015.  The natural rate of 
unemployment is projected to remain at 6 percent through 2014.  In 2015—with the

  disparities between supply and demand in vari ous labor markets no longer as extreme as 
during the recession and early recovery—we expect functioning in the labor market to 
improve and the natural rate to edge down to 5¾ percent by the end of that year, on its 
way toward 5¼ percent later in the decade.14 
Productivity and the Labor Market 
We estimate that the level of labor produc tivity was a little over 1 percent above 
its longer-run trend in the thir d quarter, consistent with our view that firms’ apprehension 
about the outlook has made them reluctant to a dd further to their workforces.  We expect 
this apprehension to fade over time, incr easing labor demand and damping productivity 
growth a little relative to its trend. 
Our projected path for gains in payroll employment growth reflects this fading 
apprehension as well as the anticipated acce leration in real GDP.  We expect private 
payroll employment gains to continue to average 150,000 per month dur ing the first half 
of 2013 and then to pick up modestly to an average pace of 165,000 per month in the 
second half of the year.  As real GDP accel erates further after 2013, net hiring continues 
to strengthen to 200,000 per month in 2014 and 260,000 per month in 2015.  The figures for 2013 and 2014 are down about 10,000 and 50,000, respectively, from the October Tealbook, reflecting the somewhat slower pace of  output growth in this projection.  In 
2013, the still-modest expected gains in employment (combined with above-trend growth of the labor force) result in  only a small reduction in the unemployment rate.  After 2013, 
the faster pace of net hiring causes the unemp loyment rate to fall to 6½ percent by the 
end of 2015. 
Resource Utilization 
The level of real GDP is expected to be 4 percent below its potential level at the 
end of this year, and this es timated gap is projected to na rrow only slowly to 1¼ percent 
by the end of 2015.  Similarly, the estimated margin between the unemployment rate and 
its natural rate falls from 2 percentage points currently to ¾ percentage point at the end of 
2015.  There appears to be less slack in the manufacturing sector than in the broader 
economy, largely as a result of the st eep drop in capacity from 2007 to 2010.15  The 
                                                 
14 We estimate that the boost to the “effective” natural rate of unemployment from the emergency 
and extended unemployment insurance programs has diminished markedly and is currently worth less than 
¼ percentage point.  This effect is expected to di ssipate completely next year as benefits from these 
programs wind down. 
15 Unlike the staff’s measure of potential GDP, which directly incorporates trends in labor input, 
our concept of capacity for the industrial sector focuses on the capability of plants to produce with the

1972–2011 average in early 2014. 
Compensation and Prices 
Our projection for price and wage inflati on is little changed from the October 
Tealbook.  Over the medium term, inflation is expected to remain subdued, reflecting 
stable long-run inflation expectations, the relatively small movements projected for 
commodity and import prices, and persistent slac k in resource utilization.  In response to 
a modest reduction in resource slack over the medium term, core PCE inflation edges up 
from 1.6 percent in both 2013 and 2014 to 1.7 pe rcent in 2015.  Total PCE inflation is 
somewhat lower than core inflation over the medium term, averaging 1.4 percent per 
year, reflecting anticipated declines in ener gy prices.  Growth in compensation per hour 
rises gradually over the medium term, from 2¾ percent in 2013 to 3¼ percent in 2015 as 
the labor market gradually tightens. 
Our forecast of continued moderate infla tion is importantly influenced by recent 
readings on inflation expectations, which have remained in the relatively narrow range 
occupied over the last several years.  Median 5-to-10-year inflation expectations in the 
Michigan survey of consumers ticked up to 2.8 percent in November, while the median 
expectation of average PCE inflation over th e next 10 years reporte d in the quarterly 
Philadelphia Fed Survey of Professional Foreca sters edged down a tenth to 2.1 percent.  
TIPS-based measures of inflation compen sation for the next five years and for 
5-to-10 years ahead remain close to their va lues as of the time of the October Tealbook. 
Prices of imported core goods—which also  play a key role in the inflation 
outlook—are expected to change little, on net, over the second half of the year.  They are 
then projected to rise at an annual rate of  just under 1½ percent during the remainder of 
the projection—making them a neutral influenc e on domestic inflation—in line with the 
relatively flat trajectory for commodity  prices and the assumed pace of dollar 
depreciation.

  THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook  depends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 
2012 meeting.  The federal funds rate is set according to the estimated outcome-based rule, adjusted to be co nsistent with the Committee’s recent 
forward policy guidance. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2016 and 2017, albeit to a diminishing extent.  By 2018, the pr ocess of portfolio normalization is 
essentially complete. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities  and bonds continue to decrease 
gradually to normal levels, and fina ncial institutions further ease their 
lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) narrows further to 
about 3 percent of GDP in 2016 but wide ns thereafter, primarily reflecting 
fast-rising transfer paymen ts for retirement and health-care programs.  
Federal debt stabilizes temporarily at around 75 percent of GDP but then 
rises to 78 percent of GDP by the end of the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 1¾  percent per year 
in 2016 and 2017 and moves down more slowly thereafter.  The price of crude oil declines slightly in 2016 and then holds steady in real terms.  
Foreign real GDP growth is 3¼ pe rcent in 2016 and 2017 and slows to a 
3 percent annual rate late in the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment c ontinues to decline in 2016 and 2017, 
from 5¾ percent at the end of 2015 to 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 
2017, as conditions in the labor market improve; it remains at that level in the longer run.  Potential GDP increases at an average annual ra te of just over

  2¼ percent in the 2016–20 period and moves up to a 2½ percent pace in the 
longer run. 
The economy is projected to enter 2016 with output still below its potential level, 
unemployment above its natural rate, and infl ation below the long-r un objective of the 
Committee.  In the staff’s long-term for ecast, further improvements in household and 
business confidence, diminishing uncertaint y, and supportive financial conditions enable 
real GDP to rise at an average annual rate  of 3 percent in 2016 and 2017.  With real GDP 
expanding more quickly than potential output, labor market conditions improve further, 
and the unemployment rate ends 2017 be low 5½ percent.  Long-run inflation 
expectations are assumed to remain well anchor ed, and with the margin of slack in labor 
and product markets diminishing, consumer price inflation is close to  2 percent in 2017.  
Later in the decade, real GDP  rises at a pace close to potential, the unemployment rate 
converges to its long-run natura l rate, and inflation holds stea dy at close to 2 percent.  
The nominal federal funds rate rises to 4 pe rcent by the end of the decade and eventually 
stabilizes at around 4¼ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economic growth remained weak  at a 1¾ percent annual rate in the third 
quarter , a bit lower  than estimated in the October Tealbook .  We see a pickup to a still-
subdued 2 percent pace in the current quarter .  Expor ts and manufacturing indicators for 
the emerging market economies (EMEs) have improved somewhat in recent months , but 
foreign growth  remains restrained by an ongoing recession in the euro area and the tepid 
pace of recovery in the United States .  Financial stresses in Europe have eased slightly 
since the time of the October Tealbook, as European and IMF officials managed to r each 
agreement on aid to Greece.  However, we expect f inancial conditions to remain a drag  
on euro- area growth in coming months and to improve sufficiently to allow  a rebound in 
activity  only later next year.   
Aggregate foreign growth is projected  to rise to  nearly 3 percent  in 2013 , roughly 
its trend pace , and to 3½ percent by 2015 as the euro -area economy recovers  and the U.S. 
expansion strength ens.  This projection is little changed from  the October  Tealbook.  We 
marked up our forecast of growth in the euro area, in part reflecting lower financial 
stress es, and in emerging Asia , on stronger -than-expected data.  These markups were 
partly offset by downward revisions for  Canada , Japan , and the United Kingdom, where 
recent data s urprised on the downside .  Moreover, the lower path for U.S. GDP has 
weighed on our outlook for many foreign economies.  
Substantial risks remain for both the euro area and other parts of the world, as 
explored i n the Risks and Uncertainty section .  Although financial conditions in Europe 
have improved since the summer, there is still a nonnegligible chance of  an 
intensification of the European crisis with severe spillovers to the rest of the world .  
Additionally, although we are heartened by indications that growth  in the EMEs  is 
picking up , we remain  concerned  that this progress could stall, perhaps  owing to 
stronger -than-anticipated ef fects from the weakness in advanced economies.   
Foreign inflation edged up to 2¼ percent in the third quarter  and is projected to 
rise to 2½ percent in the current quarter , a little lower than in the October Tealbook .  
Ther eafter, inflation is expected to remain near that pace, restrained by economic slack in 
the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and quiescent prices for oil and other 
commodities.

  With inflation contained  and growth prospects still s ubdued , monetary policy is 
generally expected to remain accommodative.  The Bank of England (BOE)  and Bank of 
Japan (BOJ) took further , albeit modest,  easing actions  during the intermeeting period , 
and we expect the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to lower rat es one more time  in coming 
months.  I n the EMEs , several  central banks reduced policy rates, and we expect further 
easing over the forecast period.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Real GDP in the AFEs rose a meager ¼ percent in the third quarter, ½ percentage 
point less than we had estimated in the October Tealbook .  Euro -area GDP continued to 
contract, albeit less sharply than we had expected, while Canadian activity stalled and 
Japanese GDP plunged  an unexpectedly sharp  3½ percent .  We project  AFE growth to 
pick up only slightly  in the current quarter, with GDP declining  further in the euro area 
and Japan.  AFE growth should then recover to 1¼ percent in 2013  and 2¼ percent by 
2015 , supported by the projected abatement of financial stresses and fiscal drag in Europe 
as well as  the firming of the global recovery.  This projection is about unchanged from 
the October Tealbook, as a slightly stronger outlook for the euro area offsets 
correspondingly weaker prospects elsewhere. 
We continue to expect AFE inflation t o step up from ¾ percent at an annual rate 
in the third quarter to 1¾ percent in the current quarter, reflecting a bounce back in 
inflation readings in Canada, a large hike in university tuition fees in the United Kingdom, and the stabilization of Japanese food prices following sharp declines.  
Ther eafter, we project that AFE inflation will average about 1½ percent, held down by 
sizable resource slack and the absence of commodity price pressure.  
Euro Area  
According to the preliminary estimate, euro -area GDP  contracted  just 0.2 percent  
at an annual rate in the third quarter .  The pace  of contraction was ½ percentage point less 
than we had anticipated , as consumption spending showed surprising resilience in France 
and Germany.  However, in October, euro- area re tail sales dropped and the 
unemployment rate rose to a record -high 11.7 percent .  Moreover, consumer confidence 
in October and November was below its third -quarter average and the composite PMI 
through November remained solidly in contractionary territory .  As such, we continue to 
expect GDP to fall a further 1 percent at an annual rate in the current quarter.

  Euro -area financial conditions eased a bit  over the intermeeting period.  Market 
participants remain ed concerned about the Spanish government’s  reluctance to request a 
financial assistance program , the potentially destabilizing Italian election s in the spring , 
and unsettled discussions over the direct recapitalization of banks by the European 
Stability Mechanism.  However, the agreement by Greece’s of ficial creditors to provide 
more funds and ease Greece’s  debt burden put off the risk of a disorderly Greek exit from 
the euro area.  (See the box “Recent Policy Developments in the Euro Area.”)   We still 
judge that financial tensions  will remain elevated in the coming months, but by l ater next 
year, we assume a more sustained process of financial normalization will ensue against 
the back drop of some progress toward  banking union, continued efforts by the Spanish 
government to reduce its fiscal deficit and shore up its banking system , and further 
adjustment in other peripheral economies .  This normalization will allow the euro area to 
climb out of recession , although continued fiscal drag and tight credit conditions will 
restrain the growth of euro-area GDP  to only ½ percent in 2013 and hold it to 1½ percent 
in 2014 and 1¾ percent in 2015.  This outlook is marginally stronger than in the October 
Tealbook , as we assume financial conditions will be a touch more favorable than we 
envisaged in October . 
Recent data suggest that euro -area inflation will remain around 2¼ percent at an 
annual rate in the current quarter .  The projected further decline in oil prices and 
additional widening of the output gap are expected to  reduce inflation in 2013 to 
1½ percent, where it should remain throughout the forecast period.  This path is about 
unchanged from the October Tealbook.  We expect the ECB to continue providing 
significant liquidity support to banks and to  cut its benchmark policy rate 25 basis points 
to 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2013 in response to persistently weak  economic 
conditions. 
Japan  
According to the initial estimate, Japanese GDP  fell 3.5 percent in the third 
quarter.  The contraction was substantially larger than we had estimated in the October Tealbook ; exports dropped surprisingly sharply, and, to a lesser extent, private domestic 
demand was weaker  than anticipated.  The downturn reflect ed the slow ing in global 
manufacturing activity, heightened tensions with China  that are weighing on J apan’s 
exports , and diminish ed support from fiscal stimulus measures.  These headwinds are still 
present  in the current quarter .  In October, real merchandise exports and retail sales 
continued to drop, and in N ovember , the manufacturing PMI  fell to its lowest level since

 Recent Policy Developments  in the Euro Area 
Since the time  of the October Tealbook, financial  stresses in Europe have moderated  a 
touch (see lower ‐left figure on the next page), in part as the Greek government  and 
official creditors  came to agreement regarding  Greece’s  assistance program.   
Investors  did not react strongly  to the Spanish government’s  continued  reluctance to  
request financial support and  the lack of progress toward  European  banking union. 
 
In early November, the  Greek Parliament  approved  an ambitious  program  of further 
austerity measures  and structural  reforms,  thus satisfying  the preconditions  for an 
additional  disbursement  of funds by official creditors.  EU  and IMF officials 
subsequently  extended  the Greek  government’s  deadline for achieving  a primary  
surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP from 2014 to 2016.  However, this  concession,  together  
with worse ‐than‐expected  macroeconomic  outcomes  and delays in  the 
implementation  of fiscal consolidation  measures  in the current year,  resulted in an 
estimated  funding gap for the Greek government  of about €30 billion over the  next 
four years.  Extending  the deadline for the  fiscal target also  helped push the projected  
level of Greece’s  debt to 144 percent  of GDP in 2020,  well above the IMF’s  original 
requirement  of 120 percent.  
 After protracted  negotiations,  on November 26,  European  and IMF authorities  
ultimately  agreed to disburse  at least €43.7 billion  by March 2013, to be  made in four 
installments,  as well as a strategy  to cover Greek funding needs over the  next several 
years and provide more‐favorable  debt financing  terms.  Under the plan,  European

loans, defer  interest payments  on European  Financial  Stability Facility (EFSF) loans by 
10 years, extend maturities  on both types of loans by 15 years, and transfer the 
Eurosystem’s  profits on Greek bonds purchased  under its Securities  Markets 
Programme  to the Greek government.   The plan also sets aside €10 billion for a 
buyback of privately  held Greek sovereign  debt at a sizable  discount,  to be completed  
before the first installment  is disbursed.
1  All told, these efforts  will reduce  the 
likelihood  of a near‐ term Greek exit from the euro zone.  That said,  Greece will face 
daunting  challenges  meeting its program  targets in the face of a deepening  recession,  
mounting  fatigue with  austerity,  and still‐ high debt levels.  Even with the debt ‐relief 
measures,  we still expect  Greek debt to remain  at nearly  150 percent  of GDP in 2020 
(see lower‐ right figure  on the next page), well above  the official estimates,  reflecting  
the staff’s less optimistic  growth and fiscal assumptions.   Thus, the recent agreement 
alleviates  but  does not fully resolve Greece’s  difficulties.  
 
Elsewhere  in the periphery,  the Spanish government  remains reluctant to seek  an

stated that Spain’s plans to reduce  the deficit and to implement structural  reforms 
may be sufficient  to meet the conditionality  associated  with a financial  assistance 
program.   However,  Spanish authorities  continue  to be deterred by  the possible 
stigma associated  with a request  for aid; concerns  that the ECB would not intervene  in 
Spanish debt  markets with sufficient force  to make a request worthwhile;  and recent 
improvements  in financial conditions,  which diminish the apparent  need for external  
assistance.   Even so, Spain’s  situation  remains challenging.   The Spanish  government  is 
likely to miss its  fiscal target for the year,  an outcome  that could trigger increases  in 
its funding costs.  In  addition,  gains by separatist  parties in recent Catalonian  elections  
highlighted  the difficulties  Spain faces in reining in spending  by regional governments.  
Spain’s fiscal situation  will likely  remain challenging  in the coming year as its recession 
deepens.   On a positive  note, the recapitalization  of Spain’s four weakest  banks, 
which is expected  to total about €40 billion,  is proceeding  according  to plan.   
 Political and legal hurdles continue  to impede  progress  toward European  banking 
union and direct recapitalization  of banks by the European  Stability Mechanism  (ESM).  
Disagreement continues  over the ECB’s role as potential  supervisor, primarily  in the 
scope and  coverage  of ECB supervision and  the powers that will be conferred  on the 
ECB.  Although  leaders remain committed  to the transfer of  at least some supervisory  
responsibilities  to the ECB in early 2013, it will take time before the ECB can become  
fully operational  in its new role.  Meanwhile,  the establishment  of pan‐European  
deposit insurance and  bank resolution  schemes  remains tabled, increasing  doubts 
about prospects  for the near ‐term creation of  an effective  backstop  for banks.  In  
addition, European  authorities  have yet to agree on the conditions  for direct  
recapitalization  of banks by the ESM, a step critical  to reducing the fiscal burden on  
governments  of vulnerable  euro‐area countries  with extensive  banking‐sector 
problems.

  April 2011.  Accordingly, we now project that GDP will decline ½ percent at an annual 
rate in the fourth quarter, a lso weaker than in the previous Tealbook.  Next year, as the 
global recovery firms, GDP growth should turn positive and gradually pick up to 
1½ percent by year -end, but it falls back below 1 percent i n 2014 and 2015 in response to 
two planned consumption tax hikes.   
The pace of deflation accelerated to 2 percent at an annual rate in the third 
quarter, as food pr ices fell substantially.  With recent data indicating that food prices have 
leveled off, deflation should moderate to ½ percent in the current quarter .  Inflation is 
projected to remain slightly negative in 2013 before being boosted to an average of 1½ percent in 2014 and 2015 by the consumption tax hikes.   
Faced with persistent deflation and weaker growth prospects, the BOJ expanded 
its asset purchase program by ¥11 trillion (about 2¼ percent of GDP) at the end of October.  It also launched a new facility  to provide loans to the nonfinancial sector 
modeled after the BOE ’s Funding for Lending Scheme.  We continue to assume only 
modest further increases in the size of the BOJ’s asset purchase program , but the BOJ 
may be pushed toward more -aggressive policies .  Shinzo Abe, the favorite to become 
prime m inister after the upcoming election of Japan’s Lower House of Parliament , has 
called for the inflation target to be raised to 2  to 3 percent, and he would be charged with 
replacing BOJ G overnor Shirakawa and his  two deputies early next year.    
United Kingdom 
U.K. GDP expanded a s olid 4 percent in the third quarter following three 
consecutive quarterly declines.  However, the acceleration in activity largely reflected a temporary boost to demand from the London Olympics and payback from the loss of a 
working day in June to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.  Recent domestic indicators suggest less underlying economic momentum than we had assumed.  Retail sales stood 
below their third -quarter average in October , while the composite PMI slid  to an 
October –November average around 50 .  Consequently, we revised down our near- term 
GDP growth projection a bit , and we  now expect GDP to stagnate in the fourth quarter.  
Recovery in  the euro area and supportive monetary conditions should lift GDP growth to 
1½ percent in 2013  and to  2½ percent by 2015. 
Inflation readings in September and October were higher than we had anticipated, 
even after accounting for the planned hike in tuition fees, leading us to revise up inflation

  to a 3 ½ percen t pace in the second half of 2012.  We still expect s ubstantial econ omic 
slack and falling oil prices to  keep inflation in check at around 1 ¾ percent thereafter .  On 
November 9, U.K. authorities announced the gradual transfer to the government  of the 
cash ac cumulating at the BOE’s Asset Purchase Facility, which should result in a small 
easing of monetary conditions as the government  will now need to issue less debt to 
finance its deficit over the medium term.  For this reason, we no longer expect the central 
bank  to expand its asset purchase program from its current level o f £375  billion 
(25 percent of GDP).   According to the first set of quarterly statistics on usage of the 
BOE’s Funding for Lending Scheme, only 6 of the 35 participating institutions had drawn 
a combined total of £4.4 billion by the end of September.  
Canada  
Canada’s real GDP growth stepped down from 1.7 percent in the second quarter 
to 0.6 percent in the third quarter.  The slowdown was driven by a sharp drop in exports and by a great er-than-anticipated effect  of maintenance shutdowns in the oil, gas, and 
mining sector.  Although we expect some payback in the current quarter from the restoration of production, we left our fourth- quarter estimate of GDP  growth unchanged 
at just under 2 percent  because  U.S. growt h was  revised down and some recent indicators 
were  relatively weak .  Notably, the manufacturing PMI declined for a fifth  consecutive 
month in November  to just above 5 0.  We expect growth to remain around 2  percent in 
2013 before picking up to 2½ percent in  2014 and nearly 3  percent in 2015  as global 
economic conditions improve .  This projection is a touch weaker than in the October 
Tealbook, reflecting softer U.S. growth prospects.  
Recent data on consumer prices suggest that inflation is on track to rebound from 
about zero in the third quarter to 2 percent in the fourth.  Given  a moderate but persistent 
output gap, inflation should average less than 2 percent through 2015.  We continue to 
expect no rise in the Bank of Canada’s target for the overnight rate, currently at 1 percent, 
until mid-2014. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
With the bulk of the data releases in hand, we estimate that real GDP in the EMEs 
grew at an annual rate of  only 3½ percent in the third quarter, well below its historical 
trend.  This estimate is roughly in line with the downward- revised pace in the previous 
quarter and about unchanged from ou r October Tealbook forecast.  It  incorporates the 
surprisingly  strong GDP release for China, which was reported jus t after the October

  Tealbook.  But t his positive surprise was roughly offset by markdowns  for some other 
EMEs, such as Brazil and Mexico.   
The tone of the incoming data for the fourth quarter —such as PMIs and exports —
has been more encouraging, and we expect EME growth to increase to almost 4  percent 
in the current quarter, ¼ percentage point higher than  in the October Tealbook.  EME 
exports to the advanced economies still remain weak .  However,  the effects of EME 
policy accommodation , as well as the positive implications of China’s momentum for its 
trading partners , should help support growth in the fourth quarter.  We anticipate that 
GDP growth will step up further to 4¼ percent in the first quarter  of 2013 and average 
4¾ percent over the remaind er of the forecast period, supported by the recovery in the 
advanced economies and accommodative domestic policies.  The medium -term outlook 
is little ch anged from the October Tealbook, with the somewhat greater momentum we 
are seeing in the EMEs offset by  the negative effects of a lower U.S. growth outlook.   
We expect EME inflation to edge down to 3 percent in the fourth quarter from 
3¼ percent in the third.  Food price pressures have generally waned, although, in some 
Latin American economies , more slowl y than we had anticipated at the time of the 
October Tealbook.  Inflation is expected to remain at around 3 percent next year, held 
down by some further unwinding of food price pressures, before edging up to 3¼ percent 
in 2014 and 2015 .  The central banks of Colombia , Israel,  and the Philippines lowered 
policy rates  during the intermeeting period, and we expect further monetary easing in 
China, India, and Korea.  
China  
Chinese real GDP , released right  after the clos e of the October Tealbook, gr ew 
nearly 8½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, 1½ percentage point s faster  than 
anticipated and up from a downward- revised 6½  percent in the second quarter.  Monthly 
data suggest that the economy’s rebound has solidified; retail sales, industrial production, and investment growth picked up in October.  In addition, the manufacturing PMI in November increased for the third straight month.  Consequently, we revised up our projection of Chinese growth in the current quarter and next year.  We now  call for GDP 
growth to remain around 8 percent throughout the forecast period rather than gradually picking up to that pace by the end of next year.  Growth in China will be supported by 
some modest additional monetary and fiscal policy stimulus and a gra dual improvement 
in global demand.  However, overcapacity in some sectors, including the property

  market, and the potential for stresses in the banking sector continue to pose downside 
risks to our forecast.  
Chinese consumer price inflation edged lower in October, as food prices further  
retrace d their previous run -up.  We expect headline inflation to rise in coming quarters as 
food prices stabilize  and wages continue to grow strongly .  Accordingly, we project 
inflation to edge up to a 2 percent annual rate in the current quarter and then increase to 
3 percent by 2014.  
In mid -November, new Chinese leadership was unveiled at the 18th  National 
Party Congress of the Communist Party  of China .  As expected, Xi Jinping and Li 
Keqiang  were appointed to the top two posts and will become the president and premier 
of the country, respectively, in March.  We do not expect  economic policies, including 
the pace of reforms, to change  appreciably , at least  over the next few years,  as a result of 
this change in leadership.  
Other Emerging Asia 
In the rest of emerging Asia, real GDP growth moved up to 2¾ percent in the 
third quarter but was still well below potential.  Growth was in line with our October 
forecast, as positive surprises in Hong Kon g, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand were 
offset by negative surprises in India, Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.  India’s third -
quarter GDP release suggested that the economy remains in the doldrums, with 
moderating service- sector growth compounded by weakness  in the agriculture, 
manufacturing, and mining sectors.  Lackluster  exports to Europe continued to weigh on 
activity in the region and appeared to spill over into domestic demand, particularly investment.  For the current quarter, however, improved readings on PMIs and exports support our view that activity has been improving, albeit gradually.  With firming  
Chinese growth also providing some impetus , we now expect the pace of expansion  in 
the rest of emerging Asia  to rise to 3 ¼ percent in the current quarter, ½ percentage point 
higher than in our October Tealbook forecast.  Thereafter, growth in the region should 
increase further to 4 percent in the first half of 2013 and 4¾  percent by the end of the 
forecast period, supported by recovering advanced -economy demand and accommodative 
macro economic policies.   
Inflation in the region is expected to step up to an annual rate of 4 percent in the 
current quarter from 2¾ percent in the third , largely reflecting a spike in Hong Kong

  inflation in October following the removal of a housing subsidy.  With food price 
pressures that had boosted inflation earlier this year gradually unwinding, inflation is 
expected to moderate to 3 percent by mid -2013 and should stay  at around that rate over 
the remainder of the fo recast period.   
Latin America 
In Mexico, real GDP growth slowed to an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the third 
quarter, down from about 4½ percent in the first half of this year, in part reflecting the contraction in U.S. manufacturing output .  This figure was ½  percentage point below our 
October Tealbook estimate and a little lower than would have been suggested by the 
third -quarter data on manufacturing  output, cons truction and retail sales .  We expect 
growth in Mexic o to step up to 2½ percent in t he current quarter:  E xports, which ha d 
been sluggish since the first quarter, picked up in October, and  the manufacturing PMI 
remained in expansion ary territory  through November .  Even so, c urrent -quarter growth  
is ½ percentage point lower than in the October Tealbook, reflect ing the downward 
revision to U.S. manufacturing output , which was depressed by Hurricane Sandy.  As 
U.S. manufacturing picks up , Mexican GDP growth should move up to 3¾ percent by the 
middle of next year and stay there for the re st of the forecast period.   
In South America, real GDP is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 
3¼ percent in the third quarter, ¼ percentage point higher than in the October Tealbook 
and up from 2½ percent in the second quarter.  In Brazil, where growt h had been 
lackluster for over a year, real GDP growth picked up to 2½ percent in the third quarter, 
but this rise was still somewhat weaker than we had anticipated , as fixed investment 
declined .  However, a large positive surprise to growth in Chile, which came in at 
5¾ percent in the third quarter, more than offset the effect of the miss in Brazil.  We 
expect that growth in South America will average about 3¾ percent over the forecast period , as the recovery in Brazil  gains  a surer footing.    
In Mexic o, inflation is expected to step down to an annual rate of less than 
4 percent in the current quarter , reflecting some reversal of food price pressures that had 
pushed inflation up to 6½ percent in the third quarter .  Mexican inflation is expected to 
moder ate further and average about 3¼ percent over the forecast period, little changed 
from the October Tealbook.  We see inflation in Brazil r emaining  elevated at a 
6¾ percent annual rate in the current quarter, as  food price  inflation is still  quite high.

Financial Developments 
Financial market sentiment deteriorated  somewhat over the intermeeting period, 
importantly reflecting market participants’ asse ssment of the possible implications of the 
“fiscal cliff” negotiations for the U.S. economic outlook.  Concern about the fiscal 
situation reportedly intensified just after th e presidential election but  subsequently eased 
somewhat, apparently on the view that, despite little concrete progress in the 
negotiations, policymakers will ultimately reach an agreement that would avoid an 
outsized fiscal tightening in the new year.  Other developm ents, such as the evolving 
European situation and global economic growth  prospects, appeared to leave a smaller 
imprint on domestic financial markets, and i nvestors seemed to take little signal, on 
balance, from incoming domestic economic data. 
On net over the intermeeting period, market -based measures of expectations for 
the path of the federal funds rate rotated down.  Information from interest rate derivatives 
suggests that market participants now expect th e federal funds rate to begin to rise in the 
first quarter of 2015, two quarter s later than at the time of the October FOMC meeting.  
Yields on longer-dated Treasury securities and on agency mortgage-backed securities 
(MBS) declined, and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation showed mixed 
changes.  Broad indexes of U.S. equity  prices were about unchanged, spreads on 
corporate bonds relative to comparable-matur ity Treasury securities moved up modestly, 
and the broad foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed. 
Historically low interest rates continued to support financing flows to the 
nonfinancial corporate sector a nd, to a lesser extent , to the household sector.  Corporate 
bond issuance increased further in October and November, and commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans continued to grow  briskly.  In the household sector, nonrevolving consumer 
credit again expanded significantly in the th ird quarter, while revolving credit remained 
about flat.  Mortgage refi nancing activity edged up in October and November, but 
conventional mortgages remained difficult to obtain for households without stellar credit 
scores, and aggregate home mortgage debt contracted further in the third quarter.  
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Reportedly due in part to the heightened concerns about the fiscal outlook and its 
implications for the U.S. economy, the expected  path of the federal funds rate derived

  from overnight index swap (OIS) rates sh ifted down beyond early 2013 on net.  The 
expected path now suggests that investors anticipate the federal funds rate will first rise 
above the current target range in the first quarter of 2015, about two quarters later than at 
the time of the October FOMC meeting.  Much of this decline came following the 
election and likely reflected greater investor certainty that monetary policy will remain accommodative in light of the increased concer n about the fiscal cliff.  The modal policy 
path—the most likely values for future federal funds rates based on caps-implied  
risk-neutral distributions—rem ains within the current targ et range through the second 
quarter of 2016.
1 
In contrast to the market-based measures, results from the Open Market Desk’s 
latest survey of primary dealers indicated a slight upw ard shift in medium-term policy 
rate expectations, consistent with the small improvement in dealers’ assessment of the 
labor market outlook. 2  Survey respondents continued to view the second half of 2015 as 
the most likely time of the first target rate  increase.  Dealers anticipate only about a 
10 percent probability that the FOMC will adopt  threshold guidance for the federal funds 
rate at the upcoming meeting, but they assign slightly be tter-than-even odds to the 
prospect that the Committee will adopt the thre sholds at one of the next three meetings.  
Regarding asset purchases, all survey respondents expected the FOMC to announce new open-ended Treasury purchases after the conc lusion of the maturity extension program 
and to continue current open-ended MBS purch ases, with an estimated monthly pace of 
purchase of about $45 billion for Treasury s ecurities and about $40 billion for agency 
MBS over the next three meetings.  Dealers c ontinued to view the first quarter of 2014 as 
the most likely time for the end of those purchases, and the expected amount of SOMA 
holdings by the end of 2013 was largely unc hanged from the October survey.   
FOMC communications over the intermeeti ng period were largely in line with 
market expectations and elicite d little price reacti on.  However, investors were apparently 
struck by the discussion in the FOMC mi nutes regarding the possible adoption of 
threshold values for inflation and the une mployment rate to provide more-explicit 
forward guidance on the timing of the initia l increase in the federal funds rate.   
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.  
2 The upward revision in dealer e xpectations for the federal funds rate reflected a change in the 
views of only a few dealers; most dealer forecasts of the federal funds rate were little changed.

  Treasury yields decreased, on net, over the intermeeting period, with 5-year yields 
dropping 14 basis points and 10-ye ar yields declining 18 ba sis points, reflecting the 
downward revision in the market-based measures  of policy expectations and perhaps also 
some flight-to-quality demands related to concerns surrounding the fiscal outlook.  
Inflation compensation measures showed mixed changes, with 5-year TIPS-based 
inflation compensation edging up, on net, a nd the 5-year forward measure declining 
13 basis points.  Swaps-based forward measur es of inflation compensation were about 
unchanged, and survey-based measures of inflation expectations changed little, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period. 
The Desk’s outright purchases and sales of Treasury securities under the maturity 
extension program continued to proceed as pl anned and did not appear to have material 
adverse effects on Treasury market functioning.3  Measures of liquidity conditions in the 
Treasury market remained stable.  Over th e intermeeting period, the Desk purchased 
$98 billion of agency MBS under the open-ended MBS purchase program and the 
reinvestment program.  Overall, MBS ma rket functioning indicators over the period 
showed no signs of material stress desp ite increased settlements by the Desk.4   
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were little changed, on net, over 
the intermeeting period, with no reports of major trading or operational disruptions 
following Hurricane Sandy.  The spread between three-month LIBOR and  
comparable-maturity OIS rates was about unchanged, on balance, since the October 
FOMC meeting, as was the spread between th e three-month forward rate agreement three 
months ahead and the corres ponding forward OIS rate (a forward-looking measure of 
potential funding strains).  Unsecured commercial paper (CP)  spreads paid by financial 
U.S. and European issuers remained stable, a nd European financial institutions appeared 
                                                 
3 The Federal Reserve purchased $60 billion, and so ld $54 billion, of Treasury securities over the 
intermeeting period under the maturity extension program; there were minimal redemptions over the 
period.  The average maturity of SOMA Treasury holdings has lengthened by about four years since the 
beginning of the program last September.  
4 The Desk settled approximately $64 billion of MBS purchases in November, up from an average 
of roughly $25 billion prior to the announcement of additional purchases.  For most TBA contracts, dollar roll implied financing rates continue to moderate, and the Desk’s dollar roll activity is lower since September.  The Desk postponed Treasury and MBS operations on October 30, following the decision by 
the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association to close the fixed-income market; both 
operations were subsequently completed.

  to continue to be able to i ssue unsecured CP at maturities similar to those of such CP 
issued by their U.S. counterparts.   
 Money markets showed some modest si gns of year-end pressures arising from 
both typical factors and special factors, such as the end of the maturity extension program 
and the expiration of the FDIC’s unlimited insurance of noninterest- bearing tr ansaction 
deposits at year-end.5  (See the box “Expiration of Unlim ited FDIC Deposit Insurance.”)  
Yields on Treasury bills maturing immediatel y after year-end are noticeably lower than 
the yields on such bills maturing immediately before; the yield differentials are slightly 
higher than those in the past four years but  well below those in late 2007, when investor 
demands for high-quality, liquid asse ts were especially intense.  In the interbank market, 
the crossing of the one-month LIBOR contract  over December 31 implied a premium of 
about 5 basis points for funding over year-end, a modest value by histor ical standards.  
The implied premium from the foreign excha nge basis swap market showed a bit more 
anticipated year-end funding pressure, comparab le to what was seen last year.     
Conditions in secured funding markets were about unchanged over the 
intermeeting period, and market participants do not appear to anticipate significant  
year-end strains.  General co llateral finance (GCF) repo ra tes spiked in the immediate 
aftermath of Hurricane Sandy—as some smaller dealers reportedly experienced difficulty 
funding their positions—but those pressures were short lived.6  On average, rates in this 
market have remained elevated relative to la st year and well above the effective federal 
funds rate, but quotes on GCF repo futures cont racts indicate that market participants 
expect GCF repo rates to dec line some by early 2013.  In a sset-backed commercial paper 
(ABCP) markets, amounts outstanding have re mained stable for programs with sponsors 
domiciled in the United States  and Europe.  Overnight sp reads on ABCP were little 
changed, on net, and spreads on most European ABCP issues remain close to those on 
U.S. issues.   
                                                 
5 Many aspects of global and U.S. regulatory re form are anticipated to increase the demand for 
high-quality liquid assets, including, most notably, central clearing for standardized OTC derivatives 
transactions, margin requirements fo r non-centrally-cleared derivatives trades, and the Basel III liquidity 
rules.  In particular, the U.S. regulatory agencies are in the process of finalizing rules that will likely require 
clearing of certain interest rate and credit swaps beginning in March 2013. 
6 GCF repo is the trading of standardized gene ric CUSIP of U.S. govern ment securities between 
dealers on a blind basis using interd ealer brokers.  GCF repo transactio ns are netted by the Fixed Income 
Clearing Corporation as central counterparty and settled on a treaty basis via clearing banks (Bank of New York Mellon or JPMorgan Chase).

  Responses to the December 2012 Senior Cr edit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer 
Financing Terms (SCOOS) generally suggested little change in credit terms over the past 
three months for important classes of dealer counterparties (see appendix).  Continuing a 
recent trend, a large net fraction of responde nts indicated having increased the resources 
and attention devoted to management of e xposures to central c ounterparties and other 
financial market utilities.   While respondents noted th at the use of leverage by 
counterparties had remained basically unchange d, they reported an uptick in demand for 
funding of various types of securitization products.  
Indicators of the health of domestic financial institutions, such as firms’ stock 
prices and CDS spreads, mostly remained in their recent ranges.  E quity prices of large 
and regional domestic banks edged down ove r the intermeeting peri od.  Nonetheless, the 
CDS spreads of most large domestic bank hol ding companies (BHCs) ended the period 
modestly lower, reportedl y owing to reduced per ceptions of tail risk.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Foreign financial market conditions have improved, on balance, since the 
previous FOMC meeting.  In the first half of  the period, the prices of most risky assets 
declined and the dollar appreciated, as concerns over the fiscal cliff in the United States 
intensified, some foreign economic indicators fell short of investor expectations, and 
European and IMF officials struggled to reach agreement on arrangements to finance 
further aid to Greece.  However, market pri ces have more than retraced their earlier 
movements since mid-November on the appare nt easing of fiscal cliff concerns, the 
attainment of an agreement on Greek aid, a nd positive reaction to the terms announced by 
Greece for its debt buyback.   
Over the intermeeting period, the foreign ex change value of the dollar was little 
changed on average.  European currencies rose against the dollar, on net, as financial 
tensions in the euro area ended the period a bit lower.  By contrast, the Japanese yen 
depreciated sharply against the dollar and other curre ncies in reaction to statements from 
Shinzo Abe—who is likely to become Japan’ s next prime minister after elections in 
December—that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) s hould employ “unlimited easing” to achieve 
an inflation target of 2 to 3 percent, above the 1 percent goal the BO J currently pursues.  
In addition, the Brazilian real depreciated in reaction to weak economic data, leading the 
authorities to intervene to support the real.  On December 3, Credit Suisse announced

 Expiration  of Unlimited  FDIC Deposit Insurance  
The substantial  increase in  noninterest ‐bearing transaction  account balances  since the end  of 
2010 has been driven, in  part, by the provision  for unlimited  insurance  on these  accounts  under 
the Dodd–Frank  Wall Street  Reform and Consumer  Protection  Act (Dodd–Frank  Act) (see 
lower‐ left figure).  The stock  of these deposits  with balances  over $250,000  has increased  
roughly $700 billion  and currently  stands at around  $1.7 trillion.  The insured amount is set to 
revert to $250,000  per account  when this provision  expires on January 1, 2013.1  Estimates  by 
the Board’s staff suggest that a modest  portion of  the $700 billion  increase in noninterest ‐
bearing deposits,  perhaps along the lines of $100 billion  to $200 billion,  could flow out of the 
banking sector early next year in response.    
While unlimited  insurance  appeared  to spur some of the increase in  noninterest ‐bearing 
transaction  deposits,  several other  factors may have contributed  to this growth, importantly  
including  the change in the FDIC assessment base.  In  April 2011, the FDIC  changed  its base for 
deposit insurance assessments, with  the outcome  that offshore deposits  were no longer 
excluded  from the base.  As  a result, the incentive for  banks to book deposits  in foreign offices 
to avoid deposit insurance  assessments  was eliminated.   Indeed, one  large bank holding 
company  reported  that it shifted just over $100 billion  of intracompany  deposits  from one of its 
foreign offices to its domestically  charted commercial  bank as a direct result of this change.   
The marked decline in  domestic banks’ “net due  to” related foreign offices directly following  
the change suggests  that such activity  may have accounted  for about  a $300 billion  shift in 
deposits to domestic commercial  banks in aggregate,  with much of  that shift likely  resulting  in 
an increase  in noninterest ‐bearing transactions  deposits  (see lower‐ right figure).2  Because  the 
change in the assessment  base is permanent,  it seems likely that any associated  increase in  
noninterest ‐bearing deposits  will not be reversed  once the unlimited  deposit insurance  
program expires.   
  
                                                 
1 Recently,  Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid proposed  legislation  that would provide for a two‐year 
extension  of the unlimited  insurance;  however,  expiration  at year‐end still appears to be the most likely 
scenario.  
2 A deposit  with a foreign‐related office of a domestic  bank results initially in a deposit in the domestic  
bank’s Federal  Reserve account and an associated  liability of the domestic  bank  due to its foreign‐related 
office.  When such a deposit is rebooked  from a domestic  bank’s foreign‐related office to the domestic  bank 
itself,  the domestic  bank’s liability to its foreign‐related office declines  commensurately.   “Net due to” 
measures  the net liabilities of a domestic  commercial  bank due to its foreign‐related offices.

 Discussions  with a small number  of banks that experienced  substantial  increases  in 
noninterest ‐bearing transaction  accounts suggested  that the large increases  over recent  years 
were the result not only of the change in insurance  coverage, but also  of investor preference  
for liquidity  and safety in an environment  of low yields on  alternative  assets amid significant  
uncertainty  about the economic  outlook.3  The outcome  of these discussions  suggests  that it is 
unlikely the full $700 billion  run‐up in noninterest ‐bearing deposits  following  the inception  of 
unlimited  insurance  under the Dodd –Frank Act will fully  unwind upon its expiration.  
From late 2008  through the end of 2010, the  FDIC provided  unlimited  insurance  for noninterest ‐
bearing deposits  under the Transaction  Account Guarantee  (TAG) Program.  However,  for a 
period in 2010 (highlighted  in yellow in  the figure below), participants  in the TAG Program  
became subject to additional  fees.  As a result, many  institutions  chose to opt out  of the 
insurance  scheme, and  the proportion  of insured deposits  in the banking system accordingly  
declined.   However,  the overall quantity of noninterest ‐bearing deposits  remained  relatively  
steady, suggesting  that the aggregate response  to the upcoming  insurance  expiration  is likely 
to be fairly limited.4   
Indeed, market commentary  and surveys indicate that only a modest  portion of  noninterest ‐
bearing transaction  account balances  are likely to be reallocated  to money market products  
when the  unlimited  insurance  expires.  For example,  the December  SCOOS included  special 
questions  about dealers’ expectations  regarding  changes in cash management  practices  
because of  the expiration  of the unlimited  deposit insurance.5  Responses  generally  pointed to 
expectations  for moderate or  limited reductions  in deposit holdings  by both levered and 
unlevered  clients, with the  funds flowing to repurchase  agreements,  money market funds, and  
Treasury securities.   Anecdotal  reports have suggested  that some depositors  could shift 
balances held at smaller banking  institutions  toward larger banking institutions,  which may be 
perceived  as safer.

4 The TAG Program  was replaced at the end of 2010  by unlimited  insurance  provided  under  the Dodd–
Frank Act.  Insured  depository  institutions  could not opt out of the Dodd–Frank  insurance;  as a result, the level 
of insured deposits increased  dramatically  at the end of 2010.

  that it would start applying ne gative interest rates on some  Swiss franc deposit accounts, 
prompting a notable depreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro.   
Yields on foreign benchmark sovereign bonds  declined over the period.  The BOJ 
expanded its asset purchase program by ¥11 trillion (about $140 b illion), and, although 
the ECB did not take any new policy actions, expected overnight rates in the euro area 
fell a bit.  While the Bank of England did not increase the size of its asset purchase 
program, it announced that going forward it will  transfer all net cash earnings from the 
program, including cumulative earnings to date, to the U.K. Treasury.  Cumulative 
earnings through March 2013 are projected to be  £35 billion (2¼ per cent of U.K. GDP), 
and the transfer of these earnings should reduce future gilt issuance, thereby exerting 
some downward pressure on yields.  Elsewhere, the Re serve Bank of Australia and 
several emerging market central banks also eased policy.    
 Italian and Spanish sovereign bond spreads narrowed modestly over the period, in 
part after European auth orities acted to diminish the risk  of a disorderly exit of Greece 
from the euro area by agreeing to disburse mo re than €40 billion to Greece, to reduce its 
debt service burden, and to provide the c ountry with financing to purchase up to 
€10 billion worth of debt at a substantial discount.  Posi tive euro-area developments 
boosted stock prices in Europe, and prospects for more-stimulative monetary policy in 
Japan lifted Japanese  stock prices.   
Foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities,  both official and private, eased in 
September and October, according to the latest  TIC data.  Foreign private investors also 
showed limited demand for U.S. corporate secu rities, on net, over the two months.  U.S. 
private investors stepped up their net purch ases of foreign bonds.  FRBNY custody data 
for November indicate that official purcha ses of U.S. Treasury securities remained 
subdued.

  for returns on the S&P 500 index over the next month, rose 1½ per centage points in the 
immediate aftermath of the U.S. election but declined moderately, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  Although the VIX is at a relatively low level, equity market 
volatility measures for longer maturities are hi gher than historical averages that exclude 
the financial crisis period.  
The reporting season for third-quarter earnings drew to a close over the 
intermeeting period, and the last wave of reports did not leave a visible imprint on 
aggregate stock market prices.  Although the majority of firms in the S&P 500 index 
reported earnings that were higher than priv ate-sector forecasts, many reported revenues 
that failed to meet expecta tions.  And, while the overall level of earnings for S&P 500 
firms increased a bit on a quarterly basis, it was little changed from  its year-ago level.  
An index of revisions to analysts’ forecas ts of year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms 
declined a bit through mid-November, prim arily reflecting downward revisions for 
nonfinancial firms. 
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds were 
little changed, and spreads of yields on su ch bonds to those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities widened moderately; fo r speculative-grade bonds, yields fell to 
historical lows and spreads were about unc hanged.  The spreads of yields on A2/P2 
unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms to those on AA-rated nonfinancial issues were 
little changed.  
The HFR Global Hedge Fund Index moved in line with the S&P 500 index on a 
total return basis ove r the intermeeting period, and hedge  fund assets increased in the 
third quarter.  In the SCOOS, a few dealers not ed an increase in the intensity of efforts by 
hedge funds to negotiate more favorable price and nonprice terms.   Respondents also 
indicated that the cu rrent use of leverage by hedge funds had remained basically 
unchanged, on net, over the past three months. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Available indicators suggest that the credit quality of  nonfinancial corporations

  Service was roughly equal to the volume of  downgrades.  The six-month trailing bond 
default rate for nonfinancial firms stayed lo w in October, and the C&I loan delinquency 
rate continued to trend down in the third qua rter.  The KMV expected year-ahead default 
rate for nonfinancial firms was little change d in November, remaining low by historical 
standards. 
Net debt issuance by nonfinancial firms continued to be very strong over the 
intermeeting period, supported by low interest  rates.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial 
firms increased from the already robust pace seen in the third quarter, as some firms 
reportedly sought to issue new debt before th e end of the year.  While high-yield bond 
issuance slowed some in November from its rapid pace in October, this reduction was 
more than offset by a pickup in investment -grade issuance.  Ma ny high-yield bond issuers 
reportedly plan to use the proceeds to retire existing debt.  The volume of C&I loans 
outstanding expanded notabl y in both October and November.  The volume of 
nonfinancial CP outstanding increased some in  November following a small decline in 
October. 
In the syndicated leveraged loan market, institutional issuance surged in October 
before subsiding somewhat in November, al beit to a still-robust level, supported by 
continued strong demand on the part of in stitutional investors such as insurance 
companies, pension funds, and CLOs.  Indeed, CLO issuance has totaled nearly $50 billion so far this year, surpassing issuan ce for the previous four years combined, but 
still remains at about half of its pre-cris is peak.  While some signs of erosion of 
underwriting standards and pressu res on credit terms and deal structures continue to be 
evident, there are indications that recently i nvestors have pushed back against some of the 
more aggressive deals.   
Gross public issuance of equity by nonfinan cial firms maintained its solid pace in 
October and November.  While IPO activity surg ed in October, it slowed in November to 
the more subdued levels seen in the third quart er.  In contrast, seasoned equity offerings 
picked up in November.  Retirements of equ ity were strong in the third quarter due to 
robust share repurchases and cash-financed me rgers, resulting in deeply negative net 
equity issuance.  In the fourth quarter, completions and announcements of cash-financed mergers have continued apace, and, although announcements of new repurchase 
programs have slowed a bit, the pace of equity retirements likely has remained rapid.

  component of net equity issuance—may acceler ate in the fourth quarter as some firms 
decide to issue special dividends or m ove dividend payments from January 2013 to 
December 2012 in anticipation of possibly higher tax rates on dividend income next year.   
Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector remained strained 
amid elevated vacancy and delinquency rates.  However, some indicators have pointed to 
modest improvement in the sector.  Prices for CRE properties continued to increase in the 
third quarter and now stand 10 percent above their low from early last year.  CMBS 
issuance remained on pace for another solid quar ter, reportedly driven by strong investor 
demand for this class of securities, which has narrowed their spreads and made CMBS 
more competitive with portfolio lenders. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates fluctuated  around historical lows dur ing the intermeeting period, 
with the interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages near 3¼ percent, about 
10 basis points below its level as of the Oc tober FOMC meeting.  Agency MBS yields 
declined in line with comparable-maturity Treasury securities.  The spread between primary and secondary rates remained wide over the intermeeting period, due in part to 
continued capacity constraints at mortgage originators.  Refinance originations increased 
a bit further in October and November.  Howe ver, originations remained subdued relative 
to the predictions of staff models base d on past behavior, as tight underwriting 
conditions, consolidation in the mortgage or igination sector, and low levels of home 
equity continued to limit access to credit fo r households without stellar credit records. 
Aggregate indexes of house prices continued to increase in September and 
October, even as the share of properties sold  through foreclosures or short sales moved 
up.  The CoreLogic house price index is now 7¼ percent higher than the low reached 
near the end of last year.  The fraction of existing mortgages that are seriously delinquent 
fell in the third quarter but remained elev ated by historical standards.  During the 
intermeeting period, the FHA announced in its a nnual report to the C ongress that elevated 
delinquency rates—primarily on loans in th e 2006–08 vintages—have contributed to a 
decrease in its cash reserves and that it will address this shortfall by increasing insurance 
premiums, among other changes.  Recent indust ry reports suggest th at about one-fourth 
of home sales have been fina nced by FHA-insured mortgages.

  Consumer credit expanded briskly again in  September as sizable increases in auto 
loans and student loans pushed up nonrevolving balances.  Revolving credit decreased in 
September, although it has been about unchange d, on net, over the past few months.  
Consumer ABS issuance continued on pace for another strong quarter, supported by low 
interest rates.  Auto ABS issuance has been strong in recent mont hs, particularly in 
October, as low default rates a nd high recovery rates have attracted investors.  Consumer 
credit delinquency rates, with the notable exce ption of student loans, remained low.  The 
particularly low delinquency rate for cr edit card loans appears to reflect the 
compositional shift toward higher-quality borro wers due to still-tight credit conditions. 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the October FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned 
$200 billion in nominal securities and $13 billion in 10-year TIPS.  The auctions were generally well received, with bid-to-cover ratio s and indirect bidding ratios mostly close 
to their recent averages.
7 
Despite continued fiscal pressures f acing state and local governments, gross 
issuance of long-term municipa l bonds was robust in October and November.  Moreover, 
net issuance of long-term bonds turned positive in October and November following a 
negative third quarter.  Industr y reports suggest that, reflecting the uncertainty about the 
fiscal cliff negotiations, some  municipalities are pulling bond  issuance forward to avoid 
the possibility that funding conditions will become more difficult past year-end.  
The credit quality of municipal bond s deteriorated somewhat over the 
intermeeting period.  Ratings downgrades continued outpacing upgrades in the third 
quarter of 2012, and incoming data suggest that downgrades will likely continue 
outpacing upgrades through the re st of the year.  CDS spre ads for states were roughly 
unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period, staying around their av erage levels over 
                                                 
7 Investors do not appear to be anticipating si gnificant strains in the Treasury market around  
year-end, when the federal debt limit is expected to  be reached.  In extraordinary circumstances, the 
Treasury can declare a “debt issuance suspension period .”  During this period, the Treasury can suspend 
daily reinvestment of the Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund, redeem 
existing and suspend new investments in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, suspend the daily reinvestment of Treasury s ecurities held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and replace a small 
amount of Treasury securities subject to the debt lim it with debt issued by the Federal Financing Bank.  
Based on current projections, these actions would allow the Treasury to continue operating without an 
increase in the debt limit through early March 2013.

  the past four years.  Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds moved down 
markedly over the period and reached new record lows.  Some of this decline might be 
due to a greater perceived likelihood that th e federal deduction for state and local taxes 
would be trimmed back as part of the fiscal  cliff negotiations, but  with existing bonds 
grandfathered.  The ratio of yields on l ong-term general obligation municipal bonds to 
yields on comparable-maturity Treasury  securities decreased some on net. 
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit was about flat, on balance, over October and November.  Growth of 
C&I loans remained robust over the period despite a decline in C&I loans held by branches and agencies of foreign banks, partic ularly those with European parents.  Over 
the past three months, CRE loans have pos ted small monthly gains—the first since 
February 2009—as originations at small do mestic banks have reportedly picked up.  
Sales of closed-end mortgages to the GS Es reportedly outpaced brisk origination 
volumes, and on-balance-sheet holdings of such loans decreased.  The ongoing declines in home equity loans accelerated, reportedly  in part because banks charged off some 
loans in response to the implementation of recent regulatory guidance and because a few 
large banks reduced principal as part of a national mortgage settlement reached in 
February 2012.  Consumer loans grew modestly over October and November because of increases in nonrevolving loans th at were partially offset by dec lines in credit card loans.  
Growth in total securities slowed, on net, as rapid incr eases in holdings of Treasury 
securities at large domestic ba nks were partially offset by si zable sales of agency MBS at 
all bank groups.  
The Survey of Terms of Business Le nding that was conducted in November 
suggested some easing in loan pricing and terms.  Spreads on C&I loans were little 
changed overall but narrowed for larger loans,  matching reports in re cent results of the 
Senior Loan Officer Opini on Survey on Bank Lending Practices that competition among 
banks for large business credits has been incr easing.  Moreover, the average maturity of 
C&I loans originated during the survey week le ngthened to a level that is considerably 
higher than its pre-recession peak. 
On a seasonally adjusted basis, standard measures of profitability for BHCs were 
little changed in the third quarter of 2012.  Those measures remained well below  
pre-crisis levels even though pr ovisioning for loan losses has st abilized in recent quarters 
at only slightly elevated levels.  BHCs’ ne t interest margins are depressed, reportedly

  pressured by the low-interest-rate environm ent, a flattening of the yield curve, and 
competition.  Delinquency and charge-off rates generally continued to improve for most 
types of loans in the third quarter but rose  significantly for ju nior-lien residential 
mortgages and home equity lines of cred it, reflecting the regu latory guidance and 
mortgage settlement noted earlie r.  Growth in core lending—the sum of C&I loans, 
consumer loans, and loans secured by real estate—at commercial banks continued to be 
well below the predictions generated by historic al statistical relationships between loan 
growth and various macroeconomic and financ ial market indicators.  Regulatory capital 
ratios based on current definitions remained very high in the third quarter, and a measure 
of banks’ reliance on short-term money as  a source of funding decreased further. 
M2 grew at an annual rate of about 8½ percent, on average, over October and 
November.  Liquid deposits, the largest com ponent of M2, continued to expand briskly, 
likely reflecting low yields on alternative i nvestments.  Both foreign and domestic 
demand for U.S. bank notes supported robust cu rrency growth over the period.  Reserves 
increased, in part because of the settleme nt of the ongoing MBS purchases announced at 
the September FOMC meeting.  The monetary base expanded in line with the gains in 
currency and reserves.

Appendix 
Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms 
Responses to the December 2012 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer 
Financing Terms generally suggested little change  in the credit terms applicable to important 
classes of counterparties covered by the survey over the past three months.1  However, continuing 
a trend observed in previous surveys, a large ne t fraction of respondents reported an increase in 
the amount of resources and attention devoted to the management of concentrated exposures to 
central counterparties and other financial market utilities; a smaller net share reported an increase 
in the amount of resources and attention devoted to the management of exposures to dealers and 
other financial intermediaries.  Overall, respondents noted that the use of financial leverage by 
important classes of counterparties had remained b asically unchanged over the past three months. 
As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in 
new or renegotiated over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives master agreements were broadly unchanged, on balance, during the past three months.  Dealers also reported that initial margin requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were  generally little changed 
over the same period.   
While the terms applicable to the funding of the various types of securities covered in the 
survey were reported to have generally change d little over the past three months, an uptick in 
demand for financing was evident.  Almost one-t hird of dealers reported increased demand for 
funding of agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).  Modest net fractions of respondents indicated increased demand for term funding (that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or more) of agency and non-agency  RMBS, commercial mortgage-backed securities 
(CMBS), and consumer asset-backed securities (ABS).  Nearly one-third of respondents noted that the liquidity and functioning of the underlying markets for non-agency RMBS and CMBS 
had improved somewhat during the previous three months. 
In response to a set of special questions on collateral transformation trades, small to 
moderate fractions of dealers reported some current activity with most of the client types covered 
                                                 
1 The December survey collected  qualitative information on changes over the previous three 
months in credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives 
markets.  In addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about 
transaction volumes and interest in collateral transforma tion trades, and a second set of special questions on 
prospects for changes in cash management strategies upon the expiration of the provision in the  
Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that extended unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at the end of this year.  The 22 institutions participating in the 
survey account for almost all of the dealer financin g of dollar-denominated secu rities to nondealers and are 
the most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives mark ets.  The survey was conducted during the period 
from November 13, 2012, to November 26, 2012.  The core questions ask about changes between September 2012 and November 2012.

  in the survey.2  However, for all client types, a greater  share of dealers indicated having frequent 
or at least some discussion with clients on prospective transactions  regarding collateral 
transformation trades.  Respondents reported that  the volume of collateral transformation trades 
had remained basically unchanged since the start of the year.    
A second set of special questions asked a bout likely changes in cash management 
strategies upon expiration at year-end of the Fe deral Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) 
unlimited guarantee of noninterest-bearing transac tion accounts.  Four-fifths of respondents 
indicated that their own institutions are unlik ely to reduce the volume of deposits held at 
commercial banks.  However, dealers expected their clients to be more responsive to the 
expiration of the unlimited guarantee.  Large fractions of dealers noted that they expected 
moderate or limited reduction in their clients’ holdings of comme rcial bank deposits, while a few 
dealers expected a reallocation of balances across banking institutions.  The clients who 
respondents anticipated would reduce deposits he ld at commercial banks were expected to 
increase their use of repurchase agreements, mone y market funds, and Treasury bills and other 
government securities. 
COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries 
 In the December survey, about one-fourth of respondents indicated that they had 
increased the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermed iaries over the past three months.  (See the 
exhibit “Management of Concentrated Credit Expos ures and Indicators of Supply of Credit.”)  
This share was similar for the nine “broad-scope” dealers, defined as those firms which have a significant presence in essentially all of the busin ess areas covered in the survey.  The fraction of 
dealers reporting an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financ ial intermediaries has declined gradually since 
the June survey.   
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities 
About two-thirds of dealers indicated that they had increased the amount of resources and 
attention devoted to management of concentrat ed credit exposure to central counterparties and 
other financial utilities over the past three months, roughly the same share as in previous surveys.  
All but one of the broad-scope dealers reporte d an increase.  In light of the approaching 
implementation of new regulatory requirements mandating increased central clearing of many OTC contracts, continued focus on this issue is  unsurprising.  Of note, all but one of the 
broad-scope dealers reported an increase.  About one-fourth of all of the respondents indicated 
                                                 
2 Collateral transformation entails the lending of securities collateralized with other securities.  
Such transactions may be used by certain market  participants to obtain higher-quality collateral—for 
example, to post pursuant to OTC derivatives transactions.  In turn, lenders of the high-quality collateral 
can boost the effective return on owning such assets by temporarily exchanging such instruments for 
higher-yielding securities.

  that changes in the practices of central counterpa rties, including changes in margin requirements 
and haircuts, had influenced to some extent th e credit terms the dealer applied to clients on 
bilateral transactions that are not cleared. 
Hedge Funds 
As in September, respondents to the December survey indicated that both price terms 
(such as financing rates) and nonprice terms (inc luding haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, 
cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation features) offered to hedge funds for 
securities financing and OTC derivatives transacti ons had remained basically unchanged over the 
past three months.  Almost one-fifth of dealers noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms over the same period, a decline in the trend observed in pr evious surveys.  Respondents indicated that the 
current use of leverage had cha nged little, on net, over the past three months.  (See the exhibit 
“Use of Financial Leverage.”)  However, among th e broad-scope dealers, one-third reported an 
increase in the use of leverage.  Respondents also  indicated that the availability of additional 
leverage under agreements currently in place ha d remained basically unchanged, although a few 
dealers pointed to an increase. 
Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts 
Most respondents to the December survey re ported that price and nonprice terms offered 
to trading real estate investment trusts (REITs ) had remained broadly unchanged over the past 
three months.3  A few dealers indicated that price terms had tightened somewhat, for which 
diminished availability of dealer balance sheet  or capital was the most cited reason.  Over 
four-fifths of respondents reported that the use of financial leverage by trading REITS had remained broadly unchanged, while the remainde r (none of which were broad-scope dealers) 
reported that the use of leverage had increased somewhat.  Respondents indicated that both the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotia te more-favorable price and nonprice terms and the 
provision of differential terms to most-f avored clients were  broadly unchanged. 
Mutual Funds, Exchange-Traded Funds, Pension Plans, and Endowments 
Respondents to the December survey indicated  that both price and nonprice terms offered 
to mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs),  pension plans, and endowments had remained 
essentially unchanged over the past three months.  Provision of differential terms to most-favored 
clients and the intensity of effort by clients to  negotiate more-favorable terms were also reported 
to be little changed, as was the use of financial leverage.  
Insurance Companies 
As in the previous survey, respondents to th e December survey indicated that both price 
and nonprice terms offered to insurance companies had changed little over the past three months, as had the provision of differential terms to most-favored clients.  The use of financial leverage

  by insurance companies also remained unchanged.  A few respondents reported an increase in the 
intensity of efforts by insurance companies to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms.   
Separately Managed Accounts Estab lished with Investment Advisers 
As in the previous survey, nearly all of the dealers reported in the December survey that 
price and nonprice terms negotiated by investme nt advisers on behalf of separately managed 
accounts were basically unchanged over the past th ree months.  Provision of differential terms to 
most-favored clients and the intensity of effort by  clients to negotiate more-favorable terms were 
also reported to be little changed.  Finally, the use of financial leverage by investment advisers 
remained basically unchanged. 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Respondents to the December survey indicated  that both price and nonprice terms offered 
to nonfinancial corporations had remained essentially unchanged over the past three months.  A 
few respondents reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to 
negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms. 
Mark and Collateral Disputes 
As in previous surveys, a large majority of  respondents in December indicated that the 
volume, persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type 
included in the survey were little changed ove r the past three months.  A few respondents 
reported that the volume of disputes with dealers and other financial interm ediaries had decreased 
somewhat over the same period. 
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in previous surveys, nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC 
derivatives master agreements were reported to be  broadly unchanged, on net, over the past three 
months.4  A few dealers indicated that requirements, timelines, and thresholds for posting 
additional margin had tightened somewhat.  For a ll of the contract types included in the survey, 
nearly all of the dealers indicated that initial margins (which fall outside the scope of master 
agreements) were little changed over the past thr ee months.  Posting of nonstandard collateral 
(that is, collateral other than cash and U.S. Treasury securities) also remained basically 
unchanged on balance.  For most contract types incl uded in the survey, nearly all of the dealers 
indicated that the volume, duration, and persis tence of mark and collateral disputes remained 
basically unchanged over the past three months.  However, one-fifth of respondents reported that 
the volume of mark and collateral disputes had decrea sed for contracts referencing interest rates.   
                                                 
 
4 The survey asks specifically  about requirements for postin g additional margin, acceptable 
collateral, recognition of portfolio or diversifica tion benefits, triggers and covenants, and other 
documentation features, including cure periods and cross-default provisions.

  SECURITIES FINANCING  
As in previous surveys, dealers reported that the credit terms under which most types of 
securities included in the survey are financed were  little changed, on balance, over the past three 
months.  The only exception was equities, for whic h a few survey respondents indicated that they 
had increased the maximum amount of funding for their clients.   
For all securities types, the large majority of dealers reported that demand for funding 
was broadly unchanged over the past three months.  (See the exhibit “Measures of Demand for 
Funding and Market Functioning.”)  However, m oderate net fractions of respondents noted an 
increase in demand for funding of securitized products.  In particular, almost one-third of dealers reported increased demand for funding of agency RMBS.  In addition, fractions of respondents ranging between one-fifth and one-fourth pointed to increased demand for term funding (not shown separately)—that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or more—for agency RMBS, 
non-agency RMBS, CMBS, and consumer ABS.   
Nearly one-third of respondents indicated that the liquidity and functioning of the 
underlying markets for non-agency RMBS a nd CMBS had improved somewhat during the 
previous three months.
5  For other collateral types covered in  the survey, liquidity and functioning 
of the underlying markets were generally characterized as little changed on net.  These results are similar to those in the September survey.  
Finally, as in previous surveys, all of the respondents indicated that the volume, duration, 
and persistence of market and co llateral disputes were basically un changed for all of the collateral 
types.   
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON COLLATERAL TRANSFORMATION TRADES  
Market commentary suggests that investors are increasingly interested in collateral 
transformation trades—that is, the lending of hi gh-quality securities collateralized with other 
securities.  Frequently cited motivations for such transactions include the need for some 
institutions to obtain pristine co llateral, including for purposes of posting collateral pursuant to 
their OTC trades with dealers and central counterparties, and the desires of other institutions for 
the returns associated with effectively providing financing for higher-risk securities.  A set of special questions queried dealers about the change  in the volume of such transactions relative to 
the beginning of 2012 as well as the current level of interest in collateral transformation across various client types. 
                                                 
5 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market  itself.  This question is not asked with respect to 
equity markets in the core questions.

  Relative to the beginning of 2012, dealers indicated that the volume of collateral 
transformation transactions through which clie nts source and provide pristine collateral had 
remained basically unchanged on net. 
With regard to the level of inter est in trades that allow clients to source pristine collateral, 
roughly one-fourth of survey respondents reported so me current activity on the part of dealers and 
other financial intermediaries, mutual funds  and ETFs, pension plan s and endowments, and 
insurance companies.  (See the exhibit “Colla teral Transformation Transactions.”)  Despite the 
lack of significant current activity, between about one-third and two-thirds of respondents 
reported frequent or at least some discussion of prospective transactions with all client types 
covered in the survey. 
With regard to the level of interest in collateral transformation transactions that allow 
clients to provide  pristine collateral, roughly one-fifth of survey respondents reported some 
current activity on the part of dealers and othe r financial intermediaries, pension plans and 
endowments, and insurance companies.  Betwee n about one-fourth and one-half of respondents 
pointed to frequent or at least some discussion of  prospective transactions with all client types 
covered in the survey.  
Overall, the clients reported to be most likel y to be either currently active in collateral 
transformation transactions or engaged in discussi ons on prospective transactions are dealers and 
other financial intermediaries, hedge funds, insurance companies, and pension funds and 
endowments.  Of note, hedge funds and insuran ce companies are more likely to be engaged in 
discussions about sourcing pristine collateral.  For other client types, reported levels of interest 
appear more balanced between sourci ng and providing pristine collateral.   
SPECIAL QUESTION ON EXPIRATION OF THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE 
CORPORATION UNLIMITED GUARANTEE ON TRANSACTION ACCOUNTS  
The FDIC’s unlimited guarantee on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts is scheduled 
to expire at the end of 2012.6  Its expiration raises the prospect that some market participants will 
adjust their cash management strategies.  A second set of special questions asked about the likely 
changes in strategies by the respondent’s in stitution as well as the likely response of the 
respondent’s clients.  In particular, respondents we re queried about the likelihood of reductions in 
the amount of deposits held at commercial ba nking institutions on credit risk management 
grounds because of the expiration of the unlim ited FDIC guarantee and, conditional on such 
reductions, about the likelihood of increased use of alternative cash management strategies.  
                                                 
6 On January 1, 2013, the insurance limit on noni nterest-bearing transaction accounts is scheduled 
to revert to $250,000.  In market commentary, th e unlimited guarantee is often referred to as the 
Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) Program, and the wording of the special questions in this survey 
followed that convention.  However, the TAG Program properly refers to an earlier FDIC program that 
expired at the end of 2010.

  Four-fifths of respondents indicated that their own institutions are unlikely to reduce the 
amount of deposits held at commercial banks.  The remainder reported that only moderate or 
limited reductions, or targeted reductions at  specific institutions, are likely.  Among the 
institutions foreseeing reductions, the alternative cash management strategies cited the most were reallocation of deposits to different co mmercial banks and repurchase agreements. 
By contrast, dealers expected many of their clients to respond at least somewhat to the 
expiration of the unlimited guarantee.  About thr ee-fourths of dealers anticipated reductions in 
deposits held at commercial banks by traditiona lly unlevered investor s, such as insurance 
companies; mutual funds, ETFs, pension pl ans and endowments; and asset managers.  The 
remainder of respondents anticipated no reductions  or targeted reductions at some specific 
institutions.  Nearly two-thirds  of respondents anticipated re ductions of deposits held at 
commercial banks by nonfinancial corporations, with a couple of dealers suggesting significant reductions were likely.  With regard to levered inv estors, nearly one-half of dealers indicated that 
they anticipated moderate or limited reductions of deposits held at commercial banks on the part 
of hedge funds, and over two-thirds of respondents expected similar reductions by trading REITs.  For every client type, the fraction reporting that reductions are likely was higher for the 
subsample of broad-scope dealers than for the full sample.  With regard to the alternative cash management strategies listed in the survey, the clients who respondents expected would reduce 
deposits held at commercial banks were seen as responding by reallocating deposits to other commercial banks or by increasing their use of  repurchase agreements, money market funds, 
Treasury bills and longer-dated Treasury securiti es or agency securities.  Among the alternatives 
listed in the survey question, only direct investme nt in commercial paper was expected to garner 
little interest.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projection for economic activity 
as elevated, although only somewhat more so  than the average high-volatility experience 
of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC).1  In part, this assessment 
reflects the persistent aftere ffects of the recent financial crisis and recession, which still 
have uncertain implications fo r the pace at which the recove ry is likely to proceed, the 
magnitude of slack in labor and product markets, and the resilience of the financial 
system.  It also derives from the uncertainty  associated with the current federal budget 
situation, which poses a significant downside ri sk as fiscal policymakers, by choice or by 
gridlock, could impose far more restraint on aggregate demand next year than we have 
assumed.  We also continue to see appreciable risks related to the fiscal and financial 
situation in Europe.  Although recent policy deve lopments in the euro area appear to have 
reduced some of those risks, we still see a significant possibility that the European 
situation could deteriorate more than we have assumed, with substantial spillover effects on the U.S. economy.  In addition, U.S. monetary policy has limited capacity to counteract the effects of either a severe economic downturn in Europe or a substantial tightening of U.S. fiscal policy.  We continue to assess the risks to domestic economic activity as skewed to the downside.   
With regard to inflation, we see signifi cant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view these risks as unusually high.  L ong-run inflation expectations and the trend 
in actual inflation have remained stable in recent years despite large fluctuations in the 
prices of crude oil and other commodities and persistently wide margins of slack in labor 
and product markets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as 
balanced.  On the upside, an increase in in flation expectations, potentially related to 
concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’ s balance sheet and the ability to execute a 
timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a 
stronger-than-expected recovery or a larger amount of damage  to the supply side of the 
                                                 
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past 
several years.  In particular, as the fixed 20-year win dow used to assess the size of typical forecast errors 
has moved forward to include the pronounced volatility during the financial crisis and its aftermath, the size 
of the estimated standard errors for out-year projections of the unemployment rate has almost doubled.  In 
contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about in flation are essentially unchanged relative to earlier 
sample periods.

economy than assumed in the baseline.  On th e downside, there is the possibility that 
weaker-than-anticipated economic conditions , further subdued increases in unit labor 
costs, and low levels of resource utilization could cause actual and expected inflation to 
decrease over time.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of th e staff’s models.  The first 
scenario examines the consequences of shar per fiscal contraction next year than is 
assumed in the baseline.  The next two scenar ios consider some upside risks to aggregate 
demand.  In the first, recent positive devel opments in the housing market are assumed to 
lead to a faster recovery in  residential construction and house prices, but the spillover 
effects to the broader economy are limited.  The next scenario builds on the previous one 
by assuming that the stronger housing recove ry also contributes to improvements in 
consumer and business confidence, employment, credit availability, and aggregate 
spending that lead to a more robust expansion in the overall economy.  In contrast, the fourth scenario explores the downside risk th at we have underestimated the persistence of 
the headwinds restraining the recovery.  The fifth scenario focuses on the risk that a 
near-term increase in actual inflation coul d feed into higher inflation expectations, 
resulting in inflation persis tently above the FOMC’s longe r-run objective through the rest 
of the decade.  The last two scenarios consider risks to the domestic economy from foreign economic developments—first, that th e European crisis could intensify with 
severe spillovers to the U. S. economy and, second, that the pace of economic growth in 
emerging market economies (EME s) could slow markedly.   
We generate the first five scenarios us ing the FRB/US model and the last two 
scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA mode l.  For the FRB/US simulations, we use 
the estimated outcome-based rule—adjusted to take into account the Committee’s forward guidance—to govern deviations of the federal funds rate from its baseline path; 
for the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadl y similar policy rule that employs an 
alternative concept of resource utilization.
2  In these scenarios, we have assumed that the 
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow th eir baseline paths.   
                                                 
2 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack  equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

Fiscal Cliff 
Our baseline projection assumes that th e Congress and the Administration will 
avert the fiscal cliff in its most severe fo rm by extending most of the tax cuts initially 
enacted in 2001 and 2003, continuing to shie ld the majority of taxpayers from the 
alternative minimum tax, and extending a num ber of other non-stimulus-related tax 
reductions.  In contrast, this  scenario assumes that none of these actions are taken, 
thereby increasing total tax payments by hous eholds and businesses next year about 
2½ percent of GDP relative to  the baseline.  In addition, the automatic spending cuts 
required by the Budget Control Act’s sequestra tion provisions are assumed to take full 
effect in 2013, further reducing federal purchas es by about ¼ percent of GDP relative to 
the baseline.3  Moreover, these fiscal policy de velopments are assumed to weigh on 
consumer and business confidence more than in the baseline.4  As a result, real GDP 
expands only about 1 percent in 2013 and 2¼ percent in 2014, on av erage 1¼ percentage 
points per year less th an in the baseline.5  The unemployment rate rises to around  
8½ percent in 2013 and 2014.  With a wider marg in of resource slack, inflation declines 
to 1 percent in 2015, and the federal funds ra te does not begin to increase from its 
effective lower bound until late 2016.   
Robust Housing Recovery 
The recent increases in house prices, housing starts, and home sales may be 
pointing to a more robust housing-market recovery than is assumed in the baseline.  In 
this scenario, residential c onstruction is assumed to increase 25 percent in both 2013 and 
2014, about 10 percentage point s above baseline on averag e, bringing the share of 
residential construction spending in aggreg ate output more rapidly to its long-run 
average.  Moreover, house prices recove r more quickly, reaching 10 percent above 
baseline by late 2014.  As a result, real GDP acce lerates to an average annual growth rate 
                                                 
3 After 2014, both tax revenues and government spending are assumed to gradually return to their 
baseline trajectories, leading eventually to budget deficits that are about the same as in the baseline.  
However, because those deficits follow a period of greater fiscal restraint, the ratio of government debt to GDP is lower over the longer term in the alternative scenario. 
4 This scenario assumes that the federal debt ceiling is raised, thereby avoiding a default on 
Treasury debt and delays in payments on other federal obligations, but it is possible to envision an even worse outcome that could reduce consumer and bu siness confidence substantially further and cause 
considerable financial market disruptions. 
5 Although taxes increase by more than 2 percen t of GDP in 2013 in this scenario, the negative 
effect on real GDP next year is smaller because households in the FRB/US model adjust their spending 
gradually in response to the declin e in their disposable in come; accordingly, real GDP growth in 2014 is 
also restrained.

of 3¼ percent in 2013 and 2014, and the unempl oyment rate falls to 6 percent by late 
2015.  Liftoff of the federal funds  rate occurs in early 2015.   
Housing Reverberations 
The stronger housing market in the previ ous scenario could lead to a more 
vigorous recovery if it reve rberates more broadly thr oughout the economy.  In this 
scenario, the stronger housing recovery sparks a cycle of increased consumer and 
business confidence, faster hiring, improved financial conditions that  lead to greater 
credit availability, and more rapid spending by households and firms.  As a result, real 
GDP rises at an average annual rate  of 4¼ percent in 2013 and 2014, and the 
unemployment rate falls to below 5½ percent by late 2015.  Upward pressure on inflation 
is initially tempered by the effects of incr eased capital investment on labor productivity 
and unit labor costs.  But, with less resource slack, unit labor costs eventually rise more 
rapidly than in the baseline, and inflation increases to 2¼ percent late r in the decade.  In 
response to higher inflation and the stronger pace of real ac tivity, the federal funds rate 
lifts off earlier and stays hi gher than in the baseline. 
Headwinds  
In this scenario, the unfavorable baselin e assumptions for fiscal policy, foreign 
economic conditions, and credit availability turn  out to have a more restrictive effect on 
aggregate demand than anticipated.  As a resu lt, the pace of the recovery does not pick 
up:  Real GDP rises only 2¼ percent per ye ar, on average, in 2013 and 2014, and growth 
remains below baseline until late 2016.  Because  margins of resource slack remain high, 
inflation stays close to 1¼ percent rather than  rising as in the base line.  With inflation 
persistently below the FOMC’s longer-run objective and the une mployment rate far 
above its natural rate, the federal funds rate  remains at its effective lower bound until late 
2016.6 
                                                 
6 As noted earlier, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio in these 
alternative scenarios are the same as in the baseline.  However, if the recovery were to prove as anemic as 
shown in the Headwinds scenario, the FOMC might choose to purchase a larger amount of securities than 
assumed in the baseline.  One ad ho c way to account for this possibility might be to assume that the FOMC 
continues adding to its SOMA portfolio through the end of next year, increasing the amount of purchases in 2013 by $500 billion relative to the baseline.  FRB/US  simulations of the effect of large-scale asset 
purchases (LSAPs) on the economy suggest that these purchases would lower the unemployment rate by roughly ¼ percentage point by late 2015 relative to the Headwinds scenario, while judgmental assessments 
of the impact of LSAPs by the staf f suggest a somewhat smaller effect.  Similar considerations could apply 
to all of the scenarios.

Higher Inflation with Unanchored Expectations 
In recent years, inflation has sometimes spiked on account of sharp increases in 
the prices of oil, other commodities, or imported goods, but these developments have 
proved to be temporary as longer-term inflati on expectations have re mained stable.  In 
this scenario, consumer pri ces rise significantly, pushing he adline inflation up to around 
3 percent by 2014.  But in this case, long-r un inflation expectati ons become unmoored, 
possibly from a loss of confidence associat ed with the large and expanding Federal 
Reserve balance sheet and a mi sinterpretation of the Commit tee’s stated intention of 
keeping monetary policy highly accommoda tive for a time after the recovery has 
strengthened.  As a result, both headline a nd core inflation run substantially above 
baseline for several years, even  after the original impetus to consumer prices has passed.  
Largely reflecting these more inflationary cond itions, the federal funds rate begins to rise 
in mid-2014 and real GDP growth is somewhat slower than in the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate finishes 2015 at 6¾ percen t, ¼ percentage point above the baseline.  
European Crisis with  Severe Spillovers  
In this simulation, the improvements witn essed in European financial markets 
over the past few months are assumed to be short-lived, and Europe plunges into a bout 
of severe stress, much worse than seen to da te during this crisis.  While we believe that 
the likelihood of such an outcome has declined somewhat in recent months, it could still 
occur, possibly triggered by a disorderly s overeign default, the failure of a large 
European financial institution, or a further lo ss of confidence by the public in the ability 
of European governments to reso lve the crisis.  In this scen ario, the greater stress prompts 
both private and most sovereign borrowing costs in Europe to soar—with corporate bond 
spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline—and the confidence of European households and businesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe declines about 8¼ percent 
relative to baseline by the firs t half of 2014, despite a 25 perc ent depreciation of the real 
effective exchange value of the euro.  Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to the rest  of the world, including the United States.  
U.S. economic activity contracts sharply, as U.S. corporate bond spreads rise more than 
300 basis points, equity prices plunge, credit availa bility is restrict ed, and household and 
business confidence erodes.  In addition, w eaker foreign economic activity and the 
stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U. S. net exports.  In all, U.S. real GDP  
falls 3¼ percent next year and barely increa ses in 2014.  The unemployment rate rises to 
10¾ percent in 2014 before beginning to gradua lly decline.  With substantially greater 
resource slack and lower import prices, overa ll U.S. consumer prices decrease 1¼ percent

in 2013; prices begin to rise in 2014 as economic  activity starts to recover.  Under these 
conditions, the SIGMA policy rule keeps the fe deral funds rate at its effective lower 
bound until early 2017. 
Weaker Growth in Emerg ing Market Economies 
Although real GDP growth in the EMEs has slowed substantially so far this year, 
to 3½ percent in the third quarter, we exp ect that economic growth will resume at a 
4¾ percent pace in 2013 and 2014, close to its  historical trend.  However, it is 
conceivable that the adverse spillover effect s on growth in the EMEs from the weakness 
in the advanced economies will be larger than anticipated in the baseline.   In this 
scenario, despite stimulative government policies, real GDP growth in the EMEs falls 
below its baseline pace to only 3 percent ove r the next two years as weakness in the 
advanced economies leads to a greater re duction in consumer confidence, lower 
investment, and tighter credit conditions in th e EMEs than in the baseline.  Moreover, we 
assume that the slowdown in the EMEs has pronounced spillover effects on other major 
U.S. trading partners.  As foreign economi es respond to their weakness with monetary 
easing, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar appreciates about 5 percent 
relative to baseline.  U.S. real net exports decline relative to baseline in response to 
weaker foreign growth and the higher dollar.  U.S. real GDP expands only about 
1¾ percent in 2013, and the unemployment rate remains near 8 percent until late 2014, 
about ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation declines to 
1¼ percent in 2013 and 2014 because of both the appreciation in the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar and lower re source utilization.  The lifto ff of the federal funds rate 
from its effective lower bound is delayed until early 2016.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
