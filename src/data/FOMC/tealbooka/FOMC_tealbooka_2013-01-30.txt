 Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information on economic activity that we have received since the December 
Tealbook has been a mixed bag.  In the labor market, the unemployment rate has come in 
a little lower than we projected in the December Tealbook, while payroll employment 
growth has been very close to our expectati ons.  However, we estimate that real GDP was 
roughly flat in the fourth quarter of 2012, as compared with a projected rise of almost 
1 percent in our previous forecast.  The weakness in real GDP growth was concentrated in the volatile categories of defense spendi ng, inventories, and net exports, and we do not 
expect it to persist into 2013.  Instead, we estimate that real GDP will step up to a 
2¾ percent pace in the first quarter, up 1 per centage point from our previous projection.  
Most of this upward revision reflects cha nges in our fiscal policy assumptions—most 
notably, the one-year extension of  the EUC program that was enacted in early January.   
 The broad contour of the medium-ter m projection for real GDP growth is 
essentially unchanged from the December Tealbook, as the revisions to the key 
background factors shaping our forecast ha ve been small and largely offsetting.  
Moreover, although the legislation enacted at the turn of the year to address the “fiscal 
cliff” left several issues unresolved, the enacted policies were  broadly consistent with our 
previous assumptions.  We e xpect real GDP to increase 2¾ percent this year, 3¼ percent 
in 2014, and 3½ percent in 2015.  
 Despite the similar projection for real GDP, our path for the unemployment rate 
is a little lower in this pr ojection, as we have interprete d the constellatio n of available 
evidence as suggesting that the cu rrent level of potential output  is a bit lower than we had 
previously assumed (and hence the gap in reso urce utilization is sl ightly narrower than 
we earlier estimated).  We now expect that  the unemployment rate will decline from 
7¾ percent at the end of 2012 to about 6¼ percent at the end of 2015, roughly 
¼ percentage point below the path in the December Tealbook.  
Readings on consumer prices have come in  a bit softer than we had expected, but 
the fundamental inflation picture remain s unchanged:  With long-term inflation 
expectations assumed to remain well anchored  and slack in resource utilization expected 
to persist for some time, inflation should remain subdued.  In response to the gradual 
reduction in resource slack over the medium term , core PCE inflation is  projected to edge 
up from 1.6 percent in 2013 to 1.7 percent in both 2014 and 2015, essentially unchanged

  from the December Tealbook.  Total PCE inflatio n is projected to run a little below core 
inflation over the medium term  as energy prices move down. 
In this Tealbook, we have consolidated our  discussion of recent developments and 
the outlook for the labor market and inflation into its own section, which begins on 
page 17. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We have adjusted our procedure for setti ng the federal funds ra te trajectory in 
order to take on board the Committee’s guida nce in its December statement that the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain within the current target range of 0 to ¼ percent at 
least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and inflation between one 
and two years ahead is projected to be be low 2.5 percent.  Once either one of these 
thresholds is crossed, we assume that the fe deral funds rate will s ubsequently follow the 
prescriptions of an inertial versi on of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.1  In the current staff 
forecast, the unemployment rate is below 6.5 pe rcent in the fourth quarter of 2015, so we 
assume that tightening begins at the end of  that year, the same as in the December 
Tealbook.   
Our assumptions about the Federal Re serve’s balance sheet are unchanged 
relative to the December Tealbook.  We assume  that the Federal Reserve will purchase 
about $85 billion of longer-term securities per month through June 2013.  We also 
continue to assume that market participan ts anticipate a longer-lived asset purchase 
program with cumulative purchases appr oximately $500 billion higher than our 
expectations, and that they will gradually l earn about the true size of the program during 
the first half of this year.   
Other Interest Rates 
The 10-year Treasury yield has increa sed about 25 basis points since the 
December Tealbook to a bit more than 1¾ per cent.  Broadly, this increase was about 
what we had expected, and we think it mostly  reflects a combination of an abatement of 
investor concerns after the year-end fiscal negotiations and the ongoing movement of the 
10-year valuation window through the period of ex tremely low short-term interest rates.  
                                                 
1 This rule generates a path for the federal funds rate after mid-2015 that is similar to the one in the 
December projection.

  We project that the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds will rise to about 4 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2015, with a somewhat steeper trajectory earlie r in the forecast period as 
investor risk appetite con tinues to strengthen and inve stors learn more about the 
dimensions of the LSAP program. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have edged up only a few basis 
points since the December Tealbook, reducing thei r implied risk spread by about 20 basis 
points.  We expect this spread to hold steady through much of 2013, and then to decrease 
about ½ percentage point by th e end of 2015.  Conventional 30-year mortgage rates have 
increased slightly from their December hi storical low of about 3¼ percent and are 
expected to rise in line w ith benchmark Treasury yields to  about 5½ percent by the end of 
2015. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
A broad index of U.S. stock prices has risen by more than 6½ percent since the 
December Tealbook, in line with the reduction in investor concerns and encouraging 
early reads on corporate earnings in the fourth quarter.  Equity prices are projected to rise 
at an average annual rate of about 8 percent over the next th ree years.  On average, the 
trajectory of equity prices is about 3¼ percent higher than in the December Tealbook. 
Recent readings on home prices from Co reLogic, along with other house price 
indicators, have once again b een a little stronger than our expectations, and we have 
boosted our projection of house price gains a bit throughout the medium-term forecast.  In particular, we now forecast that house pr ices will rise 4½ percent in 2013 and then 
decelerate to a 3½ percent rate in 2014 and 2015 as higher mortgage rates weigh on housing affordability.  At the end of 2015, the level of house prices is about 2½ percent 
higher than in the previous projection. 
Fiscal Policy 
The legislation enacted at the turn of the year settled many of the issues associated 
with the fiscal cliff.  Th e box “Fiscal Policy Developments ” describes the key provisions 
of the legislation and specifies  the relatively small adjustments to our policy assumptions 
that we have made as a result.  The key point is  that we continue to expect fiscal policy to 
be a significant drag on econom ic growth over the projection period.  As a result of the 
improving economy and fiscal consolidation, the federal budget deficit is projected to fall 
steadily over the projection period, from 7 percen t of GDP ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal year 
2012 to 3 percent of GDP ($550 billion) by fiscal 2015.

 Fiscal Policy Developments  
On New Year’s Day, the Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA), which resolved  a large 
portion of the federal tax and spending polic y issu es associated with the “fiscal cliff .”  The provisions of the 
act were roughly in line with the policy assumptions we had built into recent projections, but  considerable 
uncertainty remains around  several important issues  that will need  to be addressed in the next couple of 
months .     
The new legislation made the 2001 –03 tax cuts permanent for most taxpayers, extended the Emergency 
Unemployment Compensation (EUC)  program  and the 50 percent bonus depreciation  provisions for 
one year, and  increased income ta x rates on top -income earners.1
Overall, our current fiscal policy  assumptions remain  quite close to those in the December Tealbook, with  
the most important change reflecting the extension of the EUC  program.  With  regard to the sequest ration, 
we continue to assume that it  will eventually be replaced by a more gradual amount of deficit reduction 
from a combination of lower spending and additional tax increases.  As shown in the table below, the 
staff’s measure of fiscal impetus is  now  projected to be  a little less negative in 2013 , largely as a result of 
the extension of the EUC  program , and slightly  more negative in 2014 , as we assume that  the EUC  and the 
bonus depreciation provision s will be allowed to expire at the end of this year.   The new law is estimated to raise tax 
revenue about  $40 billion in 2013 and roughly $600 billion over 10  years .  The Congress also allowed the 
temporary payroll tax cut to expire, a move that is expected to increase revenue an additional $110 billion 
this year.  Notably, the Congress  did not resolve this year’s scheduled spending sequestration but agreed to 
delay  its implementation until March 1.    
Although uncertainty about fiscal policy has diminished somewhat with the enactment of ATRA, it remains  
elevated , as protracted negotiations are likely to ensue on the contentious issues the a ct did not resolve.  
The Treasury is expected to be constrained by the current statutory federal debt limit sometime after mid -
February , though the House leadership has proposed legislation suspending the debt ceiling until May.  In 
March, in addition to addressing the spending sequestration, the Congress will also need to tackle the 
expiration of the continuing budget resolution, which appropriates funding for discretionary defense and 
nondefense programs.  The results  of the negotiations over these issues are highly uncertain and could  
have material effects on the staff forecast.  For example, if the full sequestration were allowed to take 
hold , fiscal impetus would show a ½ percentage point greater drag on real GDP growth this year, compared 
with our current forecast.  We expect that wrangling over the debt ceiling will adversely affect consumer 
and business confidence for a time and could unsettle financial markets; of course, an actual failure to raise 
the ceiling could have vastly worse consequences .

dividends increased from 15 percent to 20 per cent.

  Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We currently estimate that foreign econo mic growth picked up in the fourth 
quarter of 2012, albeit to a still anemic annual rate of 2¼ percent.  Disappointing data in 
the euro area and Canada were offset by st ronger-than-expected indicators in Asia, 
especially China.  We expect overall forei gn growth to pick up further, to a pace of 
3 percent in the first half of this year, supported by an acceleration of  U.S. economic 
activity, further easing of financial stresses in Europe, a continued strengthening of 
growth in emerging markets, and generall y accommodative monetary policies abroad.  
The projected easing of fiscal and financ ial pressures should enable the European 
recovery to gain traction over the remainder of the forecast period, which helps push 
foreign growth up to about 3½ percent in  2014 and 2015.  We revised up somewhat our 
projection of foreign activity for 2013, in light of more momentum in the Chinese 
economy, greater policy stimulus in Japan, and less stressed financial conditions in 
Europe than we foresaw in December.  Fo r the remainder of the forecast period, our 
outlook is about unchanged.    
The broad nominal dollar has declined a b it on net since the ti me of the December 
Tealbook, as a modest depreciation against mo st currencies was partly offset by an 
8 percent appreciation against the Japanese yen.  We continue to assume that downward 
revisions over the next few m onths in market expectations for the Federal Reserve’s asset 
purchases will put some upward pressure on the level of the dollar this year.  Over the forecast period as a whole, however, we exp ect the broad real dollar to depreciate at 
about a 2½ percent average annual rate.  This pace of depreciation is  slightly less than 
projected in the previous Tealbook, as the recent improvement in European financial 
conditions has brought forward some of the re versal in safe-haven flows that we had 
expected would take place later in the forecast period.      
Oil and Other Comm odity Prices  
Oil prices are revised up slight ly in this projection.  The spot price of Brent crude 
oil closed at about $113 per ba rrel on January 22, about $2 pe r barrel higher than in the 
December Tealbook.  The price of West Te xas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has 
increased about $7 per barrel from the December Tealbook, moving the price of WTI 
toward the Brent price, as recent pipelin e expansions have better integrated the 
mid-continent oil market with the Gulf Coas t and global markets.  Our forecast for the 
price of imported oil has been revised up by $2 per barrel since th e December Tealbook.  
Overall, the price of imported oil is projected to remain at  about $100 per barrel for much

  of 2013 and then slowly decline over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching 
$90 per barrel at the end of 2015. 
Nonfuel commodity prices have increased on net relative to the previous 
Tealbook, as higher prices for some metals we re only partly offset by falling prices for 
agricultural products.  Prices for tin a nd iron ore have rise n sharply, reflecting 
improvements in Chinese demand and some s upply disruptions.  Meanwhile, a better-
than-expected supply outlook has pushed down ag ricultural prices, ex tending their retreat 
from the drought-induced peak in mid-2012.  N onfuel commodity prices are projected to 
remain relatively flat through 2015. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As noted earlier, weak readings in th e erratic categories of defense spending, 
inventories, and net exports help inform our estimate that real GDP was about flat in the 
fourth quarter, rather than rising 1 percent, as in the December projection.  In contrast, 
private domestic final purchases appear to have  risen at an annual ra te of 3½ percent last 
quarter, somewhat faster than in our previ ous forecast.  In the first quarter, we now 
project that real GDP growth will step up to a 2¾ percent pace despite the drag imposed 
by the end of the payroll tax holiday; growth  this quarter should be boosted by a rebound 
in farm output from last summer’s drought a nd a recovery in activity that had been 
depressed by the hurricane.  Relative to our December projection, the forecast for real GDP growth in the first quarter has been re vised up about 1 percentage point, mostly 
reflecting the extensi on of EUC benefits.  
Household Spending 
Real PCE appears to have increased about 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter of last 
year—about as expected in our December Tealbook projection.  Sales of light motor 
vehicles rose to an annual rate of 15 million units last quarter, and real spending in the retail sales group also posted a solid gain.  In contrast, the growth in services spending 
has been weak and uneven.  In the current quar ter, we expect real PCE growth to slow 
somewhat to a 1¾ percent pace as households begin to adjust their spending in light of the substantial increase in payroll and income  taxes.  Relative to the December Tealbook, 
our forecast of real PCE growth in the first qua rter is up about 1 percentage point, as that 
earlier projection had not assumed an extension of EUC benefits.

  Although the recent data on residential cons truction have been a little stronger, on 
net, than we had expected, we suspect that  most of the upside surprise reflects the 
unusually warm weather in December.  Following a slight dip in November, single-
family housing starts rose about 8 percen t to an annual rate of approximately 620,000 
units in December, about 30,000 higher than we anticipated.  By contrast, permits—which provide a better gauge of the unde rlying pace of new construction and, in 
particular, are less sensitive to weather anomalies—have increased more gradually.  Meanwhile, new and existing home sales have continued to pick up, indicators of homebuilder and realtor sentiment have improved substantially, and—as noted earlier—house prices have risen from their lows in la te 2011.  All told, we project single-family 
starts to average about 610,000 units in the fi rst quarter, just a bit below the outsized 
December reading. 
Some of the factors restraining home pur chases have fueled demand for rental 
units, leading to falling vacancy rates and ri sing rents in the multifamily sector.  In 
response, multifamily starts and permits have  trended up relatively strongly.  Although 
we do not expect the spike in multifamily starts in December to be sustained, we do 
expect to see continued growth in this se ctor as the supportive fundamentals persist. 
Business Investment 
After falling at an annual rate of abou t 2½ percent in the third quarter, real 
business spending on equipment and software (E&S) appears to have risen about 
14 percent in the fourth quarter.  Although the expected expiration of the 50 percent 
bonus depreciation at the end of  last year may have contri buted slightly to the sharp 
turnaround in spending, experience from previous episodes suggests that this factor was not of primary importance.  Smoothing through the recent volatility, real E&S spending increased only about 5 percent over the second ha lf of last year, sim ilar to the pace in the 
first half.  We project spending to rise onl y modestly this quarter, reflecting both the 
sluggish growth in business output and some continued caution on the part of businesses 
in response to uncertainty about the European crisis and the U.S. fiscal situation.  On 
balance, forward-looking indicators of bus iness investment appear consistent with 
continued moderate gains in near-term spending:  Although the ISM nonmanufacturing index of business conditions has improve d, the manufacturing index remains subdued, 
and indicators of capital spendi ng plans remain at low levels.  
Incoming data suggest that investment in nonresidential stru ctures outside of 
drilling and mining fell about 2½ percent in th e fourth quarter, similar to the pace of

  decline in the third quarter.  Although we anticipate a sma ll boost to this category of 
investment from rebuilding after Hurr icane Sandy, high vacancy rates and low 
commercial real estate prices should con tinue to weigh on investment.  Moreover, 
although there are hints of easing in financ ing conditions for existing commercial real 
estate, credit availability for new construc tion remain tight.  All told, nonresidential 
investment (excluding drilling and mining) is projected to increase only modestly in the 
near term, in line with leading indicators like the architectural b illings index, which has 
improved lately but remains in neutral territory.  
In the drilling and mining sector, investment flattened out in 2012 after posting 
strong gains in the prior two years.  While new drilling technique s and relatively high 
crude oil prices have kept spending at an elev ated level, the decline in natural gas prices 
has restrained it from moving even higher.  We expect outlays for drilling and mining 
structures to increase modestly in the near term, in line with the projected trajectories of 
oil and natural gas prices. 
After an unusually large increase in the th ird quarter, real inve ntory investment in 
the nonfarm business sector appears to have slowed sharply in the fourth, subtracting 
nearly 1½ percentage points from the rise in real GDP.  Estimates from the staff’s flow-
of-goods system, book-value measures of inve ntory-to-sales ratios , reports on dealer 
inventories of motor vehicles, and surveys of in ventory satisfaction all point to stocks that 
are fairly well aligned with sales.  Accordin gly, we expect nonfarm inventory investment 
to have a relatively neutral influence on GDP growth in the current quarter.  
Government 
The contraction in the state and local s ector continues to abate.  After having 
declined at an annual rate of about 1½ percen t in the first half of  2012, we estimate that 
real state and local purchases edged down just ¼ percent in the second half.  We expect real purchases to be about flat in the curre nt quarter, as budget c onditions continue to 
slowly improve. 
The defense outlays reported in recent Monthly Treasury Statements suggest that 
real federal purchases plunged in the fourth quarter, more than reversing the anomalous 
jump in the third quarter.  For 2012 as a whole, we estimate that real federal purchases 
fell about 2 percent, and we anticipate a similar decline in the first quarter.

  Foreign Trade  
International trade data for October and November suggest that both exports and 
imports in the final quarter of last year were  much weaker than we had been expecting in 
the December Tealbook.  We now estimate that real exports of goods and services fell at 
an annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, dragged down, in part, by a 
continued falloff in exports to the euro area.  We expect export growth to rebound in the 
first quarter of this year to an annual rate of 5¼ percent, a pace more in line with our 
projections for the dollar and foreign activity.  Real imports  of goods and services are 
now estimated to have fallen 2½ percent in  the fourth quarter, a second consecutive 
quarter of decline.  As with exports, imports  were weaker than th eir key determinants—
U.S. GDP and the dollar—would have imp lied, and we anticipate import growth to 
bounce back to a 3 percent pace in the first qua rter of 2013.  We estimate that, in all, the 
external sector subtracted ¼ percentage point from GDP gr owth in the fourth quarter, 
compared with a neutral contribution in th e December Tealbook, and that it will add 
¼ percentage point to growth  in the first quarter.   
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing production, which fell sharply in October because of Hurricane 
Sandy, rebounded in November and December to a level that was a bit more robust than 
we had expected in the December Tealbook; th e upward surprise likel y reflected, in part, 
a larger boost to production from rebuilding efforts and the warm weather last month.  
Most of our near-term indi cators of production—including th e new orders indexes from 
regional manufacturing surveys—suggest lit tle change in factory output in coming 
months.  Nevertheless, a strong reading fo r manufacturing IP in December sets up a 
robust first quarter, with factor y output now expected to rise at an annual rate of 4 percent 
following three quarters of little change.  This projection is about 1 percentage point 
stronger than in the December Tealbook.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The broad contour of the medium-term pr ojection for real GDP growth is the 
same as in the December Tealbook, as the revisions to our fiscal policy assumptions 
affect only the timing of the projected recove ry and the changes to our other conditioning 
assumptions are small and offsetting.  As in previous Tealbooks, we  are projecting real 
GDP to accelerate over the forecast period, supported by further improvements in financial conditions, an easing of the financial crisis in Europe, a reduction of uncertainty related to fiscal policy at home, and rising household and business confidence.  Even so,

  we continue to anticipate that several headwinds will restrain the pace of economic 
activity over the medium term, including fiscal policy that will remain restrictive (even if 
less uncertain) and still-tight credit conditions  for some households and businesses.  All 
told, real GDP is projected to increase 2¾ percent this year, 3¼ percent in 2014, and 
3½ percent in 2015.  Relative to the December projection, growth is a bit stronger in 
2013 and a bit weaker in 2015, leaving the level of real GDP at the end of 2015 
essentially unchanged from the December Tealbook. 
Part of the fiscal restraint in our forecast is reflected in the projected contraction 
in government purchases.  In particular, afte r falling an estimated 2 percent in 2012, real 
federal expenditures are expected to decline at an average pace of 4 percent per year over 
the next three years, owing to ongoing fis cal consolidation efforts and the winding down 
of overseas military operations.  Meanwhile , despite slowly improving budget conditions, 
growth in the real purchases  of state and local governme nts is projected to remain 
sluggish throughout the medium term, averaging less than 1 per cent per year.    
Another significant part of the drag from  fiscal policy shows through in the form 
of restraint on the growth of the after-tax incomes of households and hence their 
spending.  The main elements of this restrain t are the expiration of the temporary payroll 
tax cut that has now gone into effect, an increase in income taxes—including both the 
already enacted taxes on high-income households and some additional tax increases that we assume will be enacted as part of an agreement to replace the automatic sequestration—and the eventual expiration of the EUC program.
2  Despite this significant 
fiscal restraint, we are projecting a solid r ecovery in consumer spending, as the drag from 
fiscal policy is more than offset by ri sing household wealth, increasing consumer 
confidence, and an improving labor market.  In  total, real PCE is expected to rise 
2¼ percent this year before stepping up to an average pace of about 3½ percent per year 
in 2014 and 2015; this projection is little changed, on net, fr om the December Tealbook.   
Growth in residential constr uction spending is projected to benefit from the same 
factors that are supporting consumer spendi ng, including increasing confidence and rising 
income and wealth.  However, these effects ar e offset to some extent by the substantial 
increase in mortgage interest rates that we project over the medium term as well as by a 
continued tight supply of mortgage credit to borrowers with lower credit scores.  
Moreover, although the homeowner vacancy rate  has declined noticeably, the stock of 
                                                 
2 As noted previously, the one-year extension of EUC benefits changes the timing of the fiscal 
restraint relative to our earlier assumptions but not its overall magnitude.

  vacant homes held off the market remains quite elevated.  Once put on the market, this 
“shadow” inventory, which includes many ba nk-owned properties, may redirect some 
demand from new construction to existing homes, although the magnitude and timing of 
this effect are quite uncertain.  As a resu lt, we expect the recovery in residential 
construction to take place gradually.  Although residential investment is projected to increase an average of 15 percent per year  over the medium term, the pace of total 
housing starts rises only to about 1.5 million un its in 2015, still below its long-run trend.  
The external sector is exp ected to be about neutral fo r real GDP growth over the 
medium term.  Both exports and imports are projected to accelerate, reflecting strengthening economic growth at home and abroad, while th e dollar’s expected 
depreciation helps support e xports over imports.  Our pr ojection for net exports is 
essentially unrevised from the December Tealbook.   
 With rising demand emanating from the c onsumer and foreign sectors, and with 
businesses’ concerns about Europe and the U.S.  fiscal situation anticipated to wane over 
time, we project a slight acceleration in real E&S spe nding, from about 5¼ percent in 
2012 to an average of about 6 percent over the medium term.  We are projecting a modest 
rise in nonresidential building investment, as we expect on ly very gradual improvement 
in vacancy rates, commercial real esta te prices, and credit availability.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR LABOR MARKETS AND INFLATION  
On the whole, conditions in the labor market appear to have improved at a 
somewhat faster pace in the past couple of m onths than we had expected in the December 
Tealbook.  Increases in private payroll em ployment averaged 180,000 per month in the 
fourth quarter of 2012, a little above our expe ctation in the previous forecast, although 
government employment came in a little soft er than expected.  In addition, the 
unemployment rate declined to 7.8 percent in November and held steady at that rate in 
December, whereas we had projected it to be 8 percent in both months.3  Meanwhile, the 
average workweek moved up from 34.3 hours in  October to 34.5 hours in December, also 
a little higher than we had antic ipated.  In contrast, the labor force participation rate fell 
to 63.6 percent in November and was unchange d in December, whereas we had expected 
it to stay flat at 63.8 percent in both months .  Given these labor market readings and our 
                                                 
3 At the end of each calendar year, the BLS up dates the seasonal-adjustment factors for the 
household survey.  The latest update caused the unemployment rate in November to be revised from 
7.7 percent to 7.8 percent.

  estimate of real GDP growth, it appears that labor productivity in the fourth quarter of 
2012 was lower than we had expected in the December Tealbook.   
Potential GDP and the Natu ral Rate of Unemployment  
The decline in the unemployment rate si nce mid-2012 in the face of relatively 
modest output gains led us to make some further small modifications to our supply-side 
assumptions; these revisions help to alleviate the tension between our estimates of the 
GDP gap and the unemployment gap.  (See the box “The Recent Decline in the Unemployment Rate” for further discussion.)   
We made two adjustments.  First, we revised down our estimates of structural 
productivity over the past several years by enoug h to lower the level of potential output 
by ¼ percent at the end of 2012.  We carried forward some of this slower productivity 
growth into this year, trimming potential out put growth by roughly 0.1 percentage point 
in 2013.  Second, the faster-than-expected dec line in the unemployme nt rate led us to 
reconsider our path for the natural rate of  unemployment.  We have assumed for some 
time that the natural rate was boosted duri ng the recession by mismatches between labor 
demand and labor supply, and that, when the labor market strengthened sufficiently, the 
natural rate would begin to fall back towa rd its pre-recession level.  In previous 
Tealbooks, we assumed that this decline in the natural rate would not begin until 2015.  
However, some indications of declines in mismatch, while not conclu sive, now hint at the 
possibility that the natural rate  has already star ted to decline.
4  Accordingly, we have 
nudged our estimates in that direction.  In particular, although we  have continued to 
assume that the natural rate reaches 5¾ pe rcent by the end of 2015 (and decreases further 
thereafter), we now assume that a very gradual decline began in 2012, which helps to 
account for last year’s drop in the unemployment rate.   
                                                 
4 See, for example, the recent papers by Laze ar and Spletzer (Edward P. Lazear and James R. 
Spletzer (2012), “The United States Labor Market:  Status Quo or a New Normal?” paper delivered at “The 
Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in 
Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30–September 1) and Şahin, Song, Topa, and Violante (Ay şegül Şahin, Joseph 
Song, Giorgio Topa, and Giovanni L. Violante (2012), “Mismatch Unemployment,” NBER Working Paper 
Series 18265 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August)).  That said, other analyses we look to for guidance on the evolution of the natural rate, such as the decomposition of the Beveridge curve by Barnichon and Figura (Regis Barnichon and Andrew Figura (2012), “The Determinants of the Cycles and Trends in U.S. Unemployment,” unpublished paper, Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, October) and the staf f’s state-space model, do not yet 
show any decline in the natural rate.

 The Recent Decline in the Unemployment Rate  
During the second half of last year, the unemployment rate declined nearly 
½ percentage point, from an average of 8.2 percent in the second quarter to an 
average of 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  (See the top figures of the “Labor 
Market Developments and Outlook” exhibit.)  In our view, this decline in the 
unemployment rate reflects an improvement in labor market conditions, as it was 
accompanied by relatively solid gains in payroll employment (the bottom figures ).  
However, this improvement in the labor market appears at odds with the tepid pace of real GDP growth in the second half evaluated against our D ecember Tealbook 
assumptions for potential output growth and the natural rate of unemployment.  
What might account for this discrepancy?    
One possible explanation is that our supply -side assumptions in the December 
Tealbook were wrong.  Indeed, we cannot observe either potential output or the natural rate of unemployment, and we must instead infer them from the joint 
behavior of the unemployment rate and real GDP  as well as other indicators.  The 
observed decline in unemployment —along with some evidence suggesting that labor 
market mismat ch might be beginning to improve —w as an important factor causing 
us to think that the natural rate may be starting to reverse the modest increase that 
we think occurred during the recession.  We now assume that the natural rate began  
to edge down in 2012 a nd will continue to decline slowly to reach 5¾ percent at the 
end of 2015, the same level as in the December Tealbook.  In addition , we made a 
further downward adjustment to our estimate of structural productivity growth in 
recent years, which is how we had typically resolved these discrepancies in previous 
Tealbooks.  All told, after taking into account our new supply -side assumptions —and 
also the staff’s estimates of the effect s on the unemployment rate of the decline in 
the number of people receiving emergency and extended U nemployment Insurance 
benefits —GDP growth  appears consistent with  much , but not all, of the decline in the 
unemployment rate during the second half of la st year.  
To be sure, misalignments between unemployment and real GDP growth are relatively 
commonplace , and we did not feel compelled to make large enough revisions to our 
supply- side assumptions to fully eliminate the discrepancy .  For one thing, some of the 
discrepanc y may reflect changes in labor supply, such as labor force exits by 
unemployed workers who have become discouraged by their job prospects.  In addition, real GDP  is subject to considerable measurement errors , and, importantly, 
the Bureau of E conomic Analysis has not yet published an estimate for the fourth 
quarter.  Finally, it is possible that the unemployment rate has “gotten ahead of 
itself,” and we could see unemployment coming down a bit less over the medium 
term than one might have otherwise predicted in response to the projected 
narrowing of the GDP gap.  For these reasons, our projection for continuing declines 
in the unemployment rate through the medium term depend s crucially on our 
anticipated pickup in real GDP growth.

  The Outlook for the Labor Market and Productivity 
Given our revision to the level of stru ctural productivity, the level of actual 
productivity in the fourth quarter stood about ½ percent above our estimate of its longer-
run trend, suggesting that firms continue to be stressing their workforces in a way that 
they will not be able to sustain over the me dium term.  As in previous projections, we 
expect firms to step up their hiring to re duce these pressures as they become less 
apprehensive about the economic outlook.  
Our projected path for gains in privat e payroll employment reflects this fading 
apprehension as well as the anticipated accelera tion in real GDP.  In particular, we expect 
private job gains to step up from 160,000 pe r month in the current quarter to about 
170,000 per month in the second half of this year.5  As real GDP accelerates further after 
2013, net hiring continues to strengthen to about 200,000 per month in 2014 and 250,000 
per month in 2015.  With this pace of hiring, the unemployment rate falls throughout the 
projection period, dropping below the Committee’s threshold of 6½ percent on a 
quarterly average basis in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
The top-right figure of the “Labor Mark et Developments a nd Outlook” exhibit 
compares our unemployment projection with our projection from September 2012, when 
the Committee first tied its asset purchase deci sions to an improvement in the outlook for 
labor market conditions.  Since last Septembe r, we have revised down our forecast for the 
unemployment rate by 0.4 percentage point, on average, both over the second half of 
2013 and over the whole of next year.6  By the fourth quarter of 2014, we now have the 
unemployment rate reaching 7.1 percent, down from the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed 
last August, the latest reading available to  the Committee at the time of the September 
FOMC meeting.  Meanwhile, as shown in th e middle-right figure in the exhibit, the 
outlook for payroll employment growth  has changed relatively little.  
Resource Utilization   
Labor market slack is expected to pers ist throughout the medium-term forecast, 
with the unemployment rate at the end of 2015 still ½ pe rcentage point above our 
                                                 
5 The slight deceleration in job growth in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter largely 
reflects distortions to seasonal ad justments because of the timing of  the recession, which we think 
exaggerated the reported pace of job growth in the fourth quarter.  Adjusting for this distortion would lower 
average employment growth in the fourth quarter to about 160,000 per month. 
6 Because we now assume that the decline in th e natural rate of unemployment begins in 2012 
rather than 2015, the revision to th e forecast of the unemployment rate slig htly overstates the revision in the 
projection of labor market slack during the intervening quarters.

  estimate of the natural rate.  We estimate that the level of real GDP was 4 percent below 
its potential level at the e nd of 2012, and this gap is proj ected to narrow slowly to 
1 percent by the end of 2015.  
There appears to be less slack in the ma nufacturing sector than in the broader 
economy, largely because of unprecedented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010.
7  In particular, capacity utilization in manufacturing stood at 77.4 percent in 
December, only about 1½ percentage points below its long-run average.  The factory operating rate is projected to move up to about its long-run averag e by the end of this 
year. 
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
Recent data on consumer prices have been  a bit softer than expected.  Based on 
the December CPI and PPI, we estimate that core  PCE prices rose at an annual rate of 
about ¾ percent in the fourth quarter, about  ½ percentage point below the December 
Tealbook and a substantial deceleration from th e 2 percent pace in th e first half of 2012.  
The deceleration in prices since midyear was reasonably broad based.  However, we 
believe that some transitory factors have been holding down inflation recently, and we 
anticipate core prices to increase ab out 1½ percent in the current quarter.8    
Recent readings on inflation expectations have remained in the relatively narrow 
range occupied over the past se veral years.  Median 5-to-10- year expected inflation from 
the Michigan survey ticked up to 2.9 percen t in December—in line with its average over 
the past 5 years—and remained at that le vel in the preliminary January survey.  
Meanwhile, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation for the next 5 years and for 
5-to-10 years ahead have both edged up about 0.1  percentage point from their values at 
the time of the December Tealbook. 
Core import prices declined, on net, in th e second half of 2012, likely contributing 
to the softness in consumer price inflation in the past few m onths.  Recent dollar 
depreciation and higher commod ity prices are expected to push up core import prices by 
2½ percent in the current quarter; over the remainder of the projection, we expect core 
                                                 
7 We estimate capacity in the industrial sector based largely on survey data that attempt to capture 
the highest level of output that plants can sustainably maintain based on realistic work schedules and 
assuming that inputs like materials and labor are sufficiently available. 
8 Some of the pickup in inflation over the near te rm reflects the observation that, for the past few 
years, there has been a pattern of low inflation late in  the year followed by higher readings early in the next 
year, which we attribute to residua l seasonality in the price data.

  import prices to increase at a 1½ percent pace, in line with the relatively flat trajectory for 
commodity prices and the assumed pace of dollar depreciation. 
We continue to expect that inflation will remain subdued over the medium term 
due to stable long-run inflation expectations, relatively small movements projected for 
commodity and import prices, and persistent slac k in resource utilization.  In response to 
a modest reduction in resource slack, core PC E inflation edges up from 1.6 percent in 
2013 to 1.7 percent in both 2014 and 2015, essentially unchanged from the December 
projection. 
Food prices, after increasing at an annua l rate of only ½ pe rcent in the third 
quarter, are estimated to have increased about  2 percent in the fourth quarter, likely 
reflecting some pass-through to retail prices of  the sharp run-up in crop prices associated 
with last summer’s drought.  We expect food pri ce inflation to remain elevated in the first 
half of this year but then  to slow thereafter as the effects of the drought wane.  
Meanwhile, our forecast for consumer energy prices—a moderate rise in the fourth 
quarter and a sharp drop-off in the first, followed by gradual reductions throughout the 
remainder of the projection—reflects the projected  path of crude oil prices and is little 
revised from the December Tealbook.  
All told, after registering at  an annual rate of 1½ percen t in the third quarter of 
2012, total PCE price inflation appears on track to slow to 1¼ percent in the fourth 
quarter and 1 percent in the current quarte r—both about ¼ percentage point below our 
December projection.  In contrast, our medium-t erm projection is just a touch higher than 
in the December Tealbook, with  total PCE price inflation av eraging 1.5 percent per year.  
Thus, throughout the medium term, the projection for PCE inflation remains well below 
the Committee’s threshold level of 2½ percent.  
Increases in labor compensation remain subdued.  Average hourly earnings 
(AHE) in November and December were slig htly higher than expected; nevertheless, 
recent data on personal income suggest that compensation per hour, which includes 
additional sources of labor income and covers a broader range of workers than the AHE 
measure, advanced at an annual rate of 1 per cent in the fourth quart er, ¾ percentage point 
less than our December Tealbook forecast.  For th e first quarter of this year, our forecast 
for compensation growth is little revised at  an annual rate of a bout 2½ percent.  We 
expect growth in compensation per hour to ri se gradually over the medium term, from 
2¾ percent in 2013 to 3½ percent in 2015, as  the labor market gradually tightens.

  The Long-Term Outlook 
We have extended the staff’s forecast through 2020 using the FRB/US model and 
our assumptions about long-run supply-side co nditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  
The contour of the long-term outlook  depends on the following key assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s strategy statement after the January 
2012 meeting.  As was noted earlie r, the Committee’s threshold for 
unemployment is crossed in  the baseline projection in late 2015.  In the 
extension period, the federa l funds rate is therefor e set according to the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule.     
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2016 and 2017, albeit to a diminishing extent.  By 2018, the pr ocess of portfolio normalization is 
essentially complete. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd bonds continue to decrease gradually 
to normal levels, and financial instituti ons further ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) begins to widen after 
2016, primarily reflecting fast-rising transfer payments for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal debt  stabilizes temporarily at around 
75 percent of GDP but then rises to 78 percent of GDP by the end of the 
decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 1¾  percent per year 
in 2016 and 2017 and moves down more slowly  thereafter.  The price of crude 
oil declines slightly in 2016 and then hol ds steady in real terms.  Foreign real 
GDP growth is 3¼ percent in 2016 and slow s to a 3 percent a nnual rate late in 
the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment c ontinues to decline in 2016 and 2017, 
from 5¾ percent at the end of 2015 to 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 
2017, as labor market functioning improves fu rther; it remains at that level in 
the longer run.  Potential GDP  increases at an average annual rate of just over 
2 percent in the 2016–20 period and moves up to a 2¼ percent pace in the

  longer run, which is ¼ percentage point lower than in the previous Tealbook 
due to an adjustment in our projection of capital deepening. 
The economy is projected to enter 2016 w ith output below its potential level, 
unemployment above its natural rate, and infl ation below the long-r un objective of the 
Committee.  In the staff’s long-term for ecast, further improvements in household and 
business confidence, diminishing uncertaint y, and supportive financial conditions enable 
real GDP to rise 3¼ percent in 2016.  Thereafter, gains in GDP  move down closer to their 
potential pace, reflecting the progressive  withdrawal of monetary accommodation.  
Unemployment falls through 2017 to 5¼ percent.   Long-run inflation expectations are 
assumed to remain well anchored, and with the margin of slack in labor and product 
markets diminishing, consumer price inflation is close to 2 percent in 2017.  The nominal federal funds rate is above 3½ percent by the en d of the decade and eventually stabilizes 
at around 4 percent, ¼ percenta ge point lower than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting 
the downward revision to long-run potential GDP growth.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Recent indicators suggest a modest pickup in foreign economic growth in the 
fourth quarter, albeit to a still sluggish  pace of 2¼ percent.  This reading is little changed 
from our December Tealbook projection, as disappointing data in some regions were 
offset by positive surprises in others.  Economic activity in  Europe appears to have 
contracted a bit more in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated , and we also revised 
down our estimate of Canadian GDP growth in light of weak exports.  In contrast, the 
fourth -quarter GDP release from China was very strong, and Japanese consumption was 
surprisingly res ilient.    
In the first half of this yea r, we expect overall foreign growth to pick up further to 
nearly 3 percent, as easing of financial stresses leads output in the euro area to level out 
and the recent strength in the Chinese economy spills over into other emerging  Asian 
economies.  Subsequently , as fiscal and financial headwinds wane, monetary polic y 
remains accommodative , and U.S. economic activity accelerates , foreign growth should 
increase to 3½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  Our projection for 2013 is  revised up a bit 
based  on more momentum in the Chinese econom y and greater policy stimulus in Japan.  
For the remainder of the forecast period, our foreign outlook is about unchanged.      
The r isk of a slump in global economic activity has  diminished amid  continuing 
improvement of European financial conditions and more-solid evidence of a pickup in Asian growth, particularly in China.  Nonetheless, Europe continues to face formidable economic and political challenges  in implementing fiscal consolidation , especially during  
its recession .  Accordingly , there remains a danger that the European crisis could 
intensif y with severe spillovers to the rest of the world, as discussed in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section .  Moreover, although the resurgence of the Chinese economy has, for 
now, eased fears of a hard landing, we remain  alert to the fact that still-inflated property 
markets in China and in several of its neighbors pose a threat to the region’s growth.  All that said, the reduction of tail risks in Europe and China, as well as perceived progress in addressing the U.S. fiscal cliff , have buoyed investor sentiment around the globe.  This 
improvement in sentiment could lead to higher spending and growth abroad than we ha ve 
written down in our baseline forecast , a scenario also described in t he Risks and 
Uncertainty section.

  We estimate that foreign inflation in the fourth quarter came in at an annual rate 
of a little under 2½ percent, about the same rate that prevailed in the third quarter, with an 
increase in inflation in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging Asia being roughly offset by a steep decline in inflation in Mexico (which has a large weight in our aggregate of total foreign prices) .  We expect foreign inflation to remain quiescent over 
the forecast period, continuing to average about 2½ percent, held down by substantial economic slack in the AFEs and  only muted commodity price pressures.      
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We estimate that real GDP in the AFE s rose only ¼ percent in the fourth quarter, 
a bit below our December Tealbook projection.  Indicators suggest that activity in Europe contracted a little more than we had assumed, and Canadian export and production data 
also proved disappointing.  Only partially offsetting these data, in Japan, consumer 
spending held up surprisingly well, leading us to erase the small contraction we had penciled in.   
In the coming quarters, gradual progress in the resolution of the euro- area crisis 
and a pickup in demand in the U nited States  and emerging market economies (EMEs) 
should help recovery in the AFEs gain traction, leading to an increase in real GDP growth in these economies to about 1½ percent this year .  The outlook for this year is revised up 
a touch , largely based on more -stimulati ve policies in Japan  and easier financial 
conditions in Europe than we anticipated in December .  We see AFE growth picking up 
further to 2 percent in 2014 and 2¼ percent in 2015, about unchanged from the previous Tealbook projection.  Although these growth rates represent a considerable improvement 
from last year’s paltry pace  of under ¾ percent , they are still too low to eliminate the 
substantial resource slack  in these economies .   
Data on consumer prices confirm  our projection in  the December Tealbook that 
AFE inflation stepped up from ¾ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter to 1¾ percent in the fourth, reflecting a bounceback in inflation readings in Canada, a large 
hike in university tuition fees in the United Kingdom, and the stabilization of Japanese food prices following shar p declines.  Thereafter, we project that AFE inflation will settle 
around 1½ percent, held down by sizable resource slack and subdued commodity price 
pressure s.  We expect the major AFE central banks to maintain their policy rates and 
asset purchase programs at current levels through much of the forecast period, with the major exception of Japan , where we anticipate further easing.

  Euro Area 
Financial conditions in the euro area have eased further since the December 
Tealbook, as European authorities made additional progress in addressing the fiscal and 
banking crisis.  Last month, t he Greek government successfully exchanged  about 
€30 billion of its debt held by private investors at a discounted price, thus fulfilling a key requirement of the agreement reached with the European Union and the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) in late November .  As a result, euro- area governments and the IMF 
were able to resume Greece’ s financial assistance.  The agreement also improved the 
terms  on official debt, thus lighten ing Greece’s debt burden and greatly alleviat ing 
concerns , at least for the time being,  over a possible Greek exit from the euro area.  
European governments also made some progress in their protracted negotiations 
regarding European banking union, agreeing in December on key details of a single 
supervisory mechanism for European banks.  In early 2014, the European Central Bank 
(ECB ) is slated to take over the supervision of large euro-area banks from national 
authorities and be empowered to issue supervisory directives to any euro- area bank , 
although many details remain to be worked out.  
Over the next couple of years, we envision further moderate easing of financial 
stresses against the backdrop of ad ditional steps toward banking union, progress by the 
Spanish government in reduc ing its deficit and shor ing up its banking system, and further 
fiscal adjustment in other peripheral economies.  However, the process of financial 
normalization will likely be interrupted by periods of heightened financial tensions.  In 
the near term, uncertainty about Spain’s fiscal performance and the outcome of Italy’s 
upcoming national election could weigh on investors’ s entiment.   Further down the road, 
Greece will require additional assistance, and more generally, peripheral economies will face severe challenges balancing their budgets in the face of continuing economic weakness.  These developments could prompt more adverse reactions by investors than we currently anticipate, leaving open the possibility of more severe outcomes than in our baseline. 
Recent data point to a somewhat sharper -than-expected contraction of 1¼ percent  
at an annual rate in euro -area GDP in the f ourth quarter.  Industrial production and retail 
sales in November remained significantly below their third -quarter levels , and the 
unemployment rate edged up to a record -high 11.8 percent.  Activity in Germany 
weakened noticeably ; author ities noted that G erman GDP may have contracted as much 
as 2 percent  in the fourth quarter.  Other indicators, however, have been more positive.

  In December, euro -area economic sentiment improved further and the composite PMI, 
while still in contractionary territory, poppe d up to a level not seen since early 2012.  
Accordingly , we expect euro -area GDP  to stabilize in the first half of 2013.  Thereafter , 
the pickup in global demand , the gradual normalization of financial conditions, and 
reduced fiscal drag should help  growth increase to 1 percent in the second half of the 
year, 1½ percent in 2014, and 2 percent in 2015.  This outlook is a bit more optimistic  
than in the December Tealbook but is still quite anemic in light of the region’s substantial 
resource slack . 
Euro -area inflation increased slightly to 2½ percent at an annual rate in the fourth 
quarter, reflecting increases in energy and food prices.  Looking ahead, amid declining 
energy prices and a large output gap, we expect inflation to hover around 1½ percent , 
little changed from the December Tealbook .  The Governing Council of the ECB at its 
January meeting unanimously decided to keep its benchmark policy rate at ¾ percent.  As financial tensions slowly abate and the economy gradually recovers, we expect the ECB  
to keep rates on hold through 2015 while providing ample liquidity support to banks.  This assumption is a change from our December Tealbook assumption, which called for a policy rate cut by the ECB in early 2013.  Although the euro-area outlook is not substantially stronger than it was last month, comments by ECB official s after their 
January meeting i ndicated no appetite for near- term rate cuts.  
Japan 
Parliamentary elections in Japan in December resulted in a new government, 
bringing the Liberal Democratic Party back to power.  Newly  elected P rime Minister 
Shinzo Abe (who also previously served as prime minister from September of 2006 to September of 2007) introduced a large fiscal stimulus program to revive the economy and called for aggressive monetary easing to end deflation.  These developments contributed to a stock market rally and  a substantial depreciation of the yen.  (See the box “Recent 
Policy Developments in Japan.”)   
Recent data suggest that Japanese economic activity , after declining for two 
quarters, edged up at an annual pace of ¼ percent  in the fourth quarter, an improvement 
relative to the further contraction we had projected in the December Tealbook .  Even 
though industrial production and exports continued to dec line early in the quarter and the 
manufacturing PMI pointed to further contraction through December, real consumption increased at a surprisingly solid pace in October and November .  In addition,

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  manufacturers reported plans for output expansion in December and January.  In light of 
the weaker yen and greater policy stimulus being provided by the new government, we 
now call for Japanese growth to increase to 1¾  percent in 2013, up about ¾ percentage 
point from the December Tealbook.  However, growth will th en likely fall back to an 
average pace of only ½ percent in 2014 and 2015, a touch lower than in the previous 
forecast, as the stimulus measures  wind down and planned hikes in the consumption tax 
go into effect .  
With food prices leveling off after earlier declines, we estimate that Japanese 
deflation moderated from an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter to ½ percent in the fourth.  On December 20, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced a moderate expansion of its Asset Purchase Program, and on January 22, amid mounting political pressure, it took further actions, including the introduction of a 2 percent inflation target.  We deem 
that these recent measures fall well short of what is needed to break from a long history 
of persistent deflation.  Indeed, with substantial resource slack and recent core inflation readings below negative 1  percent, we project that consumer prices—abstracting from the 
temporary boost from the consumption tax hikes—will remain about flat over the forecast period.  This project ion represents only a slight upward revision to our previous inflation 
forecast.   However, the BOJ may well take bolder action to boost prices once new 
leadership is appointed by Prime Minister Abe, as the terms of Governor Shirakawa and his two deputies expire soon.  
United Kingdom 
Recent data suggest that  real GDP  growth in the United Kingdom dropped  from 
3¾ percent in the third quarter to slightly negative in the fourth, as the boost from the summer Olympics disappeared .  Notably, retail sales declined through December, 
industrial production and goods exports through November stood below their  third -quarter averages , and the composite PMI lingered near 50 throughout the quarter.  
We continue to project that U.K. real GDP will expand at about a 1½ percen t pace this 
year, supported by an abatement of European financial stresses and stronger global 
activity.  Accommodative monetary policy and diminished fiscal drag should help GDP growth  increase further to 2¼ percent in 2014 and 2½ percent in 2015, unchanged from 
our projection in the December Tealbook. 
The latest hikes in retail energy prices and university tuition fees lifted inflation to 
4¾ percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.  We expect abundant resource slack to

 Recent  Policy Developments in Japan  
Following parliamentary elections on December 16 , the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP ) 
returned to power  in Japan , and its leader, Shinzo Abe, became the new p rime m inister.  
Mr. Abe , who previously served as prime minister  from 2006  to 20 07 but did not initiate 
any important economic program s at the time, swiftly put forward a large fiscal stimulus 
program aimed at reviving economic growth and forcefully called for aggressive 
monetary policy easing to overcome deflation.  These moves have prompted strong responses in financial markets and further actions by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), but absent 
additional stimulus a s well as structural reforms, these actions are unlikely to end Japan’s 
prolonged economic slump.  
 
The Japanese government’s initiati ves follow two years of very weak growth.  R eal GDP, 
shown in the upper -left figure on the next page,  has yet to re gain  its level befo re the 
global financial crisis, held down by a  weak global recovery, a stronger yen, and the 
disastrous Ma rch 2011 earthquake and tsunami.   To jumpstart the economy, the new LDP 
government unveiled a ¥10.3 trillion (about 2 percent of GDP) s timulus package , with the 
bulk of the spending directed to construction projects .  With only h alf of the package 
consisting of genuine increases in spending, we estimate that these measures will boost 
the level of GDP by about 1 percent by mid -2014 .  However , the new stimulus package 
also exacerbates Japan’s fiscal problem s, pushing the public deficit from 10  percent of 
GDP in 2012 to nearly 11  percent in 2013.  With the gross public debt  projected  to exceed 
220 percent of GDP this year, the LDP government has stressed  that it will adhere to the 
medium-term fiscal goals laid out by the previous administration, which call for the 
government to halve its deficit by 2015 and achieve  a fiscal surplus by 2020 .  Accordingly, 
we anticipate  that the previously legislated plan to double the consumption tax rate over 
2014  and 20 15 will still be implemented and , thus , that the fiscal impulse will turn negative 
next year.  
 Japan also continued to experience persistent deflation over the past year, despite the 
BOJ’s implementation of its large Asset Purchase Program (APP) and its adoption in 
February 2012 of  a 1 percent inflation goal  (see upper -right figure on the next page.)  On 
December 20, the BOJ increased the size of its APP from ¥91 trillion to ¥101  trillion, 
pointing to a weakening economic  situation.  Amid mounting pressures  from the new 
government, the BOJ announced further  measures  on January  22.  First, it introduced an 
inflation target of  2 percent.  Second, starting in January 2014, the BOJ intends to 
conduct open -ended purchases at a monthly rate of ¥13 trillion rather than fixing the total 
purchase amount.  However, t his should result in only a modest expansion of its APP, as 
most of the purchases would merely replace maturing assets  in the BOJ’s portfolio.  The 
BOJ stopped short of more aggressive measures, such as a significant lengthening of the maturity of assets targeted by the APP, which is now only one to three years , or explicitly 
linking the conduct of future monetary policy to the achievement of an economic target, 
such as sustained inflation above 1  or 2 percent.  
 
The statements and actions of the Abe government, along with more general improvements in global risk sentiment, prompted a strong financial market response.  
Since the time of the December  Tealbook, the yen depreciated 8  percent against the U.S.

 (see the two bottom  figures o n this page).  In contrast, Japanese sovereign bond yields  
(not shown) rose  just a little, suggesting that investors’ concerns about fiscal 
sustainability have not increased despite the large new stimulus program.  
 
Although the stimulus package and the BOJ easing measures should help support 
economic  growth over the near term, they  amount to modest expansions of policies  tried 
before with limited success.  Accordingly, these initiatives  alone will likely prove 
inadequate to achieve the new 2 percent inflation target and restore the dynamism of Japan’s economy over the longer term .  The BOJ will  likely take bolder steps to overcome 
deflation once a new leadership  is in place —the terms of Governor Shirakawa and his 
two deputies expire by early April —though much uncertainty remains.   
 
Japan also faces deep structural problems —the growth rate of potential GDP has fallen 
to ½  percent —and the new administration has so far shown little intention of tackl ing 
these problems .  Measures aimed at improving potential output growth—such as 
enabling m ore immigration and more women in the labor force to offset a rapidly aging 
populatio n, deregulation of the services sector to boost productivity, and closer 
integration with e merging Asia to sustain exports —should  be top priorit ies for  Japanese 
policymakers.

  help bring inflation down to 2 percent in 2013 and about 1¾ percent over the remainder 
of the forecast period.  As anticipated, the Bank of England (BOE) kept the Bank Rate at 
½ percent and the size of its quantitative easing program, now completed, at £375 billion 
over the intermeeting period .  We expect the BOE to keep policy on hold over the 
forecast period , although the Funding for Lending Scheme initiated last August may 
provide further stimulus.   
Canada 
We now estimate that real GDP growth in Canada stepped up to an annual rate of 
only 1½ percent in the fourth quarter, ½ percentage point less than previously anticipated.  Monthly GDP in October and exports through November w ere weak.  However , data 
from late in the fourth quarter were somewhat better.  In December, the unemployment rate inched down to a four-year low of 7.1 percent, and the manufacturing PMI edged up following five consecutive monthly declines.  Also, the most recent Bank of Canada Business Outlook Survey  reports a small improve ment in business sentiment.  The  
positive tone of the most recent domestic data, along with the projected acceleration in U.S. GDP, leads us to forecast growth of 2 percent in 2013, rising to nearly 3 percent  by 
the end of the forecast period.  This projec tion is little changed from the December 
Tealbook.     
Recent price data suggest that fourth -quarter CPI inflation, at an estimated 
1¾ percent, was somewhat lower than we had expected.  We project that inflation will 
gradually increase to 2  percent by the end of the forecast period .  This outlook is  
¼ percentage point higher in 2013 due to higher oil prices and firmer growth.  Given 
contained inflation pressures and a persistent though modest output gap, we continue to expect the Bank of Canada to wait until mid -2014 before initiating a slow rise in its main 
policy rate from the current level of 1 percent.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
We now estimate that real GDP growth in the EMEs stepped up to an annual rate 
of more than 4 percent in the fourth quarter from 3¼ percent in the third.  The pickup reflects both stronger domestic demand as well as a recovery of EME exports ;  
across -the-board weakness in EME exports appears to be behind us, although exports to 
the euro area remain weak .  The fourth- quarter GDP  growth estimate is ¼ percentage 
point higher than we wrote down in the December Tealbook, largely reflecting stronger

  data from emerging Asia —especially China’s surprisingly high fourth- quarter GDP 
release—which  more than offset a downward revision in Mex ico.   
We anticipate that EME growth will step up further to 4¾ percent in the first half 
of this year, supported by an acceleration of activity in the United States, the spillover of 
the strength in China to the rest of emerging Asia, and continued accommodative 
macroeconomic policies.  This forecast is ¼ percentage point higher than in the 
December Tealbook, reflecting a more positive outlook for U.S. activity —including U.S. 
manufacturing production, which is e specially relevant for Mexico —and some  
carry -forward of th e stronger tone that incoming data are suggesting.  We look for EME 
growth to increase only slightly over the remainder of the forecast period.  Although demand from the advanced economies is expected to pick up further, EME output is already  close to potential and policy accommodation is assumed to be gradually 
withdrawn .  Beyond the near term, the EME growth outlook is little changed from the 
December Tealbook.  
Headline inflation in several EMEs increased in the fourth quarter because of 
idiosyncratic food price increases and other country- specific factors .  But the effect of 
these developments on aggregate EME inflation was more than offset by a sharp decline in Mexican inflation, reflecting an unwinding of a previous rapid run -up in food prices.  
Thus, we estimate that overall inflation in the EMEs tapered off to 3  percent in the fourth 
quarter from about 3½ percent in the third.  This year, we expect overall EME inflation to average about 3 percent before edging up to 3¼ percent in 2014 and 2015.  Monetary policy remained generally accommodative in these economies, and the central banks of 
Israel and Colombia lowered policy rates, responding to concerns about economic 
growth.  
China  
By our estimate, Chinese real GDP grew 9½ percent at an ann ual rate in the 
fourth quarter, 1¼ percentage points higher than we projected in December.1
                                                 
1 There is no official series for the level of Chinese real GDP  and thus estimates of Chinese 
economic growth from various sources can differ significantly.  The staff’s quarter -on-quarter growth 
estimates are constructed from the official series of four -quarter changes in real GDP, and should be 
viewe d as having relatively wide confidence bands.   
   This pace 
of activity appears to be quite consistent with  other recent in dicators .  Industrial

  production accelerated in the fourth quarter, supported in part by an improvement in 
external demand  as exports grew briskly after stagnating in the previous quarter.  In 
addition, retail sales and fixed -asset investment continued to grow at their relatively 
robust third- quarter rates.  Given the increased mom entum in the economy, we marked 
up the forecast for Chinese growth about ½ percentage point over the first half of this 
year, to 8½ percent.  We project that Chinese growth will taper off to 8 percent by 2015, 
reflecting a gradual decline in trend growth in the economy.  Although problems in the 
property market and the banking sector persist, the risk of a hard landing appears to have 
faded somewhat  in light of the strong recent readings on economic activity.   
In the fourth quarter, Chinese headline inflation came in at an annual rate of 
2 percent , up from 1¾ percent in the previous quarter , reflecting a sharp increase in pork 
and vegetable prices in December .  Although we believe the recent increase in food 
prices will be reversed, we expect  the solid economic expansion and associated strong 
wage growth to lead  inflation to gradually edge up, avera ging 2¾  percent this year and 
3 percent thereafter.   
Other Emerging Asia 
In the rest of emerging Asia, data suggest that real GDP growth moved up from 
2¾ percent in the third quarter to a still below -trend 3¾ percent in the fourth, about 
½ percentage point higher than the December Tealbook .  Industrial production, PMIs, 
and exports rebounded in East Asia during the fourth quarter from their weakness earlier 
in the year.  India’s economy also appears to be gaining momentum, with  growth  
estimated to have risen to 6 percent in the fourth quarter after bottoming out at 
3¼ percent in the third .  We project growth in emerging Asia excluding China to increase 
further to ab out 4¼ percent this year and 4¾  percent in 2014 and 2015, supported by 
positive spillovers from Chinese growth, a recovery of demand from the advanced economies, and accommodative macro economic policies.   In the near term, this outlook 
is about ¼ percentag e point higher than in the December Tealbook but is unchanged for 
2014 and 2015.   
We estimate that inflation in the region increased to an annual rate of 3¾ percent 
in the fourth quarter from 3 percent in the third.  The increase was largely driven by a steep rise in inflation in Hong Kong after the removal of a public housing subsidy and 
also a moderate rise in Korea, reflecting a resumption of food price inflation and increases in transportation cost s.  We project that headline inflation in the region w ill fall

  back a bit and average about 3¼ percent over the forecast period, roughly in line with our 
previous Tealbook forecast.   
Latin America 
We estimate that real GDP growth in Mexico picked up to a still- lackluster  pace 
of 2¼ percent in the fourth quar ter from 1¾ percent in the third .  We project that, 
consisten t with the pickup in U.S. manufacturing production, growth will increase to 
4 percent this year and remain at about that pace in 2014 and 2015.  The fourth -quarter 
estimate  is revised down ¼ percentage point relative to the December Tealbook , given  
weak er-than-expected readings on Mexican industrial production.  Nonetheless, we 
marked up Mexican GDP growth about ¼ percentage point this year, in light of the upward revision to U.S. manufacturing.   
We believe that real GDP growth in South America increased to an annual rate of 
3¼ percent in the fourth quarter from a downward- revised 2 ¼ percent in the third.  We 
expect growth in the region to increase to 3½ percent this year and further to 3¾ percent in 2014 and 2015.  In Brazil,  the data have been mixed .  Both the PMI and exports 
increased in the fourth quarter and retail sales continued to show robust growth through 
November .  However , industrial production remained weak.  On balance, these data are  
consistent with a rise in real GDP growth to about 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter.  W e 
continue to project  Brazilian growth to increase gradually over the forecast period , to 
3¾ percent this year and about 4 percent in 2014 and 2015, as the recovery strengthens,  
supported by the effects of policy accommodation and a pickup in the advanced 
economies.                  
Mexican inflation declined to an estimated annua l rate of 3 percent in the fourth 
quarter from 6½
 percent in the third.  Much of this decline was related to  the expected 
unwinding of third -quarter  food price increases , but the fourth -quarter re ading was still 
¾ percentage point lower than previously anticipated .  We see Mexican inflation 
moderating a bit further in the current quarter but then, after the food price cycle plays out, increasing to about 3½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  In Brazil, inflation remained 
elevated in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 7½ percent, somewhat higher than previously expected, as food price pressures remained and services prices rose more than 
expected.  As food price increases abate, we expect Brazilian inflation to decline  to about 
5½ percent over the forecast period.

Financial Developments 
Sentiment in financial markets improve d, on net, over the intermeeting period, 
largely in response to the partial resolution of the “fiscal cliff,” a positive start to the 
corporate earnings reporting season in early January, and reassuring policy developments 
in Europe.  As a result, br oad stock price indexes were up 4½ percent on balance,  
near-term option-implied volatility on the S&P 5 00 index fell further to a very low level, 
and corporate bond spreads narrowed.  Nevert heless, market participants reportedly 
remain closely attuned to fiscal developmen ts, particularly those related to the debt 
ceiling, possible sequestration of spending, and the expiration of the continuing 
resolution. 
Over the intermeeting period, market-based measures of the path of the federal 
funds rate edged up, and the implied expected value of the federal funds rate now rises 
above ¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, one  quarter earlier than at the time of the 
December FOMC meeting.  Yields on longe r-term nominal and inflation-protected 
Treasury securities also moved higher.  In addition to the somewhat-more-optimistic tone 
to the outlook, yields were like ly boosted in part by a revers al of flight-to-quality flows 
after the resolution of the fiscal cliff and by the release of the minutes of the December 
meeting, which investors repor tedly read as suggesting th at asset purchases may not 
continue for as long as they had previously expected.  N ear-term inflation compensation 
was slightly higher over the intermeeting peri od, while the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar was little changed on balance.   
Interest rates near historical lows co ntinued to support the pace of borrowing in 
the nonfinancial corporate sector .  Net debt financing by nonfinancial firms surged in the 
fourth quarter, with outsta nding volumes of corporate bonds, commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans, and nonfinancial  commercial paper (CP) all expanding.  The household 
sector also appeared to benefit from the low interest rate environment, as consumer credit 
expanded further in October and November, refl ecting growth in student and auto loans, 
and mortgage refinancing remained quite st rong.  The January Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SL OOS) suggested that, over the past three 
months, banks eased their cred it standards and terms somewhat for most types of loans 
and that demand for many types of lo ans increased further (see appendix).

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Expected policy rates base d on market quotes moved up, on balance, over the 
intermeeting period, likely reflecting in part some  attenuation of concerns about the fiscal 
cliff and the attendant downside risks to the economic outlook.  Overall, the December 
FOMC statement and the Chairman’s press conference following the meeting were characterized by market participants as largely in line with expecta tions.  Some investors 
expressed surprise that thresholds for unemp loyment and inflation were introduced in the 
forward guidance at the December meeti ng, although many had reportedly anticipated 
that roughly similar threshol ds would be adopted at so me point relatively soon.  
Economic data releases over the period, including the December employment report, were reportedly seen as about in  line with expectations and el icited little pr ice reaction.  
On net, the expected path of the federal f unds rate derived from overnight index swap 
(OIS) rates steepened over the intermeeting period and now ri ses above the current target 
range in the fourth quarter of 2014, one quarter earlier than at the time of the December FOMC meeting.  Some measures of polic y uncertainty ticked  up over the period, 
suggesting that some of the increase in OI S rates could reflect an increase in term 
premiums.  The modal policy path—the most lik ely values for future federal funds rates 
based on caps-implied risk-neutral distri butions—also shifted up somewhat and now 
indicates that the current ra nge will prevail through the first quarter of 2016.  Results 
from the Open Market Desk’s latest survey of primary dealers showed a slight downward 
shift in modal policy rate expectations beyond the first half of 2015, although dealers 
continued to view the third quart er of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increase in 
the target rate.
1   
Reflecting in part the change in the market-implied path of policy, Treasury 
coupon yields increased moderately over the period.  The FOMC announcement regarding asset purchases may have contribut ed to the upward rise in yields:  The 
announced pace of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities was widely anticipated, 
but the specific maturity distribution for thos e purchases reportedly placed slightly more 
weight on intermediate-maturity securities, as  opposed to longer-term securities, than 
some investors had expected.  Yields increased again following the release of the December FOMC minutes, which were re portedly interpreted by some market 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

  participants as signaling that the Federal Re serve might end asset purchases earlier than 
previously expected as a result of concer ns about the efficacy and costs of additional 
purchases.  Indeed, results from the most rece nt primary dealer survey indicate that far 
fewer dealers now expect asset purchases to continue beyond 2014 than at the time of the 
December survey, although median estimates su ggest that dealers continue to view the 
first quarter of 2014 as the most likely time for the end of those purchases.  Dealer 
expectations for the level of  SOMA holdings at the end of 2013 were largely unchanged 
from the December survey. 
The passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 eased concerns about 
the risk of substantially higher fiscal drag on growth in the near term; the reduced odds of 
a sharp slowing in the economy, and the associated unwinding of safe-haven demand, 
prompted a notable increase in Treasury yields .  Nonetheless, invest ors reportedly remain 
attuned to other fiscal developments, includ ing those related to th e debt ceiling, possible 
sequestration, and expiration of the continui ng resolution.  (See the box “Debt Ceiling.”)  
On net, Treasury yields rose over the inte rmeeting period, with 5-year yields increasing 
12 basis points and 10-year yields up 21 basis points.  Both TIPS- and swaps-based 
inflation compensation over the next 5 years edged slightly higher.  Five to 10 years 
ahead, TIPS-based inflation compensation was unchanged, while the swaps-based 
measure fell a bit. 
TREASURY AND AGENCY MBS  MARKET FUNCTIONING  
The Desk completed the maturity extension program, continued its monthly 
purchases of agency MBS, and began the flow-based Treasury purchases announced 
following the December FOMC meeting.2  Current-coupon yields on 30-year agency 
MBS rose 17 basis points over the intermeeting period, reaching their highest level since 
September of last year.  Liquidity cond itions in Treasury and agency MBS markets 
displayed typical seasonal patt erns associated with the ye ar-end, with bid-asked spreads 
widening somewhat and trading volumes edging lo wer in advance of the turn of the year.  
However, liquidity conditions la rgely returned to normal in both markets early in the new 
                                                 
2 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $98 billion in agency MBS under the  
flow-based MBS program and the reinvestment program.  In addition, the Desk has purchased $31 billion 
of Treasury securities since the start of the new Treasury purchase program at the beginning of the year.  
Finally, as part of the maturity extension program,  $28 billion of Treasury securities were purchased and 
$23 billion were sold over the intermeeting period.  The average maturity of SOMA Treasury holdings increased by about 4¼ years over the course of the program.

 Debt Ceiling  
Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury announced a two- month Debt Issuance 
Suspension Period and began using extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the 
$16.3 94 trillion debt limit.  As of January 22, the Board staff estimated that these 
measures provide d the Treasury with a pproximately $ 180 billion of remaining capacity, 
implying, as shown in the top figure on the next page, that the debt ceiling will not be breached un til February 28 .

Investor concerns about the debt ceiling appear to have left , as yet, only a modest 
imprint on financial markets.  As shown in the bottom  figure on the next page, spreads 
on both one- and five -year U.S. credit default swaps (CDS)  have increased recently, and 
the front end of the CDS curve has flattened .  Nevertheless, both spreads remain 
considerably below levels at the time of the debt ceiling impasse in 2011, although this measure of investor expectations could be noisy due to the illiquidity of this market.  
Signals of broader financial market strains are not evident, perhaps reflecting market 
participants’ belief that the Congress will increase the debt limit before default becomes 
a significant risk .  Near -term interest rate uncertainty measured by implied volatility from 
interest rate options is subdued, and near -term implied volatility for the S&P 500 stock 
price index fell to a five -year low over the intermeeting period (as noted in the main 
Financial Developments text ).  That said, in past debt limit episodes, stresses in some of 
these measures often d id not appear until the debt limit breach date was imminent . 
 
Fitch Ratings recently stated  that a failure to reach agreement on raising the debt ceiling 
in a timely  manner would undermine confidence in the United States as a reliable 
borrower and prompt a review of its U.S. sovereign credit ratings .  Last September, 
Moody’ s stated that the government’ s rating would likely be placed under review after 
the debt limit is reached but several weeks before the exhaustion of the Treasury ’s 
resources, similar to the actions Moody’s took in 2011.  Standard & Poor’s  Ratings 
Services downgrade d the U.S. credit rating followin g the 201 1 debt ceiling deba tes but  
has not made any statement on the current debt ceiling  negotiations .  
                                                 
1 Although forecasts for the breach date are inherently uncertain, there is a higher- than -usual 
degree of uncertainty in the current episode because the Debt Issuance Suspension Period  coincides 
with the tax -filing season, when the amounts and timing of tax payments and refunds are exceptionally 
volatile.  Against this backdrop, in a letter to the Congress on January 14, the Treasury Secretary noted 
that the Treasury expects to exhaust the extraordinatry measures between mid -February and early 
March.

  year, and fails-to-deliver in the MBS market remained at low levels.  That said, there are 
some signs of scarcity in the TBA market for production-coupon MBS.  For example, the dollar-roll-implied financing rate for Fanni e Mae 30-year 3.0 percent–coupon TBAs—a 
coupon in which significant por tions of new issuance and of  the Desk’s purchases are 
concentrated—reached its most negative levels  since September, possibly reflecting light 
MBS issuance around year-end.  In response, the Desk rolled about 12 percent of the 
expected settlements of Fannie Mae 30-year 3.0 percent–coupon securi ties in January.  
The Desk also conducted dollar roll opera tions in the 3.5 percent coupon, though this 
coupon represents a significantl y smaller portion of SOMA purc hases.  All told, the Desk 
postponed settlement on 16 percent of its tota l purchases from January to February, a 
proportion within the range of its dolla r roll activity in recent months. 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were generally little changed, on 
balance, since the December FOMC meeting, although some money market rates edged 
down on net.  Year-end pressures were m odest overall and roughly in line with 
expectations.  Data through early January show limited evidence of  reallocation out of 
deposits, in the aggregate, following the e xpiration of unlimited deposit insurance on 
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at  the end of December.  (See the box 
“Expiration of Unlimited FD IC Deposit Insurance.”) 
Over the intermeeting period, the spr ead between three-month LIBOR and 
comparable-maturity OIS rates was about unc hanged, on net, as was the spread between 
the three-month forward rate agreement three months ahead and the corresponding 
forward OIS rate (a forwar d-looking measure of potenti al funding strains).  The 
outstanding amount of unsecured CP issued by European financial in stitutions increased 
noticeably over the period, with most of the in crease attributable to financial institutions 
with parents domiciled in France, Germany, and other “core” Eur opean countries.  In 
contrast, the outstanding amount of unsecured CP issued by U.S. financial institutions 
was about unchanged.  European financial inst itutions appeared able  to issue unsecured 
CP at maturities similar to those of such CP issued by their U.S. counterparts, and spreads 
on U.S. and European financial CP remained stable.  In asset-backed commercial paper 
(ABCP) markets, amounts outstanding have changed little for programs with sponsors 
domiciled in the United States  and Europe.  Overnight spr eads on ABCP were about flat, 
on net, and spreads on most European ABCP issu es remain close to those on U.S. issues.

 Expiration of Unlimited FDIC Deposit Insurance 
The unlimited FDIC insurance of  noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at insured depository 
institutions provided under the Dodd– Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
expired as scheduled on December 31, 2012.  A necdotal reports had suggested that the 
expiration could prompt investors to shift deposits  from banks to money market mutual funds 
(particularly government- only money  market funds) and other money market instruments, 
moves that could  push down Treasury bill yields and repo rates.1  In addition, these reports also  
suggested that some depositors might shift balances from smaller to the largest  banking 
institutions, which may be perceived as “ too big to fail.”2
  
Data through early January do not show an aggregate runoff of liquid deposits as  the unlimited 
deposit insurance expired .3  In December, liquid deposits grew at a robust seasonally adjusted 
annual rate exceeding 15 percent.  The  largest  institutions in the banking sector  saw strong 
inflows, but deposits at smaller banks also grew  in aggregate (see the top figure on the next 
page ).  In the first week of January , liquid deposits were about unchanged .4
  
Institutional money market funds, particularly government- only  money  market funds,  which 
normally see net inflows around year -end,  received strong inflows late in December  (see the 
bottom figure on the next page).5
                                                 
1 A survey by the Association for Financial Professionals conducted in November 2012 indicated that of 
those anticipating reducing deposit balances in response to the FDIC insurance expiration, the anticipated 
destinat ion was Treasury -based money market funds, outright holdings of Treasury or agency securities, as well 
as prime money market funds and repo holdings.  See also the appendix “Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey 
on Dealer Financing Terms” (SCOOS) in the Dec ember 2012 Tealbook, which included a special question on the 
FDIC insurance expiration.    The effect of this new cash invested by money funds, 
combined with typical year -end balance sheet management activities,  may have contributed in 
part to declines in money market rates around the turn of the year .  However, the strong 
growth in December did not continue into the first part of January .  
2 The Board s taff expected flows out of deposits related to insurance expiration to be a small fraction of 
the level of insured deposits.  See the box “Expiration of U nlimited FDIC Deposit Insurance” in the December 
2012 Tealbook ; the SCOOS a ppendix  in the December 2012 Tealbook , which included a special question on the 
FDIC insurance expiration ; and the box “Bank Funding Consultations” in the September 2012 Tealbook for more 
information on these projections. 
3 Liquid deposits consist of demand deposits, other checkable deposits, and savings deposits.  The Board 
staff focuses on liquid deposits because automatic sweeping activity conducted by banks between customers’ 
transactions accounts and savings accounts contributes to volatility among these components.  After 
contracting in November, demand deposits grew 24 percent at an annual rate in December on a seasonally adjusted basis.  
4 Data from the January 18, 2013, Statistical Release H.8, “Selected Assets and Liabilities of Commercial 
Banks in the United States,” showed a seasonally adjusted $39 billion decline in “other deposits” (which include additional deposit types to liquid deposits) at large banks for the week ending January 9; however, these U.S. banks have reported that only a fraction of this amount was related to the insurance expiration. 
5 In December, institutional money market fund balances grew about 6 percent at an annual rate on a 
seasonally adjusted basis  and more than 28 percent at an annual rate on an unadjusted basis.

Although there is limited evidence to date of significant reallocations due to the expiration  of 
unlimited deposit insurance, anecdotal reports  indicate that some individual banks have been 
affected.  A small number of  banks have reported that they had prepared for  liquid deposit 
runoffs at year -end by issuing alternative liabilities, such as time deposits.6
   Additionally, a few 
small institutions indicated that they have seen modest transfers out of previously insured deposits to alternative products within the bank or out of the bank to larger banks.  
                                                 
6 Large time deposits grew about 25 percent at an annual rate at domestic commercial banks in December 
but contracted in early  January.

  The GCF repo rate for Treasury collateral de clined, on balance, after the start of 
the new year, averaging 15 basi s points over the first three weeks of January, compared 
with 25 basis points during the month of December.  Prior to year-end, GCF futures 
quotes had indicated that market  participants anticipated a de crease in repo rates in early 
2013, reflecting a number of factors, including the end of the maturity extension program, 
expiration of unlimited deposit insurance,  and increased demand for high-quality 
collateral.  The actual decrease in repo rates was apparently a bit larger and more abrupt 
than had been expected, and futures quotes now suggest that the overnight Treasury GCF 
repo rate is expected to increase slightly in coming months but to remain below the levels 
observed late last year.  The amount of fi nancing provided by primary dealers against 
Treasury and agency collateral  fell some, on net, over the intermeeting period, consistent 
with typical patterns around the turn of the year, and financin g in the triparty repo market 
moved down by a similar percentage. 
A broad index of bank stock prices has risen 8 percent since the December FOMC 
meeting—outperforming the S&P 500 index—and the median CDS spread of six large banking organizations has decreased 16 basis points.  Sentiment toward domestic 
financial firms improved in response to the decline in tail risk following the fiscal 
negotiations and to continued recovery in th e housing market.  Mark et reaction to large 
domestic banks’ announcements of fourth -quarter earnings was mixed.  Market 
participants reportedly focused on strong loan  growth and investment banking results.  
However, investors also noted a decrease in net interest margins at some large banks.  
Several banks announced mortgage-related sett lements, most notably Bank of America’s 
settlement with Fannie Mae to resolve ag ency mortgage repurchase claims; the 
settlements were in line with expectations and reportedly removed so me legal uncertainty 
surrounding the banking sector.

  gauge of the risk premium embedded in equity prices—narrowed so me over the past few 
weeks but continued to remain very wide by historical standards.   
To date, about 100 firms in the S&P 500 have reported their fourth-quarter 
earnings.  Expectations from Wall Street analys ts indicate that earnings per share for S&P 
500 firms declined a bit on a quarterly basis, dragged down by the large loss incurred by 
Bank of America.  However, an elevated shar e of firms in the nonfinancial sector posted 
earnings above Wall Street expectations.  An index of revisions to analysts’ forecasts of 
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms was slightly negative for th e four-week period 
ending in mid-December. 
Over the intermeeting period, yields on speculative-grade corporate bonds 
decreased, and yields on investment-grade co rporate bonds were about flat.  Risk spreads 
on speculative-grade bonds narro wed substantially, consistent with an increase in risk 
appetite over the period.  In the secondary market for leve raged loans, the average bid 
price was up a bit since the December FOMC meeting.  The spreads of yields on A2/P2 
unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on AA-rated nonfinancial issues 
were about flat, on net, over the period amid year-end pressures that were mild by 
historical standards.   
On a total return basis, the HFR Global  Hedge Fund Index modestly trailed the 
S&P 500 index over the intermeeting period.  Market participants suggested that, since the beginning of the year, appetite for risk on the part of levered investors has increased 
somewhat as concerns about tail ri sk have continued to diminish. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Foreign financial market conditions also  improved over the intermeeting period.  
Markets responded favorably to the partial resolution of th e fiscal cliff negotiations, 
incremental but reassuring Eur opean policy developments, and the decision to slow the 
implementation of Basel III liquidity regulati ons.  On net, benchmark sovereign yields 
rose, European peripheral spreads decline d, and bank stocks generally outperformed 
broader indexes.   
Over the intermeeting period, the staff’s br oad index of the trade-weighted foreign 
exchange value of the dollar was little changed.  The do llar appreciated against the 
Japanese yen as financial markets responded to statements from recently elected Prime

  Minister Shinzo Abe, who pressured the Bank of Japan to ease policy more aggressively 
and to adopt a formal inflation target of 2 percent; the new government also announced 
additional fiscal stimulus measures.  (See the box “Recent Policy Developments in 
Japan” in the International Economic Devel opments and Outlook section.)  In contrast, 
the dollar depreciated against most emerging market currencies and the euro, as global 
risk sentiment improved and financial tensions in  the euro area eased further.  Early in the 
period, Greece successfully completed a bond exch ange that reduced its outstanding debt, 
and official financial assistance to Greece resu med.  European leaders also continued to 
make progress toward a banking union, agreei ng that the ECB would supervise the 
largest banks in the euro area as of next year.  Peripheral sovereign spreads continued to 
decline over the period, and Ireland took anothe r step toward full capital market access 
with a successful syndicated bond sale.   
Japanese equity prices increased signifi cantly over the period; equity prices in 
other countries also rose, though generally less sharply.  European banking stocks 
outperformed broader indexe s and increased notably on the announcement by the Basel 
Committee on Banking Supervision that it would give banks mo re time and flexibility to 
implement the Basel III liquidity standar d.  Funding conditions improved somewhat for 
euro-area banks; notably, Iri sh, Portuguese, and small Spanish banks, which had 
difficulty accessing capital markets for much of la st year, recently issu ed unsecured debt.   
Yields on foreign benchmark sovereign bonds increased over the period, 
reflecting both the improvement in global sentiment and reduced expectations for 
additional monetary easing in some of the advanced economies.  Although the Bank of 
Japan announced some further accommodation, the ECB and the Bank of England kept their policy rates on hold and appeared to signal a lower likelihood of further easing.  
Most emerging market central banks left their policy rates on hold, though a few eased 
their policy rates further on growth concerns.    
Foreign private demand for U.S. securities  was particularly strong in November, 
according to the latest TIC data.  Although fo reign official demand for U.S. securities 
was weak in November, data on custody holdi ngs at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York indicate a considerable pickup in D ecember, leaving official inflows for 2012 well 
above their 2011 level.

Available indicators suggest that the credit quality of  nonfinancial corporations 
continues to be solid.  In th e third quarter, the aggregate liq uid asset ratio remained near 
its highest level in at least 20 years, while th e aggregate ratio of debt to assets stayed 
quite low.  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds upgraded by Moody’s Investors 
Service in the fourth quarter increased a nd was somewhat larger than the volume of 
downgrades.  The six-month trailing default rate for nonfinancial corporate bonds ticked 
up in December but remained low by histor ical standards.  The KMV expected  
year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial  firms also stayed low in January. 
Nonfinancial firms continued to tap debt  markets at a prodigious pace over the 
intermeeting period, as interest rates remained very favorable and investors displayed 
strong appetite for fixed-income products.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial firms increased in the final quarter of last year from its robust third-quarter pace, boosted by a 
pickup in investment-grade issuance, and app ears to have remained strong in January.  
C&I loans also expanded briskl y in the fourth quarter, and the the volume of nonfinancial 
CP outstanding rose notably over the intermeeting period.  In the syndicated leveraged 
loan market, institutional loan issuance was very strong in December, and fourth-quarter 
gross issuance totaled nearly $140 billion, almost  the same quarterly pace as in the first 
half of 2007.  Issuance of CLOs accelerated in the fourth quarter, pushing overall 2012 
issuance above $50 billion.  Interest on the part  of institutional inve stors appears to have 
remained strong in the first few weeks of 2013. 
Recent issuance in both the corporate bond and the leveraged loan markets 
continued to be driven importantly by firms borrowing in order to refinance existing debt 
obligations.  In addition, borrowing to issue di vidends, a practice refe rred to as dividend 
recapitalization, rose further in the fourth qua rter, as some firms made dividend payments 
in advance of expected tax changes.  At $47 billion, the volume of such deals for the year 
was the largest since at least 2004 (when data  were first collected).  The average  
debt-to-earnings ratio for firms issuing highl y leveraged loans continued to rise, reaching 
its highest level sin ce 2007 but still remaining below the 2007 peak.  Nonetheless, 
spreads on newly issued loans stayed quite el evated relative to their pre-crisis levels. 
The pace of gross public issu ance of equity by nonfinancial firms was subdued in 
January, likely owing to seasona l factors, but remained solid in the fourth quarter.  Net 
equity issuance was again deeply negative in the final quarter of 2012, as retirements of

  equity from share repurchases and cash-finan ced mergers continued to outpace issuance.  
Announcements of share repurchases and cas h-financed mergers picked up a bit, 
suggesting that equity retirements are likely to maintain their rapid pace in the near 
future.   
Conditions in the commercial real estate ( CRE) sector continued to be strained.  
Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages at banks remained elevated in the third 
quarter, and those on CMBS stayed near hist orical highs in Dece mber.  Vacancy rates 
also continued to be relatively high in the third quarter, causing rents to stagnate or 
decline over the same period.  Investor demand for CMBS remained a bright spot for the 
sector.  CMBS issuance during the fourth qua rter was robust, capping off the strongest 
year for issuance since 2007 (but still we ll below its 2007 levels).  CMBS spreads 
narrowed 18 basis points over the intermeeting period.  In addition, the January SLOOS 
indicated that moderate frac tions of banks had eased some terms on CRE loans over the 
past year, such as maximum maturity and spreads of loan rates over banks’ cost of funds.  However, banks reported that policies relate d to loan-to-value ratios, debt service 
coverage ratios, and takeout  financing requirements were  about unchanged on net.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Conforming home mortgage rates touc hed new lows during the intermeeting 
period but have edged up 4 basis points, on net, since the December FOMC meeting.  
Yields on MBS rose by more, leaving the spre ad between primary and secondary rates  
13 basis points narrower and at its lowest  level since before the September FOMC 
meeting.  However, the spread still remained wide by historical standards due in part to 
heavy workloads at the majo r mortgage originators. 
Indeed, refinance originations in December  and January stayed near their highest 
levels since the housing market began to reco ver, supported by low in terest rates and, to 
some extent, HARP (the Home Affordable Refinance Program).  Nonetheless, originations remain below predictions from  staff models based on past refinancing 
behavior, as very tight underwriting conditions, cons olidation among mortgage 
originators, and low levels of home equity continue to limit access to credit for many households.  Capacity constraints in the mortga ge market may also be having an effect on 
the ability of some borrowers, especially thos e with lower-than-average credit scores, to 
obtain mortgage credit.  (See the box “Crowding Out in the Mortgage Market.”)  Earlier 
this month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized the ability-to-repay rules

 Crowding Out in the Mortgage Market 
Some market analysts and Fed eral Reserve staff have argued  that the recent large spreads 
between mortgage rates and the yields on agency MBS are at least partly attributable to 
“capacity constraints” in the mortgage finance industry.  Indeed, mortgage industry employment (the red line in the bottom- left figure ) plummeted over 40 percent between 2006 
and 2010, and hiring has rebounded only modestly despite the heavy pace of mortgage refinancing  activity (the blue line).  The resultant strain on industry processing capacity is 
thought to convey temporary market power to originators, which may be reflected not only in a higher primary –secondary market interest rate spread , but also in restraint on the quantity of 
loans originated.  Moreover, that restraint would likely be more binding on potential  
borrowers with less- than-pristine credit scores , owing to the increased time and scrutiny now 
required for underwri ting such  loans . 
These forces would compound the effects of the dramatic shift to tighter credit standards that took hold in 2008.  That shift is exhibited in the bottom- right  figure , which shows the monthly 
number of originations of prime mortgages for financ ing home purchases divided into five  
groups according to borrower credit scores.  L oans to borrowers with credit scores of 621  to 
680  (the black  line), which represented a sizable share of the market before 2008 , have nearly 
disappeared.  But there was also a dramatic falloff in the number of loans made to borrowers 
with fairly typical  credit scores, such as those in the range of 721  to 750 (the purple line ).  In 
contrast, purchase mortgages for borrowers  with the highest credit scores (above 780 , the 
orange line) have continue d to run at only a slightly slower  pace than during the boom years.  
In an environment in which origination capacity appears so stretched, the boon to refinancing activity as a result of historically low  mortgage interest rates might have the unfortunate side 
effect of exacerbating the difficulties that borrowers without stellar credit scores face in obtaining purchase and refinance mortgages.  In particular, lenders might be prone to focus their resources on easier- to-complete, but just as lucrative, refinance applications of borrowers 
with very high  credit scores, many of whom are repeat refinancing customers.

 To look for evidence of congestion effects on purchase mortgage originations , we construct ed 
a measure of the mortgage employee “ refinance workload ” using recent months’ total 
refinance applications divided by the number of real estate credit industry employees .  We 
then examine d the relationship between that measure and the quantity of purchase mortgage 
originations  for borrowers in different credit score ranges.  The result is shown in the bottom -
left figure , which plots the estimated effects (along with standard error bands) from the 
increase in the refinance workload seen over the past 18 months.  Our estimates suggest that 
such a rise in the refinance workload depresses monthly purchase originations about 50 percent for borrowers with credit scores of 621  to 680  and 15 percent for borrowers with 
credit scores of 681  to 720.  In contrast, there is no statistically significant effect for credit 
scores above 720 . 
We also explored the effects of our refinance workload measure on the monthly credit score 
distribution for purchase mortgage originations.  Indeed, t he 10th percentile of credit scores 
among  newly originated purchase mortgages  (the blue line in the bottom- right  figure ) exhibits 
a strong positive correlation with our refinance workload measure (the red line).  Our results suggest that an increase in the refinance workload like that seen o ver the past 18 months 
pushes  the 10th percentile of the credit score distribution 12 points higher and pushes up the 
median credit score about 3½ points.  This effect of higher workloads is not confined to purchase mortgages; we find s imilar results for t he credit score distribution of newly 
originated  refinance mortgages . 
One implication of this analysis is that assessing the net effect of a modest rise in market 
interest rates  on home purchase and refinancing activity is more complicated than one might 
expect.  Higher rates will tend to depress home purchase and refinance activity through the usual channels.  But at least some of those direct effects might be offset to the extent that the rise in rates curtails the demand for  mortgage refinancing and so leaves lenders more willing 
to provide purchase mortgages to borrowers with lower credit scores.   Moreover, the 
disappearance of “serial refinancers” could free up some capacity  to refinance more 
applicants with less- than-pristine credit scores.

  required by the Dodd–Frank Act, which delineates  the types of “qualified mortgages” for 
which mortgage originators will be provided legal safeguards from borrower lawsuits.  
Publication of the rules, which go into eff ect at the beginning of 2014, had little effect on 
market prices. 
Residential mortgage debt continued to c ontract in the third quarter because of 
high foreclosure and short-sale  activity, low home sales, a nd tight mortgage credit.  
Aggregate indexes of house pric es increased further in Nove mber, leaving home prices 
roughly 7½ percent above their ye ar-earlier levels.  The rate at which mortgages entered 
delinquency continued to trend down in Oc tober and November, but overall, serious 
delinquency rates on the stock of loans only edged down from a very high level.  
Consumer credit expanded briskly again in October and November.  
Nonrevolving credit continued to increase at a robust pace because of growth in student 
and auto loans, while revolving credit moved roughly sideways.  Consumer asset-backed 
securities (ABS) issuance totaled about $35 bi llion in the fourth quarter, capping off the 
strongest year for ABS issuance since prior to th e crisis (but still well below 2007 levels).  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the December FOMC meeting, th e Treasury auctioned $199 billion in 
nominal securities and $14 billion in five-year TIPS.  On balance, the auctions were 
about in line with expectations, although bid-to-cover ratios exhi bited their usual  
seasonal decline. 
Amid continued fiscal pressures facing state and local governments, net issuance 
of long-term municipal bonds was again negativ e in the fourth quart er, and partial data 
indicate that it likely remained negative in January.  In the third quarter, downgrades of 
municipal bonds slowed with respect to the fi rst half of the year but continued to far 
outpace upgrades.  CDS spreads for states na rrowed a bit, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, consistent with movements in corpor ate CDS spreads and a general increase in 
investors’ risk appetite.  Yields on 20-year general oblig ation municipal bonds did not 
rise as much as those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving their ratio a bit 
lower on net.

  COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Growth of bank credit in the fourth qu arter slowed to about half the pace it 
registered over the first three quarters of the year, as securities holdings continued to 
advance at a moderate rate and loan growth slowed.  Gains in bank loans continued to be 
concentrated in C&I loans, especially at  domestic banks.  In contrast, C&I loans 
contracted at foreign-related institutions in the fourth quarter, the first such decline in 
more than two years.  CRE loans were about flat over that period.  Closed-end residential 
loans held on banks’ books decreased over the quarter, and home equity loans continued 
to run off at a rate that was comparable to that of the previous quarter.  Consumer loans 
increased modestly in the f ourth quarter, reportedly booste d by auto loans, while credit 
card loans were flat.  Meanwhile, noncore loans increased only ma rginally during the 
quarter.  
Growth in banks’ securities during the fourth quarter remained roughly on par 
with that during the previous quarter.  Banks  reduced their portfolio s of agency MBS, on 
balance, over the quarter but continued to in crease their holdings of Treasury securities 
and “other” (non-Treasury and non-agency) secur ities.  Detailed data available from the 
Call Report for the third quarter suggest th at municipal bonds account for an important 
portion of the recent sustained growth in other securities. 
According to the January SLOOS, domestic banks continued to report having 
somewhat eased their lending standards a nd some terms, on balance, and having 
experienced a net increase in demand across most major loan categories in the fourth 
quarter.  Regarding business loans, large fractions of banks again reported having 
reduced spreads of rates on C&I loans over their cost of  funds, while much smaller 
fractions indicated that the premiums charge d on riskier loans had decreased.  Regarding 
credit policies on loans to households, a fe w banks reported having eased standards on 
prime residential mortgages, including a large bank that reported having eased 
considerably.  On a loan-weighted basis, dom estic banks indicated little change in their 
credit card lending standards and generally repo rted weaker demand for credit card loans.  
In contrast, standards and terms on auto lo ans reportedly were eased somewhat, while 
demand for such loans reportedl y continued to strengthen.  
M2 and its largest component, liquid depos its, expanded robustly  in December.  
Anectodal evidence suggests that at the end of  the year, in anticipat ion of the possibility 
of higher tax rates next year, investors sought to incur tax liabilities in 2012 rather than

  2013 and firms increased dividend payments to shareholders.  These actions likely 
contributed to the growth in liquid deposits in  December and played a role in the robust 
growth in retail money market funds over th e month.  The monetary base expanded at a 
13 percent annual rate in Decem ber, reflecting solid growth in currency and an increase 
in reserve balances.  The rise in reserve balanc es was due in part to the settlement of the 
Federal Reserve’s ongoing MBS purchases.

Appendix 
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, generally 
modest fractions of domestic banks reported having eased their standards across major loan 
categories over the fourth quarter on net.1  Larger fractions reporte dly had eased pricing terms on 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans over the p ast three months, and terms on some types of 
consumer loans also had been eased somewhat .  Respondent banks indicated that demand for 
business loans, prime residential mortgages, and auto loans had strengthened, on balance, while 
demand for other types of loans was about unchanged.  U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, which mainly lend to businesses, reported little change in their lending standards, while 
demand for their loans was reportedly stronger on net.  The January survey included a set of special questions on lending to and competition from banks headquartered in Europe as well as 
annual special questions on commercial real estate (CRE) lending policies and the outlook for 
asset quality in major loan categories during 2013. 
On balance, although domestic and forei gn respondents reported that standards on C&I 
loans were about unchanged over the past three months, domestic banks indicated that most C&I 
loan terms had been eased for firms of all sizes, reportedly in part because of increased 
competition for such loans.  On balance, r espondents reported that demand for C&I loans, 
especially from large and middle-market firms, had strengthened over the survey period.
2  Several 
banks noted that an important reason for this  strengthening in C&I loan demand was firms’ 
increased use of loans to finance payments to investors and employees ahead of year-end, driven 
by anticipated changes in tax policy.  CRE le nding standards reportedly remained about the same 
over the past three months while large fractions of domestic and foreign respondents experienced 
stronger demand for such loans on net.  In add ition, in their responses to an annual special 
question on CRE lending policies, banks indicated that they had eased some loan terms over the 
past 12 months.  
In response to a set of special questions  on lending to and competition from banks 
headquartered in Europe, respondents indicated that lending standards to European banks and 
                                                 
1 The January 2013 survey addressed changes in the supply of and demand for loans to businesses 
and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from 68 domestic banks 
and 22 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent  banks received the survey on or after 
December 27, 2012, and responses we re due by January 15, 2013.  
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of 
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased 
standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fractions of banks that reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.

more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

  their affiliates (hereafter, European banks) were  little changed over the previous three months, the 
first time that no net tightening was observed sin ce the inception of this special question in the 
October 2011 survey.  On balance, the demand for loans from European banks was reportedly 
unchanged.  
On the household side, a few domestic banks  reported having eased standards on prime 
residential mortgages over the past three months, on net, including a large bank that reported 
having eased such standards considerably.  On a portfolio-weighted basis, respondents reported 
that demand for prime residential mortgage loans had strengthened further on net.  According to 
portfolio-weighted responses, a modest fraction of banks had eased standards for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), on net, while demand w as reportedly unchanged.  A moderate fraction 
of respondents had eased standards on auto loans over the past three months, on net, while standards on credit card and other consumer loans had remained about unchanged.  On balance, 
banks reported having eased selected terms on cons umer loans other than credit card loans over 
the past three months.  A moderate fraction of  respondents reported weaker demand for credit 
card loans on a portfolio-weighted basis, while a large fraction indicated that demand for auto 
loans increased on net. 
A set of special questions regarding res pondents’ outlook for asset quality in 2013  
revealed that moderate to large net fractions of domestic banks expect improvements in credit 
quality in most major loan categories.   
LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending 
A modest fraction of domestic survey respondents, on net, indicated that their C&I 
lending standards had eased somewhat for all firm si zes over the past three months.  On balance, 
most loan terms were eased regardless of firm si ze, and none was tightened, but a large degree of 
variation in the extent of easing across different loan terms was evident.  Moderate to large 
fractions of banks again reported having reduced th e cost of credit lines, spreads of loan rates 
over their banks’ cost of funds, and the use of inte rest rate floors for all firm sizes.  Additionally, 
the net fraction of domestic banks reportedly easing policies on loan covenants for large and 
middle-market firms increased notably from the prev ious survey, to about 20 percent.  However, 
much smaller fractions had been indicating in recent surveys that the premiums charged on riskier loans have decreased and collateral requireme nts have reportedly changed little.  Of the 
respondents that reported having eased either standards or terms over the past three months, almost all cited more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as an important reason for having done so.  More over, the number of domestic banks citing  
more-aggressive competition as an important r eason for the change in their bank’s lending 
position has been increasing since the October 2011 su rvey.  As in the previous survey, no other 
reasons were broadl y cited as important.

  Moderate fractions of banks indicated st ronger demand for C&I loans by firms of all 
sizes, on net, and cited their customers’ increased  investment in plant or equipment and increased 
need to finance mergers or acquisitions and acc ounts receivable as the top reasons for increased 
loan demand.  Demand from large and middle-market  firms was notably stronger than that from 
small firms according to portfolio-weighted r esponses.  Several banks acknowledged tax-related 
distributions to investors and employees ahead of year-end as an important reason for 
strengthening loan demand.  Furthermore, inquiries from businesses about new or expanded 
credit lines reportedly changed little over the past three months, suggesting that the increase in 
C&I loans outstanding during the fourth quarter may have largely reflected draws on existing 
credit lines. 
Similar to the previous survey, branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that their 
C&I lending standards had remained about the same, on net, over the past three months.  A 
moderate net fraction of foreign respondents reported having reduced loan spreads over their cost 
of funds.  On balance, some foreign respondents also reportedly eased their policies on the size of 
credit lines.  Maximum loan maturity was the onl y category for which a modest net fraction of 
foreign respondents reported having tightened.  As  was true for domestic respondents, the reason 
most widely cited by foreign respondents for easing standards or terms was more-aggressive competition from other lenders.  Some foreign res pondents also pointed to a more favorable or 
less uncertain economic outlook and increased liquid ity in the secondary ma rket for C&I loans as 
reasons for easing standards or terms.  About 20 percent of foreign respondents reported stronger demand for C&I loans, on net, over the past three months, the highest fraction observed among those respondents since the July 2011 survey.  A few foreign respondents deemed their customers’ increased merger or acquisition financing needs as a very important reason for 
stronger demand. 
Special Questions on Lending to and Competition from European Banks 
The January survey again included special questions about lending to European banks.  
On balance, only about 10 percent of domestic respondents reported that their standards for loans 
to European banks had tightened over the past three months, the smallest net fraction observed 
since the introduction of this special question in the October 2011 survey.  Furthermore, foreign 
respondents indicated that their standards on su ch loans were essentially unchanged, which was 
also the first time in the survey  that such standards had not reportedly been tightened on net.  As 
in the October 2012 survey, domestic banks reported that they had experienced little change in demand for loans from European banks.   
The share of domestic banks that have observed an expansion of C&I lending business as 
a result of a decrease in competition from European banks continued to trend down.  After 
responses were weighted by outstanding C&I loans, about one-third of domestic banks indicated that they had experienced a decrease in compe tition from European banks that had resulted in 
some increase in business at their institution.  Most of the remaining domestic respondents that 
compete with European banks reported having ex perienced a decrease in competition from such 
institutions, but the decrease did not appreciably boost their business.

  Questions on Commercial Real Estate Lending 
A modest net fraction of domestic respondents to the January survey reported that they 
had eased standards on CRE loans over the previous three months and a large share indicated that 
demand for such loans had increased.  Overall, the continued strengthening in demand for CRE 
loans in recent surveys has corresponded with a gradual slowing in the pace of runoff in CRE 
loans on domestic banks’ books.  
On balance, foreign respondents reported simi lar trends in CRE lending conditions in the 
fourth quarter; a small fraction indicated that they had eased lending standards and a large 
fraction reportedly experienced stronger demand for CRE loans. 
Annual Question on Commercia l Real Estate Loan Terms 
The January survey also included a special question regarding changes in lending policies 
for CRE loans over the past year  (repeated annually since 2001).  During the past 12 months, on 
net, several domestic banks reportedly had eased policies regarding the maximum size and 
maturity of CRE loans and many had reduced the sp reads on such loans.  In particular, compared 
with the responses from last year, there was a notable increase in the net fraction of respondents 
reporting having increased maximum loan maturity.  However, banks indicated no change in their 
policies for debt service coverage ratios or loan -to-value ratios, which reportedly still have not 
been eased since the height of the financial cr isis.  Foreign respondents also indicated that 
policies on maximum loan size and spreads for CRE  loans were eased somewhat, on balance, and 
those on other terms were about unchanged. 
LENDING TO HOUSEHOLDS  
Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending 
A few domestic banks reported having eased standards on prime residential mortgages, 
including a large bank that reported having eased such standards considerably.  When responses 
were weighted by outstanding closed-end mortgages on the respondents’ books, the net fraction 
of banks that reported an increase in demand fo r prime residential mortgage loans remained 
substantial, though slightly below its level in the previous survey.3  In contrast, standards for 
nontraditional mortgages were reportedly little ch anged and weighted responses continued to 
indicate that demand for such mortgages dec lined.  According to the portfolio-weighted 
responses, a modest fraction of banks had eased standards for HELOCs, on net, while demand for 
such loans was reportedly unchanged.4 
                                                 
3 Although the survey instructs respondents to exclude refinancing from their considerations about 
demand for residential mortgages, responses to the query about changes in demand may have been 
influenced by the volume of refinance applications that banks received over the past three months.   
4 Unweighted responses indicate no change in standards and a modest weakening in demand for 
such loans on balance.

  Questions on Consumer Lending 
Responses from domestic banks indicated that  they had again eased standards on auto 
loans over the past three months.  However, st andards on credit card loans were reportedly little 
changed, whereas banks had been reporting a ne t easing of standards on such loans in recent 
surveys.  Standards on other consumer loans also were little changed.  On balance, several banks 
reported that they had reduced spreads on consumer loans other than credit card loans.  A modest 
fraction of banks also reported having increased the maximum maturity of auto loans on net.  
Other terms for consumer loans were little  changed over the past three months. 
On a portfolio-weighted basis, banks reporte d moderately weaker demand for credit card 
loans, on net, in contrast to the moderate ne t strengthening of demand reported in the previous 
survey.  Demand for auto loans and other consumer loans reportedly increased on balance. 
ANNUAL QUESTIONS ON ASSET QUALITY EXPECTATIONS  
The January survey contained a set of special questions on respondents’ expectations for 
loan quality in 2013 (repeated annually since 2006).  Overall, large fracti ons of domestic banks, 
on net, expected improvements in delinquency and charge-off rates during 2013 for most loan categories included in the survey, assuming th at economic activity progresses in line with 
consensus forecasts.  Expectations for improvement in most loan categories were in line with the 
corresponding responses from a year ago with the exception of C&I loans, for which a smaller 
fraction of banks expected improvement in credit quality in 2013.   
Regarding the outlook for the quality of bus iness loans, about 40 percent of domestic 
banks, on net, reportedly expect delinquency and charge-off rates on their C&I loans to all sizes 
of firms to decline in 2013.  While still considerable, these res ponses indicate a less widespread 
expected improvement in the quality of C&I loan s relative to the 2012 survey, consistent with 
already very low delinquency and charge-off rates on such loans by historical standards.  Similar 
to last year, about 55 percent of domestic banks indicated that they expect improvement in the 
quality of CRE loans in 2013.  Turning to foreign respondents, about 20 percent, on net, 
anticipate improvement in the quality of C&I loans to large and middle-market firms this year.  
Meanwhile, about 45 percent of foreign respondent s forecast improvement in the quality of CRE 
loans, on balance, a sizable increase from the 25 percent that reportedly expected improvement 
last year. 
About 45 percent of domestic banks exp ect the delinquency and charge-off rates on 
prime and nontraditional residential real estate lo ans to improve in 2013, on net, about the same 
fractions reported in last year’s survey.  None of the six banks that responded to the question on 
subprime residential real estate loans expected a change in the quality of such loans in 2013.  
Expectations for improvements this year in the quality of HELOCs stayed roughly the same as last year, with about one-third of the respondent s anticipating an improvement in the quality of 
such loans.  The discrepancy between respondent s’ expectations of improvements in the quality 
of residential real estate loans and HELOCs in last January’s survey and the observed

 delinquency and charge-off rates for such loans in 2012 may, in part, be attributed to widespread 
mortgage putbacks by GSEs, reported delays in the foreclosure process in many states, and 
changes in regulatory guidance on junior lien loan lo ss allowances.  As the effects of these factors 
dissipate, the expected improvements in the qualit y of residential real estate loans and HELOCs 
may prove to be more aligned with actual changes in delinquency and charge-off rates for such 
loans in 2013.      
Among major loan categories, domestic banks were least likely to expect improvement in 
the quality of consumer loans in 2013.  Only about 10 percent of banks, on net, expected 
improvement in credit card loans, and similar frac tions projected improvement in auto and other 
consumer loans.  However, the current credit qualit y of these types of loans appears to be high.  
According to Call Report data available through th e third quarter of 2012, the aggregate rate of 
credit card delinquencies reached a historical low for the period on record since 1991, and 
delinquency rates for other consumer loans are near their historical averages over the 
corresponding period.  Moreover, charge-off rates fo r these types of loans are near or below their 
pre-recession levels.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of th e staff’s models.  The first 
two scenarios examine risks to the supply side.  In particular, the first scenario assumes 
that the natural rate of unemployment declines  to a greater extent than we have assumed 
in the baseline because discouraged workers are leaving the workforce permanently.  The 
second scenario explores a different way to ra tionalize a more rapid near-term decline in 
the unemployment rate, namely that potential GDP is growing less rapidly because of 
weaker structural productivity growth in both th e recent past and in the future.  The third 
scenario focuses on the risk that a near-term increase in actual inflat ion could feed into 
higher inflation expectations, re sulting in inflation that is persistently ab ove the FOMC’s 
longer-run objective through the rest of the decade.  The next two scenarios focus on 
contrasting risks to domestic spending—f irst, that we have underestimated the 
persistence of the headwinds restraining the recovery and, second, that a strong recovery 
in residential construction and house prices will spark broad improvements in the overall 
economy.  The final two scenarios consider downside and upside risks to the domestic 
economy from foreign economic developments—f irst, that the European crisis could 
intensify with severe spillovers to th e U.S. economy and, second, that the pace of 
economic growth abroad could increase more rapidly than assumed in the baseline.   
We generate the first five scenarios us ing the FRB/US model and the last two 
scenarios using the multicountry SIGMA model.   In the FRB/US simulations, we use an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, subject to the th resholds for the unemployment 
rate and inflation announced by the FOMC  following its December 2012 meeting.  For 
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly si milar policy rule, subject to the same 
unemployment and inflation thresholds but em ploying an alternative concept of resource 
utilization.1  In these scenarios, we have assumed that the size and composition of the 
SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.   
                                                 
1 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack  equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

Lower Natural Rate  
Over the past several quarters, the unem ployment rate has declined somewhat 
faster than we had expect ed despite relatively subdued output growth.  The Tealbook 
projection attributes only a sma ll part of this surprise to a somewhat earlier decline of the 
natural rate than we had previously anticip ated.  In this scenario, we consider the 
possibility that the natural rate of unemployment started to decline substantially earlier 
and more rapidly than assumed in the baseli ne, and that it will r each 5¼ percent by late 
2013—several years earlier than in the baseline .  However, the more rapid decline in the 
natural rate is assumed to reflect not an improvement in labor market functioning, but 
rather a greater number of the long-term unemployed permanently leaving the labor 
force.  The combination of a more rapidly falling natural rate and a steeper downward 
trend in labor force participation implies li ttle change in potential labor input—and thus 
only a small revision from the baseline in potential GDP—through 2015.2  Under these 
conditions, real GDP and employment fall s lightly relative to th e baseline, but the 
unemployment rate falls more quickly b ecause more of the long-term unemployed 
become discouraged and leave the labor force permanently.  As a result, the unemployment rate falls below its threshold value in mid-2015, and so the federal funds 
rate reverts to the prescriptions of the inertia l Taylor rule and begins  to rise one quarter 
earlier than in the baseline.   
Supply-Side Damage  
Another possible explana tion for the surprisingly rapid decline in the 
unemployment rate during 2012 is  that potential GDP has been expanding more slowly 
than the staff estimates, perhaps because the financial crisis caused  greater structural 
damage than the staff has assumed.  This scenario assumes that the current level of potential output is actually 1 percent lower than in the baseline because of  smaller-than-estimated gains in structural produ ctivity over the past few years, and that 
these smaller gains will conti nue, shaving 0.3 percentage poi nt off the average annual 
growth rate of potential GDP going forward.  As a result, real GDP rises only 2¾ percent 
per year, on average, in 2013 and 2014, and economic growth remains below baseline 
throughout the simulation period.  Given the downward revision to potential output in 
2012 and beyond in this scenario, Okun’s law implies a more rapid decline in the 
unemployment rate than in the ba seline.  Inflation runs above baseline later in the decade, 
                                                 
2 Alternatively, the natural rate of unemploymen t could decline, reflecting an improvement in 
labor market functioning.  In this case, the natural rate would fall but labor fo rce participation would not, 
resulting in higher potential output.

reflecting both the direct effect of lower pr oductivity on firms’ costs and a smaller margin 
of slack.  With the unemployment rate falli ng below its threshold value in mid-2015, the 
federal funds rate lifts off one quart er earlier than in the baseline. 
Unanchored Expectations 
In recent years, inflation has sometimes spiked on account of sharp increases in 
the prices of oil, other commodities, or imported goods, but these developments have 
proved to be temporary as longer-term inflati on expectations have re mained stable.  In 
this scenario, consumer prices rise si gnificantly, pushing headline inflation up to 
3¼ percent by 2014.  But in this case, long-run inflation expectations  become unmoored, 
possibly facilitated by a loss of confidence associated with th e large and expanding 
Federal Reserve balance sheet and a misinterpr etation of the Committee’s stated intention 
of keeping monetary policy highly accommodativ e for a period of time after the recovery 
has strengthened.  As a result, both headline and core inflation r un substantially above 
baseline for several years, and projected inflation one-to-two y ears ahead exceeds the  
2½ percent threshold in early 2014, prompting a liftoff of the federal funds rate under the 
inertial Taylor rule.  The federal funds rate then rises steeply and remains above baseline 
until late 2017.  Yields on Treasury securitie s and corporate bonds rise in response to 
both higher expected short-term interest rates and an assumed increase in inflation risk 
premiums.  Real GDP rises only 2¾ percen t per year, on average, in 2013 and 2014 
because of these tighter financial conditi ons, and growth remains below baseline 
throughout the simulation period. 
Headwinds  
In this scenario, the unfavorable ba seline assumptions for foreign economic 
conditions and credit availabi lity, the remaining uncertainty  about the fiscal outlook, and 
the dysfunction in the mortgage lending market turn out to have a more restrictive effect 
on aggregate demand than anticipated in the baseline.  As a result, the pace of the 
recovery does not pick up:  Real GDP rise s only 2½ percent per year, on average, in 2013 
and 2014, and growth remains below baseline until late 2016.  The unemployment rate 
runs about a percentage point  above its baseline trajecto ry from mid-2015 through 2017.  
Because margins of resource slack remain high, inflation stays close to 1½ percent 
through late 2015.  With inflation persisten tly below the FOMC’s longer-run objective

and the unemployment rate far above its natural rate, the federal funds rate remains at its 
effective lower bound until mid-2017, almost two years longer than in the baseline.3 
Housing-Led Recovery 
The increases in house prices, housing star ts, and home sales seen over the past 
year may be pointing to a more robust recovery  in the housing market than is assumed in 
the baseline.  In this scenar io, the stronger housing recovery, along with  the resolution of 
some of the uncertainty pervading the economic environment, spark a cycle of increased 
consumer and business confidence, faster hi ring, and improved financial conditions that 
leads to stronger spending by households and firm s.  As a result, real GDP rises at an 
average annual rate of 4¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, and the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent in early 2014 and below 5¼ percent by mid-2015.  Upward pressure on 
inflation is initially tempered by the effects of increased capital investment on labor 
productivity and unit labor costs.  But, with less resource slack, unit labor costs eventually rise more rapidly than in the base line, and inflation is slightly above 2 percent 
in 2015 and 2016.  In response to higher infla tion and the stronger pace of real activity, 
the federal funds rate lifts off in early 2014 and stays higher than in the baseline.   
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers  
In this scenario, the improvements witne ssed in European financial markets over 
the past few months are assumed to be shor t-lived, and Europe plunges into a bout of 
severe stress, much worse than seen to date during this crisis.  While we think that the 
likelihood of such an outcome has declined somewhat in recent months, it could still occur, possibly triggered by a disorderly s overeign default, the failure of a large 
European financial institution, or a loss of  confidence by the public in the ability of 
European governments to resolve the crisis.  In this scenario, the greater stress prompts 
both private and most sovereign borrowing costs in Europe to soar, with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above baseline; in addition, th e confidence of European 
households and businesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe declines about 8 percent 
                                                 
3 As noted earlier, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio in these 
alternative scenarios are the same as in the baseline.  However, if the recovery were to prove as anemic as 
shown in the “Headwinds” scenario, the FOMC might choose to purchase a larger amount of securities than 
assumed in the baseline.  One ad ho c way to account for this possibility might be to assume that the FOMC 
continues adding to its SOMA portfolio through late this year, increasing the amount of purchases in 2013 by $500 billion relative to the baseline.  FRB/US simulations as well as judgmental assessments of the effect of large-scale asset purchases on the econ omy suggest that these purchases would lower the 
unemployment rate by slightly less than ¼ percentage point by late 2015 relative to the “Headwinds” scenario.  Similar considerations could apply to all of the scenarios.

relative to the baseline by th e second half of 2014, despit e a 25 percent depreciation of 
the real effective exchange value of the eur o.  Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have 
important financial and economic spillovers to the rest of the world, including the United 
States.  U.S. economic activity contracts sh arply, as U.S. corporate bond spreads rise 
more than 300 basis points, equity prices pl unge, credit availability is restricted, and 
household and business confidence erodes.  In  addition, weaker foreign economic activity 
and the stronger exchange value of the dollar de press U.S. net exports.  In all, because of 
greater resource slack and lowe r import prices, total U.S. co nsumer prices fall in 2013, 
before beginning to rise in 2014 as economic act ivity starts to recover.  U.S. real GDP  
falls 1½ percent this year and increases only 1¼ percent in 2014.  The unemployment rate 
rises to 9½ percent in 2014 and then graduall y declines.  With inflationary pressures 
subdued and the unemployment rate above its 6½ percent threshold value until late 2018, 
the federal funds rate does not lift off from its effective lower bound until 2019.   
Faster Recovery Abroad 
In this scenario, output growth across our major trading partners turns out to be 
stronger than anticipated, as favorable polic y developments in the United States and 
Europe and the strengthening of global economic activity envisaged in our forecast contribute to a more rapid return of consum er and investor confid ence.  Specifically, 
foreign output expands about 1½ percentage po ints faster than the baseline pace through 
late 2014, as sentiment improves and corporate ri sk spreads fall about 100 basis points; in 
addition, the broad real dollar depreciates abou t 5 percent relative to the baseline because 
of a faster reversal of both safe-haven fl ows and monetary accommodation abroad.  The 
stronger foreign activity and the weaker dollar st imulate U.S. real net exports.  All told, 
U.S. real GDP rises 3½ percent in 2013, about  ¾ percentage points faster than in the 
baseline, while the unemployment rate falls  to about 6½ percent by late 2014.  Higher 
import prices and stronger activity boost core PCE inflation to close to 2 percent in 2013 
and 2014.  The policy rule does not call for a liftoff until the third quarter of 2015, one 
quarter earlier than in the baseline, even though the unemployment threshold is crossed 
three quarters earlier.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
