Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The economic data we have received sin ce the January Tealbook have mostly met 
or exceeded our expectations.  In the labor market, payroll employment gains in the past 
few months have been somewhat larger  than we had anticipated, while the 
unemployment rate edged down, on balance, mu ch as we had projected.  The incoming 
data on private spending have al so been a little stronger, on net, than we expected.  By 
contrast, the fact that the Congress has allowed the federa l spending sequestration to go 
into effect suggests that fiscal policy w ill weigh on near-term economic growth by more 
than we had assumed in the January Tealbook.  In all, real GDP is now projected to rise 
at an annual rate of 2¾ per cent in the current quarter, th e same as in the January 
Tealbook, but then to step down to a 1¾ percen t pace in the second quarter as cuts in 
federal government purchases deepen.   
 Our medium-term projection for real ac tivity is essentially unchanged from the 
January Tealbook, with real GDP projected to rise 2½ percent this year, 3¼ percent in 
2014, and 3½ percent in 2015.  The additional dr ag from the greater degree of fiscal 
consolidation and higher foreign exchange valu e of the dollar in the current forecast is 
offset by higher projected equity and house pr ices, positive momentum from the recent 
spending data, and a stronger outlook for do mestic oil production.  As in previous 
projections, the mild accelerati on in output that we project to occur over the medium term 
reflects the anticipated waning of a number of headwinds that have been restraining 
growth in the past few years, including the economic and fis cal situation in Europe and 
restrictive fiscal policy here at home; at the same time, we continue to anticipate that 
monetary policy will remain  highly accommodative and that household and business 
sentiment will improve. 
 In line with the gradual pickup in  economic activity, we expect the 
unemployment rate to decline from 7¾ percent in  the first quarter of this year to about 
6¼ percent at the end of 2015.  Thus, at the end of 2015, the unemployment rate is still 
projected to be ½ percentage point above its natural rate.  In this respect as well, our 
current forecast is very sim ilar to the January Tealbook.   
On net, readings on consumer prices have  come in close to our expectations.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following the 
December FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the staff economic 
projection since the December Tealbook.
The staff projections for both real GDP growth and inflation through 2015 are essentially 
unrevised since December and continue to show a gradual strengthening of economic 
growth with inflation remaining below, but edging toward, the FOMC’s long-run objective of 
2 percent. The projection for the unemployment rate is revised down throughout the 
medium term, largely reflecting the downward surprise in the unemployment rate since the 
December Tealbook, which we have allowed to persist. Nonetheless, significant slack 
remains even at the end of 2015.
The staff projection for GDP growth over the longer run has been revised a little lower since 
December to be better aligned with our long-run projections for growth of the population 
and structural multifactor productivity. This lower expected rate of GDP growth over the 
long run shows through, essentially one-for-one, to our estimate of the equilibrium federal 
funds rate.
The baseline path for the federal funds rate in the current projection is set in a manner 
consistent with the quantitative thresholds described in the Committee’s statement 
following the December meeting; in the December forecast, the path of the federal funds 
rate was tied to the date-based forward guidance then in force. Nevertheless, the federal 
funds rate trajectory is essentially unrevised since December and continues to envision the 
federal funds rate moving above its effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2015.

  relatively small movements in commodity and im port prices, we continue to expect core 
inflation to remain subdued.  In response to  the gradual reduction in resource slack that 
we anticipate over the medium term, core PC E inflation is expected to inch up from 
1.6 percent in 2013 to 1.7 percent in both 2014 and 2015, unchanged from the January 
Tealbook.1  Total PCE inflation is projected to ru n a little below core inflation throughout 
the projection period as energy pr ices decrease, in line with the path of futures prices for 
oil. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Our monetary policy assumptions are unc hanged in this Tealbook.  Because our 
medium-term projections for the unemployment rate and inflation are close to the ones 
we presented in January, our implementa tion of the Committee’s threshold-based 
guidance continues to result in the federal funds rate lifting off from its effective zero 
lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2015.  For now, we have also maintained our 
January assumptions for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In particular, we continue 
to assume the FOMC will cease its current LSAP program this June, bringing the 
cumulative net purchases since December to $500 billion.2 
Other Interest Rates 
Since the January Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased about 
20 basis points to just over 2 pe rcent, a little more than we had anticipated.  Nonetheless, 
the projected path of the yield is little ch anged from the January Tealbook; we continue 
to expect it to increase steadily to about 4 percent by the end of  2015.  This projected 
increase primarily reflects the movement of the 10-year valua tion window through the 
period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual waning of the effects of 
the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.  We also still allow for some upward pressure on the 
10-year Treasury yield as investors move to ward our assumption that the Federal Reserve 
will purchase fewer securities th an they currently anticipate. 
                                                 
1 The February reading on the consumer price i ndex will be published at the end of this week. 
2 For reference, had we assumed instead that the Federal Reserve would purchase another 
$250 billion of longer-term securities over the second half  of this year but keep the path of the federal funds 
rate unchanged through 2017, we would have trimmed our projection for the level of the unemployment 
rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 about 0.1 percentage point and marked  up our forecast for consumer price 
inflation in 2015 a few basis points.

   Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have moved up about 25 basis points 
since the January Tealbook, leaving their sp reads to yields on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities a touch wider.  We have carried the slightly higher bond spread 
through the next several quarters,  but we still expect the spr ead to narrow gradually over 
the forecast period, ending 2015 almost ½ percen tage point below its current level.  
Conventional 30-year mortgage rates have  increased about 25 basis points and are 
expected to move up about in line with benchmark Treasury yields, which would take 
them from their current level of about 3½ pe rcent to about 5½ percent by the end of 2015. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Broad indexes of U.S. stock prices ha ve climbed about 4 percent since the 
January Tealbook, a higher gain than we had an ticipated.  We continue to expect equity 
prices to rise at an aver age annual rate of close to 9 percent through the end of 2015, 
resulting in a higher projected pa th of stock prices this round. 
Recent readings on home prices have on ce again been stronger than we had 
expected, leading us to revise up our forecast for the level of hous e prices significantly 
throughout the projection period.  The recent larg e price increases appear to have been 
related to tight supply conditions in many local  markets.  We expect these conditions to 
persist this year and now forecast house prices to rise 8 percent in 2013, about the same 
as the increase seen in 2012.  In 2014 and 2015, we expect increases in house prices to slow to an average pace of just under 4 per cent as a step-up in construction adds to 
supply and higher mortgage rates weigh on housing affordability.  At the end of 2015, the 
projected level of house prices  is about 5 percen t higher than in th e January Tealbook. 
Fiscal Policy 
We have changed our assumptions regard ing how the spending sequestration will 
play out.  In January, we a ssumed that the Congress and the Administration would forge 
a compromise that would eliminate all of the effects of the sequestration in 2013 and 
replace it with much more gr adual deficit-reduction policies in later years.  While the 
ultimate disposition of the sequestration rema ins highly uncertain, it now appears likely 
that there will be more fiscal restraint this  year than we had previously thought.  As a 
result, we have incorporated a “modified sequester” into our forecast:  We assume that 
fiscal policymakers will reach a compromise  that reduces spending in 2013 and 2014 by 
half of the amount that would occur if the full sequestration is left in place.  We continue 
to assume additional tightening in 2015.

  With these new assumptions, fiscal policy at all levels of government is projected 
to restrain the rate of real GDP grow th in 2013 by 1 percentage point (excluding 
multiplier effects)—about ¼ percentage point more than in the January Tealbook.3  We 
continue to forecast that the fiscal restra int on growth of aggregate demand will decrease 
to ½ percentage point in 2014 and to ¼ percentage point in  2015.  As a result of policy 
actions to reduce the deficit and the impr oving economy, the federal budget deficit, 
which was 7 percent of GDP ($1.1 trillion) in fiscal year 2012, is projected to fall to 
4¾ percent of GDP this fiscal year, a nd to 2¾ percent of GDP in fiscal 2015. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP rose at an unexpectedly weak 2 percent p ace in the fourth 
quarter.  Growth was disappointing in most  advanced foreign economies, with output 
contracting in Europe.  By contrast, the e xpansion of output growth in emerging market 
economies exceeded our expectations.  Weak  incoming data on the advanced economies 
in the current quarter and some increased fi nancial stresses in Eu rope following Italy’s 
inconclusive parliamentary election have led us to mark down total foreign growth a little 
over the forecast period.  However, we anticipa te that financial conditions in Europe will 
resume their progress toward normalization—a  development that, along with diminishing 
fiscal drag and accommodative monetary policy, is projected to help end the euro area’s 
recession and lift overall foreign growth to 3 percent this year, 3¼ percent in 2014, and 
3½ percent in 2015. 
Since the time of the Janua ry Tealbook, the nominal exchange value of the dollar 
has appreciated almost 2 percent, with larg er gains against advanced-economy currencies 
than those in emerging market s.  The Japanese yen deprec iated about 8 percent against 
the dollar, as the nomination of Haruhiko Kuroda  to lead the Bank of Japan reinforced the 
view that aggressive moneta ry policy action is forthcomi ng.  In addition, both the euro 
and the pound depreciated markedly as readi ngs on activity came in weak, expectations 
for further monetary accommodation increa sed, and financial stresses in Europe 
intensified after the Italian election.  We assu me that the dollar will depreciate in real 
terms at an annual rate of  2¾ percent through the end of  2015, reflecting the gradual 
abatement of European financial stresses—wh ich should relieve safe-haven pressure on 
                                                 
3 If a compromise is not reached and the full se questration remains in place, we would expect an 
additional drag on real GDP growth of ¼ percentage point and the unemployment rate to be 0.1 percentage 
point higher in 2013.

  the dollar—and the trend declin e of the dollar against emergi ng market currencies.  The 
broad real dollar averages just over 1½ percent higher over the forecast period than in the 
January Tealbook. 
Oil and Other Comm odity Prices  
After rising through mid-February, crude oi l prices fell back in recent weeks on 
growing concern over the strength of global demand.  The spot price of Brent crude oil 
closed at about $110 per barrel on March 12, down  about $2 from the time of the January 
Tealbook.  The projected path for the price of imported o il is also down by about the 
same amount on average.  From this lower leve l, the price of imported oil is projected to 
remain fairly steady for the remainder of this ye ar and then to decrease  slowly in the next 
two years, consistent with futures prices.  Th is downward trajectory is likely due, in part, 
to expectations of increased crude produc tion in the United States and Canada.   
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has moved down since the time of the 
January Tealbook, partly as the global supply of agricultural products appears to have 
been less restricted by last summer’s drought th an market participants originally feared.  
Metals prices also edged down, on net, largel y reflecting concerns over the strength of 
Chinese demand.  We project that nonfuel co mmodity prices will remain relatively flat 
through 2015, a path about in line with quotes from futures markets. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We currently expect real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the 
current quarter—unrevised from the January Tealbook.  This pace of growth is boosted by the assumed recovery in agricultural pr oduction and a hurricane-related bounceback. 
In the second quarter, growth slows to a 1¾ percent pace as these impulses fade and the 
spending cuts associated with the modified sequestration kick in.  The adjustment to 
fiscal spending accounts for most of the ½ pe rcentage point downward revision to our 
second quarter forecast relative  to the January Tealbook.   
Household Spending 
We project that real PCE w ill rise at an annual rate of 2 percent in the current 
quarter, up about ¼ percentage point from the January Tealbook.  Based on retail sales 
and motor vehicle sales through February, PC E appears to be holding up reasonably well 
in the face of January’s increase in payroll and income tax rates.  We continue to expect 
households’ gradual adjustment to the lower level of disposable income to weigh on

  consumer spending in the near term.  Neverthe less, real PCE is expected to move up at a 
2½ percent pace in the second quarter as the gr owing drag from the tax increases is more 
than offset by rising employment and wealth.4    
In the housing market, the incoming data on starts and sales continue to be 
consistent with a gradual recovery.  At the same time, the number of homes for sale has 
fallen considerably, bringing inventories of  both new and existing homes to very low 
levels by historical standards.  The limited supply of homes for sale is likely due to 
several factors, including underwater borrowers ’ reluctance to sell, a slowing in the flow 
of foreclosed properties coming to the market, and the still-low level of new construction.  
All told, as in the January T ealbook, we project single-family st arts to rise further in the 
near term, in line with continued gradual increases in demand. 
Tight mortgage credit and concerns about future labor market conditions appear 
to have fueled demand for rental units, lead ing to falling vacancy rates and rising rents in 
the multifamily sector.  Multifamily starts and permits have nearly recovered to their pre-
crisis levels, and we expect to see furthe r growth in this sector as the supportive 
fundamentals persist. 
Business Investment 
Orders and shipments of nondefense cap ital goods excludi ng aircraft have 
continued to recover from a w eak patch in the summer of last year.  New orders surged 
almost 10 percent (not at an annual rate) over the three mont hs ending in January and the 
level of new orders is now above shipments, suggesting that shipments will remain on an upward trajectory in coming months.  Forwar d-looking indicators of  business investment 
are also consistent with a pickup in real in vestment in equipment and software (E&S) in 
the first half of this year relative to the second ha lf of last year.  For example, the ISM 
surveys have shown some improvement of la te, and analysts’ earnings expectations for 
capital goods producers have turn ed more positive since December.  Overall, we forecast 
real business spending on E&S to step up to a gr owth rate of 5¾ percent in the first half 
of this year, somewhat faster than in the January Tealbook. 
                                                 
4 Our forecast for real disposable personal income ju mps in the fourth quarter and falls back in the 
first quarter, largely owing to the BEA’s estimate that  some dividends and bonuses were paid early in 
anticipation of tax increases beginning in 2013.  We  expect consumers to smooth through this income 
volatility and do not expect it to have a large effect on consumption.

  Our estimate of nonresidential investment in the fourth quarter was revised up 
substantially, as new source data revealed a rush of constructi on outlays in anticipation of 
the possible expiration of a tax cr edit for wind power structures.5  We have revised down 
our forecast for the level of spending in the first quarter accordingly.  Excluding the 
power sector, recent data suggest a mode st improvement in nonresidential building 
investment in the first half of this year that is consistent with our January Tealbook 
forecast.  Nevertheless, high vacancy rates a nd low commercial real estate prices should 
continue to weigh on investment.  Moreove r, although financing conditions for existing 
commercial real estate have improved, th ey remain tight for new construction. 
Inventories appear fairly we ll aligned with sales in mo st sectors, and our near-
term inventory forecast is largely unrevised on net.  Estimates from the staff’s flow-of-
goods system and indicators of inventory sen timent from the ISM through February show 
no evidence of sizable inventory imbalances .  Consequently, real nonfarm inventory 
investment is expected to be roughly neutral fo r real GDP growth in th e first half of this 
year.  In the farm sector, real  inventory investment is exp ected to boost real GDP growth 
by ¾ percentage point in the fi rst quarter, as farm output re turns to normal after having 
been held down by the drought in the second half of last year.  We expect this impetus to 
growth to disappear in  the second quarter. 
Government 
Improvements in state and local governm ent budgets are reducing the pressure on 
these jurisdictions to cut their purchases.  Ov erall, we expect their real purchases to 
decrease only a little in the fi rst half of 2013.  Nevertheless, this projection is somewhat 
softer than in the January Tealbook due to weaker-than-expected incoming data on state 
and local construction spending and employment so far this quarter.  
We now project total real federal purchases to contract at an annual rate of 
2 percent in the current quarte r, a decline that is a little smaller than in the January 
Tealbook due to incoming data on defense sp ending.  We do not expect real federal 
purchases in the first quarter to be material ly affected by the spe nding sequestration that 
began on March 1 because most agencies ha ve reportedly delayed furloughs and other 
                                                 
5 The tax credit was extended as part of the “fiscal cliff” deal.  The new data on construction 
outlays were released after the publication of the second  estimate of the NIPA.  We expect the revised data 
to boost the published figure for fourth-quarter r eal GDP growth ¼ percentage point when they are 
incorporated into the third estimate.

  cost-cutting measures until the second quarter .  But in the second quarter, we project 
purchases to drop at an annual rate of 11 percent as our assumed “modified 
sequestration” takes effect.  The pattern of  federal spending in the near term is 
particularly uncertain because we have li ttle evidence on which to base our judgment 
about how quickly agencies will adjust their spending to lowe r funding levels.   
Foreign Trade  
Real exports of goods and services are pr ojected to rebound in the current quarter 
after having fallen in the four th quarter, supported by the co ntinued robust expansion of 
the emerging market economies.  Our forecast fo r export growth of about 5 percent in the 
first half of the year is li ttle changed, on balance, from  the January Tealbook, although 
we shifted some exports from the first quarter  to the second to account for delivery delays 
at Boeing as the company works to correct problems with the 787 Dreamliner.  Real 
imports of goods and services are expected to  grow at an average rate of 3¼ percent in 
the first half of this year, consistent w ith the projected pace of expansion in U.S. 
economic activity.  This forecast is a little lower than the January Tealbook projection, 
reflecting both the markdown to U.S. growth  and a lower projection for oil imports.  
Overall, we expect net exports to be a slight positive for grow th in the first half of this 
year.     
The Industrial Sector 
We project manufacturing output  to rise at an annual rate  of 7 percent in the first 
quarter, partly supported by activity related to  the recovery from Hurricane Sandy.  Near-
term indicators, although mixed, have improve d somewhat and also point to moderate 
gains in the first half of this year.  In particular, the new orders index from the ISM 
manufacturing survey rose in February to its highest level since April 2011, and the 
three-month moving average of the staff’s estim ate of real adjusted durable goods orders 
increased 1 percent in January.   
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The contour of the medium-term projection for real GDP growth is similar to the 
one in the January Tealbook, as the eff ects of changes to our key conditioning 
assumptions have been offsetting on net.  On  the downside, we now expect fiscal policy 
to impose more restraint on economic growth  than we projected in January, and the 
upward revision to the exchange value of the dollar is anticipated to hold down exports.

  On the upside, though, we have marked up our forecasts for house prices and the stock 
market, and revised down slightly our projecti on for oil prices.  In addition, we have 
upgraded our outlook for domestic oil production in the medium term considerably, as we 
have taken on board the Department of En ergy’s view that domestic oil production is 
likely to continue increasing over the next few years. 
All told, real GDP is now projected to e xpand 2½ percent this year, a modest step 
up from the 1¾ percent pace of last year.6  Our forecast then calls for growth in real GDP 
to move up a little further to an averag e pace of 3½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  In an 
environment of highly accommodative moneta ry policy, this gradual acceleration is 
supported by an easing of a number of headwinds  that have restrained growth in the past 
several years.  In particular, we expect the restraint from fe deral fiscal policy to diminish 
after this year.  Also, European financia l and economic conditions are projected to 
improve gradually over the next several ye ars, supporting an acceleration in exports.  
Moreover, lenders should gradually increase th e availability of mortgage credit to a 
broader range of homebuyers as capacity  constraints ease over time and regulatory 
uncertainty around mortgage finance is reduc ed.  In sum, these developments are 
expected to lead to a growing sense among households and firms that threats to the recovery have diminished, which should, in turn, help lower asset risk premiums and 
boost consumer and business confidence, contributing to greater household consumption as well as business inve stment and hiring.   
The sector where the projected pickup in  economic activity is most evident is 
consumer spending.  Real PCE is expected to rise 2½ percent this year before stepping up 
to 3¼ percent in 2014 and 3¾ percent in 2015.  We anticipate that th is acceleration will 
be supported by rising disposable incomes (s temming from ongoing improvements in the 
labor market) and improving consumer confidence as well as by increases in household wealth.  The projected path of real PCE is little changed, on net, from the January 
Tealbook.  
Smaller declines in government purchases  also contribute to the projected 
acceleration in real GDP after th is year.  In particular, we expect the drag from federal 
government purchases to wane over the forecast period as the pace of fiscal consolidation 
                                                 
6 About half of this pr ojected acceleration is due to the dr ought and Hurricane Sa ndy, which held 
down real GDP in 2012 and is exp ected to boost growth in 2013 as damaged equipment and structures are 
replaced and as farm output comes back to normal.

  slows and the scaling-back of overseas military operations moderates.  Meanwhile, 
slowly improving budget conditions should allow purchases by state and local 
governments to flatten out in 2013 and begin to rise a little in 2014 and 2015. 
Residential construction is projected to benefit from th e same factors that support 
the strengthening of consumer spending, includi ng rising confidence, income, and wealth.  
However, these effects are offset to some ex tent by the considerable increase in mortgage 
interest rates that we expect to occur over the medium term.  As a result, growth in 
residential investment is projected to ease from a pace of 19 percent this year to an 
average pace of 14 percent in 2014 and 2015.  This recovery is noticeably weaker than that seen in many previous housing recoveries, in part because mortgages will continue to remain out of reach for some households. 
Growth in E&S investment is expected to average 6¼ percent per year over the 
medium term, supported by rising demand eman ating from the consumer and foreign 
sectors.  Despite the modest acceleration that  we project for busine ss output, the increase 
in capital expenditures is  anticipated to be a little larg er in 2013 than in 2014, as some 
investment that may have been delayed last  year due to heightened uncertainty about 
Europe and about U.S. fiscal policy is re sumed this year.  Moreover, the expected 
expiration of the 50 percent bonus depreciation provision at the end of this year pulls 
forward some investment from next year into this year. 
In the nonresidential building sector, we  are projecting a modest increase in 
spending growth over the medium term, as the strengthening in overall economic activity 
leads to very gradual improvements in vacancy rates, commercial real estate prices, and 
credit availability.  By contrast, growth in drilling and mining investment is expected to 
slow in the next two years after a few years of  rapid increases.  Overall, our forecast calls 
for investment in real nonresid ential structures to increase  about 3¼ percent in each of 
2014 and 2015.  
Inventory investment and the external se ctor are both expect ed to be roughly 
neutral for real GDP growth over the medium term.  With little sign of inventory 
imbalances, we expect nonfarm inventories to  accumulate in line with final sales in the 
next two years.  Meanwhile, both exports and imports are projected to accelerate, 
reflecting strengthening economic growth at home and abroad.  Our forecast for real exports is somewhat lower than in the Ja nuary Tealbook forecast owing to the stronger 
exchange value of the dollar.  Also, the stronger dollar boosts im port growth, but this

  effect is more than offset by a downward revision to oil imports stemming from our 
brighter outlook for domestic oil production.  Combining the two, our projection for net 
exports is little different from the January Tealbook.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION  
Conditions in the labor market have continue d to improve at a pace that is, at least 
by some metrics, stronger than we had exp ected.  The unemployment rate moved down to 
7.7 percent in February, in lin e with our projection.  But in the establishment survey, 
nonfarm employment came in higher than expected, averaging 180,000 jobs per month in 
January and February, about the same as th e upward-revised pace in the second half of 
last year.  Taking account of the annual revisions, the level of nonfarm payroll 
employment in February surprised us to the upside by 330,000.7  Both the workweek for 
February and the level of aggregate hours also came in somewhat higher than we 
anticipated. 
Forward-looking indicators of labor mark et activity are also consistent with 
continued employment gains in coming months.  Initial claims for unemployment 
insurance have drifted down ove r the past few months and ar e now at their lowest level 
since early 2008.  Meanwhile, individuals’ expect ations of future labor market conditions 
brightened a bit in February.  That said, the more restrictive picture for fiscal restraint 
stemming from the federal sequestration s uggests somewhat less hiring by private 
contractors in the near term.  We expect  the effect of the spending sequestration on 
federal payroll employment to be minimal as government agencies use furloughs rather 
than layoffs to reduce spending.  In all, we now look for employment gains to average 
about 175,000 per month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady at 7.7 percent 
over the next several months.  Absent seque stration-related spending cuts, we estimate 
that employment gains would average about  200,000 per month over the next several 
months. 
                                                 
7 The January employment report released on February 1 included upward revisions to payroll 
employment from several sources.  First, the usual an nual benchmark revision raised the level of total 
nonfarm employment in March 2012 by nearly 425,000; we had anticipated most of this revision, on the 
basis of the Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary estimate announced in the fall.  Second, payroll 
employment growth from April to December 2012 was revised up by a cumulative 225,000 because of both 
additional adjustments associated with the benchmark revision and the inclusion of additional survey responses for November and December.  Finally, new seasonal factors released with the January report 
appear to have removed the residual seasonality in the payroll employment data that resulted from the timing of the recent recession.

  Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment 
We have not changed our estimates of pot ential output, structural productivity, or 
the natural rate of unemployment in this projection.8  We continue to project the natural 
rate of unemployment to edge down from 6 percent in 2012 to 5¾ percent in 2015 as the 
degree of mismatch between labor demand a nd labor supply, which was elevated during 
the recession and early recovery, starts to ease.   
We estimate that potential output will ri se by about 2 percent per year over the 
projection period, a slightly faster pace than that seen in the past few years.  This 
acceleration is due to a step- up in capital deepening resu lting from the post-recession 
rebound in investment in E&S as well as to th e projected decline in the natural rate.   
The Outlook for the Labor Market and Productivity 
We estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose only 
¾ percent in 2012, only slightly above the pa ce in 2011.  We have interpreted this 
sluggish pace of growth as suggesting that firms have been gradually returning their 
workforces to more sustainable levels after having been reluctant to hire new employees 
earlier in the economic recovery.  We curren tly estimate that actu al productivity stood 
about ½ percent above its longer -run trend in the fourth quarter , so we anticipate slower-
than-trend productivity growth in the near te rm as firms continue to make up for their 
prior restraint by adding worker s. Thereafter, productivity is  expected to rise at its 
structural pace. 
Private job gains are projected to step  up from 180,000 per month this year to 
about 210,000 per month in 2014 and 260,000 per month in 2015 as real output 
accelerates.  With this pace of hiring, th e unemployment rate moves down throughout the 
medium term, ending 2015 at 6¼ percent.  The forecasts for employment growth and the 
unemployment rate are similar to those in  the January Tealbook, and the unemployment 
rate is still expected to drop below the Comm ittee’s threshold of 6½ percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2015.  
                                                 
8 The upward revision to domestic oil production did not change our projection for trend 
productivity or potential output.  Although labor productivity in the oil industry is higher than the average 
of the rest of the nonfarm business sector, the revision to the forecast for oil production car ries forward the 
trend in production seen in the past few years.  Consequently, we think that the projected trend in structural 
multifactor productivity, which is informed by average increases in the past, was already consistent with 
the steeper trajectory of oil production that is now incorporated in our forecast.

  The top-right figure of the “Labor Mark et Developments a nd Outlook” exhibit 
compares our unemployment projection with our projection from September 2012, when 
the Committee first tied its asset purchase deci sions to an improvement in the outlook for 
labor market conditions.  The unemployment rate  in the fourth quarter  of last year was 
about ½ percentage point below our Sept ember Tealbook projecti on, and our current 
forecast for the remainder of this year and ne xt year is lower by about the same amount.  
By the fourth quarter of 2014, we now have the unemployment rate reaching 7.1 percent, 
down from the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed la st August, the latest reading available to 
the Committee at the time of the September FOMC meeting.  Meanwhile, as shown in the 
lower-right figure in the exhibit, the outlook fo r payroll employment gr owth past the first 
half of this year has changed relatively little  since September, in line with our little-
revised projection for output growth.  That said, the level of payroll employment is higher than in our September projection, reflecti ng the positive employment surprises in the 
second half of last year as well as the benchmark revision. 
Resource Utilization   
We estimate that there is still a fair amount  of slack in the economy.  In the fourth 
quarter of 2012, the unemployment rate stood 2 pe rcentage points above our estimate of 
the natural rate, while the level of real GDP was 4 percent below its potential level.  In the manufacturing sector, capacity  utilization stood about 1¾ percentage points below its 
long-run average.
9  We project these gaps to narr ow slowly throughout the medium-term 
forecast as output rises somewhat faster than potential.  Nevertheless, we still expect the unemployment rate to be ½ percentage point above the natural rate and real GDP to be 
1 percent below potential  at the end of 2015.   
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
Recent data on consumer price inflation have come in about in line with our 
expectations.  Moreover, as the projection for resource utilization is li ttle changed in this 
Tealbook and inflation expectations  are still projected to rema in stable, the forecast for 
inflation is also roughly unrevised.  
                                                 
9 There appears to be less slack in the manufacturing sector than in the broader economy, in part 
because of unprecedented de clines in production capacity from 200 7 to 2010 as manufacturers shuttered 
plants that had been underutilized for a long time.  We estimate capacity in the industrial sector based 
largely on survey data that attempt to capture the highest level of output that plants can sustainably 
maintain based on realistic work schedules, assuming that inputs like materials and labor are sufficiently 
available.

  Gasoline prices rose a good bit more than  expected in February, but since we 
judge margins currently to be above their long- run average, we expect gasoline prices to 
fall back in the near term on a seasonally adjusted basis.  Sm oothing through these 
fluctuations, our forecast for the change in c onsumer energy prices over the first half of 
this year is roughly the same as in the January Tealbook.  Over the medium term, we 
expect consumer energy prices to decline in  line with the projected path of crude oil 
prices.   
We expect food price inflation to remain el evated in the first half of this year, 
reflecting continued pass-through to retail prices of the sharp run-up in crop prices 
associated with last summer’s drought.  Although the CPI for food has surprised us to the 
downside of late, we estimate that the higher crop prices have not yet been fully passed 
on to consumer prices.  Hence, our near-ter m forecast for food pri ce inflation is only a 
little lower than it was in th e January Tealbook.  We expect food price inflation to slow 
after this year as the effects of last summer’s drought fade. 
Given the recent appreciation of the dollar, we expect core import price inflation 
to slow to only ½ percent in the second qua rter following a projecte d rise of 1¾ percent 
in the current quarter.  Over the remainde r of the projection pe riod, we expect core 
import price inflation to move back up to a pace of 1½ percent, in line with our forecast 
for moderate dollar depreciation. 
We expect core PCE prices to rise at an annual rate of about 1½ percent in the 
first half of this year, up from a fourth-quarter pace th at we think was held down by 
several transitory factors, in cluding residual seasonality in  the price data and earlier 
declines in import prices.10  Our current forecast for core infl ation in the first half of this 
year is a bit lower than th e one in the January Tealbook due to lower-than-expected 
estimates of nonmarket prices and to a reduc tion in Medicare payments to health-care 
providers that we expect to be associated with the onset of the spending sequestration. 
Recent readings on inflation expectations have remained in the relatively narrow 
range occupied over the past se veral years.  Median 5-to-10- year expected inflation from 
the Michigan survey ticked up to 3 percent in February.  Meanwhile, expectations for 
PCE price inflation over the ne xt 10 years, as measured by the Survey of Professional 
                                                 
10 We suspect that residual seasonality exists in th e price data because, for the past several years, 
there has been a pattern of low inflation late in the year  followed by higher readings early in the next year.

  Forecasters, edged down in the first quarter to  2 percent.  The TIPS-based measures of 
inflation compensation for the next 5 year s and for 5 to 10 years ahead are about 
unchanged from the January Tealbook. 
With stable long-run inflation expectati ons, relatively small projected movements 
in commodity and import prices, and persistent  slack in resource utilization, we expect 
core inflation to remain in the range of 1½ to 1¾ percent through 2015, essentially 
unchanged from the January projection.  In al l, total PCE prices are anticipated to 
increase 1¼ percent this year and 1½ pe rcent in both 2014 and 2015.  Thus, throughout 
the medium term, the projection for PCE inflation remains well below the Committee’s 
threshold level of 2½ percent.     
Recent data on labor compensation have rema ined soft overall, about in line with 
our January Tealbook forecast.  The employment  cost index rose at an annual rate of 
2 percent in the fourth quarte r of last year, close to the average rate observed over the 
past three years.  By contrast, compensa tion per hour (CPH) in the nonfarm business 
sector increased at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the f ourth quarter, somewhat higher 
than its three-year average.  However, this  higher-than-expected reading mainly reflects 
the BEA’s assumption that anticipated tax incr eases caused some bonuses to be paid late 
last year rather than in th e first quarter of this year.11  Consequently, our projection for 
CPH growth in the first quarter is lowe r than in the January Tealbook.  Smoothing 
through the volatility around the turn of the year, our foreca st for CPH growth is little 
changed since the January Tealbook, with grow th in compensation projected to pick up 
slowly over the medium term as the labor market gradually tightens. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast be yond the medium term using the FRB/US 
model and our assumptions about long-run s upply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and  
 
                                                 
11 The employment cost index (ECI) does not show a surge in bonus payments late last year, 
possibly indicating that they  were distributed after the mid-December ECI survey date.  In addition, a large 
fraction of the bonuses may have been paid to top exec utives who are not included in the ECI survey if the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics determines that they set their own pay.

  other factors.  The contour of the long-term outlook  depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s st rategy statement as reiterated at the 
January meeting.  As noted earlier, the Committee’s threshold for the unemployment rate is crossed in th e baseline projection in late 2015.  
Thereafter, the federal funds rate is se t according to the inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule.     
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2016 and 2017, albeit to a 
diminishing extent.  By late 2018, the pr ocess of portfolio normalization is 
essentially complete. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd bonds continue to decrease gradually 
to normal levels, and financial instituti ons further ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) begins to widen after 
2016, primarily reflecting fast-rising transfer payments for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal debt st abilizes temporarily at a little below 
75 percent of GDP but then begins to edge up later in the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates 1¾  percent per year 
from 2016 to 2018 and moves down more slowly thereafter.  The price of crude oil declines slightly in 2016 and then holds steady in real terms.  
Foreign real GDP growth is 3¼ pe rcent in 2016 and 2017 and slows to a 
3 percent annual rate late in the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment c ontinues to decline in 2016 and 2017, 
from 5¾ percent at the end of 2015 to 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 
2017, as labor market functioning improves fu rther; it remains at that level in 
the longer run.  Potential GDP  increases at an average annual rate of just over 
2 percent in the 2016–20 period and moves up to a 2¼ percent pace in the longer run. 
The economy is projected to enter 2016 w ith output below its potential level, 
unemployment above its natural rate, and infl ation below the long-r un objective of the

  Committee.  In the staff’s long-term for ecast, further improvements in household and 
business confidence, diminishing uncertaint y, and supportive financial conditions enable 
real GDP to rise 3 percent in  2016.  Thereafter, gains in real  GDP move down closer to 
their potential pace, reflecti ng the progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation.  
Unemployment falls through 2017 to 5¼ percent.   Long-run inflation expectations are 
assumed to remain well anchored, and with the margin of slack in labor and product 
markets diminishing, consumer price inflation is close to 2 percent in 2017.  The nominal 
federal funds rate is 3¾ percent by the end of  this decade and eventually stabilizes at 
around 4 percent early in the next decade.  Th e 10-year Treasury yield averages 4 percent 
from 2016 through the end of the decade but  eventually rises to 4¾ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
With nearly all of the 2012 GDP releases in hand, we now estimate that foreign 
output expanded a modest 2 percent  in the fourth quarter, a touch less than we had 
assumed in the January Tealbook.  Growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) 
was stronger than we had projected, notably in Asia where trade flows were unexpectedly robust.  However, this positive surpri se was more than offset by an unanticipated 
contraction in the output of the advanced foreign economies (AFEs).  In particular, Europe experienced a more pronounced fourth-quarter GDP drop than we had foreseen, and Canada remained in a soft patch due to an unexpectedly large deceleration in 
inventories. 
Recent indicators suggest that foreign growth strengthened somewhat following 
the turn of the year, with foreign GDP estimated to be rising 2¾ percent  in the current 
quarter.  This pickup is driven by improved performance in the AFEs, with data on 
production and exports suggesting some firming this quarter in both Japan and Canada.  
Additionally, PMIs suggest that the pace of contraction in euro- area GDP is slowing.  We 
expect economic activity in the EMEs to  expand at roughly the same solid rate this 
quarter as in the last, although we see a step -down in the recent rapid growth in emerging 
Asia, notably in China, being offset by an increase in Latin America. 
Europe’s exit from recession is likely to proceed more slowly than we had 
envisioned in the January Tealbook, however.  In part, this revision reflects our read of 
the incoming data, which point to a deeper contraction in European output.  In addition, European financial conditions have deteriorated some in the wake of Italy’s inconclusive national election, and we expect that Italy’s struggles to put together an effective government will weigh on financial markets and business confidence for some time.  
More generally, the uncertainty resulting from Italy’s election highlights the euro area’s 
continuing vulnerability to shocks.  The severe European crisis scenario explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section is still a material tail risk.   
All told, we project total foreign economic growth to strengthen further over the 
remainder of the forecast period, averaging 3 percent  this year and increasing to 
3½ percent  by 2015.  The strengthening is concentrated in the AFEs, where output should 
accelerate as the euro -area crisis abates, fiscal drag diminishes, and  monetary policies

  remain accommodative.  Growth in the EMEs is slated to stay around 4¾ percent  during 
the period, near its trend pace.  Our forecast for total foreign growth is a little lower than 
in the January Tealbook for this year, mainly reflecting a slightly gloomier outlook for Europe.   
Foreign inflation held steady at 2¼ percent  in the fourth quarter, in line with the 
January Tealbook.  It should remain near that rate throughout this year, restrained by limited commodity price pressure and, in some countries, substantial resource slack.  Some EME central banks, including the Bank of Mexico, have cut their policy rates since the January Tealbook because of economic growth concerns.  In the AFEs, we now expect more accommodative monetary policies ma inly because of weaker growth, 
including an additional rate cut by the European Central Bank (ECB) and an expansion of the quantitative easing program of the Bank of England (BOE).  But most notably, we see 
the Bank of Japan (BOJ), under new leadership, undertaking more aggressive actions to 
end deflation.  Exactly how much additional easing will be undertaken by AFE central banks is uncertain, and in the Risks and Uncertainty section we explore the effects of stronger monetary stimulus abroad than we assume in our baseline forecast.  In the box “Currency Wars,” we also consider some of the controversies surrounding monetary easing by the advanced economies.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Real GDP in the AFEs is expected to increase almost 1  percent  at an annual  rate 
in the current quarter after a surprising decline of 0.4 percent  in the fourth quarter.  Soft 
economic indicators and elevated financial stresses suggest that economic activity in Europe will remain quite subdued in the near term.  In Japan, by contr ast, a substantial 
depreciation of the yen over the past few months, along with prospective fiscal and monetary easing, should support an economic rebound this year.  We anticipate that fading financial stresses, reduced drag from fiscal consolidation, and a firming of U.S. activity should lift AFE output growth to a little more than  1¼ percent  this year, 2 percent 
in 2014, and 2¼ percent  in 2015.  This outlook is a touch weaker than in the January 
Tealbook.  
Recent data suggest that AFE inflation has moderated from 1.6 percent  in the 
fourth quarter to an estimated ¾ percent  in the current quarter, a figure somewhat below 
our January Tealbook projection because of lower- than-expected readings in Canada and

  the euro area.  We continue to forecast inflation to average about 1¼ percent  over the 
remainder of 2013 before picking up slightly during the following two years. 
Euro Area 
Euro -area real GDP contracted 2.3  percent  in the fourth quarter, 1 percent age 
point worse than we had estimated in the January Tealbook, with declines widespread 
across core and peripheral economies.  Recent indicators suggest that the pace of contraction is moderating, although less so than we had anticipated.  In January, retail sales rebounded and consumer and business confidence edged up, but car registrations dropped.  The euro-area composite PMI remained in contractionary territory through February despite rising above its fourth-quarter average.  Moreover, bank lending 
standards continued to tighten, and loans to nonfinancial corpo rations decreased further.  
Financial tensions in the euro area have increased a bit on balance since the 
January Tealbook.  While sovereign spreads declined somewhat, on net, for Ireland and 
Spain, spreads on Italian 10-year government bonds are up signifi cantly in the wake of 
the country’s inconclusive parliamentary election.  At present, expectations are for a weak caretaker government to take power until new elections can be held later this year, which could result in a stronger coalition.  The prolonged uncertainty should not compromise fiscal consolidation efforts already under way for 2013.  However, a weak government may struggle to implement needed structural reforms and credibly commit to fiscal consolidation for future years, which raises questions about how quickly Italy could 
obtain ECB support via Outright Monetary Transactions if necessary.  As a result, area-
wide financial stresses and volatility will probably remain a little higher than envisioned in the January Tealbook, but they should subsi de when Italy’s political situation settles 
and further progress toward fiscal and structural reform is made in the other peripheral countries. 
All told, we revised down our projection for euro-area output growth a little more 
than ¼ percent age point this year and a touch in 2014.  We see GDP contracting a further 
¾ percent  in the current quarter, bottoming out later this year, and accelerating over the 
forecast period to a 2 percent  pace by 2015. 
We expect inflation to step down from 2¼ percent  in 2012 to 1¼ percent  this year 
as the output gap widens further and retail energy prices decelerate.  The projected recovery in activity should lift inflation to 1¾ percent  by 2015.  Despite the soft outlook

  Currency Wars  
In recent weeks, there has  been much discussion about the possibility that several 
advanced economies  might engage in a “currency war,” seeking to devalue their 
currencies through accommodative monetary policies.  Brazilian Finance Minister G uido 
Mantega is generally credited with coining the term currency wars  in November 2010 , 
following the initiation of the Federal Reserve’s second LSAP program.  At that time, 
authorities in several EMEs criticized  policy easing in the advanced economies  as 
encouraging excessive capital inflows that put upward pressure on EME currencies and 
asset prices .  However, as economic growth in the EMEs  slowed last year, prompted in 
part by renewed weakness in the advanced economies, these criti cisms became more 
muted .    
 More recently, complaints about currency wars have reemerged following the sharp 
depreciation of the yen since last fall, when it became clear that Shinzo Abe would be 
elected prime minister of Japan.  Abe called  for aggressive monetary stimulus to help 
Japan escape deflation  and discussed  currency intervention, including the possible 
creation  of a Japanese government fund to buy foreign assets.  Some European officials 
were vocal in their concerns about policies that depreciate the yen.  Bundesbank 
President Jens Weidmann showed alarm at the Japanese government’s urging of more 
aggressive monetary stimulus and expressed the hope that competitive devaluations 
could be avoided .  French President Fran çois Hollande said he feared the euro’s strength 
against other currencies and suggested setting a medium -term exchange rate target.   
 
Following their most recent meeting on February 12, the G -7 central bankers and finance 
ministers committed to refrain from actions focused on achieving  competitive advantage 
through  lower currencies :  “We reaffirm that our fiscal and monetary policies have been 
and will remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that we will not target exchange rates .”
1 Since the n, Japan ese 
policymakers have dialed down public discussion of  exchange market intervention or 
purchases of foreign assets to stimulate their economy.   
 
Similarly, t he G-20 (which includes a broader range of countries)  issued a communiqu é on 
February 16 , which no ted:  “We will refrain from competitive devaluation.  We will not 
target our exchange rates for competitive purposes, will resist all forms of protectionism and keep our markets open.”
2  But in fact , the exchange rate policies of emerging market 
countries  are varied.  Some (most prominently China) heavily manage their currencies , 
often  keep ing them at levels that are generally considered undervalued.  Others 
(including Brazil and Korea) occasionally intervene in foreign exchange markets , 
following an exchan ge rate policy that is described as a managed , or “dirty ,” float.  Still 
others (including Mexico) allow their exchange rates to move more flexibly.  There is also 
a range of exchange  rate policies  among smaller advanced economies.  R ecently, the

  governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has said that the New Zealand 
dollar is clearly overvalued and that the RBNZ stands ready to intervene.  Most  explicitly, 
in September 2011 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) imposed a ceiling on the Swiss franc  in 
resp onse to safe-haven flows that sharply appreciated the franc  during the height of the 
euro- area crisis.  While clearly targeting the exchange rate, that action generally escaped 
criticism because the SNB had few other tools to combat deflation and the franc  was 
seen as overvalued.   
 
By our reckoning, the accommodative monetary policies pursued by the Federal Reserve, 
the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank have indeed been focused on easing domestic financial conditions rather than on depreciating their currencies, consistent with the G -7 statement.  These policies contribute to the expansion 
of global demand.  At the same time, however, these policies do exert some downward pressure on home currenc ies, which can have an adverse effect on trading partners.  The 
net result for other countries will depend on the balance of these effects.  To evaluate 
that balance, an  alternative simulation discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section 
explores the effects  on the United States and the EMEs  of a simultaneous increase in 
monetary accommodation among the advanced foreign economies .  This 
accommodation  combines (1) balance sheet expansion sufficient to reduce the term 
premium in long -term interest rates by 50  basis points and (2) an int ention, understood 
by markets, to extend by about two quarters the period during which short -term interest 
rates stay near the zero bound .  As shown in the figure on the lower left , the net effect  
on GDP in the United States and the EMEs is quite small, as  the adverse effect on ouput 
of the resulting appreciation of their currencies (lower- right  figure) is offset by the 
stimulative effect of rising incomes and demand  in the countries undertaking monetary 
easing.  
 These results suggest that  monetary easing  is not a beggar -thy-neighbor policy that 
detract s from economic growth in a country’s trading partners.  Some observers are 
concerned that if weakness in the global economy continues, the temptation to resort to 
policies genuinely focused on exchange rates or trade protectionism might intensify.  So far, however, countries have generally resisted such actions .

  for both inflation and activity, the ECB left its benchmark policy rate at 0.75 percent  in 
February.  Nonetheless, given the larger output gap and ECB projections showing 
inflation falling well below target, we now expect the ECB to cut its main policy rate to 0.5 percent  in the second quarter of 2013 and then hold the rate steady until the second 
half of 2015. 
United Kingdom 
Real GDP contracted 1  percent  in the fourth quarter, slightly more than we 
estimated in the January Tealbook, as inventories decelerated and final demand languished.  The near-term outlook has also deteriorated amid disappointing domestic indicators and weaker growth prospects in the euro area, although the recent depreciation 
of sterling should damp the effect on aggregate demand.  In January, retail sales 
contracted for a fourth consecutive month and industrial production tumbled to a two-decade low.  In addition, the composite PMI stalled near 50 through February.  Accordingly, we shaved ¼ percent age point off our GDP growth forecast for this year, 
with output now barely increasing this quarter and expanding a modest 1½ percent , on 
average, over the remainder of 2013.  As in the January Tealbook, we expect growth to 
rise to 2¼ percent  in 2014 and to 2½ percent  in 2015, helped by continued favorable 
monetary conditions, smaller fiscal drag, and the projected recovery in the euro area.  
We marked up our inflation forecast a bit following warnings by U.K. authorities 
that power plant closings and increased reliance on higher-priced foreign oil and gas would exert upward pressure on retail energy prices in coming years.  We now expect 
inflation to average 2¼ percent  this year before edging down to the BOE’s 2 percent  
target over the remainder of the forecast period.  BOE officials appear willing to tolerate above-target inflation over the next year or two, and press reports indicate that the central bank’s remit may be modified in a way that places a greater emphasis on growth.  In this context, and given weaker GDP growth prospects, we are assuming that this year the BOE will increase its quantitative easing program £50  billion (3.2 percent  of GDP) and 
expand the Funding for Lending Scheme. 
Canada 
Canadian real GDP rose only 0.6 percent  in the fourth quarter, about the same 
pace as in the third quarter and ¾ percent age point less than we had estimated in the 
January Tealbook.  Economic activity was held down by a surprisingly large deceleration

  in inventories, while consumption and investment grew at a moderate pace.  Recent data 
suggest that output growth is picking up modestly this quarter.  Exports advanced in 
January , and aggregate hours posted a solid gain in February.  However, the PMI was 
consistent with a meager expansion of manufacturing output through February.  Moreover, Statistics Canada’s annual survey of  investment intentions was also downbeat.  
Given these developments, our GDP growth projection is slightly lower over the forecast period relative to the January Tealbook; we forecast GDP growth to rise from 2 percent  
in 2013 to 2¾ percent  by 2015, in line with the firming in U.S. GDP growth. 
Canadian consumer price inflation was softer than expected in January due to 
surprising weakness in both retail energy and core components.  We now expect inflation to moderate to an annual rate of 1  percent  this quarter, down from 1.4 percent  in the 
fourth quarter.  Inflation should rise to around 1¾ percent  by early 2014 as economic 
activity improves and remain near that rate over the remainder of the forecast period.  Against this backdrop of slow growth and low inflation, we now expect the Bank of Canada to push back its first policy rate hike by one quarter, keeping the rate at 1 percent  
until the third quarter of 2014. 
Japan 
Following two quarters of negative growth, Japanese real GDP edged up 
0.2 percent  in the fourth quarter, as a drag from plummeting exports was offset by a solid 
increase in private consumption.  Recent data suggest that external demand is recovering.  
Industrial production and exports rose in January, and the manufacturing PMI and other 
surveys suggest further gains in February.  We thus estimate that output is expanding at a 1¾ percent  pace in the current quarter.  Growth should then pick up to 2¼ percent  by 
year-end, driven by previously announced measures to boost public investment.  
Thereafter, a planned doubling of the consumption tax rate phased in over two years should slow GDP growth to a near -trend pace of ¾ percent  in 2014 and 2015.  This 
outlook is ¼ percent age point stronger than in the January Tealbook, with much of the 
revision due to a further decline in the yen, higher stock prices, and our expectation for greater monetary easing.  
At the end of February, the Abe government nominated Haruhiko Kuroda to head 
the BOJ.  Pending parliamentary approval, Mr. Kuroda and two new deputy governors 
will take office on March 20.  Under their leadership, we expect the BOJ to announce 
new easing measures, including an increase in the size of the Asset Purchase Program

  (APP), an extension of the maturity of Japanese government bonds acquired through the 
APP, and guidance as to how long open- ended purchases will last.  Accordingly, we 
revised up our inflation forecast ¼ percent age point over the forecast period.  However, 
we remain skeptical about the BOJ’s resolve and ability to achieve its new 2 per cent 
inflation target over the forecast period, and we project that, net of the effect of 
consumption tax hikes, inflation will reach only ½ percent  by the end of 2015. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
We estimate that real GDP growth in the EMEs increased to 4½  percent  in the 
fourth quarter from 3¼ percent  in the third quarter, with growth firming in both Latin 
America— especially Mexico —and emerging Asia.  Final domestic demand remained 
strong, inventories rose sharply in some countries, and exports were surprisingly robust, considering the weakness in the advanced economies.  Overall, our fourth- quarter 
estimate for EME growth is ½  percent age point higher than in the January Tealbook, 
reflecting positive surprises in emerging Asia and Mexico.  
We expect EME growth  to remain at 4½  percent  in the current quarter, with some 
moderation in emerging Asia balanced by a step -up in Latin America.  Over the 
remainder of the forecast period, we see EME output growth hovering around 
4¾ percent.  Relative to the January Tealboo k, our GDP forecast is down marginally 
because of the slightly weaker outlook for the advanced economies and somewhat softer-
than-expected monthly indicators from China.  We would add that some of the EMEs’ 
recent rebound in inventories and output may have been predicated on an anticipated firming of demand by the advanced economies.  If that recovery does not materialize within the next several quarters, activity in the EMEs might fall back abruptly.  
We estimate that headline inflation in the EMEs will mo ve up to 3¼ percent  in the 
first quarter, about ½ percent age point higher than we projected in the January Tealbook, 
largely because of  a jump in Chinese inflation driven by food prices.  Thereafter, EME 
inflation should stabilize around 3¼ percent , in line with our January forecast.  Mainly on 
growth concerns, the central banks of Colombia, India, and Mexico cut their policy rates.  Capital flows to EME -dedicated funds remained strong for most of February but have 
moderated in recent weeks.

  China  
Indicators from China point to  an easing of economic growth from 9½ percent  in 
the fourth quarter to 8½ percent  in the current quarter.1  Over January and February, 
growth of industrial production and retail sales slowed a bit.  Investment remained strong, 
led b y the real estate sector, but we anticipate that investment will also slow as authorities 
clamp down on speculation in the real estate market, in part by implementing a 
20 percent capital gains tax on all residential property sales.  We look for GDP growth  to 
decrease a bit further to 8  percent  by the end of 2015, largely reflecting a gradual 
reduction in China’s growth potential.  The forecast for this year and next is down a bit 
from the January Tealbook, reflecting the softer tone of the recent data and some reversal of earlier policy stimulus.  Still, compared with early last year, when the Chinese economy was decelerating rapidly, a hard landing now seems less likely.  However, the 
new measures to cool the property market could lead to a steeper- than-expected decline 
in investment, and the recent rapid expansion of off- balance -sheet banking activities 
could pose a risk to financial stability.  
Chinese inflation picked up in January and February mainly because of an 
increase in vegetable prices.  The rise in food prices led us to mark up our forecast for 
headline inflation in the first quarter 1¼ percent age point to 3¾ percent  at an annual rate.  
We project Chinese inflation to moderate after the effects of the food price shock wane and to average about 3 p ercent  over the remainder of the forecast period. 
Other Emerging Asia 
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, real GDP growth climbed to 4½  percent  in the 
fourth quarter from 3  percent  in the third.  This pace is ¾ percent age point faster than 
projected in the January Tealbook, as positive surprises in most of the region outweighed disappointing readings in India and Korea.  The largest upward surprises were in 
Thailand and Malaysia, where output growth reached double- digit territory.  Activity in 
the region continued to be supported by domestic demand.  In addition, growth was 
boosted by exports to China, both to meet strong Chinese final demand and to provide parts and components used in the production of goods for re-export.  In Singapore and 
                                                 
1 There is no official series for the level of Chinese real GDP , and thus estimates of Chinese 
economic growth from various sources can differ.  The staff’s quarter -on-quarter growth estimates are 
constructed from the official series of four -quarter changes in real GDP and should be viewed as having 
relatively wide confidence bands.

  Thailand, a sharp increase in inventory accumulation also raised activity in the fourth 
quarter.  
We expect growth in the region to step down to just above 4 percent  in the current 
quarter, reflecting a moderation in those economies that experienced outsized expansions 
in the fourth quarter.  Thereafter, growth should pick up to 4¾ percent  by the end of 
2014, supported by accommodative policies and the recovery of activity in the advanced economies.  Relative to the January Tealbook, our forecast is up ¼ percent age point in 
the cur rent quarter on increased economic momentum.  The outlook is down a touch for 
the rest of the year and in 2014 due to the downward revision to the pace of recovery in the advanced economies. 
Price readings have been coming in about as expected.  Accordingl y, we project 
inflation in the region to remain at 3¼  percent  in the current quarter and to stay near that 
rate over the remainder of the forecast period, in line with our previous Tealbook forecast.  Concerns about house price bubbles prompted authorities in Hong Kong and Singapore to introduce additional tightening measures for property markets. 
Latin America 
Real GDP growth in Mexico picked up to 3.1 percent  in the fourth quarter, almost 
1 percent age point more than projected in the January Tealbook.  Al though industrial 
output edged down, services output, which represents about two-thirds of the economy, expanded at a moderate pace and output in the volatile agricultural sector jumped.  Manufacturing exports edged up in January and vehicle production through February rebounded from its December slump.  Combining these readings with the projected improvement in U.S. manufacturing, we expect economic growth to increase further this quarter to 3¾ percent  and to remain near that pace through 2015.  This forec ast is little 
changed from the January Tealbook. 
For South America, we estimate that real GDP growth increased to 3¼  percent  in 
the fourth quarter from 2¼ percent  in the third quarter.  We expect growth in the region 
to stay at about this pace in the current quarter before edging up to 3¾ percent  in 2014 
and 2015.  In Brazil, GDP rose 2¼ percent  in the fourth quarter, 1 percent age point less 
than we had estimated, and the third-quarter expansion was also revised down to only 1½ percent .  The weakness in the fourth quarter reflected still-sluggish investment, which 
grew only modestly after four quarters of decline.  Indicators for the current quarter, such

  as industrial production and PMI, have strengthened and suggest a pickup in growth to 
about 3 percent  in the current quarter, though this is still ½ percent age point below our 
January projection.  We expect Brazilian growth to increase further to 4 percent  next year 
and to level off at that rate in 2015, supported by policy accommodation and the recovery 
in the advanced economies. 
We estimate that consumer price inflation in Mexico dipped to 2 percent  at an 
annual rate in the first quarter, about ¼ percent age point below our January Tealbook 
forecast, as food prices ebbed from their recent highs.  With inflation having retreated significantly and amid concerns about weak global growth and strong capital inflows, the 
Bank of Mexico lowered its policy rate 0.5 percentage point to 4 percent , the first rate cut 
since mid -2009.  We expect Mexican inflation to rebound to 3¼ percent  later this year 
after food prices bottom out and to step up slightly further over the remainder of the 
forecast period. 
In South Ameri ca, first -quarter inflation, at an estimated 5¾  percent, has 
moderated a bit less than we had anticipated in the January Tealbook.  Inflation in the 
region should settle near 5¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, in part as 
inflationary pre ssures in Brazil ease.  The Brazilian central bank kept  its main policy rate 
unchanged at its record -low 7 .25 percent at its March meeting, citing persistently weak  
growth , but indicat ed a tightening bias for the future given that 12-month inflation , at 
6.3 percent in February,  is near the upper limit of its target range of 2½  to 6½ percent.  
Accordingly, we expect the central bank to start tightening in coming months.

Financial Developments  
Generally f avorable U.S. economic data releases  and monetary policymakers’ 
communications supported continued improvement in domestic market sentiment over 
the intermeeting period  despite some renewed  concerns about conditions in Europe.  On 
balance, broad U.S. stock price indexes rose 3 percent  over the period , while  longer -term 
Treasury yields ticked higher and co rporate bond and MBS spreads were essentially 
unchanged.  T he passing of the sequestration deadline and  uncertainty over the extension 
of the continuing resolution to fund the federal government left little apparent imprint in 
domestic asset markets .  The dollar appreciated against the major currencie s amid 
weaker -than- expected foreign economic data releases and anticipation of easier monetary 
policy conditions abroad.  Equity prices of European financial institutions dropped and Italian sovereign spreads widened in response to heightened political uncertainty following the inconclusive outcome of the Italian elections.   
The expected path of policy rates implied by derivative s contracts edged down, on 
net, since the January FOMC meeting .  On balance, various communications from 
policymakers , including the Chairman’s semiannual testimony  to the C ongress, were 
characterized as reinforcing market expectations that significant monetary policy 
accommodation would continue. 
Conditions in domestic financing markets  generally improved, on net, over the 
intermee ting period.  T here was no apparent deterioration in access to short -term funding, 
including for financial institutions with European parents.  Meanwhile, credit flows to nonfinancial business es remained robust, as evidenced by elevated  net domestic  
corpor ate bond issuance and increases in outstanding commercial paper ( CP) and C&I 
loans .  Financial conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to 
improve slowly , with commercial mortgage debt increasing in the fourth quarter for the 
first time since 2008.  On the household side, student and auto loans continued to expand briskly, while other credit flows to the household sector remained subdued.  In particular, despite another sizable increase in house prices, residential mortgage debt outstanding 
was little changed in the fourth quarter amid persistent ly tight credit conditions for many  
households, and balances owed on credit card accounts have been  flat in recent months.  
Meanwhile, overall b ank credit continued to expand moderately , driven primarily by the

  growth  in C&I loans.   After surging toward the end of 2012, M2 has been roughly 
unchanged so far this year.  
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Over the intermeeting period, the expected path for federal funds rates derived 
from market quotes edged down, while longer -term Treasury yields were relatively 
unchanged on net.  On balance, FOMC communications were slightly more 
accommodative than expected .  Although some market participants viewed the minutes 
of the January FOMC meeting  as signaling marginally less policy accommodati on 
through the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet than they had expected, the January FOMC statement , the Chairman’s m onetary p olicy testimony, and a number of speeches by 
FOMC  member s appeared to more than offset that interpretation and  reinforce d 
expectations for a continuation of significant policy accommodati on.  The expected path 
for the federal funds rate derived from overnight index swaps now rises above the current 
target range in the fourth quarter of 2014, one quarter later than at the time of the January 
FOMC meeting.  The modal policy path—the most likely values for future federal funds 
rates based on prices of interes t rate caps —indicate s that the federal funds rate will 
remain in its current range until early 2016, slightly longer than seen in January.
1 
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest S urvey of Primary D ealers also show 
a small downward revision in modal policy rate expectations beyond the first quarter of 
2015, although dealers continued to view the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increase in the target rate.  Median estimates suggest that dealers also 
continued to view the firs t quarter of 2014 as the most likely time for the completion of 
the flow -based purchases in Treasury securities and agency MBS , but the number of 
dealers that expect  purchases to continue beyond the first quarter of 2014 rose slightly . 
Nominal Treasury yie lds stayed within a narrow range during the first half of the 
intermeeting period but declined noticeably in response to the deterioration in sentiment 
following the inconclusive elections in Italy.  T he decline in yields was subsequently 
retraced as domes tic data releases on housing and labor market  activity  exceeded 
expect ations .  On net since the January FOMC meeting , 2-year Treasury yields ticked 
down 2 basis points, while 10- and 30- year yields rose 2 basis points and 7 basis points, 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 15 basis points  over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday stan dard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

points, on net, amid declining commodity prices.  TIPS -based inflation compensation  
5 to 10 years ahead also declined 5 basis points, while the swaps- based measure was little 
chan ged.     
TREASURY AND AGENCY MBS  MARKET FUNCTIONING  
The Desk’s flow -based purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS 
continued to proceed as planned and did not appear to have had any material adverse 
effect on either Treasury or agency MBS market fun ctioning.2  Most measures of 
liquidity conditions in these markets , such as bid- asked spreads for nominal Treasury 
securities and trading volumes and settlement fails for both types of securities, remained stable over the intermeeting period.  Implied fina ncing rates for dollar roll transactions in 
most MBS coupons have ri sen over the period, suggesting little scarcity in the supply of 
the cheapest -to-deliver MBS that trade in the to-be-announced (TBA) market.  Implied 
financing rates for Fannie Mae 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent MBS coupons were  quite 
negative in January, suggesting a short- term shortage of such securities in the TBA 
market, but rose over the period, as supply in these  coupon s increased and the Desk’ s 
purchases shifted somewhat toward ot her securities that were in relatively greater supply.  
Consequently, the Desk roll ed only about 8 percent of total expected settlements in 
February, about half the January level.  
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Conditions in domestic  funding markets were generally little changed, on balance, 
since the January FOMC meeting.  Conditions in offshore dollar funding markets were 
stable despite the heightened political uncertainty in Italy.    
Over the intermeeting period, both the spread be tween three-month LIBOR and 
comparable- maturity OIS rates and that  between the three- month forward rate agreement 
three months ahead and the corresponding forward OIS rate narrowed a bit, leaving them 
near the lower end s of their ranges since 2009.  Most f inancial institutions with parents 
domiciled in France, Germany, and other “core” European countries reported ly had  fairly 
                                                 
2 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $60 billion  in Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program.  In addit ion, t he Desk purchased $107 billion  in agency MBS 
under the flow -based MBS program and the reinvestment program.

  normal access to dollar liquidity.3  The outstanding amount of unsecured CP issued by 
European financial institutions remained stable  in the period following a significant 
increase in issuance at the beginning of the year , and the outstanding amount of 
unsecured CP issued by U.S. financial institutions was also about unchanged.  The 
spreads on U.S. and most European unsecured CP and asset -backed commercial paper 
(ABCP ) generally held at their recent levels.  Aggregate outstanding ABCP was little 
changed for programs with sponsors domiciled in the United States and Europe.  
Overnight spreads on ABCP (relative to AA -rated  unsecured nonf inancial CP) were 
about unchanged , on net, with spreads on most European ABCP issues remaining close to 
those on U.S. issues.   
Repo markets continued to function well over the intermeeting period.  Rates on 
Treasury and agency GCF repo increased from thei r low levels at the time of the January 
FOMC  meeting  but remained below their six -month averages.  Repo haircuts for 
Treasury and agency collateral , as well as for corporate bond collateral , were roughly 
unchanged .  The availability of term secured funding reportedly continued to increase, 
including for less-liquid asset classes.  Market participants noted that funding for  
high-yield debt is now available to high -quality counterparties for tenors up to six 
months, and from a broadening group of lenders. 
Leveraged investors have not experienced unusual volatility during the 
intermeeting period.  Dealers  reported in the March Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey 
on Dealer Financing Terms that risk appetite on the part of lever aged investors has 
increased somewhat over the past three months, as their concerns about tail risks to the 
domestic economic outlook appear to have diminish ed (see appendix). 
A broad index of U.S. bank equity prices has risen about 6 percent, on net, since 
the January FOMC  meeting, and large domestic bank CDS spreads ticked down on

  OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity price indexes rose over the intermeeting period , as markets reacted 
to generally better -than-expected domestic economic data releases and strong corporate 
earnings reports despite the cont inued trimming of year -ahead earnings forecasts .  The 
staff’s estimate of the expected real return on the S&P 500 index edged down further 
over the period to the lowest level seen since  late 2008, while the spread between th is 
return and the real 10- year Treasury yield —a gauge of the current equity premium —
remained wide by historical standards.   The VIX, an index of option-implied  
one-month -ahead volatility for the S&P 500 index, jumped after the Italian elections but 
subsequent ly fell to a level last seen in early 2007 .  
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative- grade 
corporate bonds rose slightly, roughly in line with yields on comparable- maturity 
nominal Treasury securities.  As a result, spreads for both classes of corporate bonds 
were about unchanged, on net, for the period.  The spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured 
CP issued  by nonfinancial firms over yields on AA- rated nonfinancial issues were about 
unchanged, on balance, over the period .  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Concerns regarding Europe rose over the intermeeting period amid  
weaker -than- expected macroeconomic data releases and the election results in Italy, 
which cast doubt on whether a governing coalition strong enough to pursue further reforms  coul d be assembled .  Spreads of 10- year Italian sovereign debt yields over 
comparable German yields widened about 65 basis points over the period, but Spanish 
spreads narrowed modestly.  Although the headline euro- area equity index was , on net, 
little changed ove r the period, euro- area banking -sector share prices fell 8 percent.  
Macroeconomic data for the United Kingdom were also weak, and Moody’s Investors Service cut the country’s Aaa sovereign debt rating one notch, citing the outlook for 
economic growth.  Reflecting poorer growth prospects, market- based measures of 
expected overnight interest rates in the euro area and the United Kingdom fell, and the 
Bank of England signaled that it was likely to maintain its accommodative monetary 
policies  even as it expects to miss its inflation target over the medium term.  Sovereign 
yields declined in the United Kingdom and Germany, and sterling and the euro depreciated 6 percent and 3 ½ percent, respectively, against the dollar.

  Expectations for easier monetary policy extended also to Canada and Japan.  
Amid weak data on domestic economic activity, the Bank of Canada appeared more 
likely to delay further the start of monetary tightening, and the Canadian dollar depreciated 2½ percent against the U.S. dol lar, on net, over the period.   
In Japan, the nomination of Haruhiko Kuroda to lead the Bank of Japan reinforced 
expectations for aggressive monetary policy action.  Ten -year sovereign yields dec reased 
about 13 basis points in Japan, to near record lows, and the Nikkei index rose 13 percent over the period.  The yen depreciated a further 6 percent against the dollar, bringing the yen’s decline against the dollar since last fall to 22 percent.  This depreciation in anticipation of more policy easing led to s ome fears that Japan would deliberately seek to 
lower its currency and thereby induce retaliatory actions by other countries to devalue their currencies.  In response, the G -7 and G -20 issued statements reaffirming their 
commitments to “market  determined” exchange rates (see the box “Currency Wars” in 
the International Economic Developments and Outlook section). 
Although inflows into emerging market mutual funds continued, they slowed 
notably in recent weeks, partly reflecting heightened stresses after the Italian elections, 
and EME equity indexes were, on average , slightly lower.  In China, the government 
imposed new measures aimed at cooling activity in the housing market and proposed 
measures to rein in the country’s shadow banking sector.  The central banks of Colombia, Hungary, India, Mexico, and Poland lowered their respective policy interest rates over the period, citing weakening prospects for growth.  Movements in the currencies of EMEs  against the dollar were generally small; on average, the dollar rose ¼ percent 
against EME currencies.  
Foreign private demand for U.S. assets , including Treasury securities, was very 
strong in December but reversed some in January; smoothing through the two months, foreign private demand contributed to the ongoing rec overy in cross -border flows .  U.S. 
investors’ acquisitions of foreign securities also picked up, with strong purchases of equities.  Foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities , led by a sharp increase in 
purchases from Asia, recovered in Decemb er and January from November’s low level; 
Federal Reserve Bank of New Y ork custodial data suggest more -moderate increases in 
February.

After a strong finish to the  fourth -quarter reporting season , earnings per share for 
S&P 500 firms are n ow estimated to have increased modest ly from the third -quarter 
level .  Gains for the nonfinancial sector more than offset a substantial decline in the 
profits of insurance companies  stemming in large part from payouts to cover damage 
caused by Hurricane Sandy .  Although revision s to year -ahead analyst earnings forecasts 
for firms in the S&P 500 continued to be slightly negative in January and February, 
analysts , on balance, continue to expect a healthy rate of earnings growth over the 
coming year.  
Available indicators also continued to point to solid  credit quality  for the 
nonfinancial corporate sector .  In the fourth quarter, the aggregate liquid  asset ratio 
remained near its highest level in 20 years, while the aggregate ratio of debt to asset s 
ticked lo wer and continues to be well below its historical average for the same period.  
The volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds downgraded by Moody’s jumped in January, 
primarily reflecting a downgrade to AT &T’s debt .  Bond rating upgrades rebounded in 
February to  slightly exceed downgrades.  The six-month trailing bond default rate for 
nonfinancial firms remained low by historical standards in January, and the C&I loan delinquency rate continued to decrease in the fourth quarter from an already low level .  
The KMV expected year -ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms declined slightly in 
recent months because of  gains in share prices . 
Bond issuance by nonfinancial firms  remained  fairly robust in February , largely 
due to continued sizable issuance from investme nt-grade firms .  Staff estimates indicate 
that the net issuance of nonfinancial CP  continued to be brisk, and t he volume of C&I 
loans outstanding also grew , in February.  Issuance of syndicated leveraged loans 
remained robust, supported by strong demand fr om CLOs , which has recently brought 
down yields on most  tranches , bringing them more in line with other similarly  rated debt 
securities .  The pace of CLO issuance hit a post- crisis high over the intermeeting period .   
The pace of gross public issuance of equity by nonfinancial firms picked up in 
January, boosted by robust IPO  activity  and secondary issuance , and remained strong in 
February.  In the fourth quarter, s hare repurchases and cash -financed mergers by 
nonfinanc ial firms continued their recent pace , leaving net equity issuance deeply 
negative. Moreover, a notable pickup in a nnouncements of both merger s and share

  repurchase programs  so far this year suggest that equity retirements are likely to 
accelerate over the coming quarters.  
Financial conditions in the CRE sector ha ve improve d of late .  As low interest 
rates have increased demand for commercial mortgages and lending standards reportedly 
have eased somewhat , commercial mortgage debt increased slightly in the fourth quarter 
after decreasing in each quarter since the beginning of 2009.  Data from banks suggest that growth in multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loans more than offset further declines in constr uction and land development loans.  Moreover, CMBS issuance 
continues to be robust so far this year, reportedly driven by low interest rates and strong investor demand.  Nonetheless, delinquency rates on loans underlying existing CMBS 
moved  only a touch lo wer in February , remain ing near historical ly high  level s, while 
CRE  prices flattened out  in the fourth quarter after several consecutive quarter ly 
increases.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Conforming home mortgage rates and yields on agency MBS have risen  a bit , on 
net, since the previous  FOMC  meeting , while the spread between primary and secondary 
rates was little changed.  Despite the fact that mortgage rates have increased by about 
35 basis points, on net, this year , refinancing originations have declined only slightly, as 
many borrowers with strong credit records remain  “in the money” to refinance even at the 
higher level of rates . 
Aggregate house  price indexes posted substantial increases in December and 
January, even as the share of home sales involving distressed properties continued to be elevated.  Residential mortgage debt , though, was about flat in the  fourth quarter, as tight 
mortgage credit conditions damped purchase loan originations and foreclosure- related 
loan charge -offs remained elevated.    
Consu mer credit continued to expand moderately in December and January, with 
all of the increase again appearing in the nonrevolving credit  category.  Growth in student 
and auto loans averaged annual rates around 10 percent in th ose two months.  In contrast, 
revolving credit was roughly flat amid continued tight underwriting standards for credit 
card loans.  Even so, credit card solicitation mail volume jumped noticeably  in January, 
perhaps a  nascent sign that conditions in this market are  beginning to ease, es pecially for

  consumers with strong credit records .  Consumer ABS issuance continued on pace for 
another robust quarter, largely supported by strong investor demand for these securities .    
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the January FOMC meeting, the Treasury Dep artment has auctioned 
$232 billion in nominal securities and $9 billion in 30- year TIPS.  The auctions were 
generally in line with expectations, with bid -to-cover ratios close to their recent averages.  
The pace of gross issuance of long- term municipal bonds weakened in January 
and is expected to slow further in February, largely owing to tepid issuance for new 
capital projects .  Moreover , net issuance of these bonds remained negative, as state and 
local governments resist ed taking on debt amid continued weakness in their credit 
quality.  The number of r ating downgrades of municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to 
substantially outpace upgrades in the fourth quarter, and preliminary data  suggest that 
this trend may have continued in the current qua rter.  CDS spreads for states inched down 
further over the intermeeting period, while the ratio of yields on 20- year municipal bonds 
to yields on comparable- maturity Treasury securities —a gauge of the relative risk of 
municipal bonds—was little changed . 
COMMERCIAL  BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit continued to expand modestly in January and February—about 
matching its fourth -quarter pace, on average —largely driven by continued robust growth 
in C&I loans .  CRE loans were about unchanged over that period , while m oderate 
increases in closed -end residential mortgage loans were partially offset by continued 
declines in home equity loans.  Consumer loans have only inched up so far this year , 
reflecting limited change s in credit card loans and modest growth in other consumer 
loans.  Finally, banks’ holdings of securities were about flat, as sizable declines in 
Treasur y and agency debt securities  were offset by increases in agency MBS and other 
securities.  
In aggregate, the profitability of BHC s increased  in the fourth quarter  but 
continued to run well below the levels that prevailed before the financial crisis .  
Profitability was boosted last quarter by a moderate  increase in noninterest income, as 
revenues from investment banking activities such as underwriting rose .  Net interest 
margins (NIMs) at commercial banks narrowed and remained  near the bottom of their

  historical range , reflecting  a downward trend in NIMs at the large st BHCs .  In contrast, 
NIMs at smaller banks with relatively high concentration s of real estate loans  rose in the 
fourth quarter and have risen , on net, over the past few years .  Meanwhile, the industry as 
a whole continued to release loan loss reserves  in the fourth quarter, but to a lesser extent 
than has been the case in some time.  Credit quality at banks continued to show signs of 
improvement in every major asset class.  Regulatory capital ratios rose  further, driven by 
an increase in retained earnings.   
According to the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in early 
February, spreads of C&I loan  rates  over an interest rate on a market instrument of 
comparable maturity continued to trend down.  However, spreads on loans at large domestic banks and foreign banks declined further, while spreads on loans originated at 
small d omestic banks increased .  Likewise, spreads on loans made under smaller 
commitments, a proxy for loans to small businesses, inched up and remained elevated, while the spreads on loans made under larger commitments fell .  These patterns are 
generally consis tent with an environment in which there has reportedly been greater  
competition among banks to supply credit to large and middle- market firms . 
The level of M2 was about unchanged , on net, over January and February.  
Deposits  rose rapidly in December  as uncertainty about future tax rates reportedly 
spurred some investors to realize capital gains and some firms to increase dividend payments .  The reversal  of these flows due to portfolio re balancing likely damped M2 
growth in the first two months of this ye ar.

In contrast, the monetary base has expanded at a n annual rate of  37¾ percent

for the fourth quarter of 2012 showed that these temporarily insured balances actually increased until the 
point of expiration.  Moreover, after expiration, there appeared to be no migration of deposit balances to banks p erceived as stronger or likely to be “too big to fail.”  In fact, the largest 19 banks by assets have 
seen deposit outflows since the turn of the year.  Also, banks with higher credit ratings appear to have seen relatively more outflows in January and Febr uary than a sampling of banks with comparatively lower credit 
ratings.

Appendix  
Senior  Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms  
Responses to the March 2013 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing 
Terms generally suggested little change over the p ast three months in the credit terms applicable 
to important classes of counterparties covered by the survey .1  Continuing a trend  observed in 
recent surveys, a large net fraction of respondents reported an increase in the amount of resources 
and attention devoted to the management of concentrated exposures to central counterparties and 
other financial market utilities.  Overall, respondents noted that t he use of financial leverage by 
most classes of counterparties had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  However, about one-fourth of dealers , including a majority of the nine  broad- scope dealers—that 
is, dealers with a significant presence in essentially all of the business areas co vered in the 
survey — reported  an increase in the use of leverage by hedge funds. 
As in previous  surveys, r espondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in 
new or renegotiated over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives master agreements were generally 
unchanged, on balance, during the past three months.  Dealers also reported that initial margin 
requirements, which fall outside the scope of the master agreements, were generally little changed 
over the same period.   
While the credit terms applicable to the funding of the various types of securities covered 
in the survey were reported to be little changed, on net, over the past three months, dealers 
indicated that demand for funding had increased for a number of collateral types, particularly for 
securiti zed products.  A lmost  two-thirds of respondents reported increased demand for funding of 
non-agency residential mortgage -backed securities (RMBS ), whereas  about two-fifths  noted 
increased  demand for funding of agency RMBS  and commercial mortgage -backed securities 
(CMBS ).  For a number of the collateral types covered by the survey, dealers characterized 
liquidity and functionin g in the underlying markets as improved relative to three months earlier . 
In response to a set of special questions on warehouse f unding of commercial real estate 
(CRE) loans and syndicated bank loans prior to securitization, notable net fractions of dealers 
reported an increased willingness to fund such  loans on an interim basis at prevailing market rates 
                                                 
1 The March survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over -the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives markets.  In 
addition to the core set of questions, this survey incl uded a set of special questions about the provision of 
warehouse funding for commercial real estate loans and syndicated bank loans prior to securitization, and a 
second set of special questions about client risk appetite.  The 22 institutions participatin g in the survey 
account for almost all of the dealer financing  of dollar -denominated securities to nondealers and are the 
most active intermediaries in OTC derivatives markets.  The survey was conducted during the period from February 19, 2013, to March 4,  2013.  The core questions ask about changes between December 2012 and 
February 2013.

  and under prevailing terms since the middle of 2012.  About one -half of survey respondents also 
indicated that demand for such interim funding for CRE and syndicated bank loans had increased 
over the same period .  
Finally, in response to a set of special questions about client  risk appetite, dealers 
reported that the appetite of most client types to bear investment risk had increased since the 
beginning of 2013.  In particular, nearly one-half of dealers, on net, noted an increase in the risk 
appetite of their most-favored hedge fund customers, while about one -fourth of respondents 
pointed to a similar increase for other hedge funds and insurance companies.    
COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries  
In the March survey, all but two respondents indicated that the a mount of resources and 
attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial 
intermediaries remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  (See the exhibit 
“Management of Concentrated Credit Exposures and Indicators of Supply of Credit.”)   The 
fraction of dealers reporting an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries has declined 
gradually from  the 90 percent pe ak reached in the December 2011 survey .   
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities  
About three -fifths  of dealers indicated that they had increased the amount of resources 
and attention devoted to management of concentrated credit exposure to central counterparties 
and other financial utilities over the past three months, roughly the same share as in previous  
survey s.  About t hree-fourths of broad -scope dealers reported such an increase.   In light of the 
implementation of new regulatory requirements mandating increased central clearing of many 
OTC contracts, continued focus on these exposures is perhaps unsurprising.2  About one- fifth of 
survey  respondents noted that the credit terms their firms  applied to clients on bilateral 
transactions that are not cleared had been influenced to some extent by changes in the practices of 
central counterparties , including changes in margin requirements and haircuts. 
Hedge Funds  
As in December , respondents to the March  survey generally indicated that both price 
terms (such as financing rates) and nonprice terms (including haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, cure periods, cross-default provisions, or other documentation features) offered to 
hedge funds for securities financing and OTC derivative s transactions had remained basically 
                                                 
2 As of March 11, 2013, central counterparty clearing became mandatory for major swap market 
participants, including dealers and active funds.  The mandated products include interest rate swaps, 
forward rate agreements, overnight index swaps, basis swaps, and credit default swap indexes.  The 
immediate effect of the clearing rule on dealers’ counterparty exposures is likely to be limited because 
many dealers have been repo rtedly submitting these trades for central clearing on a voluntary basis for 
some time.

  unchanged over the past three months.   However, about one-fourth of respondents , including  
two-thirds of broad- scope dealers,  reported an increase in the use of financial leverage by hedge 
funds over the past three months .  (See the exhibit “Use of Financial Leverage.”)   A few  
broad- scope dealers also indicated that the availability of additional (and currently unutilized) 
financial leverage under agreements currently in place with hedge funds had increased  somewhat .  
Nearly one-fourth of dealers further  noted that there had been an increase in the intensity of 
efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more -favorable price and nonprice terms over the same 
period.  A similar fraction noted that the provision of dif ferential terms to most-favored hedge 
funds had increase d somewhat over the same period .   
Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts  
Most  respondents to the March survey reported that price and nonprice terms offered to 
trading real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) had remained basically unchanged over the past 
three  months.3  Respondents generally indicated that the use of financial leverage by trading 
REITs had remained basically unchanged.  Respondents also noted  that both the intensity of 
efforts by tradin g REITs to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms and the provision 
of differential terms to most- favored clients were broadly unchanged.  
Mutual F unds, Exchange-T raded  Funds, P ension Plans, and E ndowments  
Respondents to the March  survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to 
mutual funds, exchange- traded  funds ( ETFs ), pension plans, and endowments had remained 
essentially unchanged over the past three months.  P rovision of differential terms to most-favored 
clients  and the intensity of effort s by clients to negotiate more- favorable terms were also reported 
to be little changed , as was the use of financial leverage.   
Insurance Companies 
Respondents to the March  survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms  offered to 
insurance companies had changed little over the past three months, as had the provision of 
differential terms to most- favored clients.  The use of financial leverage by insurance companies 
also remained unchanged.  A few respondents reported an  increase in the intensity of efforts by 
insurance companies to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice terms.   
Separately Managed A ccounts E stablished with Investment Advisers  
Similarly , nearly all of the  dealers reported in the March survey that pri ce and nonprice 
terms negotiated by investment advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically 
unchanged over the past three months.  Provision of differential terms to most- favored clients and 
the intensity of effort by clients to negotia te more -favorable terms were also reported to be little 
changed.  Finally, the use of financial leverage by investment advise rs remained basically 
unchanged.

  Nonfinancial Corporations 
About one- fifth o f respondents indicated that they had eased somewhat pr ice terms 
offered to nonfinancial corporations over the past three months; a couple of dealers  also pointed 
to an easing of nonprice terms.  More than  one-fourth of respondents reported an increase in the 
intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate more-favorable price and nonprice 
terms.  
Mark and Collateral Disputes  
As in previous  surveys , a large majority of respondents in March indicated that the 
volume, persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type 
included in the survey were little changed over the past three months.  A few respondents, 
however, reported a decline in the volume of mark and collateral disputes with dealers  and other 
financial intermediaries as well as with  hedge funds,  over the same period . 
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in previous  surveys , most nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC 
derivatives master agreements were reported to be basically unchanged, on net, over the past 
three months. 4  However, in a departure from prior survey responses, one-fourth of dealers —
including some broad- scope dealers—reported a tightening in acceptable c ollateral, and one- fifth 
of respondents also indicated that requirements, timelines, and thresholds for posting additional 
margin had tightened somewhat over the past three months.   
For all of the contract types included in the survey, nearly all of the dealers indicated that 
initial margins (which fall outside the scope of master agreements) were little changed over the  
past three months.  Posting of nonstandard collateral (that is, collateral other than cash and U.S. 
Treasury securities) also remained basically unchanged on balance.  For most contract types 
included in the survey, dealers generally  indicated that the vo lume , duration, and persistence of 
mark and collateral disputes had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  
However, a few dealers reported a decline in mark and collateral disputes with regard to  contracts 
referencing corporates and securitized products including MBS and ABS as well as commodities .   
SECURITIES FINANCING  
As in previous  surveys , dealers reported that the credit terms under which most types of 
securities included in the survey are financed were little changed, on balance, over the past three months.  However, i n the March survey, dealers reported that demand for funding had  increased 
for a number of collateral types.  (See the exhibit “Measures of Demand for Funding and Market Functioning.”)  In particular, significant  net fractions of respondents noted an increase in demand 
                                                 
4 The survey asks specifically about requirements, timelines, and threshold s for posting additional 
margin, acceptable collateral, recognition of portfolio or diversification benefits, triggers and covenants, 
and other documentation features, including cure periods and cross -default provisions.

  for funding of securitized products.  A lmost  two-thirds of dealers reported increased demand for 
funding of non- agency RMBS , while about two- fifths of respondents pointed to increased 
demand for funding of agency RMBS and CMBS .  In addition, net fractions of dealers ranging 
between about one- fifth and one-fourth reported increased demand for funding of high-yield and 
investment -grade corporate bonds and equities.  Finally, respondents noted an increase in demand 
for term funding—that is , funding with a maturity of 30 days or more—for high -yield corporate 
bonds, agency and non- agency RMBS, and CMBS .   
Survey respondents characterized liquidity and functioning over the past three months as 
improved in a number of markets.  In particular, roughly one- fifth of respondents noted such an 
improvement in the markets for CMBS, non- agency RMBS , consumer ABS, and high-yield 
corporate bonds .5  Finally, as in recent surveys, almost all of the respondents indicated that the 
volume, duration, and persistence of market and collateral disputes were basically unchanged for 
all of the collateral types.   
SPECIAL QUESTIONS ON WAREHOUSE FUNDING OF COMMERCIAL REAL 
ESTATE AND SYNDICATED BANK LOANS PRIOR TO SECURITIZATION  
A number of new CMBS issues and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)  have been 
brought to market over the past nine months.  In some cases, such primary market activities rely on dealers providing funding for the collateral  on an i nterim basis through “warehouse” lending 
facilities  prior to securitization.  The first set of special questions in the March survey asked 
dealers about the provision of warehouse funding for CRE loans and for syndicated bank loans.  
With regard to CRE loans, about one- third of dealers that funded such loans on an interim 
basis through warehouse financing and similar secured facilities indicated that they had eased their terms on the loans somewhat since the middle of 2012.  About one-fourth of respondents 
also noted an increase in their willingness to fund these loans on an interim basis at prevailing 
market rates and under prevailing market terms over the same period.  In addition, about one -half 
of dealers reported an increase in dem and by their clients for funding CRE loans on an interim 
basis since the middle of 2012.  All but one of these respondents were broad- scope dealers.   
With respect to syndicated bank loans, the terms under which these loans are funded on 
an interim basis through warehouse financing and similar secured facilities were reported to have remained basically unchanged since the middle of 2012.  However, about one-third of dealers that 
offered such funding indicated that they had become more willing to fund these loans on an 
interim basis at prevailing market rates and under prevailing market terms.  More than one- half of 
respondents also  reported an increase in demand for funding syndicated bank loans on an interim 
basis since the middle of 2012.  About one- half of  these respondents were broad- scope dealers.  
                                                 
5 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.  This question is not asked with respect to 
equity markets in the core questions.

  SPECIAL QUESTION ON CLIENT RISK APPETITE  
The last set of special questions queried dealers about changes in risk appetite of different 
client types since the beginning of 2013.  Overall, respondents indicated th at the  appetite of most 
client types to bear investment risk had increased .  (See the exhibit “Client Risk Appetite.”)   Most 
notably, nearly one- half of dealers —including a majority of broad -scope dealers —on net, 
reported an increase in risk appetite of their most -favored hedge fund customers, and about  
one-fourth of respondents noted a similar increase for  other hedge funds and insurance 
companies.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We now  view the uncertainty around our projection for economic activity as 
similar to the average level over the past 20 years  (the benchmark used by the FOMC).  
Measures of uncertainty over that period are  importantly influenced by the pronounced 
volatility in activity during the recent recession .1  Uncertainty is comparable to  this high 
benchmark, in part, because of the persiste nt aftereffects of the recent financial crisis and 
recession, which still have uncertain implications for the pace at which the recovery is 
likely to proceed, the magnitude of slack in labor and product markets, and the resilience 
of the financial system.  We continue to view the risks to the projection for real activity  
as skewed to the downside.  R ecent developments in the euro area highlight the fragility 
of the  reform process in several euro -area economies , and we still see a material  risk that 
the European situation could deteriorate markedly , with substantial spillover effects on  
the U.S. economy.  And, despite the resolution since December of some uncertainty, U.S. 
fiscal policy could impose somewhat more restraint than we have assu med.  Importantly, 
U.S. monetary policy has limited capacit y to counteract the effects of a severe economic 
downturn in Europe , tighter fiscal policy,  or any other factor that might unexpectedly 
impose a significant drag on domestic economic activity .  Fin ally, the disappointing pace 
of GDP growth during the recovery might indicate greater supply- side damage than we 
assume in our projection.   
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view these risks as unusually high.  Long-run inflation expectations and the trend 
in actual inflation have remained stable in recent years despite  large fluctuations in the 
prices of crude oil and other commodit ies and persistently wide margins of slack in labor 
and product mark ets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as 
roughly balanced.  On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations, potentially related 
to concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to 
                                                 
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past 
several years.  In particular, as the fixed 20 -year window used to assess the size of typical forecast errors 
has moved forward to include the pronounced volat ility during the past five years, the estimated standard 
errors for out -year projections of the unemployment rate have almost doubled.  As a result, the benchmark 
estimates of uncertainty about economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of  the Great 
Moderation period.  In contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially 
unchanged relative to earlier sample periods.

 execut e a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as 
could a stronger -than- expected recovery.  On the downside, weaker -than- anticipated 
economic growth, coupled with falling commodity prices, could cause actual inflation to 
decline; moreover, such developments, coupled with persistently low levels of resource 
utilization, might prompt inflation expectations to drift down, amplifying the disinflation.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of the staff ’s models.  The first 
scenario focus es on the possibility  that a strong er recovery in residential construction and 
house prices could  spark broad er improvements in the overall economy.  The second  
scenario  considers the macroeconomic implications of an unexpected ly sharp increase in 
long- term interest rates this year.  The next two scenarios ex amine risks to the supply side 
of the economy.  In particular, the third  scenario assumes that the natural rate of 
unemployment declines to a greater extent than assumed in the baseline because a greater 
number of the long- term unemployed leav e the workforce permanently.  The fourth 
scenario explores a different  way to explain a faster  near -term decline in the 
unemployment rate than we are projecting , namely that potential GDP is growing less 
rapidly than we currently assume because of weaker st ructural productivity growth both 
in the recent past and in the future.  The final two scenarios consider risks  to the domestic 
economy from foreign economic developments —first, that the European crisis could 
intensify with severe  spillovers to the U.S. economy and, second, that monetary policy 
abroad becomes more expansionary than assumed in the baseline.   
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and th e last two  
scenarios  using the multicountry SIGMA model .  In the FRB/US simulations , the federal 
funds rate f ollows  an inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule, subject to  the thresholds  
for the  unemployment rate and inflation announced by the FOMC following its  
December  2012 meeting .  For  the SIGMA simulations , we use a broadly similar  policy 
rule, subject to the same unemployment and inflation thresholds but employ ing an 
alternative concept of resource utilization.2  In all of the scenarios, we assume that the 
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.   
                                                 
2 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and t he model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence o f slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 Housing-Led Recovery 
The in creases in house prices, housing starts, and home sales over the past year  
may be pointing to a more robust recovery in the housing market than is assumed in the 
baseline.  Indeed, given the subdued rate of household formation for the past several 
years , there may be scope for a  very substantial increase in the  demand f or housing; 
moreover, by some metrics house prices remain  below their equilibrium levels, 
suggesting that home values  could appreciate somewhat more than assumed in the 
baseline.  In this scenario, a stronger housing recovery, along with reduced uncertainty about the durability of the expansion more broadly, sparks a cycle of increased consumer and business confidence, faster hiring, and improved financial conditions that leads to stronger spending by households and firms.  As a result, real GDP rises at an average annual rate of around 4½ percent over 2013 and 2014, and the unemployment rate falls 
below 6½ percent in the first half of 2014 and stands at 4¾ percent in late 2015—½ per centage point below  our estimate of  the longer -run value of the natural rate.  W ith 
rapidly disappearing resource slack, unit labor costs eventually rise more rapidly than in the baseline, pushing consumer price inflation  up to a little over 2 percent in 2016 and 
2017.  The federal funds rate  lifts off in mid -2014 and remains well  above the baseline 
thereafter.   
Higher Long-Term Interest Rates 
In the staff’ s baseline forecast, long -term interest rates rise steadily and 
substa ntially over the med ium term , in part reflecting a rise in term premiums .  But term 
premiums could climb even more quickly than we project for any number of reasons, including an incre ase in inflation risk premiums,  a quicker and more substantial reversal 
of safe -haven demands for U.S. T reasury securities than the staff anticipates , or an 
unwinding of leveraged positions in anticipation of a cessation of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve.  In this scenario , yields on 10- year T reasur y securities  and BBB- rated  
corporate bonds reach 3¾ percent and 6 percent , respectively,  by early next year, roughly 
a full percentage point above the baseline projection.  The resulting tightening in ove rall 
financial conditions shaves ½ percentage point off the average annual gro wth rate of real 
GDP over the next three years, and the unemployment rate declines to only 7 perce nt by 
late 2015, ¾ percentage point above the baseline.  Core PCE  inflation remains around 
1½ percent until the end of 2016.  Under these conditions, the first increase in the federal 
funds rate is delayed until the end of 2016.

 Lower Natural Rate  
We were surprised by the extent of the reduction in the unemployment rate last 
year.  In the January Tealbook, we responded to this surprise by trimming  a small amount 
off our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment in 2012 and this year.  In this 
scenario, we consider the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment declines 
substantially faster  than assumed in the baseline, and that it will reach  5¼ percent by late 
2013—several years earlier than in the baseline.  However, this  more rapid decline in the 
natural rate is not assumed to reflect  an improvement in labor market functioning, but 
instead to be the result of  a greater number of the long- term unemployed permanently 
leaving the labor force.   The combination of a more rapidly falling natural rate and a 
steeper downward trend in labor force participation implies little change in potential labor input—and thus only a small revision from the baseline in potential GDP —through 
2015.
3  Under these conditions, real GDP  and employment  run close to t he baseline, but 
the unemployment rate declines  more quickly  and falls  below its threshold value in  
mid-2015.  As a result, the federal funds rate begin s to rise one quarter earlier than in the 
baseline.   
Supply -Side Damage  
In the January Tealbook, we attributed much of the surprisingly rapid decline in 
the unemployment rate during 2012 to somewhat lower potential output growth over recent history.  How ever, we may still be overestimating the growth rate of potential 
GDP , perhaps because the financial crisis has caused greater  structural damage than  we 
assum e.  In t his scenario , the current level of potential output is 1 percent lower than in 
the baseline because of s maller -than- estimated gains in structural productivity over the 
past few years .  Moreover,  these smaller  productivity  gains  continue, shaving  
¼ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of potential GDP going forward.  
As a result, real GDP rises  only about 2½ percent per year, on average, in 2013 and 2014, 
and economic growth remains below the baseline through  2017.  Given the dow nward 
revision to p otential output in 2012 and beyond in this scenario, the output gap is 
narrower, and, as a result , Okun’s law implies  a more rapid decline in the unemployment 
rate.  With the unemployment rate falling below its threshold value in early 2015, the 
                                                 
3 Alternatively, the natural rate of unemployment could decline because of an improvement in 
labor market functioning.  In this case, the nat ural rate would fall but labor force participation would not, 
resulting in higher potential output.  As a result, GDP growth would be somewhat higher than in the 
“Lower Natural Rate” scenario, but the unemployment rate would be little different.

 federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound  two quarters earlier than 
in the baseline.    
European Crisis with Severe Spillovers   
In this scenario , the improvements witnessed  in European financial markets since 
the middle of last year are assumed to be short- lived, and Europe plunges into another 
bout of severe stress , much worse than that seen to date.  While we think  the likelihood of 
such an outcome has declined, recent political events in Italy highlight that the European 
situation remains fragile and could deteriorate sharply, possibly triggered by a disorderly sovereign default, the failure of a large European financial institution, or a loss of confidence by the public in the ability of European governments to resolve the crisis.  In 
this scenario, the greater stress  prompts private  and most sovereign  borrowing costs in 
Europe to soar , with corporate bond spreads rising 400 basis points above the baseline; in 
addition, the confidence of European households and businesses plummets.  Real GDP in Europe declines about 8 percent relative to the baseline by the second half of 2014, despite a 25 percent depreciation of  the real effective exchange value of  the euro.  
Europe’s difficulties are assumed to have important financial and economic spillovers to 
the rest of the world, including the United States.  U.S. economic activity contracts 
sharply, as U.S. corporate bond spreads rise by about 300 basis points, equity prices plunge, credit availability tightens, and household and business confidence erodes.  In 
addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net expor ts.  In all, because of greater resource slack and lower commodity 
and import prices, total U.S. consumer prices fall in 2013, before beginning to rise in 
2014 as economic activity starts to recover.   U.S. real GDP falls  about 1 percent this year  
and increases only ½ percent in 2014.  The unempl oyment rate rises to 9¼ percent in 
2014 and then gradually decline s.  With inflationary pressures subdued and the 
unemployment rate above its 6½ percent threshold value until late 2018, the federal funds rate does not lift off from its effective lower bound until 2019.   
More Expansionary Monetary Policy in AFEs 
In this scenario, we consider the possibility that monetary policy in the advanced 
foreign economies (AFEs) becomes considerably more expansive than in the baseline.  Slow economic growth and, in some countries, undesirably low projected inflation rates 
could bolster the case for further monetary easing in the AFEs, especially in the United 
Kingdom, Japan, and the euro area.  We assume that the easing policies adopted in each AFE country, which might  include asset purchases or longer -term central bank lending,

 reduce term premiums on 10-year government bonds by 50 basis points on average for 
the AFEs.  We also assume that AFE central banks credibly indicate that they will keep 
policy rates unchanged for two quarters longer than in the baseline.  These easing 
measures lower the real exchange value of AFE currencies by 3 percent in 2013.4  The 
combination of easier financial conditions and exchange rate depreciations boosts AFE economic growth in 2013 and 2014 by ¾ percentage point relative to the baseline and causes AFE core inflation to run ½  percentage point faster.   
The expansion in f oreign activity is large enough to offset the effects of a 
sustained real dollar appreciation of about 1 percent, leaving the performance of the U.S. economy little changed.
5  With r eal U.S. net exports rising  slightly, U.S. real GDP grows  
2¾ percent in 2013 and 3¼ percent in 2014, marginally faster than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation runs a touch faster as well, averaging somewhat more than 1¾ percent in 
2014 and beyond.  As in the baseline, the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent in 
the third quarter of 2015, and the target for the federal funds rate is not increased until the fourth quarter of 2015.  
                                                 
4 In line  with the LSAP experience for the United States, the AFE central bank operations to 
expand their balance sheets are assumed to prompt a decline of 2 percent in those countries’ real exchange 
rates.  The AFE central banks’ indication that they will keep policy rates unchanged for two quarters longer 
leads to a further 1 percent depreciation of their real exchange rates.   
5 The magnitude of the appreciation of the real U .S. dollar (1 percent) is less than the magnitude of 
the depreciation of the AFE currencies (3 percent) because the U .S. broad real dollar also includes the 
emerging market economy (EME) currencies, which move little against the dollar.  The results for the 
EMEs are discussed in the “Currency Wars” box in the International Economic Development s and Outlook 
section of this Tealbook.  Importantly, the AFE policy actions stimulate economic activity in the EMEs.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
