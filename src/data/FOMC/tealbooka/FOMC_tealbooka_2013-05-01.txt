Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received sin ce the March Tealbook has been mixed.  In 
the labor market, data on private payro lls for March were disappointing, although the 
unemployment rate showed a further small d ecline.  Industrial production also was weak 
in March, but it followed a strong February ga in.  On the spending side, real PCE growth 
for the first quarter as a whole has been  revised up, reflecting solid motor vehicle 
expenditures and surprisingly strong purchases of energy-related services.  However, the 
latest readings on retail sales and business orders and shipments were soft.  After 
factoring in rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy and the rebound in farm production from 
last year’s drought, real GDP is  estimated to have risen at a 3 percent annual rate in the 
first quarter.  We expect real GDP growth to step down to 1½ percent in the second 
quarter as the temporary factor s boosting real PCE wane, households continue to adjust to 
higher taxes, federal spending declines furthe r, and the accumulation of farm inventories 
levels out at a more normal pace.  On average,  the projected pace of  growth for the first 
half of the year is close to our  estimate in the March Tealbook. 
Our medium-term projection for real activity is also ve ry similar to the March 
Tealbook, with real GDP projected to rise at an annual rate of 2¾ percent over the second 
half of this year before accelerating to gains of 3¼ percent and 3½ percent in 2014 and 
2015, respectively.  We have changed our assump tions for federal fiscal policy to take on 
board the full federal spending sequestration, in contrast to th e partial sequestration that 
we assumed in March.  However, the added drag  from this tighter fiscal policy is largely 
offset in our projection by the direct stimulus  from lower long-term interest rates—driven 
in part by our assumption that the current LS AP program will turn out to be somewhat 
larger than assumed in the previous Teal book—along with lower proj ected oil prices.  
These small revisions notwithstanding, the mode st acceleration in real output after this 
year continues to reflect the anticipated waning of a number of forces that have been restraining growth for some time, most not ably the economic and fiscal situation in 
Europe, restrictive U.S. fiscal policy, and mediocre consumer and business sentiment 
domestically.   
Consistent with the projected gradua l strengthening in economic activity, we 
expect the unemployment rate to decline sl owly from about 7½ percent in the current 
quarter to 6¼ percent at the end of 2015—about  ½ percentage point above the projected 
natural rate.  Given its slightly lower star ting point, the unemployment rate crosses the

  6½ percent threshold relevant for funds rate policy setting in th e third quarter of 2015, 
one quarter earlier than  in the March Tealbook.  
Incoming data on core consumer prices have been a bit softer than we had 
expected, and oil prices have declined c onsiderably.  Accordingly, our projection for 
consumer price inflation in the near term ha s been revised notably lower.  However, we 
view these developments as having only transitory implications for inflation, so our 
medium-term inflation projection is not very  different from previous Tealbooks.  With 
persistent slack in resource utilization and stable long-run inflation expectations, core inflation is projected to remain subdued at about 1¾ percent in 2014 and 2015.  Headline 
inflation is expected to be below core in flation throughout the medium term, reflecting a 
projected downward tren d in energy prices.   
We view the degree of uncertainty associat ed with our projection of real activity 
as being about average in comparison with th e experience of the past 20 years, which is 
the benchmark used by the FOMC.  That said, we continue to view the risks to the projection for real activity to be skewed to the downside, in part because of the 
constraints on monetary policy imposed by the effective lower bound.  We also regard 
risks to inflation as being about normal, meas ured by the same historical standard as for 
real activity, and that these risks are roughly balanced.  This  assessment of risk is the 
same as was reported in the March Tealbook. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We have boosted our assumption, rela tive to the March Tealbook, for the 
cumulative purchase of long-term securities under the LSAP program.  We now assume 
that purchases will continue through the e nd of the year, although the pace will be 
gradually reduced from the current $85 bill ion per month beginning with the June FOMC 
meeting, resulting in cumulative purchases of $750 billion in 2013—$250 billion more 
than previously assumed.   
A tension remains, however, between our policy assumptions and market 
expectations for cumulative asset purchases in 2013 and beyond, as the latter also appear 
to have risen over the intermeeting period.  Thus, as in the March Tealbook, we assume 
total purchases still fall about $500 billion short of current ma rket expectations, and so 
we continue to anticipate that investors w ill bring their policy expectations in line with

  staff assumptions in coming months, thereby mode stly increasing long-term  interest rates.  
Although the assumed magnitude of this “learn ing effect” is about the same as in the 
March Tealbook, its timing has been pushed back, with the bulk of the adjustment taking 
place during the third quarter. 
Our assumptions for the federal funds ra te are essentially unchanged this round.  
In particular, the assumed policy rule continue s to project that the federal funds rate will 
lift off from its effective lo wer bound in the fourth quarter of 2015, although the average 
level of the federal funds ra te that quarter is revised up about ¼ percentage point, 
reflecting slightly less slack.   
Other Interest Rates 
Since the March Tealbook, the 10-year Tr easury yield has dropped about 35 basis 
points to 1.7 percent, in contra st to the small increase that we had expected.  We interpret 
that decline as larg ely reflecting more downbeat sen timent among market participants 
about the global economic outlook, as well as  the unexpectedly aggressive easing of 
monetary policy in Japan; in  addition, rates have likely shifted down in response to 
revised expectations for cumulative Federal Reserve asset purchases in the context of 
domestic economic data that fell short of expectations.  We anticip ate some of the recent 
decline in Treasury yields to reverse in the period ahead as risk sentiment improves, so 
we now project a somewhat steeper rise in yields over the rema inder of 2013.  Beyond 
2013, the upward trend in the bond yield reflect s the movement of the 10-year valuation 
window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual 
waning of the effects of the FO MC’s balance sheet policies. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have declined about 30 basis points 
since the March Tealbook, and th eir implied risk spreads have risen a little.  We expect 
this spread to narrow gradually over th e forecast horizon and to end 2015 about 
½ percentage point lower, at which time the yield on BBB-rated bonds is 5½ percent.  
Conventional 30-year mortgage rates have declined about 25 basis points since the March 
Tealbook and are expected to rise in line with benchmark Treasury yields to reach about 
5¼ percent by the end of 2015. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
The Dow Jones U.S. total stock market inde x is similar to what we wrote down in 
the March Tealbook, despite the deterioration in  sentiment signaled by Treasury yields.

  We project that equity prices will rise at  an average annual rate  of about 9 percent 
through the end of 2015, leaving the path slightly higher th an in the March Tealbook. 
Recent readings on house prices from Co reLogic, along with other house price 
indicators, have been a bit st ronger than anticipated.  Howeve r, we suspect that seasonal-
adjustment issues and other id iosyncratic factors may be affe cting those data, and thus the 
level of house prices in our projection returns to the same path as in the March Tealbook 
by the end of this year.  In particular, we continue to forecast that  house prices will rise 
8 percent in 2013 before decelerating to a 4 pe rcent rate of increase in 2014 and 2015.  (A 
more detailed discussion of this subject  can be found in the box “House Prices.”) 
Fiscal Policy 
We now expect fiscal policy to exert mo re restraint on economic growth over the 
forecast period than we did in the March Tealbook.  Given the absence of visible progress 
on resolving the legislative stalemate, we ha ve now incorporated the full effects of the 
sequestration into our projection as opposed to roughly half in the pr evious projection.  
With this new assumption, fiscal policy at all le vels of government is projected to restrain 
the rate of real GDP growth in 2013 by 1¼ percentage points (excluding multiplier 
effects)—about ¼ percentage point more than in the Marc h Tealbook.  We forecast that 
the restraint on the rate of growth in aggreg ate demand from fiscal policy actions to be 
approximately ¾ percentage point in 2014 and to be around ¼ percentage point in 2015; 
both figures are only marginally larger than  in the previous Tealbook, as we expect a 
substantial portion of the spending reductions  from the sequestrati on to show through in 
the second half of this year.  As a result of  policy actions to reduce the deficit and our 
expectation that further improvements in the economy will generate larger gains in tax 
receipts, the federal budget de ficit, which was 7 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2012, is 
projected to narrow to 4½ percent of GDP this  fiscal year and to decline further to 2¼ 
percent of GDP by fiscal 2015.  
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We estimate that real GDP in the foreign economies increased at an annual rate of 
2¼ percent in the first quarte r, about ½ percentage point  lower than in the March 
Tealbook, primarily reflecting weaker-than-expect ed growth in China.  We now see less 
momentum in China and other EMEs, which, together with the weak tone of the 
incoming data from Europe, led us to revise down the foreign outlook a bit.  Nonetheless, 
we expect foreign growth to pick up to about  3 percent over the remainder of the year, as 
China’s economy recovers from the first qua rter’s unusually slow pace, the euro area

 House  Prices 
The major national house price indexes,  which are  shown in the lower‐left figure, have risen 
6 to 11 percent since  the beginning  of 2012.  The recovery  of house prices has been broad  
based geographically,  with  90 percent  of local markets having experienced  price gains over 
the year ending in February.  
Both supply and demand factors have contributed  to th e rise in house prices over the past 
year.  With regard to supply, a  below‐average number of homes have been on the market 
for sale, reflecting  both the relatively low  level of new home construction  and a decrease  in 
the flow of distressed properties  being listed for sale.  At the same time, historically  low 
mortgage  interest rates and improving  macroeconomic  conditions  have strengthened  the 
demand for housing.   Moreover,  in contrast to previous  housing recoveries,  demand has 
been supported  by sizable purchases  of homes among corporate  investors  using 
substantial  cash financing  and reportedly  intending  to rent out single‐family homes on a 
large scale.  Staff estimates  suggest that these investors  accounted  for about  one‐half of 
last year’s increase in home sales.  Accordingly,  the recent increases  in house prices have 
occurred  in an environment  where access to mortgage  credit has remained  tight and 
aggregate  mortgage lending has not expanded.  
The bottom‐right figure  presents our current forecast for house prices,  which has  been 
revised up  significantly  since  the January Tealbook  in response  to evidence  that a more 
durable housing recovery has taken hold.  We expect the strength  in house prices to 
continue through the  end of this year, resulting in an 8 percent  increase for 2013 as a whole, 
but we expect the pace of appreciation  to slow to about 4 percent per year in 2014  and 
2015.  Factors contributing  to the  projected  deceleration include:   (1) a reduction  in housing 
affordability  associated  with  the staff’s projection  that mortgage  interest rates will rise to 
more than 5 percent  by 2015, (2) an  anticipated  decline in corporate  investor activity as 
higher house prices reduce the expected  investment  returns on housing,  and (3) a 
projected  rise in the pace of new construction.   By the end of 2015, we expect nominal 
house prices to still be 15 percent  below their 2006 peak.

 Among the many risks  attending  our house price forecast, we see two  as particularly  
important.   On the downside,  the way in which the  remaining  inventory  of seriously 
delinquent  loans will be liquidated  remains uncertain.   In states with  nonjudicial  foreclosure  
processes, lenders have  been able  to complete  large volumes of foreclosures  and 
corporate  investors have been quite  willing to purchase  foreclosed  properties  and 
rehabilitate  them for the  rental market.   In contrast,  an outsized “shadow”  inventory  
remains in states requiring  judicial foreclosure  proceedings,  and these  properties  could 
enter the market in  the next year or two.  If this inventory  is released to the  market faster  
than investor s and other home buyers are willing to absorb  it, the additional  supply of 
homes for sale could exert significant  downward  pressure on house prices in those areas.   
On the upside, very tight mortgage  underwriting  is likely masking strong underlying  
demand for housing.   If so, a faster‐than‐expected  improvement in  the availability  of credit 
could accommodate  much  of this underlying  demand, thereby boosting  house prices more 
than in our baseline projection.  
One additional  risk to our house price forecast is that housing could be overvalued  
currently,  in which case  prices could fall below our projection  even if fundamentals  improve 
over the medium term.  However,  a nationwide  measure of house prices relative to rents 
(shown  in the bottom‐left figure), which provides  one measure of house prices relative to 
housing’s  current fundamental  value, suggests no such  overvaluation.   This ratio plunged in 
2007 and 2008 and  has moved about sideways,  on net, since  then.  Our forecasts  for house  
prices and rents imply that the price‐to‐rent ratio will just edge up through the end of 2015, 
remaining  near levels seen  in the early 2000s. 
Currently,  rapid home price appreciation  appears to be fairly localized,  as nominal house 
prices have increased  more than 10 percent in only about one in five large metro areas.  
Moreover,  even  in those markets  where home prices have increased  rapidly, the increases  
do not seem outsized with respect to rising nominal rents.  Indeed,  as shown in the 
bottom‐right  figure, price‐to‐rent ratios in markets with  fast house price growth recently, 
such  as Phoe nix and Miami, have increased  somewhat  but remain close to the  levels seen  in 
the early 2000s.

  pulls out of recession, and aggressive monetary easing gives the Japanese economy a 
significant boost.  Beyond this year, foreign grow th is expected to rise to 3½ percent by 
2015, as monetary policy remains accommodative,  the U.S. recovery gathers steam, and 
financial conditions in Europe normalize. 
Since the time of the March Tealbook, the nominal dollar is about unchanged, on 
average, against a broad set of currencies.  Weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data in 
the United States put modest downward pressu re on the dollar’s exchange value against a 
number of currencies, balanc ing the effect of ongoing yen depreciation and the weaker 
foreign outlook.  Going forward, we project th e broad real dollar to depreciate at an 
annual rate of about 2½ percent through 2015, as European financial stresses gradually abate, safe-haven demands for the dollar eas e, and trend depreciation continues against 
the emerging market currencies.   
Oil and Other Commodity Prices  
The spot price of Brent crude oil has dr opped sharply since early April and closed 
at $100 per barrel on April 23, down about $11 from the time of the March Tealbook.  
The price of West Texas Intermediate has fa llen about $3 per barrel over the same period.  
Futures prices have declined as well, albeit  by less than spot prices.  These declines 
apparently reflect market participants’ conc erns over the strength of economic growth in 
the United States and abroad, particularly in  China, against a bac kdrop of strong global 
oil supply, supported by increasing North Amer ican production.  Accordingly, we have 
revised down our forecast for the price of imported oil by about $5 per barrel through the 
remainder of 2013; the downward revision then tapers gradually to about $3 per barrel by 
the end of 2015.  With these revisions, the pri ce of imported oil is projected to remain at 
about $91 per barrel through the end of 2013 and then to decline slowly over the 
remainder of the forecast period, reac hing $86 per barrel at the end of 2015. 
A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has fallen about 1¾ percent since the 
time of the March Tealbook, primarily reflectin g lower prices for a number of metals 
following weaker-than-expected economic growth  in China.  On average, food prices are 
little changed from the previous Tealbook.  Overall, nonfuel commodity prices are 
expected to remain about flat at their new lower level through the duration of the forecast.

  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We estimate that, after having just edged up in  the fourth quarter of last year, real 
GDP rose at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, boosted by the rebound from 
the effects of last year’s dr ought and Hurricane Sandy.  Output growth in the first quarter 
is ¼ percentage point higher than in th e March Tealbook, reflecting a surprise to 
household consumption that we perceive as la rgely transitory.  In the second quarter, we 
expect GDP growth to slow to a 1½ percent pace, as the rebound from the drought and 
hurricane wane, the increase in consumer spending slows, and the effects of the 
sequestration show through more appreciably to  federal spending.  On  average, real GDP 
is expected to grow at an annual rate of  2¼ percent over the first half of the year. 
Household Spending 
We estimate that real PCE ro se at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the first quarter, 
up ¾ percentage point from the March Tealbook.  Weather-related expenditures in the 
energy services category and strong household spending on new and used motor vehicles 
account for the bulk of the upward revision.  In  contrast, increases in retail sales other 
than autos and spending on non- energy services were more downbeat; we in terpret those 
data as suggesting that households have begun to adjust to the lowe r level of disposable 
income implied by January’s increase in pa yroll and income taxes.  Looking ahead, a 
boost to purchasing power from ongoing declines in gasoline prices will likely provide a 
partial offset to the tax hit for households.  Nevertheless, as the adjustment to higher 
taxes continues, and as the jump in spending on energy services unwinds, we expect the pace of PCE growth to step down to 2¼ percent in the second quarter, ¼ percentage point 
below our forecast in the March Tealbook.   
Activity in the housing sector has co ntinued to strengthen, and near-term 
indicators point to further increases in spending through the second quarter, much like 
what we wrote down in the March Tealbook.  Both new and existing home sales have 
continued to move up, on net, in recent mont hs, and single-family housing starts averaged 
an annual rate of 630,000 units in the first quarter, up markedly from the previous 
quarter.  The low cost of housing, continue d job gains, and growing optimism about 
future house prices appear to be providing important support to the recovery in housing 
investment; these factors, combined with strengthening demand for multifamily 
dwellings and rebuilding afte r Hurricane Sandy, now lead us to project gains in 
residential investment averaging nearly 20 percen t at an annual rate over the first half of 
this year.  Nevertheless, ac tivity in the housing sector co ntinues to be restrained by

  limited access to mortgage credit for many individuals, along with some wariness about 
the durability of the recovery. 
Business Investment 
Real spending on equipment and software  (E&S) appears to be growing at a 
modest pace, after a transitory  surge in expenditures in th e fourth quarter.  New capital 
goods orders have moved back up in line with shipments; however, forward-looking 
indicators such as survey measures of business sentiment and analysts’ earnings 
expectations for capital goods producers have be en lackluster.  All told, we forecast that 
real business spending on E&S will increase at an average annual rate of 2½ percent in 
the first half of this year, half the rate in the March Tealbook.1 
Investment in nonresidential structures likely fell in the first qu arter; this decline 
primarily reflects a sharp drop-off in expe nditures on power-generating structures, as 
firms rushed in the fourth quarter to comp lete investments in wind power before the 
scheduled expiration of an  associated tax credit.2  Excluding power-generating structures, 
nonresidential building investment has moved up moderately in recent quarters, on net, 
and we expect more of the same in the current quarter.  Overall, the level of investment in 
nonresidential buildings remains relatively low, as high vacancy rates, tight financing conditions for new construction, and relatively low commercial  property prices continue 
to restrain demand for new structures.  In cont rast, the level of inve stment in drilling and 
mining structures remains elevated, suppor ted by high oil prices and the continued 
exploitation of new drilling technologies.  Cutting through the quarterly variation, 
investment in nonresidential structures is projected to be about unchanged, on average, 
over the first half of the year; even so, this  tepid performance is stronger than what we 
wrote down in the March Tealbook. 
Estimates from the staff’s flow-of-goods system and indicators of inventory 
sentiment from the ISM survey show no evid ence of sizable inventory imbalances.  
Consequently, real nonfarm inventory investment  is expected to be roughly neutral for 
                                                 
1 The quarterly pattern for E&S spending over the firs t half of the year is affected by the delay in 
deliveries of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, which holds down aircraft investment in the first quarter and boosts 
it in the second and third quarters.  These swings in aircraft deliveries should have no measurable effect on overall GDP, as they are offset in inventories.  
2 We think that the Census Bureau’s methods fo r calculating construction put in place (CPIP) have 
not yet captured the drop-off in investment in wind power structures at the beginning of this year.  Because 
the BEA uses these data in constructing its estimate s of real GDP, we suspect that the BEA’s advance 
estimate of real GDP growth for the first quarter will be overstated by 0.2 percentage point.

  GDP growth in the first half of this ye ar, largely unrevised from the March Tealbook 
assumptions.  In the farm sector, real inventory investment is expected to boost GDP 
growth by ¾ percentage point in  the first quarter, as farm output returns to normal after 
having been held down by the drought in the seco nd half of last year.  We expect this 
impetus to growth to disapp ear in the s econd quarter. 
Government 
We estimate that total real federal purchases contract ed at an annual rate of 
5 percent in the first quarter—a more pronounced decline than estimated in the March Tealbook—reflecting weak incoming data on de fense spending.  We interpret a portion 
of this surprise as an earlier-than-anticipated onset of the effects of sequestration.  Looking ahead, although we now assume a full sequestration, we also now assume that 
the larger part of the expenditure reductions will not be felt until the second half of this year, an assumption driven by an announced pace for furloughs by the Department of 
Defense and some other agencies that was sl ower than we had expected.  Accordingly, 
we continue to project real fe deral spending to decline at an  annual rate of 10 percent in 
the second quarter, about the same pace as in the March Tealbook.    
The budgets of state and local governm ents continue to improve, reducing 
somewhat the pressure on these jurisdictions to cut expenditures.  Overall, we expect 
their real purchases to decrease only margin ally in the first half of 2013, little changed 
from the March Tealbook. 
Foreign Trade  
After falling at the end of last year, real exports of goods and services are 
expected to increase at an average annual rate of  5 percent in the first half of this year, a 
little more than in the March Tealbook, because of stronger incoming data through 
February.  (As with business investment, the quarterly pattern of e xports is affected by 
the assumed delays of deliveries of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.)  Imports are also 
expected to pick up after having declined in  the second half of la st year; we project 
increases of about 3¾ percent, on average, in the first half of this year.  Overall, net 
exports are expected to add a bout 0.1 percentage point to GDP  growth in the first half.     
The Industrial Sector 
For the first quarter as a whole, manufacturi ng output rose at a brisk annual rate of 
5¼ percent, supported in part by the recovery in production fr om last year’s hurricane. 
Nevertheless, first-quarter growth in manufacturing output  was 1¾ percentage points

  below what we wrote down in the March Te albook.  In particular, factory output in 
March edged down 0.1 percent, as broad-based d eclines more than offset a jump in the 
production of motor vehicles and parts.  More over, forward-looking indicators of activity 
have also softened, on balance, with the late st readings on new orders from the national 
and regional manufacturing surv eys consistent with only small gains in factory output. 
Nevertheless, the ongoing recovery in cons truction should provide support for the 
manufacturing sector in coming months, and a sizable increase in motor vehicle 
assemblies is projected for the second quarter .  All told, factory out put is expected to 
increase 3 percent in the second quarter, a bout 1½ percentage points below the March 
projection. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The contour of our medium-term projection for real GDP is quite similar to the 
forecast in the March Tealbook, as the balance of incoming data were approximately in 
line with our thinking and the effects of the changes in our conditioning assumptions 
have been about offsetting.  With regard to  the latter, on the downside, we now expect 
federal spending to restrain economic growth a little more than we assumed in our most recent projection.  On the upside, our projection fo r the path of interest  rates is lower than 
in the previous Tealbook, and a downward revisi on to oil prices also provides support for 
domestic economic activity over the medium term.  
All told, real GDP is projected to expand 2½ percent this year.  As in the March 
Tealbook, this pace is about ¾ percentage point above the rate of GDP growth last year.  
Thereafter, our forecast calls for real GDP gr owth to move up to 3¼ percent in 2014 and 
3½ percent in 2015.  This acceleration in economic activity is supported by our 
assumption that a number of the headwinds that  have restrained the growth in economic 
activity over the past several years will ease.  In particular, we expect the restraint on economic growth from tighter federal fiscal policy to lessen and Eu ropean financial and 
economic conditions to improve.  Given highly accommodative monetary policy, a growing sense among households and firms th at downside risks to the recovery have 
diminished, falling asset risk premiums, and a further healing of the housing market, we 
project household spending, business invest ment, and hiring will accelerate over time.   
This story plays out most clearly in  consumer spending.  Real personal 
consumption expenditures are expected to grow  2¾ percent this year before stepping up 
to a pace of 3½ percent in 2014 and 3¾ percent in 2015—a path that is slightly higher

  than in our March forecast.  We anticipat e that this acceleration will be supported by 
rising personal disposable incomes, which are facilitated by improved labor market 
conditions that are themselves driven by rising household expenditu res—a virtuous circle 
of rising spending, employment, and confiden ce.  Along the way, increases in household 
wealth, reflecting the projected rise in equ ity and house prices, are also anticipated to 
continue to boost consumption growth. 
The same forces that are e xpected to boost consumer spe nding are also at work in 
our projection for the housing sector; im proving household confidence and rising 
employment, income, and wealth support both a brisk pace of construction and further 
increases in house prices, both actual and expected.  However, these effects are tempered 
by the sizable increase in mortgage interest rate s that we expect to occur over the medium 
term.  All told, single-family housing starts are projected to rise from about 540,000 units 
in 2012 to a bit over 1 million units in 2015.  Likewise, continued strong demand for 
rental units is anticipated to keep construction in the multifamily sector on a steady 
uptrend. 
Decreases in total govern ment purchases are a noteworthy drag on economic 
growth in 2013, particularly with the full sequestration.  We  expect the restraint from 
declines in real federal government purchases  to recede over the medium term as the pace 
of fiscal consolidation slows and as the downsizing of spending on overseas military 
operations moderates.  Our new fiscal assumptions have some effect on our projection for 
spending by state and local governments, as we have revised down our assumptions for federal grants to states.  But that effect is relatively small, and with state and local 
government budget conditions anticipated to slow ly improve, real purchases are expected 
to be roughly flat this ye ar and next and then to be gin to rise a little in 2015. 
Business investment in E&S is projected to increase 6 percent per year in 2014 
and 2015, a bit faster than in 2013.  Broadly speaking, the modest acceleration in 
business output that we project over the medi um term should help support further gains in 
investment spending despite the rising l ong-term corporate borrowing rates in our 
projection.  In addition, spending in  the second half of this year  is projected to be boosted 
by a small pull-forward of investment from next  year into this year in response to the 
expected expiration of the 50 pe rcent bonus depreciation provision at the end of this year.   
The projected acceleration in business output also raises firms’ demand for 
nonresidential space, leading to very gradual improvements in vacancy rates and

  commercial real estate prices.  With credit availability also anti cipated to improve, we 
project that the growth of nonresidential construction spending excluding drilling and 
mining will pick up over the medium term.  By  contrast, growth in drilling and mining 
investment is expected to slow from its recent rapid pace as o il prices drift down.  
Overall, our forecast calls for growth in invest ment in real nonresidential structures to 
average a little more than 3 percent in 2014 and 2015.  
Inventory investment and the external se ctor are both expect ed to be roughly 
neutral for real GDP growth over the medium term.  With little sign of inventory 
imbalances currently, we expect firms to keep inventories in line with final sales over the forecast period.   Meanwhile, real exports of goods and services are projected to rise 
5¼ percent in 2014 and 6¾ percent in 2015 in response to accelerating foreign activity 
and a depreciating foreign exchange value of th e dollar.  Real import growth is expected 
to be 4¾ percent in 2014 and 5 percent in 2015, as the upward impetus from the recovery 
in U.S. demand is partially offset by the negative effect of dollar depreciation.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION  
Near-Term Labor Market Developments 
Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, although we read the 
latest employment report as sl ightly weaker than we had e xpected.  In particular, total 
nonfarm payroll employment rose only 88,000 last month, well below our expectations.  
For the first quarter as a whole, increase s in payroll employment averaged 168,000 per 
month, notably slower than the 210,000 rate poste d in the fourth quarter  but still a fairly 
solid pace of job gains.   
The unemployment rate edged down furthe r to 7.6 percent in March, a touch 
lower than we expected.  Although the labor fo rce participation rate  also fell in March, 
we nevertheless view the si gnal from the unemployment rate decline as suggesting a 
slightly tighter labor market.  Consistent with this interpre tation, March data also showed 
declines in the BLS’s measure of marginally attached worker s, in the number of people 
who are out of the labor force but say they  want a job, and in the number of people 
working part time but would prefer to work full time.  Indeed, the broader U-5 and U-6 
measures of unemployment declined by more in Marc h than did the official 
unemployment rate.

  Although the sharp slowdown in payroll growth in March gives us some pause, 
forward-looking indicators of labor market activity generally appear consistent with 
moderate job gains in coming quarters.  The job openings rate in the JOLTS edged up in 
February and is currently at the top of the ra nge seen over the past year.  In addition, the 
job quit rate, which measures the willingness of workers to change employers and is 
positively related to labor demand, has also moved up in recent months.  That said, initial claims for unemployment insurance thus far in April have been running a touch higher than a month ago, and indicators of hiring and hiring plans have moved sideways of late.  
In all, we now expect private payrolls to expand an average of about 160,000 per month 
in the second quarter, 20,000 less than in the March Tealbook, and for the unemployment 
rate to hold steady at 7.6 percent over the next few months.
3   
Potential GDP and the Natura l Rate of Unemployment 
After the March Tealbook, we received revi sed data on capital services from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics that reduced so mewhat our estimates of capital deepening in 
recent history.  We partially offset the downw ard revision to capital deepening with an 
upward revision to our estimates of structural multifactor productivity.  On net, this adjustment results in a downward revision to the level of potential output that cumulates to ¼ percent by the end of 2012.
4  We continue to assume th at potential output will rise 
about 2 percent per year over the projecti on period, and that the natural rate of 
unemployment will edge down from 6 per cent in 2012 to 5¾ per cent in 2015 as the 
degree of mismatch between labor demand a nd labor supply, which was elevated during 
the recession and early recovery, eases.   As in previous projections, the small acceleration 
in potential output in our forecast reflects a st ep-up in capital deepening arising from the 
post-recession rebound in business investment as  well as the projected decline in the 
natural rate of unemployment.    
The Outlook for the Labor Market and Productivity 
 We estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose only 
¾ percent in 2012.  We have interpreted this sluggish pace of productivity growth as suggesting that firms have been gradually bu ilding their workforces to more sustainable 
                                                 
3 The federal sequestration is anticipated to subtract 30,000 per month from private payroll growth 
in the second quarter.  In contrast , we expect the effect of the spending sequestration on federal payroll 
employment to be minimal this quarter as government ag encies use furloughs, rather than layoffs, to reduce 
spending.   
4 This revision to the level of potential output implies a smaller output gap and essentially 
eliminates the previous Okun’s law error in 2012:Q4.  In terms of growth rates, however, the revisions to 
potential output are too small to be seen in most of our Tealbook exhibits.

  levels after having been reluctant to hire ne w employees earlier in the economic recovery.  
Our thinking is that the level of actual produc tivity in the fourth quarter of last year was 
still a bit above its structural level, which le ads us to expect that actual productivity will 
again rise at a somewhat slow er pace than structural pr oductivity this year, as firms 
continue to return capital–labor ratios to more normal levels.  With that adjustment 
projected to be mostly complete at the end of  this year, growth in actual productivity is 
anticipated to roughly match structural  productivity growth after this year. 
As noted previously, we expect priv ate payrolls to grow 160,000 per month 
through the second quarter.  Thereafter, employ ment accelerates to an average monthly 
pace of 175,000 in the second half of the year  and then to average monthly rates of 
220,000 in 2014 and 265,000 in 2015.  Reflecting incoming data, the unemployment rate 
starts the forecast period 0.1 percentage point lower than we had expected in our most 
recent projection, and, going forward, changes in  the labor utilizati on gap move in line 
with changes in the projected output gap.  As a result, the unemployme nt rate is projected 
to drop below the Committee’s threshold of 6½ percent in the third quarter of 2015, one 
quarter earlier than in March.  The labor fo rce participation rate also came in a touch 
lower than predicted in March, and here too we carried forward the lower level through 
2015.   
The top-right figure of the “Labor Mark et Developments a nd Outlook” exhibit 
compares our current unemployment projection with our projection from September 2012, when the Committee first tied its asset purch ase decisions to an improvement in the 
outlook for labor market conditions.  The unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of last year was about ½ percentage point belo w our September Tealbook projection, and our 
current forecast for the medium  term remains roughly ½ percentage point lower.  By the 
end of this year, we now project the unempl oyment rate to reach 7.4 percent, almost 
¾ percentage point below the 8.1 percent rate th at prevailed last Augus t, the last reading 
that was available to the Committee at th e time of the September FOMC meeting.  
Meanwhile, the outlook for total payroll employme nt growth past the first half of this 
year has changed relatively l ittle, on average, since Septem ber.  However, our current 
projection for the level of tota l payroll employment at the en d of this year is ¾ percent 
above what we projected in September. 
Resource Utilization   
Labor market slack remains fairly subs tantial through most of the medium-term 
projection period.  In the current quarter , the projected unemployment rate is

  1¾ percentage points above our estimate of the natural rate, while the level of actual 
output is 3½ percent below potential.  Sim ilarly, in the manufacturing sector, capacity 
utilization is currently ab out 2¼ percentage points below its long-run average.5  Over the 
projection period, the labor ut ilization gap gradually narro ws (as do the output gap and 
the manufacturing capacity utiliz ation gap), but our projection for the unemployment rate 
is still about ½ percentage point above the natural rate at the end of 2015.   
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
We currently project headline PCE prices  to rise at an annual rate of only 
¼ percent, on average, over the first half of the year, ¾ percentage point lower than in the 
March Tealbook.  This revision mostly reflects steep declines in consumer energy prices, 
which are now expected to fall more rapidly ove r the first half of the year.  But increases 
in consumer food prices and core prices also have been coming in a bit lower than we had 
expected in March.   
The significant decline in energy prices now projected for the firs t half of the year 
has largely been driven by an unanticipated slide in gasoline prices from late February 
through mid-April.  In fact, this decline has been larger than we would expect given the 
downward movement in the prices for crude oil in recent months, as gasoline price 
margins, which were elevated relative to their long-run average earlier in the year, also 
have moved down.  As a result, we now project PCE energy prices to decline at an annual 
rate of 23 percent in the second quarter, followi ng an estimated decline in these prices of 
less than 4 percent in the first quarter.  Gi ven the path for oil prices, we expect PCE 
energy prices to flatten out, on averag e, in subsequent quarters.      
Consumer food prices are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 
1.3 percent in the first quarter, somewhat less than we had projected in the March 
Tealbook.  We had been expecting consumer fo od prices to rise more rapidly following 
the run-up in food commodity prices after th e drought last year; however, in light of 
persistent downward surprises in thes e data—including the CPI for March—and the 
gradual decline of commodity food indexes to their pre-drought levels, we have decided 
                                                 
5 With the annual revisions to industrial production and capacity, manufacturing capacity 
utilization has revised down noticeably from the March Tealbook.  Nevertheless, there still appears to be a 
bit less slack in the manufacturing sector than in the broader economy, in part because of unprecedented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010, as manufacturers shuttered plants that had been underutilized for a long time.  We estimate capacity in the industrial sector based largely on survey data 
that attempt to capture the highest level of output that plants can sustainably maintain given realistic work 
schedules, assuming that inputs like material s and labor are sufficiently available.

  to trim our projection for food price increases this year.  We now project that PCE food 
prices will increase a bit less rapidly than core  prices, on average, over the medium term.  
We project that core inflation in the firs t half of the year will be a little below 
what we projected in March, owing to a va riety of largely temporary factors.  Among 
these, the incoming data on nonmarket prices have come in very soft, but such prices 
have little information content for future infl ation.  We also now pr oject a larger one-time 
reduction in Medicare payments  to health-care providers in  the second quarter than we 
had previously thought, consistent with the staff’s new assumption regarding the federal 
spending sequestration.  Outsid e of Medicare prices, our forecast for market-based 
consumer prices is about the same as we had been previously expecting.   
After increasing at an annual rate of ¾ pe rcent in the first quarter of 2013, prices 
of imported core goods are expected to rema in about flat in th e current quarter—a 
downward revision of ½ percen tage point relative to the March Tealbook—restrained by 
weaker commodity prices.  In the second half  of 2013, we expect core import prices to 
increase at a ½ percent pace, pushed up by the projected depreciation of the dollar.  For 
the remainder of the forecast period, core im port price inflation is expected to average 
about 1½ percent, in line with the relatively flat trajectory for co mmodity prices and the 
assumed pace of dollar depreciation. 
Readings on long-term inflation expectati ons remain generally stable.  Median 5-
to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the preliminary Michigan survey for April 
were unchanged from March and in the middl e of the range seen over recent years.  
However, measures of inflation compensati on derived from TIPS have moved slightly 
lower since the time of the March Tealbook.   
Given our projection of continued stabili ty in long-run inflation expectations, 
relatively small movements in commodity and import prices beyond this year, and 
gradually diminishing slack in resource utiliza tion, we expect core in flation to edge up 
from 1½ percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in  2014 and 2015, essentially unchanged from the 
March projection; total PCE price inflation is ex pected to be just a bit lower, rising from 
1 percent this year to about 1½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  Thus, throughout the medium 
term, the projection for PCE inflation re mains below both the Committee’s long-run 
objective of 2 percent and the threshold level of  2½ percent.

  We have received little data on hour ly compensation since the March Tealbook 
and thus have left our near-term projec tion nearly unchanged.  We project nonfarm 
compensation per hour to grow 3 percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in 2015.     
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast be yond the medium term using the FRB/US 
model and our assumptions about long-run s upply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and 
other factors.  The contour of the long-term outlook  depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s st rategy statement.  As noted earlier, 
the Committee’s threshold for the unemployment rate is crossed in the baseline projection in the third quarter  of 2015.  Thereafter, the federal funds 
rate is set according to the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule.     
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2016 and 2017, albeit to a diminishing extent.  By 2019, the pr ocess of portfolio normalization is 
essentially complete. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd bonds continue to decrease gradually 
to normal levels, and financial instituti ons further ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) begins to widen after 
2016, primarily reflecting fast-rising transfer payments for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal debt  stabilizes temporarily at around 
73 percent of GDP in 2016 and 2017 but then  begins to edge up later in the 
decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar declines 1¾ percent per year in 2016 and 2017 and moves down more slowly thereafter.  The price of crude 
oil declines slightly in 2016 and then hol ds steady in real terms.  Foreign real 
GDP growth is 3¼ percent in 2016 and 2017 and slows to a 3 percent annual rate late in the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment dec lines from 5¾ percent at the end of 
2015 to 5¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, as labor market functioning 
improves further; it remains at that level in the longer run.  Potential GDP 
increases at an average annual rate of  2¼ percent in the 2016–20 period and in 
the long run. 
The economy is projected to enter 2016 w ith output below its potential level, 
unemployment above its natural rate, and infl ation below the long-r un objective of the

  Committee.  In the staff’s long-term for ecast, further improvements in household and 
business confidence, diminishing uncertaint y, and supportive financial conditions enable 
real GDP to rise 3 percent in  2016.  Thereafter, gains in real  GDP move down closer to 
their potential pace, in larg e part reflecting the progressi ve withdrawal of monetary 
accommodation.  The unemployment rate falls through 2017 to 5¼ percent.  Long-run 
inflation expectations are assumed to remain well anchored, and, with the margin of slack 
in labor and product markets diminishing, cons umer price inflation moves up to 2 percent 
by 2017.  The nominal federal funds rate is 3¾ percent at the end of this decade and 
eventually stabilizes at around 4 perc ent early in the next decade.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The international outlook is a little gloomier  than in  the March Tealbook , 
particularly in the near  term .  Recent data suggest that foreign output expanded at an 
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter, up only slightly from the previous quarter 
and about ½ percentage point less than we had estimated in the March Tealbook.  The 
downward revision is mainly in the emerging ma rket economies (EMEs), especially 
China, where growth slowed abruptly after surging late last year.  Additionally, 
performance  in the advanced foreign economies  (AFEs), notably Canada and Europe,  
was a bit more downbeat  in the first quarter than we had exp ected . 
We project  economic growth to pick up to a 2¾ percent pace in the current 
quarter and  to ris e further to 3 percent in the second half of the year , still a bit weaker 
than we wrote down in March.  Th e projected pickup reflects both gradual ly improving 
economic conditions  in the AFEs as well as a rebound in the EME s as China’s growth 
firms  later this year .  Further out, foreign growth rises to  3½ percent by 2015, supported 
by normalizing financial conditions in the euro are a, diminishing fiscal  drag and 
continu ing monetary accommodation  in the AFEs , and the firming U.S. recovery.   Our 
longer -term outlook is little changed from the March Tealbook.  Although we are now 
more optimistic about prospects for Japan, our upward revision for that country  is offset 
by markdowns elsewhere, notably  China.   
Both th e weak first -quarter GDP release in China and the gloomier data  for 
Europe underscore the downside risks to our outlook .  In particular, the risk of a hard 
landing in China , with its significant implications for other EMEs,  has increased 
somewhat , while  the continued weakness in the euro area poses the risk  that the recession 
there may be deeper and more prolonged than we are anticipating .  We explore both of 
these  scenario s in the Risks and Uncertaint y section.  Finally, while the recent crisis in 
Cyprus appear s to have had a limited effect  beyond its borders, it nonetheless highlight s 
the continuing threat  of a severe ratcheting -up of financial turbulence in Europe.  
Foreign inflation inched up to just under 2½ percent at an annual rate in the first 
quarter, as a decline in AFE inflation following a transitory surge  in the previous quarter 
was more than offset by a rise in EME inflation associated with various idiosyncratic factors , including jum ps in food price s in several countries .  We expect inflation to ease

  in the near term .  As growth strengthens, inflation will edge back up, although it will be 
restrained by ample resource slack in the AFEs and substantially lower oil prices.  Japan 
is a n otable exception:  W e expect the significantly looser monetary stance  to provide a 
meaningful boost to Japanese inflation.  We continue to expect o ther AFE central banks , 
including the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE),  to deliver 
additional monetary stimulus  in coming quarters.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Recent data suggest  that real GDP in the AFEs  rose ¾  percent in the first quarter 
following a 0.4 percent decline in the fourth quarter.   We estimate that Canadian and 
Japanese gr owth stepped up, U.K. economic activity stabiliz ed, and the pace of 
contraction in the euro area moderated.  We continue to project a gradual acceleration of 
growth in the AFEs , to 1¼ percent in 2013 as a whole, 2 percent in 2014 , and 2¼ percent 
in 2015.  The  forecast is a bit lower than in the March Tealbook  for this year and is little 
changed  further out , with downward revisions for Canada and Europe but a significantly 
stronger outlook for Japan.  
Inflation in the AFEs likely retreated to  1 percent in the first quarter  from  
1.6 percent in the fourth quarter as retail energy prices fell and the effects of earlier 
consumption tax hikes dissipated .  We project that inflation will edge up over the forecast 
period, reaching nearly 2 percent in  2015.  In spite of lower oil prices, this projection is a 
touch higher toward the end of  the forecast period  than in  the March Tealbook , largely 
due to higher Japanese inflation in response to the B ank of Japan ’s (BOJ) more aggresive  
monetary easing.  Amid subdued inflation and persistent resource slack, we continue to project that the Bank of Canada (BOC) will keep its main policy rate fixed through the 
second quarter of 2014 and that the ECB  and the BOE  will provide further monetary 
stimulus.  
Euro Area  
Recent indicators suggest that euro- area real GDP contracted ¾ percent in the first 
quarter, a more moderate decline  than in the fourth quarter.  I ndustrial production through 
February has fallen  less sharply  than in the fourth  quarter, and retail sales have  risen .  
However, economic sentiment has remained depressed .  In addition, although the 
composite PMI improved in January, it weakened noticeably in February and March and 
remains deep in contractionary territory.  As a result, we lower ed our projection for euro -
area activity a touch for the first half of 2013.

  During the intermeeting period, financial conditions were volatile as market 
participants digested developments in Cyprus.  In addition to raising questions about the 
level of support authorities  would provide to troubled banks elsewhere in the euro area, 
Cypriot developments  highlighted shortcomings in European policymakers’ ability to 
manage cris es.  (See the box “ The Crisis  in Cyprus”  in the Financial Developments 
section. )  Moreover, credit co nditions continued to be tight, especially for small- and 
medium -sized firms in the periphery, despite accommodative monetary policy and a 
significant improvement in banks’  funding conditions since last summer.  I nterest rates 
on loans to non financial corp orations have remained quite elevated in the periphery , even 
as they have declin ed in Germany.   
These considerations reinforce our expectation  that financial market and credit 
conditions will ease only gradually  over the forecast horizon as the political situation in 
Italy becomes clearer , Spain pushes forward on fiscal consolidation and bank 
restructuring, and incremental progress is made on banking and fiscal union.  This slow normalization of  financial conditions, together with diminishing fiscal drag, 
accommodative monetary policy, and stronger export growth, should spur a gradual 
economic recovery.  All told, euro- area GDP is projected to rise at an anemic pace of 
½ percent over the second half of 2013 before growing 1¼ percent in 2014 and 2 percent 
in 2015.  This outlook is a little lower than in the March Tealbook.  
Euro -area inflation slowed to less than 1 percent in the first quarter, largely 
because of declining  retail energy prices.  Inflation should be around 1¼ percent through 
the rest of the year  and then edge up  to 1¾  percent by  the end of the forecast period as 
growth strengthens . 
The ECB Governing Council at its April meeting left its benchmark policy rate 
unchanged at 0.75 percent.  After the meeting, ECB President Draghi signaled that the 
ECB was ready to act if economic data remained weak.  We continue to expect that the 
ECB will provide further monetary accommodation , including lowering the policy rate to  
0.5 percent during the current quarter and perhaps introducing measures to improve 
funding for small - and medium -sized enterprises.

  United Kingdom 
We estimate that real GDP was flat  in the first quarter following a 1.2 percent 
contraction in the fourth quarter.  Although retail sales rose from their fourth- quarter 
level, exports through February were down appreciably , and industrial production was 
little changed on net.  Survey indic ators suggest a bit less momentum in near -term GDP 
growth than we envisioned in the March Tealbook, with first -quarter PMIs for 
manufacturing and construction lingering in contractionary territory.  For this reason, and 
in light of the slightly more subdue d prospects for the euro area, we marked down our 
U.K. growth forecast for 2013 a bit to 1 percent.   We continue to expect growth to rise to  
2¼ percent in 2014 and 2½ percent in 2015, supported by improvement s in private -sector 
balance sheets and the projected euro -area recovery.  In addition, the government’s fiscal 
consolidation plans, which the 2013 budget reaffirmed, suggest a diminution of fiscal 
drag from an average of 1¾ percentage points over the past three years to about 
1 percentage point over the forecast period. 
Our inflation forecast for 2013 is down a little to 2¼ percent due to  the recent fall 
in oil prices and the cancellation of an upcoming hike in fuel duties.  Amid significant 
resource slack, inflation should edge down to the 2  percent target over the remainder of 
the forecast period.  On March 20, the chancellor of the e xchequer altered the BOE’s 
remit to ensure that due consideration is given to output volatility in the pursuit of the 
inflation target.   The BOE is now enjoined to commu nicate the inflation -activity tradeoffs 
it faces and the appropriate horizon over which inflation should return to the target.   Moreover, in the new remit, the BOE is directed to report on the merits of 
deploying explicit forward guidance, such as the thre sholds recently introduced by the 
Federal Reserve.   We do not see these requirements as materially altering the BOE’s 
reaction function.  In light of the still-weak economic outlook and declining inflation, we continue to expect the BOE to increase its qua ntitative easing program £50 billion (3.2 
percent of GDP) later this year.   On April 24, U.K. authorities extended the Funding for 
Lending Scheme’s drawdown period by one year to early 2015, improved its terms for loans directed at small - and medium -sized enterprises, and broadened its eligibility 
criteria to include some nonbank lenders.  
Japan  
Recent data suggest that real GDP growth increas ed to a 2 percent pace in the first 
quarter—a bit higher  than in the March Tealbook —from  only 0.2 percent in the fou rth 
quarter.  Household spending, supported by further gains in consumer confidence, rose

  robustly through February, and car registrations continued to expand in March.  Exports  
increased at a solid pace in the first quarter  following two quarters of sharp  declines , and 
imports grew  even faster.  GDP growth should pick up further to nearly 3 percent by 
year-end, driven by a previously announced fiscal stimulus and the easing measures 
introduced by the BOJ on April 4, which ar e described in the box “The New Monetary 
Polic y Program of the Bank of Japan.”   Thereafter, a planned doubling of the 
consumption tax rate phased in over the coming two years should slow GDP growth to a 
pace of only 1 percent.  Reflecting the better -than-expected data and the additional 
monetary stimulus, our growth outlook is nearly ½ percentage point stronger than in the 
March Tealbook.  
Consumer prices were roughly flat in  January and February, suggesting that 
inflation remained near zero in the first qu arter.  However, g iven the BOJ’s newly ultra -
accommodative stance and an expected narrowing of the output gap, we now project that, 
net of the effect of the consumption tax hikes, inflation will rise to 1¼ percent by end-
2015, ¾ percentage point higher tha n in the previous Tealbook. 
Canada  
We estimate that Canadian real GDP growth stepped up from 0.6 percent in the 
fourth quarter to 1½ percent in the first quarter , about ¼ percentage point lower than in 
the March Tealbook.  Although monthly GDP rose in Jan uary and manufacturing 
shipments increased  in February , more recent March data show employment and work 
hours slipp ing and  the manufacturing PMI sinking into contractionary territory.  W e 
carried some of the recent weakness forward , and we now expect GDP t o rise 1¾ percent 
in the second quarter and 2 percent in the second half of the year , a bit lower than in the 
March Tealbook.  Thereafter,  Canadian GDP  growth , supported by improvement in U.S. 
and global economic conditions, picks up to nearly 2½ percent i n 2014 and 2¾ percent in 
2015.  P rivate consumption and investment should be the main drivers of growth, 
although they will be weighed down by high household debt and some cooling of the 
housing market .   
Headline inflation rose to an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter, 
somewhat higher than in the March Tealbook, as core prices bounced back more strongly than expected.  In line with subdued growth prospects and lower oil prices, we have headline inflation moderating somewhat  in the near t erm before rising back to 1¾ percent

 The New Monetary Policy Program of  the Bank of Japan  
On April 4, the Bank of Japan (BOJ), under the new leadership of Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, 
announced a surprisingly aggressive policy overhaul called “Quantitative and Qualitative 
Monetary E asing .”  The announcement was a major victory for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, 
who promised  faster economic growth and the end of deflation  and openly admonished  the 
BOJ  for not doing enough .  Indeed, although the BOJ had been providing  stimulus by keepin g 
the policy rate near zero and expan ding its asset purchases, it had been criticized for focusin g 
its purchases on shorter-term securities and for exhibiting little conv iction that quantitative 
easing would yield tangible benefits.  Under pressure, the BOJ introduced a new inflation 
target of 2 percent in February, but it had refrained from pursuing significantly more-
aggressive easing.   
The new program calls for a sharp  increase in purchases of Japanese government bonds 
(JGBs) and other assets, such as Japanese equity exchange- traded funds .  In particular, the 
BOJ will increase its JGB holdings at an annual pace of ¥50 trillion, equivalent to more than 
10 percent of Japan’s GDP.  The BOJ also substantially extended the maturity of its JGB 
purchases.  All maturities, including 40 -year bonds, became  eligible for purchase, and the 
average maturity of JGB purchases rose from slightly less than 3 years to about 7 years, 
matching the average maturity of  current  outstanding JGBs in the market .   
A prominently stated goal of these measures is to double the monetary base over the next 
two years.  Indeed, the BOJ announced that it has shifted  its operational target from the 
overnight rate to the monetary base.  In our view, t his shift  does not imply  any fundamental 
difference in the way monetary policy is carried out but rather appears to be a signaling 
mechanism  designed to boost inflation expectations by underscoring  the forcefulness of the 
new program.  The BOJ committed to continue these measures “as long as necessary ” to 
achieve the 2 percent inflation target, though its stated aim is to achieve that goal in about two years.   
These measures were much more aggressive than market participants  had expected , 
prompting the yen to depreciate further against  the dollar and Japanese  stock prices to rise.  
As illustrated in the upper -left figure on the next page, since November 14, 2012, when former 
Prime Minister Noda called for elections, the yen has depreciated nearly 25 percent  against the 
U.S. dollar and the Nikkei index ha s surged more than 50  percent .  Following the BOJ 
announcement, as shown in the upper- right figure, l onger -term J apanese bond yield s fell 
initially , but later retraced th is decline.  This reversal may be the result of an increase in  
inflation compensation , even though  the extent to which inflation expectations have moved  
remains an open question.  Inflation swap rates have risen  in recent months , but the market 
for inflation swaps is highly illiquid , and surveys of long- term inflation forecasts have  changed 
little even after the April 4 announcement  (bottom -left figure) .   
Like market participants, we were also surprised by the scale and scope of the new program.  As illustrated in the bottom -right figure, w e now assume  that  the BOJ’s balance sheet will 
expand  from 35  percent of GDP to 75 pe rcent of GDP , much higher than  the 50  percent level 
we anticipated  at the time of the March Tealbook .  This e xpansion will bring the share of BOJ’s 
assets relative to GDP well above that of most other major central banks and close to the 85 percent share of the Swiss National Bank.

 We considered  two different approaches to gauge  the effects  of the BOJ ’s new program on 
inflation .  First , we assumed  that future asset purchases  by the BOJ  would  have similar effects 
on inflation to those of  the Fed’s large-s cale a sset purchase program.  In this case, inflation 
would rise slightly more than 1  percentage point .  Ho wever, this exercise presumes that the  
term premium  on 10 -year JGBs declines 200 basis points , which seems questionable given the 
already  low level of Japanese interest rates .  Alternatively, we used the staff’s SIGMA model to 
examine the effects of the  improvements in Japanese financial conditions observed since mid -
November.  Specifically, we assumed a 25 percent real depreciation of the yen and a 
50 percent increase in  equity wealth, while leaving  the term premium unchanged .  The model 
predicts  an incr ease in i nflation of about 1 ½ percentage point s over a year, largely owing to  
the effect of the lower yen on import prices .  Although these estimates are necessarily 
tenuous , we take some comfort that both approaches yield  broadly  similar predictions .   
Informed by these results, we now project  that  inflation —net of the effects of two planned  
consumption rate hikes —will gradually increase from about zero in early 2013  to 1¼ percent by 
the end of 2015 .  Likewise, the combination of monetary expansion and fi scal stimulus planned 
by the Abe administration pushes projected GDP growth  to an annual average of 1½  percent 
over the 2013 –15 period , compared with the just-below  1 percent pace we were anticipating 
late last year.  This markup  leads to a considerably more rapid narrowing of Japan’s output 
gap.

  in 2014  and 2015 .  With inflation contained , we continue to project that the BOC will 
keep its main policy rate fixed at 1 percent through the second quarter of 2014.          
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
We now estimate t hat real GDP growth in the EMEs slowed to an annual rate of 
3¾ percent in the first quarte r from 4¾ percent in the fourth,  mainly reflecting a sharp 
step-down in economic growth in China , for which we have already received first -quarter 
GDP  data.  Economic activity also appeared  to have  moderate d elsewhere in the EMEs , 
as weak Chinese growth and the slow pace of recovery in the advanced economies 
weighed on exports.  All told, o ur estimate for first -quarter growth in the EMEs is about 
¾ percentage point low er than projected in the March Tealbook , and, reflecting  this lower  
momentum, our outlook for this quarter and next is also revised down ab out ¼ percentage 
point.   
We judge the factors that pushed down EME growth in the first quarter to have 
been mainly transitory , including some payback for the very rapid expansion at the end of 
last year.  Accordingly, w e expect EME growth to pick up to 4½ percent by the end of 
this year and to average abo ut 4¾ percent through the end of the forecast period , 
supported by accommodative macroeconomic policies and the recovery in the advanced economies.  Beyond the near  term, the outlook for activity is only a touch weaker than in 
the previous Tealbook.  Never theless, the sharp slowdown in China and other EMEs  last 
quarter gives us pause, and we are alert to the possibility of less favorable outco mes.   
We estimate that headline inflation in the EMEs moved up to 3½ percent in the 
first quarter, about ¼ percenta ge point higher than our estimate in the March Tealbook, as 
food price inflation surprised on the upside in India and Mexico.  EME inflation should 
slow to about 2¾ percent in the current quarter as food price inflation eases and oil prices 
decline.  It  then gradually increase s to around 3¼ percent over the rest of the forecast 
period, about in line with our March Tealbook forecast, as growth in the EMEs picks up.  
The central banks of Colombia and I ndia cut their policy rates , mainly on growth 
concerns .  In contrast, the central bank of Brazil raised its policy rate to combat  rising 
inflation.   
China  
China’s official four-quarter GDP growth edged down to 7.7 percent in the first 
quarter, significantly less than market expectations.  B ased on th is release, we estimate

  that Chinese GDP growth  on a quarter -to-quarter basis  stepped down sharply from an 
annual rate of 9½ percent in the fourth quarter of last year to just 6½ percent in the first 
quarter.1  The slowdown does not appear to merely reflect noisy data.  The GDP figure 
was consistent with movements in monthly  indicators, including industrial production, 
retail sales,  and imports.    
Some slowing of the economy from its red- hot pace of the fourth quarter was in 
the cards, but the extent of the slowing was much greater than we had anticipated  in the 
March Tealbook , suggesting less underlying dynamism in the economy.  Fixed -asset 
investment decelerated despite strong credit growth; it is possible that the efficacy of 
credit creation as a means of spurring  economic activity has weakened.  Alternatively, it 
may be that the economy is rebalancing away from investment -led growth slightly faster 
than anticipated.  Real retail sales growth also slowed  a bit, reflecting in part weaker 
government consumption (whic h is included in the series), as the new Chinese leadership 
has strongly signaled that it expects more frugality by government bureaucrats in order to help dispel the notion of widespread corruption.   As such, we revised down Chi nese GDP 
growth an average of ¾ percentage point in the current quarter and next , so that growth 
reaches  8 percent only by the end of this year and remains about 8 percent in 2014 and 
2015. 
Chinese headline consumer prices rose 3½ percent at an annual rate in the first 
quarter, with food prices rising sharply early in the quarter before retracing in March.  This monthly pattern suggest s that  inflation will step down to about 1¾ percent in the 
current quarter.  Inflation is then expected to rise  back to  around 3 percent over the 
forecast period.  With inflation fairly subdued and growth surprising on the downside, Chinese authorities are likely to institute somewhat less policy tightening over the next few quarters than previously expected.  
Other Emergin g Asia  
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, we estimate that economic growth stepped down to 
an annual rate of 3½ perc ent in the first quarter from 4½ percent in the fourth, as growth 
cooled in a number of economies that had  outsized expansions in the fourth quarte r.  This 
                                                 
1 There is no official series for the level of Chinese real GDP , and thus esti mates of Chinese 
economic growth from various sources can differ.  The staff’s quarter -on-quarter growth estimates are 
constructed from the official series of four -quarter changes in real GDP and should be viewed as having 
relatively wide confidence bands.

  estimate is about ¾ percentage point lower than in the March Tealbook, as exports, 
especially to  China, slowed more than expected and the advance GDP release for 
Singapore surprised on the downside.  Growth in the r egion should pick up to about 
3¾ percent in the current quarter, and further to about 4¾ percent by the end of 2015 , 
supported by higher Chinese growth, accommodative macroeconomic policies , and the 
recovery of economic activity in the advanced economies.  Relative to the March 
Tealbook, our forecast is down ½ percentage point this quarter and next on weaker 
momentum and slower -than-expected growth in China.   
Headline inflation is estimated to have increased to an annual rate of 3½ percent 
in the first quarter from about 3  percent in the  fourth, reflecting such factors as a  
resurgence of food price inflation in India and  Indonesia.  We expe ct inflation to average 
a little under  3½ percent over the forecast period, about the same as in the previous 
Tealbook.   
Latin America 
In Mexico, we e stimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in 
the first quarter, little changed from its fourth -quarter pace but ½ percentage point lower 
than projected in the March Tealbook.  This downward revision reflects weaker -than-
expected expor ts, industrial production , and retail sales .  We expect Mexican growth to 
pick up gradually to about 4 percent by the middle of 2014, broadly in line with the 
contour of U.S. manufacturing output growth.  
In South America, GDP growth declined from an upwardly  revised 4¼ percent in 
the fourth quarter to an estimated 3 percent in the first.  Growth in much of the region 
apparently cooled following surprisingly large gains in the four th quarter, but recent 
indicators for Brazil, including PMIs, industrial production, and retail sales , suggest that 
growth picked up to 2¾ percent following more than a year of anemic performance.  
Although Brazil’s first- quarter growth was still somewhat weaker than we anticipated in 
March, w e continue to expect a gradual incr ease to 4 percent by next year, supported by 
still-accommodative fiscal and monetary policies, the recovery in the advanced 
economies , and a pickup in Chinese growth.  As a result,  aggregate South American 
growth should increase to about 3¾ percent  in 2014  and 2015.   
Consumer price inflation in Mexico increased  to an annual rate of 3½ percent  in 
the first quarter, significantly  above our estimate in the March  Tealbook, as food price

  inflation  surprised on the upside .  We expect inflation to dip later this year a s these  food 
price pressures dissipate  but to return to  3½ percent by early next year . 
In Brazil, h eadline inflation moderated some  in the first quarter but remained  
elevated  amid persistent food price pressures.  With 12- month inflation rising in recent 
months and breaching the upper limit of the target range  of 2.5 to 6.5 percent , the central 
bank raised the policy rate 25 basis points to 7.5 percent , as anticipated .  Some easing of 
food price  pressure s should push inflation back down to within th e target range, aided by 
further monetary tightening over the next several quarters .

Financial Developments  
Financial conditions eased a little, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  The 
Cypriot banking crisis boosted volatility somewhat in financial markets early in the 
period, but its effects on financial asset prices generally appeared to be transitory.  The 
negative tone of U.S. and foreign economic data releases, as well as more -
accommodative- than-expected policy actions by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), put downward 
pressure on yields on longer -term Treasury securities and foreign benchmark sovereign 
bonds.  The mean path of the federal funds rate implied by derivatives contracts also decreased moderately  over the intermeeting period, though Federal Reserve 
communica tions left little imprint on asset prices.  The broad dollar i ndex was little 
changed , on net, as t he dollar appreciated significantly against the yen.  R esilient earnings 
expectations and lower interest rates likely helped offset the deterioration in sent iment 
regarding global economic growth, and domestic equity  prices increased modestly on 
balance.  Private yields edged lower across the credit spectrum; spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds changed little, while those on high-yield bonds widened modestly.    
  Recent trends in c redit flows and financing conditions for nonfinancial 
businesses and households generally persisted .  Lending to businesses was  robust, on net, 
through April, and a number of indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained  solid .  In the household sector , the latest available data show that 
student and auto loans continued to increase significantly while credit card loans and 
mortgage debt were about flat .  Underwriting standards in the credit card and mortgage 
sectors remained tight, particularly for borrowers without strong credit histories.  The 
aggregate results for t he April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices  (SLOOS ) indicated that domestic respondents had , on net, eased th eir lending 
standards and experienced  stronger demand in the first quarter of 2013 (see appendix) .  
Meanwhile, overall bank credit and M2 expanded moderately.

  purchases would slow later this year , but market participants noted that those discussions 
did not reflect  the disappointing economic data that followed the meeting .  On balance, 
quotes from overnight index swaps suggest that market participants moderately lowered 
their mean expected paths for the federal funds rate through early 2017.  The implied expected federal funds rate now rises above 25 basis points in the first quarter of 2015, one quarter later tha n at the time of the March FOMC  meeting .  The modal expectation 
derived from interest rate caps remain s within  the current target range until the fourth  
quarter of 2016.
1 
Results from the Open Market Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Dealers indicated  
that the median estimate of the most likely time of the first increase in the target federal funds rate remained  the third quarter of 2015, unchanged from the prior survey.  The 
results suggested a modest increase in the median expectation of the most likely policy 
rate path beyond the second half of 2015 and into 2017, but the increase was due to 
revisions to the forecasts of only a few dealers .  Median estimates of Federal Reserve 
securities  holdings through the end of 2016 edged up, and the median expected ti me of 
the end of asset purchases moved out one quarter, to the second quarter of 2014. 
Nominal Treasury yields declined over the intermeeting period , partly in response 
to the weaker -than-expected U.S. employment and retail sales figures (see the box 
“Sensitivity of Treasury Yields to Economic Data Surprises”).
2  An expectation that the 
BOJ’s policy actions may provide an incentiv e for some investors to reallocate their 
portfolios away from Japanese government bonds and toward higher- yielding safe assets, 
including Treasury securities, reportedly also contributed to the declines.  On net, the 
5-year nominal Treasury yield decreased 8 basis points, while the 10- year and 30- year 
yield s both dropped about 20 basis points.   
Against the backdrop of weaker -than-expected economic data and declines in 
commodity prices, near -term measures of inflation compensation moved lower.  In 
particular, TIPS -based inflation compensation over the next 5 years fell 22 basis points, 
while inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead was little changed .  Both measures

a false report of  explosions at the White Hous e appeared  on their feed.  Bond yields and equity prices 
dropped precipitously for a couple of minutes but quickly recovered when the story  was corrected.

 Sensitivity  of Treasury  Yields to Economic  Data Surprises  
In September  2012, the FOMC announced  a new round of agency MBS purchases  
linked to the outlook for the labor market.  In December  2012, the Committee 
announced  purchases  of Treasury  securities  similarly linked to the outlook and 
replaced its earlier calendar ‐based forward rate guidance with numerical  
thresholds  for the unemployment rate  and projecte d inflation.   Market 
participants  have suggested  that these  policy actions might cause expectations  
of the Federal Reserve’s securities  holdings  and of the future target rate to 
become more responsive  to economic  news influencing  the outlook for the labor  
market and inflation.   A simple way to evaluate  whether  such  an inc rease in 
responsiveness  has occurred  is to look at whether  the sensitivity  of Treasury  
yields to surprises  in economic  data releases has changed  since the policy  actions 
were announced.    
The figure on the next page shows estimates  of the sensitivity  of Treasury  yields 
to surprises  in the nonfarm  payrolls data over time.   The plotted series represent  
the estimate d effect on various Treasury  yields of a positive  100,000 surprise in 
nonfarm payrolls growth, based on data in the 12‐month sample ending in the 
period specified  on the x axis.  The estimates  are calculated  by regressing  
changes in on‐the‐run Treasury yields  during a one‐ hour window around nonfarm  
payrolls releases on the surprise component  of the releases,  measured  as the 
difference  between the  actual change in nonfarm payrolls and the median 
expected  change taken from  Bloomberg.1  The black  vertical line in the figure 
denotes October 2012,  the date that the  estimation  sample first includes 
observations  after the announcement  of asset purchases  linked to the labor 
market outlook. 
Contrary to the proposition  that recent  FOMC policy changes have prompted  an 
increase in  the sensitivity  of Treasury  yields to econom ic news, the estimated  
effects of payrolls surprises  have edged down in recent months  as more post‐
September  2012 observations  have come to be  included  in the regression 
samples.  However, these  recent declines are small relative  to the  variation 
observed  in the estimates  since 1998  and to the coefficient  standard errors  (not 
shown), and one could not reject the hypothesis  that the sensitivity  was 
unchanged  following  September  2012 at standard  significance  levels.  
Nonetheless, the sensitivity  of longer‐term yields has  generally  trended up over 
recent years even as the zero lower bound  has sharply reduced the sensitivity  of 
the two‐ year  yield.  This observation  is consistent  with the well‐est ablished 
notion that Federal Reserve asset purchases  affect longer ‐dated term premiums.  
 
                                                 
1 The results shown here hold if the regressions  are structured  in a manner that controls 
for the effects of simultaneous  surprises  in the unemployment  rate and other data releases.

Broadly similar results  are found for surprises  in many other key U.S.  economic  
releases,  including  consumer  confidence,  core PCE, industrial  production,  and 
initial claims.  While  estimates  of the sensitivity  for some  releases,  including  the 
unemployment  rate, have edged up in recent months, the evidence  on these 
releases is as tentative  as that on nonfarm payrolls.  Estimates  of changes in 
sensitivity  to data  surprises  obtained  using more sophisticated  econometric  
approaches  vary with  the model specification  and estimation  sample but 
generally  don’t indicate  an increase in the sensitivity  of Treasury yields since  last 
fall.2 
In short, there is not yet any convincing  evidence  that the sensitivity  of Treasury 
yields  to economic  data  surprises  has increased  as a result of recent FOMC policy 
decisions.   Of course, given the relatively  limited number of observations  
currently  available  following  those decisions,  it may simply be too early to discern 
any change in sensitivity.  Separately,  even  if the policy actions have not 
prompted  an increase in sensitivity  to date, they may do so as economic  
indicators  draw  nearer to the numerical  thresholds  or more clearly suggest a 
substantial  improvement  in the labor market outlook.

  remain  within their ranges observed over the past  several years.   Swaps -based inflation 
compensation measures behaved similarly.  
MBS yields decreased  about in line with yields on Treasury securities , as the 
30-year F annie Mae current -coupon MBS yield declined 17 basis points since the March 
FOMC meeting.  The discussion in the minutes of that meeting regarding MBS sales and 
possible changes that the FOMC might make in paring its holdings over time appeared to 
leave little imprint on MBS spreads , in part because of  prior communications on the 
subject .  According to the Desk’s survey, primary dealers put a probability of about  
one-third  on the scenario of outright sales of agency MBS from the SOMA portfolio, 
with the most likely timing of this event being the third quarter of 2016. 
TREASURY AND AGENCY MBS  MARKET FUNCTIONING  
The Desk conducted  flow -based purchases of Treasury securities and agency 
MBS as planned , and these operations did not appear to have material adverse effect s on 
the functioning of either Treasury or agency MBS market s.3  Measures of liquidity 
conditions suggested that agency MBS markets continued to function normally over the intermeeting period, though some short- term signs of scarcity were evident in implied 
financing rates for certain agency MBS.  For example, over the period, dollar- roll-
implied financing rates for 30- year Fannie Mae 3.5 percent coupon securities declined 
close to levels last observed in January, when the TBA market experienced some near -
term settlement pressures.  However, these MBS account for a relatively small proportion of issuance and of the Desk’s purchases.  T he Desk executed dollar rolls  on 8 percent of 
its total agency MBS purchases for April sett lement to ease pressures in the TBA market , 
about in line with its rolls over the previous intermeeting period. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
Conditions in dollar funding markets generally have been stable since the March 
FOMC meeting.  Offshore dollar funding markets reacted only modest ly to the spike in 
uncertainty surrounding the negotiations early in the intermeeting period to resolve the Cypriot banking crisis .  The spread between three-month LIBOR and comparable-
maturity OIS rates  was little changed, on balance, over the period, as was the spread 
                                                 
3 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $ 50 billion in Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program.  In addition, the Desk purchased $ 77 billion in agency MBS under 
the flow -based MBS program and the reinvestment program.

  between the three -month forward rate agreement three months ahead and the 
corresponding forward OIS rate.   
Treasur y and MBS g eneral c ollateral finance (GCF) r epo rates decreased  slightly , 
on net , over the intermeeting period amid some volatility .  Quotes on GCF Treasury repo 
futures indicate that market participants ’ expect ations for the Treasury repo rate over the 
rest of 2013 edged down on balance.  Haircuts in bilateral repo contracts for a range of 
collateral types were reportedly about unchanged on net.  
Conditions in domestic commercial paper (CP) markets remained stable  over the 
intermeeting period .  The outstanding amounts of unsecured CP issued by both European 
and U.S. financial institutions were little changed  on net.  I nterest rates on  unsecured 
financial CP  remained  at the low end of their range over the past several years.  In asset -
backed commercial paper (ABCP) markets, amounts outstanding were roughly 
unchanged for programs with sponsors domiciled in Europe, while amounts outstanding 
edged down for those with sponsors domiciled in the United States.  Spreads on ABC P 
were about flat, on net, with spreads on most European ABCP issues remaining close to those on comparable U.S.  issues.  
Turning to financial institutions, s hare prices for the largest domestic banking 
organizations registered  modest declines , on balance, reflecting in part the expected 
trends in these banks’ profitability.  Five of the six largest U.S. banking institution s 
reported earnings that were above consensus forecasts , but analysts pointed to difficulties 
banks continue to face in increasing  their revenues , as well as their  reliance on expense 
management to meet earnings forecasts .  Bank CDS spreads were slightly higher, on 
average, across the larger firms in the sector.  
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET  DEVELOPMENTS  
About one-third of the firms in the S& P 500 index have reported first- quarter 
earnings.  Roughly three-fourths of these firms , a typical proportion, have exceeded Wall 
Street earnings forecasts, but less  than half of the reporting firms met or exceeded 
analysts’ revenue forecasts.  P reliminary  data suggest that through mid- April , firms’ 
earnings reports generally had not caused analysts to revise their forecasts of year -ahead 
earnings for S&P 500 firms.  Industry analysts still expect annualized earnings growth in 
the second half of 2013 and in 2014 to be in double digits .

  Over the intermeeting period, broad equity price indexes increased 1½ to 
2 percent , on net, despite the negative tone of economic data .  This resilience  in stock 
prices likely reflected  the stability of medium- term earnings expectations as well as  lower 
interest rate s.  In addition, the spread between the return on the S&P 500 index and the 
real 10 -year Treasury yield —a gauge of the current equity premium —remained 
historically wide.  M oreover , share prices for firms that are generally considered to be 
less exposed  to macroeconomic risk , such as those in the utilities and health- care sectors, 
generally outperformed the broader market, a pattern consistent with some concerns 
among investors regarding global growth prospects .  The VIX —an index of option-
implied one-month-ahead volatility for the S&P 500 index—remained in a range that is 
low by historical standards .   
In the corporate debt market , yields on investment-grade bonds fell roughly in 
line with those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity, leaving their spreads little changed.  However, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds widened modestly.  The spreads of yields on A2/P2 unsecured CP issued by nonfinancial firms over yields on AA-rated nonfinancial issues continued to edge  down  over the period.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Most foreign equity indexes fell over the intermeeting period, and benchmark 
sovereign yields declined , amid disappointing U.S. and foreign macroeconomic data.  
Although markets reacted negatively to Cyprus’s “bail-in” of uninsured bank depositors at the two largest Cypriot banks and the imposition of an extended bank holiday early in the period, price movements were relatively co ntained and largely temporary (see the box 
“The Crisis in Cyprus”).  
Pulled down by a weaker outlook for global growth, European equity prices have 
declined about 1 percent, on net, while emerging market stock prices are also down amid modest outflows from emerging  market equity mutual funds.  In contrast, Japanese stock 
prices have risen 8½ percent, as the BOJ surprised investors with the scale of its new monetary stimulus.  On April 4, the BOJ announced plans to essentially double its balance sheet by the end of 2014 by purchasing larger amounts of government bonds, including longer-maturity bonds, and other securities (for further details, see the box “The New Monetary Policy Program of the Bank of Japan” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).  Yields on long-dated Japanese government bonds fell 10 to 50 basis points in response to the announcement but retraced over the next

 The  Crisis in Cyprus 
 
The crisis  in Cyprus had its origin in the country’s  domestic banking  sector, where  
assets totaled roughly five‐and‐a‐half times the nation’s GDP.  Cypriot banks, 
already suffering  from the euro‐area recession,  took large losses on their sizable 
holdings of Greek debt when this  debt was restructured.  Last  June, Cyprus, 
having already lost access to bond markets in mid‐ 2011 on investor concerns  
about domestic banks, requested  European  assistance to recapitalize  its banks.  
Amid protracted  negotiations,  European  and IMF officials opposed  fully bailing 
out Cypriot banks because of  their perceived role  as a haven for money  
laundering  and tax evasion for large  Russian depositors  and because of  the 
effects a bailout might have on  the sustainability  of Cyprus’s  sovereign  debt.  In 
contrast,  Cypriot leaders wished to protect Cyprus’s  foreign investors  and 
offshore banking  franchise.   With Cypriot bank deposits  declining,  European  and 
Cypriot leaders hastily put together  a plan, announced  on March 16,  under which 
Cyprus would receive €10 billion in official assistance,  and additional  funds for 
bank recapitalization  would come from a tax on all bank deposits—including  a 
7 percent tax on insured deposits.   Cypriot leaders announced  a bank holiday to 
prevent deposit runs.  Immediately  controversial,  the plan was rejected by the 
Cypriot Parliament  on March 19, and negotiations  began again.   
 With the ECB threatening  to cut off funding absent an agreed ‐upon plan for 
Cyprus, on March 25,  euro‐area leaders  unveiled  a revised  €10 billion assistance 
program in which insured deposits  would be protected,  as would all deposits  at 
solvent Cypriot  banks.  Bank  of Cyprus (the country’s  largest bank) will be 
recapitalized  by imposing  losses on shareholders,  bondholders,  and uninsured  
depositors.  Cyprus  Popular Bank (the second‐largest bank, also called “Laiki”) 
will be resolved,  with its insured deposits  transferred to Bank  of Cyprus and 
losses imposed  on its shareholders,  bondholders,  and uninsured  depositors.  
Uninsured  deposits  at the two  banks have been frozen.   In addition,  Cypriot 
leaders unveiled  a set of capital controls and limits on banking transactions  to 
prevent large‐scale runoffs of deposits  once banks were reopened.   Cypriot 
banks reopened  on March  28, but capital  controls and limits on bank transactions  
remain in place.   
 Despite fears of widespread spillovers, few  signs of disruptions  outside Cyprus  
were observed.   There have been no  reports of deposit runs from other 
peripheral  banking systems.   And although global  financial markets initially 
reacted negatively to the  ill‐fated March 16  plan, these reactions  were small 
relative to market movements  in recent years, were partly reversed,  and 
primarily affected  the debt and equity prices of European  banks.  The  ECB’s 
program of Outright Monetary  Transactions,  which allows the ECB to purchase 
the debt of member countries  that have negotiated  programs with the  European  
Financial Stability Facility or the European  Stability Mechanism, likely reassured  
markets that support would  be forthcoming  should contagion  arise.  Even so, like  
Greece, Cyprus may have difficulty  meeting the requirements  of its program,  and 
any need for renegotiation  may pose the threat of  impasse and contagion  to 
other peripheral  European  countries.

 Attention  quickly turned to which European  country might next require a 
program.   Amid  the search for vulnerable  countries, press  commentary  has 
focused on Luxembourg,  Malta, and Slovenia.1  There was only a slight market 
reaction in Luxembourg  (lower‐left figure), where the spread of the 10‐year 
sovereign  yield over German  bunds is currently  11 basis points, and in Malta (not  
shown).2  However,  the comparable  spread jumped notably for Slovenia,  where 
the recession  is causing large losses for banks.   
 
Market  participants  also raised concerns  over whether the decision in Cyprus—
unlike in Ireland and Spain—to  impose losses on, or “bail in,” senior bank 
creditors  signaled a greater willingness  of European  leaders to  bail in such 
creditors  in the future.  Although European  authorities  had already indicated  
their intent to move toward greater burden  sharing with  bank creditors,  it was 
unclear how quickly they would do so given the persistence  of financial fragility 
in Europe.  Moreover,  Cyprus’s role as a large and problematic  offshore banking 
center arguably made it a special case.  That  said, markets  appear to have priced 
in a modest increase in the likelihood  that bank creditors  will take losses in the 
event  of future difficulties.   The iTraxx  Europe senior financial credit default swap 
(CDS) index, although  down from its recent peak, remains above  its March  15 
level (lower‐right  figure), whereas the nonfinancial  CDS index is little  changed.   
And euro‐area  bank stocks (not shown) declined more than headline indexes 
around the time of the Cyprus crisis.   
 
Increased  expectations  of creditor bail‐ins could raise bank funding costs and 
leave European  banks at greater risk  of deposit flight and funding difficulties  
should the banks come under pressure.   Although  strains in most of peripheral  
Europe appear not to have  increased,  the recent experience  in Cyprus highlights  
the need for the European  authorities  to push ahead on their plans for banking  
union, including  establishing  a single supervisor, harmonizing  regulations,  and 
strengthening  resolution  and deposit‐insurance  mechanisms.  
    
 
                                                 
1 Luxembourg’s  fiscal imbalances  are small, but its banking system  is outsized compared  
to its GDP.  Malta’s banking system is also outsized,  and its fiscal imbalances  are worse  than 
Cyprus’s.  Slovenia’s  banking system is not large, but its macroeconomy  is quite weak. 
2 In Malta, the spread of the 10‐year sovereign  yield over German bunds is currently  below 
its March 15 level.

  several days amid substantial intraday volatility as market participants struggled to fully 
understand the implications of the BOJ’s purchases for market functioning and the 
economy.   
Outside of Japan, sovereign yields fell, on net, over the intermeeting period.  
Early in the period, these yields were likely pushed down modestly by flight- to-quality 
flows induced by events in Cyprus.  However, yields fell even after the situation in Cyprus appeared to stabilize, likely reflecting a combination of weak macro data releases , 
some spillovers from the BOJ’s policy announcements, and increased expectations of additio nal monetary accommodation in some other major foreign economies.  The ECB 
and the Bank of Canada kept their policies on hold over the period, but, late in the period, the Bank of England announced an expansion of its Funding for Lending Scheme.  On net, 10-year sovereign yields declined about 10 basis points in Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and Canada.   
After appreciating , on balance, since early this year, the foreign exchange value of 
the dollar wa s about unchanged against a broad set of currencies over the intermeeting 
period.  The dollar appreciated 4½ percent against the yen but depreciated about 1 percent against the euro and pound, with most of the depreciation occurring after the 
weaker -than-expected U.S. March employment report.  The dollar also depreciated 
modestly against most emerging market currencies, including the renminbi, which Chinese au thorities allowed to appreciate ½  percent against the U.S. dollar.   
Foreign official purchases of U.S. securities moderated in February after 
rebounding strongly in December and January.  The lower purchases were more than accounted for by Asian counterpa rties.  Custody holdings data at the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York indicate that foreign official purchases weakened further , on net, in 
March.  Foreign private investors showed some renewed interest in Treasury securities and U.S. corporate bonds in Fe bruary, which was partially offset by sales of agency 
bonds and corporate stocks.  U.S. investors made modest purchases of foreign bonds and very large purchases of foreign stocks in February. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remain ed strong so far this year, though 
they slowed somewhat from the outsized pace observed at the end of last year.  The rate of bond issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in March and April, roughly in line

  with the pace in January and February .  Consist ent with recent trends, some companies 
reportedly retired a notable portion of their CP  outstanding and  issued longer- term bonds 
in comparable amounts.  Syndicated leveraged loans were issued at a record pace in the 
first quarter, supported by robust demand for these generally floating -rate assets from  
banks and particularly nonbank institutions, such as  CLOs  and loan funds.  About 
75 percent of that volume was used to refinance existing debt, and the amount of incremental issuanc e (or “new money”) in the first quarter of 2013 remained near the 
pace seen over the past couple of years .  Strong demand from investors for leveraged 
loans also pushed the median bid price in the secondary market  for the 100 most liquid 
loans slightly above par for the first time since mid -2007. 
The latest available indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations 
continued to be solid.  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds upgraded by Moody’s 
Investors Service rebounded in February and significantly exceed ed that of downgrades 
in March.  The six -month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firms remained low 
by historical standards in March , while the KMV expected year -ahead default rate for 
nonfinancial firms was roughly unchanged in April.  
Turning to equity finan ce, gross public issuance was solid in the first quarter , 
mainly owing to robust IPO and secondary offerings in January that reflected improved 
sentiment in the U.S. equity markets over the corresponding period .  However, w ith the 
corporate sector still flush with cash, net equity issuance appears to have remained deeply negative so far this year.  Moreover, data on merger activity and announcements of new share repurchase programs in the first quarter indicate that equity r etirements are likely to 
significantly outpace gross issuance over coming months . 
Conditions in some segments of the commercial real estate (CRE) sector 
continued to improve at a moderate pace in recent months.  Outstanding CRE loans held by commercial banks have edged up in the past two quarters, following a prolonged 
period of decline.  According to the April SLOOS, the fraction of banks that reported 
having eased standards on CRE loans over the past three months increased to a relat ively 
high level while demand for these loans reportedly strengthened further.  CMBS issuance was strong in the first quarter, and spreads on newly issued securities, as well as those trading in the secondary market, were stable at moderate levels.  Prices  on commercial 
properties hav e generally continued to move up slowly, and price indexes for various 
market segments are now  at levels last seen in late 2008.  Vacancy rates have returned to

  about their long- term averages for office properties but  have remained elevated for retail 
and industrial properties.  
GOVERNMENT FINANCE  
Since the March  FOMC m eeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned 
$200 billion  in nominal securities and $31 billion in  TIPS.4  On balance, the auctions 
were about in line with expectations, although for some, especially the five- year TIPS 
auction later in the intermeeting period, the bid -to-cover ratios were below their recent 
averages . 
The pace of gross  issuance of long -term municipal bonds picked up somewhat 
toward the end of the first quarter, largely owing to issuance for new capital  projects .  
The ratio of yields on 20-year municipal bonds to yields on comparable- maturity 
Treasury securities —a gauge o f the perceived  relative risk of municipal bonds—
increased moderately, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Investor demand for 
municipal bonds may have softened against the backdrop of the inclusion in the Administration’s budget proposal of a cap on th e tax deduction for interest on municipal 
debt, as well as a federal court ruling allowing the municipality of Stockton, California, 
to proceed with chapter 9 bankruptcy, which may have raised the specter of lower recovery rates for municipal bond investors. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates declined 16 basis points over the intermeeting period, bringing the 
average rate to about 3.3 percent .  The primary –secondary spread remains well below the 
peaks  seen d uring the second half of 2012.  Estimated  mortgage r efinance origination  
volumes continued to be heavy, reflect ing the historically low mortgage rates.   However , 
purchase mortgage applications stayed  essentially unchanged  at low levels . 
House prices continued to grow briskly in recent months.  All four major 
indexes —CoreLogic, Zillow, FHFA, and S&P/ Case–Shiller —registered  their  largest 
year-over-year increases since June 2006.  Robust investor demand has boosted prices , 
                                                 
4 On May 19, 2013, the statutory debt limit will be increased to the level of debt subject to limit as 
of May 18, 2013.  The new limit will reflect only the funding needed for authorized  commitments incurred 
by the federal government through that date.  At that point, if the Treasury were to declare a “d ebt issuance 
suspension period, ” we project that the use of extraordinary measures would allow the Treasury to  delay 
the breach of the debt ceiling for several months.

  and a tight supply of homes listed for sale in many markets with strong demand has 
report edly also played a role.  Staff estimates suggest that i ncreases in house prices 
contributed to lifting about 4 million homeowners out of a negative equity  position in 
2012. 
The performance of outstanding r esidential mortgages  continued to improve in the 
first quarter.  Overall m ortgage delinquencies have trended lower in both the prime and 
subprime sectors.  Moreover, the transition rate into delinquency for prime mortgages is 
now at roughly its very low 2005 rate , primarily reflecting the very tight underwriting 
standards imposed over the past several years, as well as the increases  in house prices and 
employment.   
The April SLOOS  contained a set of special questions regarding  banks’ 
residential real estate ( RRE ) lending policies.  O n a portfolio-weighted basis, banks’ 
willingness to approve GSE- eligible  home-purchase loans was reportedly about 
unchanged, regardless of credit score and down-payment size.  In contrast , moderate net 
fractions of banks indicated that they were less willing to approve FHA -insured home- 
purchase loan applications from borrowers with relatively low FICO scores.   Banks cited 
a number of important factors generally restraining their  ability or willingness to approve 
all types of home-purchase loans, especially the risk of putback of delinquent mortgages 
by the GSEs  and periods in which volumes of loan applications exceeded  the bank s’ 
processing capac ity. 
Consumer credit continued to expan d in January and February, primarily driven 
by sizable increases in nonrevolving credit .  Growth in auto loans and that in student 
loans extended through the Department of Education’s Direct Loan Program were particularly strong .  In contrast, total revolving credit was about flat  amid continued tight 
underwriting standards and terms on credit card loans.  S ecuritized consumer finance 
activity remained robust in recent months.  In particular, subprime auto ABS issuance has 
totaled nearly $5½ billion in the year to date, approach ing its pre -recession pace.    
Although the student loan segment has been  an exception, consumer debt has 
continued to perform well.  For example, the delinquency rate for credit card loans in 
securitized pools over January and February , at 2¼ percent, was  near its historical low , 
likely reflect ing a substantial compositional shift of outstanding credit  card  balances  
toward the least risky borrowers  since late 2008 and early 2009.

  COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit expanded moderately during the first quarter of 2013, as loans and 
securities holdings grew at a similar pace.  Gains in core loans continued to be 
concentrated in commercial and industrial (C&I ) loans, which increased at an especially  
robust rate at domestic banks.  The “o ther loans and leases” categor y also grew notably 
during the first quarter.  Growth in banks’ holdings of securities over the past three 
months was  roughly on par with that of previous quarter s, with the main  contributor to 
recent growth being  sizable purchases by a few large domestic banks  of securities  that are 
not backed by the U.S. government or the GSE s.  Finally, balance sheet data from U.S. 
branches and agencies of European banks showed little evidence of renewed strains 
despite the events in Cyprus.  
The April SLOOS indicated that, in the aggregate, domestic respondents eased 
their lending standards on core loans and experienced  stronger demand for such  loan s in 
the first quarter of 2013.  In particular, relatively large net fractions of domestic banks 
reported having eased  standards and reduced spreads on C&I loans to firms of all sizes.  
However, the fraction of domestic banks reporting stronger demand for C&I loans declined relative to  the previous survey.  Concerning lending conditions for households, a 
significant net fraction of banks experienced  stronger demand for prime residential 
mortgage loans, but only a modest fraction indicated that they had eased standards on such loans over the past three months.  Respondent banks’ standards and terms on most types of consumer loans remained basically unchanged.  The exception was auto loans, for which  moderate net fractions of banks reported having eased some terms and having 
experienced stronger demand.   
Aver age annualized growth of M2  over March and April  was about 5 percent , a 
faster  pace than was observed over the course of the first two months of the year.  Liquid 
deposits and currency advanced moderately over March and April , while retail money 
market  funds and small time deposits contracted.  Recent money growth may have been 
boosted slightly by the higher level of annual tax receipts relative to recent years.  
However , year -to-date growth  in liquid deposits has been somewhat below the average 
pace observed in the same period during the prior t wo years.   Meanwhile, the monetary 
base expanded at a 37½ percent  annual rate over March and April, driven mainly by the 
increase in reserve balances that resulted from the Federal Reserve’s purchases of 
Treasury securities and agency MBS.  Overall, t he gr owth in reserve balances  since year -

Appendix  
Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  
On balance, the responses to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices indicated that domestic banks e ased their lending standards and e xperienced 
stronger  loan demand during the first  quarter.1  Moderate to large net fractions of survey 
respondents reported ha ving eased pricing terms on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, and 
moderate n et fractions reportedly eased standards on both C&I and commercial real estate (CRE) 
loans.  Mean while , lending standards and terms were little changed, on balance, for most other 
types of loans .  Regarding the demand for bank loans, respondents indicated that demand for 
CRE , residential real estate , and auto loans had strengthened on balance.  Demand for C&I loans 
also reportedly increased, but such reports w ere less widespread  than in  the previous survey .  The 
April  survey included a number of special questions regarding banks’ lending policies for  
residential real estate and private student loans ; the survey also repeated a set of special questions 
on lending to and competition from banks headquartered in Europe. 
The survey results generally in dicated that banks’ policies regarding lending to 
businesses eased over the past three months.  In particular, a relatively large  fraction of domestic 
respondents reported having eased  standards on C&I loans and  moderate to large net fractions of 
such resp ondents  reportedly eased many  terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes .  Banks that 
eased their C&I lending policies generally cited  increased competition for such loans as an 
important reason for having done so.  A moderate net fraction of banks reportedl y eased their 
CRE lending standards over the past three months— a slightly higher fraction in comparison with 
the previous survey.    
On the household side, the survey results were more mixed.  On balance, a  few domestic 
banks reported having eased standards on prime residential mortgages over the past three months.  
For the fourth  consecutive survey, o n a portfolio- weighted basis, respondents reported that 
demand for prime residential mortgage loans had strengthened on net.2  A small  net fraction of 
respondents reported that they had eased standards on credit card and auto loans over the past 
three months, while standards on other consumer loans had remained about unchanged.  On 
                                                 
1 The April 2013 survey addressed changes in the supply of and demand for loans to businesses 
and households over the past three months.  This appendix is based on responses from 68 domestic banks 
and 21 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Respondent banks recei ved the survey on or after 
April 2, 2013, and responses were due by April 16, 2013.  
For questions that ask about lending standards or terms, reported net fractions equal the fraction of 
banks that reported having tightened standards minus the fraction of banks that reported having eased 
standards.  For questions that ask about demand, reported net fractions equal the fraction of banks that 
reported stronger demand minus the fraction of banks that reported weaker demand.  
2 Where noted, responses are weighted by survey respondents’ holdings of the relevant loan type 
as reported in the December 31, 2012, Call Report.

  balance, banks reported having  eased selected terms on  auto loans , but terms on credit card and 
other consumer loans were reportedly little changed .   
In response to a set of special questions on banks’ residential real estate lending  policies , 
most banks indicated that their willingness to  approve GSE -eligible  mortgages to borrowers with 
lower credit scores was about unchanged relative to a year ago , despite improvement s in the 
housing sector over this period.  In contrast, about one -third of respondents indicated that they 
were less likely to approve  home- purchase loan applications  insured by the Federal Housing 
Administration ( FHA ) with relatively low FICO scores.  Banks reported a number of important 
factors restraining the ir current  willingness or ability to approve home-purchase loans, especially  
the risk of putback of delinquent mortgages  by the GSEs despite moves by those agencies to 
address concerns expressed by the industry.  When asked to l ook ahead over the next year , a 
moderate net fraction of banks, on a portfolio- weighted basis,  reported that they expect ed to 
decrease their  holdings of  residential real estate assets —loans, agency mortgage -backed securities 
(MBS ), and private -label MBS .   
LENDING TO BUSINESSES  
Questions on Commercial and Industrial Lending  
A moderate fraction of domestic survey respondents, on net, indicated that their C&I 
lending standards had eased  somewhat for all firm sizes over the first quarter of 2013.  On 
balance, respondents reported that they had eased most terms on C&I loans, reg ardless of firm 
size, and that no such terms  were tightened .  As has been the case for some time, there was 
considerable variation  in the number of banks that reported having eased  various C&I loan terms.  
A very large fraction of respondents indicated that they had decreased spreads on C&I loan rates 
over the ir bank’s  cost of funds for firms of all sizes.  Moderate to large net fractions of banks 
again reported having reduced the cost of credit lines and decreased the use of interest rate floors 
for all firm sizes.  In addition, consistent with reports of increases in so -called covenant- lite deals 
in the syndicated leveraged loan market, about one -half of large domestic banks reported having 
eased loan covenants for large and middle- market firms in the A pril survey, up from 30 percent in 
the January survey .3 
Of the respondents that reported having eased  either standards or terms on C&I loans 
over the past three months, all but one cited more-aggressive competition from other banks or 
nonbank lenders as an  important reason for having done so.  About 40 percent  of respondents  that 
had eased their C&I loan policies cited a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook  as a 
somewhat important or very important reason .  As in the previous two survey s, no other reasons 
were broadly cited by banks as being important for easing their C&I lending policies.   
                                                 
3 Large banks  are defined as those with total domestic assets of $20 billion or more as of 
December 31, 2012.  Large and middle -market firms  are generally defined as firms with annual sales of 
$50 million or more and small firms as those with annual sales of less than $50 million.

  Meanwhile, responses from domestic banks indicated that the change in demand for C&I 
loans was mixed  in the first quarter,  with large banks reporting weaker demand for C&I loans, on 
balance, and other banks reporting stronger demand.  Large banks also reported a net decrease in 
the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers regarding new or increased credit lines, 
while other banks reported net increases.  Consistent with survey results, the Federal Reserve’s 
weekly bank balance sheet data suggest that the growth rate of C&I loans slowed in the first 
quarter at banks reporting weaker demand in the survey.  However, these data indicate that for the 
banking sector as a whole,  C&I loans at large banks are still growing at a faster pace than at 
smaller banks so far this year.  Banks reporting weaker  C&I loan demand in the survey most 
often cited decreases in customers’ funding needs related to investment in plant or equipment as a 
reason .  Banks indicating that C&I loan demand had strengthened cited increases in  customers’ 
funding needs related to investment in plant or equipment , inventor ies, and accounts receivable as  
the top reasons . 
Similar to the previous two survey s, foreign respondents reported that their C&I lending 
standards had remained about unchanged, on net, over the past three months, but that some terms 
had been eased .  A moderate net fraction of foreign respondents reported having narrowed C&I 
loan spreads over their cost of funds, increased the maximum size of credit lines, and reduced 
premiums charged on ris kier loan s.  As was the case for domestic respondents, the reason most 
widely cited by foreign respondents for easing standar ds or terms on C&I loans was more-
aggressive competition from other lenders.  Consistent with robust growth in the issuance of 
collateralized loan obligations in the first quarter, a  majority of foreign respondents that eased 
standards or terms  on C&I loans also pointed to increased liquidity in the secondary market for 
such loans as a reason for  having done so .  Modest net fractions of foreign respondents indicated  
that demand for C&I loans had strengthened over the past three months.   Almost all foreign 
respondents reporting stronger demand cited  customers’ increased  merger or acquisition 
financing needs as a very important reason.  
Special Questions on Lending to and Competition from European Banks  
The April  survey again  included special questions about lending to banks headquartered 
in Europe and affiliates and subsidiaries of European banks regardless of their location (hereafter, 
European banks).  All respondents, both foreign and domestic, report ed that their standards for 
loans to European banks remained basically unchanged over the past three months, the first time there was no additional  tightening  since the introduction of this special question in the October 
2011 survey.  As in the January  survey, domestic banks reported that they had experien ced little 
change in demand for loans from European banks.  The share of domestic banks that have 
observed an expansion of C&I lending business as a result of a decrease in competition from European banks continued to trend down.  In fact, two respondents reported an increase in 
competition from European banks.

moderate net fraction of foreign respondents reported ly experienced stronger demand for such

observed in outstanding CRE loans on banks’ books over the past two quarters following several 
years of declines.

Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending  
Overall, only small numbers of domestic respondents report ed changes in either standards 
or demand for residential real estate lending during the previous three months , with the exception 
of a significant net fraction of banks that indicated that the demand for prime mortgages had 
picked up.  The reported increase in demand for prime residential mortgages is even larger w hen 
the responses are weighted by the amount of outstanding closed-end mortgage balances held on 
each respondent’s books.  In contrast, w eighted responses continued to indicate that demand for 
nontraditional mortgages had declin ed.  Meanwhile, a few domestic banks reported having eased 
their standards on prime residential mortgages and respondents’ lending standards for 
nontra ditional mortgages were little changed .  On a weighted basis, a modest fraction of banks 
reportedly had eased standards for home equity lines of credit, on net, while demand for such 
loans was unchanged . 
Special Questions on Residential Real Estate Lending  
The April survey contained a set of special questions about banks’  residential real estate 
lending policies .  One such question asked banks how much more or less likely it currently is, 
compared with a year ago, that their bank would approve an application for a GSE- eligible ,  
30-year fixed -rate home- purchase loan from  a borrower with a FICO score (or equivalent) of 620, 
680, or 720 and a down payment of 10 or 20 percent (for a total of six categories of borrowers).  
About 25 percent  of the banks surveyed indicated that they were  currently  less likely  to approve  
such loan applications with a FICO score of 620 and a down payment of 10 percent, but only 
10 percent  of banks  were less likely to approve the loan if the down payment was 20 percent .  
However, when weighted by their holdings of residential real estate  loans , banks reported  they 
were currently about as likely to approve GSE- eligible home -purchase loan applications as they 
were a year ago  regardless of FICO score and down-payment size.  Banks were also asked to 
compare their bank’s current likelihood of approving an application for an FHA-insured home-
purchase loan with a given FICO score with  their likelihood a year ago.  On a weighted basis, for 
a borrower with a FICO score of 620, abou t 45 percent  of banks reported  that they would be at 
least somewhat less likely  to approve such a l oan currently .  Banks’ lower willingness to approve 
FHA -insured loan applications versus GSE -eligible  loan applications relative to a year ago may 
reflect th e more recent decision by  the FHA to tighten its underwriting criteria .  The GSEs 
tightened such criteria several years ago .   
Another special question asked banks about factors currently restraining their willingness 
or ability to approve conforming and nonconforming home-purchase loans.  Despite the new

  representation and warranty framework that took effect on January 1, almost all banks, on a 
portfolio- weighted basis, cited the risk of putback of delinquent mortgages by the GSEs as an 
important factor restraining the ir current ability  or willingness to approve home- purchase loans .4  
Continuing to use portfolio-weighted responses, m ore than three-fourths of banks cited periods 
during which a high volume of residential real estate loan applications exceed their banks’ 
capacity to process applications and complete appraisals and underwriting as at least a somewhat 
important factor.  While house prices have generally  improved over the past year, three -fourths of 
respondents viewed  either  the outlook for house prices or economic activity as at least  somewhat 
important factor s currently restraining  their bank’s  residential real estate lending.  Three -fourths 
of respondents also indicated that the “ risk-adjusted profitability of the residential mortgage 
business relative to other possible uses of funds” was  an important factor restraining such 
lending, and in a separate question , a large fraction  of respondents  report ed an increase in the 
importance of th is factor over the past year .  
Looking ahead, portfolio- weig hted survey responses indicated that a modest net fraction 
of banks anticipate reducing  their holdings of residential real estate loans  over the next year.   
Similar net fraction s reportedly anticipate reducing their  combined exposure to all types of 
reside ntial real estate assets  over the next year, including  residential mortgage loans held on 
balance sheet  and holdings of government-backed or other mortgage -backed securities.   While 
most large banks reported  that their appetite for residential mortgage ass ets will stay the same or 
decline somewhat over the same period , a number of smaller banks indicated  that they anticipated  
their exposure would increase.  On both a weighted and unweighted basis, a moderate fraction of 
banks reportedly anticipate reducing their holdings of private -label MBS  on net. 
Questions on Consumer Lending  
Responses from domestic banks indicated that they are somewhat more willing to make 
consumer installment loans now as opposed to three months ago.  However, only a small net 
fraction  of banks reported having eased  standards on credit card loans and auto loans , and 
respondents’ standards on other consumer loans reportedly remained about unchanged.  On 
balance, several banks reported that they had increased the maximum maturity of auto loans and 
reduc ed spreads on such loans .  Other terms across the three categories of consumer loans 
remained little changed, on net , over the past three months.  
Demand for credit card loans was reportedly unchanged  on a portfolio- weighted basis , 
but a large net fraction of respondents reported stronger demand for auto and other consumer 
loans.   
Special Questions on Private Student Loans  
The April survey also contained a set of special questions on private student loans .  Only 
14 of the 68 domestic res pondents indicated  that they currently hold private student loans.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first 
scenario focuses on the possibility that the normalization of conditions in financial and labor markets proceeds more gradually than assumed in the baseline,  resulting in a slower 
recovery .  The second  scenario contemplates  a stronger re covery in residential 
construction and house prices that  spark s broader and faster improvements in the overall 
economy ; the third scenario then builds on the second by considering the prospect  that 
more -rapid economic growth could be accompanied by greater financial risk -taking and a 
persistent increase in inflation .  The fourth and fifth scenarios are  motivated  by 
alternatives to  the staff’s explanation for the combination of modest GDP growth and a 
substantial decline in the unemployment rate seen over the past few years—either that 
past and projected declines in the natural rate are more rapid than assumed in the baseline because more long -term unemployed workers are permanently leaving the labor force, or 
that structural productivity is lower and increas ing less rapidly than we estimate.  The 
final two scenarios consider  risks  to the U.S.  economy  from foreign economic 
developments—first, that the  recession in  Europe could be deeper  than we currently 
anticipate , and , second, that  economic growth in China could slow sharply further.   
We generate the first five  scenarios using the FRB/US model and th e last two  
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations , the federal funds rate 
follows an inertial  version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , subject  to the thresholds for the  
unemployment rate and inflation announced by the FOMC following its  December  2012 
meeting .  For t he SIGMA simulations , we use a broadly similar  policy rule , subject to the 
same unemployment and inflation thresholds but employing  an alternative concept of 
resource utilization.
1  In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA 
portfolio follow their baseline paths.   
                                                 
1 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence o f slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 Weak Recovery  
Despite the disappointingly slow pace of the recovery to date and recent weakness 
in some indicators, the baseline forecast continues to feature a steady  normalization of 
financial and labor market conditions.  But even this guarded outlook could prove to be 
overly optimistic.  In this scenario, risk premiums remain elevated at roughly their current level through 2015, while real wage growth runs substantially below the baseline 
projection.  In response to higher borrowing costs, less wealth, and lower labor income, 
household expenditures decline relative to the baseline .  Firms are also less willing to 
invest and hire in this environment, further restraining household income and consumption.  All told, real GDP growth averages just under 2½ percent per year through 2015, ¾ percentage point less, on average, than in the baseline.  Accordingly, the unemployment rate stays above the 6½ percent threshold until mid -2017, while inflation 
remains below 2  percent ; consequently, the federal funds rate does not begin to rise until 
the third quarter of 2017.

The increases in house prices, housing starts, and home sales over the past year  or 
so may be pointing to a more robust recovery in the housing market (and ultimately the 
overall economy) than assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, a stronger housing 
recovery, along with reduced  uncertainty about the durability of the expansion more 
broadly , spark s a self -reinforcing boom involving increased consumer and business 
confidence, faster hiring, improved financial conditions , and greater credit availability 
that leads to stronger growth in spending by households and firms.  As a result, real GDP 
rises at an annual rate of 3½ percent  in the second half of this year and above 4 pe rcent in  
2014 and 2015; the unemployment rate fal ls below 6½ percent by  the end  of 2014 and 
declines to 5 percent in late 2015—¾ percentage point below our projection  of the 
natural rate at that time .  With resource slack  disappearing more rapidly , wages and unit 
labor costs begin to accelerate gradually relative to the baseline; however , with long- term 
inflation expectations assumed to be well anchored, consumer price inflation  rises to  only 
2¼ percent by  2017.  The federal funds rate lifts off at t he beginning of 2015 and remain s 
well above the baseline thereafter.       
Boom with Adverse Side  Effects 
In the previous scenario, while the recovery is robust, inflation is nevertheless 
well-contained and financial market conditions display few signs of f roth; as a result, the 
unexpected strength of demand in that scenario does not pose a dilemma  for monetary

 policy.  In this scenario, by contrast, the stronger recovery engenders a more substantial 
financial market response including a larger reduction of risk aversion in financial 
markets, faster growth in lending, and greater use of leverage—developments that boost real activity further but also increas e risks to financial stability.  In addition, the ensuing 
rapid pace of economic growth, in an environm ent of still highly accommodative 
monetary policy, is assumed to lead to an unmooring of inflation expectations .  As a 
result, actual inflation climbs to  2¾ percent later in the decade.  Under these condition s, 
the federal funds rate rises  to 5¼ percent, 2  percentage points above the baseline.  Thus, 
although the risks to financial stability do not develop into a financial crisis in this scenario, policymakers confront an economy with both persistently high inflation and heightened financial vulnerability.  
Lower Natural Rate   
In assessing the factors that may explain why the unemployment rate has declined 
substantially over the past few years despite only modest growth in real GDP, the staff 
may have understated the role played by declines in the natural rate.  In this scenario, we 
consider the possibility t hat the natural rate of unemployment has already declined to 
around 5½ percent ( nearly ½ percentage point below the staff’s estimate) and that it 
reaches its long -run value of 5¼ percent  by late 2013 —several years earlier than in the 
baseline.  However, this  more rapid decline is assumed to be the result of a greater 
number of the long- term unemployed permanently leaving the labor force, rather than  an 
improvement in labor market functioning .  The combination of a lower  natural rate and a 
steeper downward trend in labor force participation implies little change in potential labor input—and thus only a small revision from the baseline in potential GDP —through 
2015.
2  Under these conditions, real GDP  and employment run  close to the baseline, but 
the unemployment rate declines  more rapidly and falls below its threshold value in t he 
first quarter of 2015.  Given the assumption that the federal funds rate will be set 
according to the inertial Taylor rule  once the threshold on unemployment is crossed, the 
funds rate begins to rise two  quarter s earlier than in the baseline.    
                                                 
2 In contrast, the natural rate of unemployment could decline because of an improvement in labor 
market functioning.  In this case, the natural rate would fall but trend labor force participation would not, 
resulting in higher potential output.  In such circumstances, GDP growth would be somewhat higher than in 
this scenario, but the unemployment rate would be little different.

 Supply -Side Damage  
In explaining t he co -movement s of output and the unemployment rate over the 
past few  years, and in contrast to the previous scenario, the staff may have instead 
understated the damage to potential output caused by the financial cris is and the 
subsequent recession.  Speci fically, the staff may still be overestimating the growth of 
structural  productivity during the past few years, as more of the growth in actual 
productivity early in the recession may have been a result of unsustainably aggress ive 
cuts to the workforce than the staff has assumed.  Accordingly, more of the recent 
downward surprise in the unemployment rate may reflect the ongoing reversal of this prior reduction in the workforce.  T his scenario assumes  that the current level of potential 
output is 1 percent lower than in the baseline because of s maller -than-estimated gains in 
structural productivity over the past few years .  Moreover, these smaller  productivity 
gains  continue, shaving ¼ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of 
potential GDP in the coming years.  As a result, real GDP rises  only about 2¾ percent per 
year, on average, in 2013 and 2014, and economic growth remains below the  baseline 
pace through 2017.  Given the downw ard revision to potential output, the output gap is 
initially narrower, which , consistent with  Okun’s law, implies  a more rapid decline in the 
unemployment rate  early in  the projection period.  With the unemployment rate falling 
below its threshold value in early 2015, and inflation little changed from the baseline, the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound three  quarters earlier than 
in the baseline.    
Prolonged European Recession 
In the baseline forecast, the European economies expand at a modest pace while 
financial stress and s overeign and corporate spreads slowly decline to their 2010 levels. 
Risks remain of a severe escalation in financial stress in Europe that disrupts global financial markets.  However, a more prominent downside risk is that the recession in Europe will prove deeper and more prolonged than we currently project but will not 
trigger a global financial crisis.  I n this scenario, fiscal and financial headwinds in Europe 
are assumed to prove stronger than anticipated , but the spillover effects to other financial 
markets are relatively limited.  Specifically, continued investor concerns and weak loan 
supply leave borrowing costs about 100 basis points higher than in the baseline, leading to weaker business and household spending.  As a consequence, European GDP decl ines 
2¼ percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2014, notwithstanding a real 
depreciation of the European currencies of about 10 percent against the dollar.  The 
stronger dollar and weaker foreign activity cause U.S. net exports to fall relative to the

 baseline, but, with limited financial market contagion, the spillover effects on the United 
States are not severe.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands about 2¼ percent , on average, this 
year and in 2014, about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline.  With a higher 
unemployment rate, the federal funds rate remains near zero until the second quarter of  
2016, two  quarter s longer than in the baseline. 
Hard Landing in China  
Although real GDP growth in China appears to have slowed substantially in the 
first quarter of this year, in our baseline forecast we expect it to return to a pace close to 8 percent by the end of 2013.  Nevertheless, important downside risks attend this outlook, including the possibility of a bust in the property sector associated with a sharp slowdown 
in credit growth and a collapse in construction.  In this scenario, we assume these risks 
materialize and real GDP in China rises at an annual pace of only 5 percent in 2013 and 7 percent in 2014.  Moreover, we assume that the slowdown in China’s economy has pronounced spillovers to other major U.S. trading partners in Asia.  In this environment, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar averages about 3 percent higher than in 
the baseline over the next 2 years.  U.S. real net exports decline relative to the baseline in 
response to weaker foreign economic growth and the dollar’s appreciation.  U.S. real 
GDP expands at an annual rate of only 2 percent and 2¾ percent in 2013 and 2014, 
respectively, and the unemployment rate stays above 7½ percent until mid-2014, about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation falls below 1½ percent in 2013 and 2014 because of both the appreciation in the dollar and lower resource utilization.  With a higher unemployment rate, the federal funds rate remains near zero until early 2016, one quarter longer than in the baseline.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
    surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
