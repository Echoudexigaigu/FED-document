Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Taken as a whole, the indicators that we have received since the April Tealbook 
suggest a slightly weaker-than-anticipated pace of spending and production during the 
first half of this year.  On the spending side , first-quarter real GDP growth now appears to 
have been softer than the available data suggested at the time of the April Tealbook; 
similarly, the incoming readings on second- quarter consumer spending and business 
outlays for equipment and software (E&S) point to somewhat less growth in these 
components of final demand relative to our previous projection.  In addition, factory 
output has surprised us to the downside in recent months.  All told, real GDP is now 
projected to rise at an annual ra te of 2 percent in the first ha lf of this year, ¼ percentage 
point less than our April forecast. 
Despite the slightly weaker first half, we have made a small upward revision to 
our forecast for real activity over the medi um term.  Among the factors boosting the 
outlook for spending this round, the most importa nt were the higher paths for equity and 
house prices that we have assumed in this forecast, which result in a modestly faster pace 
of consumer spending.  We now expect real  GDP growth to come in at just under 
3 percent over the second half of 2013, led by an acceleration in consumption and 
business investment.  After that, GDP is expected to rise around 3½ percent per year in 2014 and 2015.  All told, the level of real GDP at  the end of the medium term is similar 
to what we wrote down in April.   
The incoming data on the labor market were, in total, a little better than expected, 
and we have carried some of that good news  forward.  In addition, despite the similar 
forecast for real GDP, we have significantly marked down the projected path of the 
unemployment rate over the medium term.  In this forecast, we have brought forward the improvement in labor market functioning that we had assumed would occur over the course of the recovery, and have also assumed additional permanent withdrawals of less-
employable workers from the labor force.  As discussed in the secti ons on potential GDP 
and the medium-term outlook for the labor ma rket, these revisions steepen the downward 
trajectory for both the actual and natural ra tes of unemployment.  We therefore now 
project that the unemployment rate will declin e from 7½ percent in the current quarter to 
5¾ percent at the end of 2015 and expect it to  cross the FOMC’s 6½ percent threshold in 
the first quarter of 2015, two quarters earlier than in the April Tealbook.  Even so, the

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  last published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP) following  
the March FOMC meeting.   The table  below summarizes  revisions  to the staff 
economic  projection  since the  March Tealbook.    
The staff projection  for real GDP growth is essentially  the same as in the March 
Tealbook.   However,  the projection for the  unemployment  rate is revised down 
significantly,  primarily the result of the revisions  we made in this Tealbook  to our 
estimates  of the natural rate of unemployment.   Taking into account those 
revisions to the natural rate, the projection  for the unemployment  gap is about 
unrevised  over the  medium term, with the gap narrowing  to about ½  percentage  
point by the end of 2015.   
The staff projection  for inflation has  revised down  this year relative  to the March 
projection,  reflecting  the surprisingly  low incoming  data.  However, as  we view 
this surprise as mostly reflecting  transitory  factors, our  projection  for inflation  in 
2014 and 2015, at 1½ percent,  is also essentially  unrevised  from Marc h.   
With the revised unemployment  projection,  the unemployment  rate now  crosses 
the FOMC’s 6½ percent threshold  in early 2015, and  the policy rule that governs 
our assumption  for the federal funds  rate calls  for the rate to lift  off from the 
effective lower bound  in the second quarter of 2015, two quarters  earlier than  in 
the March Tealbook.  The federal funds  rate therefore  ends 2015  about 75 basis 
points higher than in March.

  lower natural rate and associated higher leve l of potential GDP in this projection imply 
that the unemployment gap and GDP gap are each a little wider  than in April. 
The recent data on core consumer prices once again came in lower than expected.  
Although a portion of the downward surprise to the core appear s to be transitory, we took 
some signal from our latest miss and redu ced our near-term inflation projection.  
Thereafter, the core inflation forecast is very similar to the April Tealbook, with core 
PCE prices expected to rise 1.6 percen t in 2014 and 1.8 percent in 2015.  Headline 
inflation runs a little under core inflation over the medium term, as consumer energy 
prices are expected to decline in line w ith our assumed path for crude oil prices. 
As we discuss more fully in the Risks and Uncertainty section, we view the 
degree of uncertainty associat ed with our projection of r eal activity as being about 
normal.  Nevertheless, we continue to view th e risks to the projection for real activity as 
skewed to the downside, in part because of  the constraints on m onetary policy imposed 
by the effective lower bound.  We also re gard the uncertainty around our inflation 
forecast as being about normal, but we see these risks as roughly balanced.  This assessment of risks is unchanged from April. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We left our assumption for the cumulative purchase of long-term securities under 
the LSAP program unrevised.  Specifically, we  assume that the pace of purchases will be 
gradually reduced from $85 billion per month to zero over the course of the second half 
of this year, resulting in cumula tive purchases of $750 billion in 2013.1  Market 
expectations for the total size of the asse t purchase program, which were assessed in 
April to be about $1.25 trillion, appear to ha ve declined and are now assumed to be 
around $1 trillion.  As in earlier editions of  the Tealbook, we assume that, over the next 
few months, market participants will bring their expectations for the ultimate size of the 
program into line with the intentions of the Committee, and that this learning process will 
result in some additional modest upward pressure on long-term  interest rates. 
                                                 
1 A more gradual slowing in the pace of purchases ov er the second half of this year might result in 
cumulative purchases of about $900 billion, or $150 billion more than our baseline assumption.  Staff 
analysis suggests that an additional $150 billion in asset purchases would lower the unemployment rate by 
4 to 8 basis points by the end of 2015, and raise the PCE inflation rate by 0 to 6 basis points.

  In terms of conventional m onetary policy, we now assume  that the federal funds 
rate will lift off from its e ffective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, two quarters 
earlier than in the April Tealbook.  The ear lier increase in the policy path reflects 
downward revisions to our projection for the unemployment rate, which result in the 
Committee’s threshold for the federal funds rate  being crossed at an earlier date than 
before.2 
Other Interest Rates 
The 10-year Treasury yield has increased about 50 basis points since the April 
Tealbook, likely owing, in part, to a combin ation of more upbeat sentiment among 
market participants about the domestic ec onomic outlook and greater uncertainty about 
the size and duration of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program.  We continue to 
expect yields to rise substantially over the medium term; this path primarily reflects the 
movement of the 10-year valuation window th rough the period of extremely low short-
term interest rates and a gradual waning of  the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet 
policies.  The level of the 10- year Treasury yield that we an ticipate at the end of 2015 is 
only a bit higher than in the Ap ril Tealbook, as we interpret re cent increases in yields as 
mostly pulling forward increases in term pr emiums that we had previously assumed 
would be spread out over the medium term. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have increased about 60 basis points, 
leaving their implied risk spread s somewhat higher.  We continue  to expect this spread to 
narrow gradually over the forecast horizon and to end 2015 about ½ percentage point 
lower, at which time the yield on BBB-rated bonds is projected to be 5½ percent.  
Conventional 30-year mortgage rates have increased about 55 basis points to nearly 
4 percent since the time of th e April Tealbook and are expect ed to rise further with 
benchmark yields to around 5¼ percen t by the end of the projection period. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
The Dow Jones U.S. total stock market i ndex has risen about 3 percent since the 
April Tealbook was finalized; we interpret thes e gains as reflecting a more rapid decline 
                                                 
2 As in the April Tealbook, we assume that the federal funds rate will remain within the current 
target range of 0 to ¼ percent at leas t as long as inflation between one to  two years ahead is expected to be 
below 2½ percent and the quarterly average of the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent.  (Given the 
staff’s projections for inflation and unemployment, it is the latter condition that determines the date of 
liftoff in our forecast.)  On ce either threshold is crossed, the federa l funds rate follows the prescriptions of 
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule starting in the following quarter.

  in equity risk premiums than we had prev iously anticipated.  Equity prices are now 
expected to rise at an aver age annual rate of about 8 pe rcent through the end of 2015; the 
pace of these anticipated gains is  a little slower than we had assumed in April, as less of 
the predicted normalization in the equity premium now remain s to be accomplished.  As 
a result, the projected le vel of equity prices at the end of 2015 is little changed from the 
April Tealbook. 
The CoreLogic house price index increased 6½ percent over the first four months 
of this year.  In the past, we have been  skeptical of the pace of house price growth 
implied by the CoreLogic index because of c oncerns related to its seasonal adjustment 
and because other major house price indexes we re rising less rapidly.  We continue to 
harbor concerns about the reli ability of this index as an indicator of household wealth.  
However, in light of the sustained large increases posted by this  and other house price 
series, we have taken a str onger signal from the incoming data and have revised our 
forecast significantly:  We now project that  house prices will rise 13 percent for 2013 as a 
whole before decelerating to a 5 percent pace in 2014 and a 4 percent pace in 2015.  With 
this new path, the level of hous e prices at the end of 2015 is 6 percent higher than in the 
April Tealbook. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are essentially unchanged in this forecast.  In 
particular, we have maintained our assump tion that policy is exerting considerable 
restraint on the growth of aggregate spending as  a result of the expiration of the payroll 
tax cut and implementation of other tax incr eases at the beginning of the year, the 
sequestration, and declines in purchases related to overseas defense operations.  
Accordingly, fiscal policy at all levels of gove rnment is projected to reduce the rate of 
real GDP growth by 1¼ percentage points (excluding multiplier effects) in 2013, by ¾ percentage point in 2014, and by ¼ percentage point in 2015.
3 
The near-term federal deficit outlook has brightened somewhat owing to 
surprisingly strong April tax co llections as well as to recent announcements of large one-
time payments to the Treasury by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Accordingly, we now 
anticipate that the federal unified budget deficit will narrow to 4 percent in fiscal year 2013, down from 7 percent of GDP in fiscal 2012.  The deficit is projected to decline to 
                                                 
3 Including multiplier effects, fiscal policy is project ed to exert a drag on the growth rate of real 
GDP of 1½ percentage points in 2013, 1¼ percentage points in 2014, and ¾ percentage point in 2015.

  2¼ percent of GDP by fiscal 2015 as a resu lt of further improvements in the economy 
and ongoing policy actions to reduce the deficit. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the firs t quarter to 2 percent at an annual rate, 
¼ percentage point lower than expected in th e April Tealbook, as a pickup in activity in 
the advanced foreign economies was more th an offset by subpar growth in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs).  The slowing in the EMEs partly reflected a greater-than-
expected step-down from the strong growth at  the end of last year .  For the second and 
third quarters, we expect aggregate foreign gr owth to pick up to an average annual pace 
of about 2½ percent.  This path is a bit lower than we had projected in the April 
Tealbook, reflecting continued softness in China a nd other EMEs.  As the euro area starts 
to recover and the ongoing U.S. economic expans ion boosts global trade, we project that 
foreign growth will rise to 3½ percent by the end of 2014 and will stay at about that rate 
in 2015, little changed from the previous Tealbook.  
The broad nominal dollar has appreciated  about ½ percent si nce the previous 
Tealbook, as increases against the currencies of many EMEs have more than offset 
declines against most of the major foreign currencies.  Going forward, the broad real 
dollar is projected to depreciate at an annual rate of about 2 percent over the remainder of 
this year and at a roughly 2¼ percent pace thereaf ter.  This rate of depreciation is a touch 
slower than we had assumed in the previous  Tealbook.  While we st ill project that the 
gradual abatement of European financial st ress will lessen safe-haven demand for the 
dollar, we have scaled back the amount of dolla r depreciation that we anticipate from this 
source.  The flatter path of the dollar also reflects our assumptions regarding the earlier 
onset of monetary tightening in  the United States.  On net, the broad real dollar ends the 
forecast period about 1½ percent higher than we had projected at the time of the April 
Tealbook. 
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Oil prices have moved up some since the time of the April Tealbook, reversing a 
dip that took place before that forecast.  Th e spot price of Brent crude oil closed at 
$103 per barrel on June 11, up $3 from the previous Tealbook, while the price of West 
Texas Intermediate increased a little more.  In response to the une xpected strength of 
imported oil prices in the recent trade data, we revised up our forecast for the price of imported oil by a bit more than the observed increase in market prices.  Consequently,

  our forecast for the price of imported oil for th e remainder of this year is $7 per barrel 
higher than in the April Teal book; this upward revision tapers  to about $5 per barrel in 
2015.  Overall, the price of imported oil is pr ojected to decline slow ly over the remainder 
of the forecast period, reaching $90 per barrel at the end of 2015. 
Nonfuel commodity prices ar e little changed on net si nce the April Tealbook, as 
slightly higher food prices balanced a small decline in metals prices.  Notwithstanding the 
modest movement seen in aggregate prices, some individual metals exhibited large price 
swings; in particular, iron-ore prices fell sharply in response to incoming data that 
pointed to weaker Chinese demand.  Overall, nonfuel commodity pri ces are expected to 
remain relatively flat through 2015; this for ecast is in line with quotes from futures 
markets and down slightly from the previous Tealbook. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The incoming spending data led us to trim  our projection for real GDP growth in 
the first half of the year to an average annua l rate of 2 percent, ¼ percentage point lower 
than what we wrote down in the April Teal book.  In the third quarter, we have marked 
down our forecast for investment spending; however, the stronger-than-expected recent 
news about household wealth a nd consumer confidence led us to revise up our forecast 
for consumer spending.  As a result, we antic ipate GDP growth of 2½ percent in the third 
quarter—a pace that is about uncha nged from our April projection.  
Household Spending 
  Available indicators of consumer spendi ng suggest that real PCE edged lower in 
April.4  We have interpreted this unexpected ly weak consumer spending reading as a 
temporary pause and expect a second-quarter pace of real PCE growth that is only a little 
below our April Tealbook forecast.  In the th ird quarter, we raised projected real PCE 
growth by ½ percentage point, to 3 percent at an annual rate; this upward revision reflects 
the higher path for household net worth sugge sted by recent gains in equity and house 
prices, as well as our reaction to May’s not iceable improvement in consumer sentiment.5 
                                                 
4 Although real PCE was estimated  to have risen 0.1 percent in April in the BEA’s most recent 
Personal Income and Outlays release, the annual revision s to retail sales that were released at the end of 
May implied slower growth in retail sales than was incorporated into the preliminary estimate of April 
PCE.  We will receive May retail sales data on Thursday, the day after Tealbook is closed. 
5 Our current estimate of real disposable pers onal income (DPI) growth now implies an even 
larger swing in real DPI between the fourth and first quar ters.  Real DPI spiked in the fourth quarter of last

  We expect residential investment to rise at an average annu al rate of around 
15 percent in the second and thir d quarters; this change is a l ittle weaker than in our April 
projection, reflecting an unexpected drop in starts of multifamily housing units and the 
anticipated effect of the recent jump in mortgage rates.  Other incoming data suggest that 
activity in the housing sector  has continued to trend up.  Both new and existing home 
sales have continued to move higher, on net,  in recent months.  And while single-family 
starts declined in April, permits—which provide a better signal of underlying activity—
rose at about the same average pace that we ha ve seen over the past year.  The low cost of 
housing, sustained job gains, and growing optimism about the trajectory of house prices 
appear to be providing impor tant support for the housing recovery.  Nevertheless, we 
think that housing demand is still being held back by limite d access to mortgage credit 
for many individuals, along with some warine ss about the durability of the broader 
economic recovery.  In addition, it is possible that new construction is being restrained by 
tight supplies of developed land and other inputs as builders ramp up activity from the 
abnormally low levels of recent years. 
Business Investment 
Although the latest data led us to revise  up our estimate of real spending on E&S 
in the first quarter, this category of demand appears on track to post only a small increase 
in the current quarter.  New orders for cap ital goods excluding aircraft, which had 
bounced back late last year from an earlier so ft patch, have flattened out more recently at 
a level that is only slightly above the leve l of shipments.  In addition, other forward-
looking indicators of business investment, such as readings on business sentiment and 
capital spending plans, have been lackluster of late.  All told, real E&S purchases are 
expected to rise at a modest  annual rate of 3 percent in the first half of this year; 
thereafter, as business output accelerates, we expect equipment invest ment growth to pick 
                                                                                                                                                 
year, in part because firms apparently made special one-time payments of dividends and bonuses in 
advance of the January tax increases .  While a large portion of this fourth-quarter income surge was 
apparent in the data that we had in hand for the April Tealbook, the BEA’s subsequent incorporation of 
data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages caused them to revise up their estimate of fourth-quarter wages and salaries by $100 billion.  (The BEA again attributed a large portion of the wage and salary jump to bonus payments and other forms of irregular pay, although at this point they have little hard evidence on the precise nature of the increase.)  As in our April forecast, we believe that consumers 
will smooth through this income volatility and so do not expect it to have much of an effect on near-term real PCE growth.

  up in the second half to 6½ percent.6  For the year as a whole, these projected growth 
rates are a little weaker th an in the April Tealbook. 
Investment in nonresidential structures fell in the first quarter, led by a sharp tax-
related drop-off in expenditures on power-gener ation structures.  Mo re broadly, the level 
of nonresidential building investment has rema ined relatively low as high vacancy rates, 
tight financing conditions for new construction, and low commercial property prices 
continue to restrain demand for new buildings.  By contrast, the level of investment in 
drilling and mining structures has stayed el evated, supported by high oil prices and the 
continued deployment of new drilling technologie s.  In total, nonresidential structures 
investment is expected to rise modestly in  the second and third quarters at an average 
pace that is similar to what we wrote down in the April Tealbook. 
Estimates from the staff’s flow-of-goods system point to a moderate pace of 
stockbuilding in the current qua rter, while gauges of inventory sentiment from the ISM 
survey and book-value inventory-to-sales ratios do not i ndicate any emerging inventory 
imbalances.  Consequently, we expect nonf arm inventory investment to be roughly 
neutral for GDP growth in the first half of this year—similar to our April forecast—
before adding a small amount to GDP growth in the second half as businesses build 
stocks in response to accelerating sales.  In line with our April Tealbook estimate, farm 
inventory investment is sc ored by the BEA as having boosted GDP growth by nearly 
1 percentage point in the firs t quarter as farm output returned to more normal levels 
following last summer’s drought; we expect this  contribution to fall back to zero in the 
second and third quarters. 
Government 
Total real federal purchases contracted at an annual rate of 9 percent in the first 
quarter—a faster decline than the 5 percent rate we had estimated in the April Tealbook—and are expected to decline at a si milar rate in both the second and third 
quarters.  The first-quarter drop in purcha ses reflected weaker-than-expected defense 
spending, which we have interpreted as partly reflecting an earlier-th an-anticipated onset 
of the effects of the sequestra tion.  We expect that the effect s of the sequestration on real 
federal purchases will intensify over the second and third quarters.  That said, 
                                                 
6 The near-term trajectory of E&S spending is affected by delivery delays for the Boeing 787 
Dreamliner, which shift some final sales of aircraft from  the first quarter to the second and third quarters.  
These shifts should have no measurable effect on overall GDP, as they are offset by corresponding swings 
in Boeing’s inventories.

  considerable uncertainty surr ounds the timing of these effects:  Agencies have announced 
(and in some cased initiated) temporary furl oughs, but we have little information about 
what will happen to their other outlays. 
Real purchases by state and local governments moved lower in the first quarter of 
this year, led by a steep drop in  construction spending; data fr om April suggest that real 
construction outlays will decline further in the current quarter.  However, consistent with 
the improving outlook for this sector’s financ es, employment in this sector moved up 
slightly over the first five months of the ye ar.  Combining these cross-currents, we have 
overall real state and local government purchases inching down in the second and third 
quarters after declining at a 2 percen t annual rate in the first quarter. 
Foreign Trade  
After declining in each of the preceding two quarters, real exports of goods and 
services are expected to rise at an averag e pace of 5¼ percent in the second and third 
quarters of this year as Boeing resumes e xports of its 787 Dreamliner and as foreign 
growth steps up.  Real imports are projected to rise 3½ percent on average in the second 
and third quarters, reflecting modest increase s in U.S. demand as well as a continued 
decline in real oil imports that is a bi t more pronounced than in the April Tealbook.  
Altogether, the external sector is expected to add ¼ percentage point to  the growth of real 
GDP in the second quarter and to be about neutral in the third quarter. 
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing output declined 0.4 pe rcent in April after moving down 
0.3 percent in March, a much weaker profile of  activity than we had anticipated.  Despite 
these recent declines, we expect manufactur ing production to turn up in coming months; 
indeed, data on production-worker hours and available weekly physical-product data 
suggest that factory output e dged higher in May.  Looking fu rther ahead, while surveys of 
manufacturing activity remain subdued, sust ained consumer and business demand for 
motor vehicles should provide continued suppor t for automobile production and increases 
in homebuilding should lift the production of co nstruction supplies and related materials.  
We now expect factory output to decline ½ percent in the current quarter but then to 
increase 2¾ percent next quarter; the average annualized gain in the second and third 
quarters of this year is more than 2 per centage points lower than our April Tealbook 
forecast.

  THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Notwithstanding its slightly weaker performance over the first half of this year, 
real GDP growth is projected to be a little stronger over the medium  term than in the 
April Tealbook, reflecting some changes to our conditioning assumptions that are slightly 
positive on balance.  Specifically, we raised our forecasts for equity and house prices, 
which pushes up expected consumer spending growth over the medium term.  We also 
boosted our outlook for domestic oil production to reflect the ne west projections from the 
Department of Energy, which reduces projecte d oil imports.  These positive factors are 
mostly offset, however, by higher long-term in terest rates and a st ronger assumed path 
for the exchange value of the dollar.  (Our changes to poten tial output, discussed below, 
had relatively modest effects on projected spending.) 
In total, real GDP is expected to e xpand 2½ percent this year, up from 2012’s 
1¾ percent pace; thereafter, our forecast ca lls for real GDP growth to step up to 
3½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  As in previous forecasts, the projected acceleration in 
economic activity reflects our view that fisc al policy will be less of  a drag on aggregate 
demand growth after this year  and that some of the fact ors that have weighed on the 
recovery over the past several years will continue to subside; in particular, we expect that European financial and economic conditions w ill gradually improve and that the housing 
market will heal further.  As households and firms become more confident that the main 
threats to the recovery have diminish ed—and against a back drop of still highly 
accommodative monetary policy—asset risk premiums should decline and household and 
business confidence should improve, resulting in a pickup in household spending, 
business investment, and hiring. 
The emergence of this sort of dynamic is mo st clearly apparent in our forecast for 
personal consumption.  Despite the higher payr oll and income taxes that took effect in 
January, real PCE is projected  to rise 3 percent this year before accelerating to 
3¾ percent in 2014 and to just under 4 percent in 2015—a path that is a touch higher than 
in our April forecast.  The expected upturn  in PCE growth is supported by gains in 
disposable personal income and consumer conf idence that in turn reflect improvements in 
the labor market that result from higher cons umer spending—a self -reinforcing cycle of 
rising spending, hiring, and confidence.  In ad dition, the anticipated further increases in 
house and equity prices lead to gains in  household wealth that further support 
consumption growth.

  We anticipate that solid gains in resi dential construction will also support the 
recovery.  Demand for housing is expected to be nefit from the same sorts of factors that 
contribute to a pickup in consumer spe nding, including rising income, wealth, and 
confidence, though the effects of these f actors will likely be counteracted by the 
significant increase in mortgage interest rates that we expect to occur in coming years.  
As a result, the projected traj ectory of residential investment over the medium term is 
relatively steady at a solid grow th rate of just above 15 perc ent per year, about the same 
as in the April Tealbook. 
Business fixed investment is expected to  accelerate only a little over the medium 
term, as an increase in long-term corporate borrowing rates partly offsets the effects of 
rising business output growth.  As a result, our forecast calls for E&S growth to step up 
from 4¾ percent in 2013 to just under 6½ percent in both 2014 and 2015—an average 
rate of growth that is very close to our April Tealbook projection.  In addition, we expect 
only modest gains in nonresidential struct ures investment over the medium term.   
After growing only 2 percent last year, real exports of goods and services are 
expected to rise at a still-subdued 3 percent pace this year; this project ion is down from 
4¼ percent in the April Tealbook because of weaker-than-exp ected first-quarter export 
data, the stronger dolla r in this projection, and somewhat  weaker foreign growth.  We 
then look for exports to expand 5 percent in 2014 and 6½ percent in 2015, similar to our April projection.  We also have a smaller rise in real imports in 2013—only 2¾ percent—
as the effects of the stronger dollar are outwe ighed by lower oil imports (which in turn 
reflect our even brighter outl ook for domestic oil production).  Over the remainder of the 
forecast period, import growth picks up to av erage about 5 percent.  Overall, the 
contribution of net trade to real GDP growth is  expected to be slightly negative over the 
medium term, a touch weaker than in the April Tealbook. 
As discussed earlier, declines in real government purchases act as a significant 
drag on economic growth this year.  On the fede ral side, this drag is expected to diminish 
after this year as the pace of fiscal consolidation slows and as reductions in spending on 
overseas military operations moderate.  Sim ilarly, state and local government purchases 
are projected to bottom out next year a nd then begin to slowly increase as budget 
conditions continue to improve.  In all, our outlook for total government purchases is 
little changed from April.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION  
Recent Developments and Near-Term  Outlook for the Labor Market 
Taken together, the two monthly employment reports that we have received since 
the April Tealbook were a touch stronger than  we had expected and imply that labor 
market conditions have continued to improve .  In the establishment survey, average 
monthly nonfarm employment growth was re vised up 40,000 in the first quarter, to 
210,000 jobs per month.  More recently, payro ll employment growth in April and May 
averaged around 160,000 jobs per month, about 10,000 above our April Tealbook 
projection.  In the household survey, th e unemployment rate rounded back up to 
7.6 percent in May, but the April–May aver age was nonetheless 0.1 percentage point 
lower than our previous forecast. 
Forward-looking indicators of labor ma rket activity have been mixed but 
generally point to some improvement in the labor market outlook since the April 
Tealbook.  Households’ expectations for future  labor market conditions have brightened 
appreciably from their March readings, and, while initial claims ar e little changed on net 
since late April, they remain near their pos t-recession lows.  Firms’ hiring plans edged up 
recently and quits measured in the JOLTS continued to trend upward on balance.  
However, measures of job openings from the JOLTS and the Conference Board’s help-
wanted index have slipped a bit of late, and now appear roughly flat , on net, since early 
2012.  Finally, according to a preliminary vers ion of a factor model maintained by the 
staff that includes a range of labor market indicators, conditions in the labor market 
continued to improve in May.  In total, we  now expect average nonf arm payroll gains of 
160,000 per month in the second and third quar ters, about the same as in our April 
forecast.7  We project an average unemployment ra te of 7.5 percent in the current quarter 
and 7.4 percent next quarter; both figures are 0.1 percentage point lowe r than in the April 
Tealbook. 
Potential GDP and the Natu ral Rate of Unemployment  
We have revised our supply-side assump tions this round and now judge that the 
natural rate of unemployment is on a more pronounced downward trajectory than we had 
previously thought.  In particular, we now be lieve that the natural rate declined about 
                                                 
7 As in the April Tealbook, we expect the federal sequestration to subtract 30,000 jobs per month 
from private payroll growth in the second and third qu arters.  We still expect that the effect on federal 
payroll employment will be small in the current quarter as government agencies use furloughs, rather than 
layoffs, to reduce spending.

long-run level (which is unrevised at 5¼ pe rcent) by the end of 2015—two years earlier 
than in the April projection.  In our assessment, the revision to the natural rate can be 
attributed both to a greater improvement in  labor market functioning and to a slightly 
steeper rate of decline in trend labor force participation (on the grounds that we will see a 
larger amount of permanent withdrawal from the workforce in coming years).8 
These revisions also result in a small net upward revision to the level of potential 
GDP at the end of 2015, since the reduction in tr end participation only partly offsets the 
lower natural rate.  At 2 percen t per year, the average rate of  growth of potential output 
over the medium term is not materially different from our April forecast; because our estimate of the natural rate is unrevised in  the long run, the revision to the level of 
potential output after 2015 is even smaller. 
The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market 
Beyond the near term, we look for the labor market to gradually improve in line 
with the overall pace of economic recovery.  We expect total payr oll gains to step up 
from an average pace of 160,000 per month in th e second and third quarters to an average 
monthly pace of 210,000 in 2014 and 265,000 in 2015.  The unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point lower at th e start of the forecast period as a result of incoming data; 
going forward, the improvement in labor ma rket functioning and withdrawal of less-
employable workers that drive the steeper de cline in the natural rate that we have 
assumed in this projection also imply a correspondingly steep er decline in the actual  
unemployment rate.  In particular, by allowing employers to fill positions more easily, improved labor market functioning results in workers moving into employment more 
quickly, thereby bringing produc tivity and the workweek mo re quickly into line with 
desired levels.  Hence, by the end of th e projection period, th e unemployment rate 
reaches 5¾ percent, nearly ½ percentage point lower than in our April forecast.  With this projected path, the unemployment rate crosse s the FOMC’s 6½ percen t threshold in the 
first quarter of 2015, two quarters ea rlier than in the April Tealbook.

  The top-right figure of the “Labor Mark et Developments a nd Outlook” exhibit 
compares our current unemployment projection with our projection from 
September 2012, when the Committee first tie d its asset purchase decisions to an 
improvement in the outlook for labor mark et conditions.  By the end of 2013, the 
unemployment rate is projected to be 7.3 percent, ¾ percentage point lower than 
August’s 8.1 percent rate  (the last observation that th e Committee had in hand for the 
September FOMC meeting); over the medium term as a whole, our forecast for the 
unemployment rate averages about 1 percentage point lower than the September Tealbook’s projection.  The outlook for total payroll employment growth  past the first 
half of 2013 is little changed, on average,  since September; that said, our current 
projection for the level  of total payroll employment at the end of this year is ¾ percent, or 
1.1 million jobs, higher than our corresponding September forecast, reflecting both the 
faster-than-expected payroll gains registered this past fall and winter and the effects of 
the annual benchmark revision to payrolls that was published in February.

Resource Utilization   
The revisions that we have made to the natural rate and potential GDP imply that 
the unemployment rate gap and the GDP gap were both a little wider at the end of 2012 than we had previously assumed.  In the curr ent quarter, the projected unemployment rate 
is almost 2 percentage points above our estima te of the natural rate  (nearly ¼ percentage 
point more than our April forecast), while th e level of actual output is almost 4 percent 
below potential (implying a GDP gap that is ne arly ½ percentage point wider relative to 
April).  These gaps are projected to dimini sh gradually over the medium term, with the 
unemployment gap projected to be ½ per centage point by the end of 2015 and GDP 
projected to be ¾ percent below potential (hence, these gaps are just a little wider than in 
the April Tealbook).  In the manufacturing sector, capacity utilization is currently almost 3 percentage points below its long-run average but rises to about its long-run average by 
the end of 2014.
10 
                                                 
9 Our supply-side revisions this round have only a small effect on our assessment of the change  in 
the unemployment gap since September 2012 because the estimated shifts in the paths of the natural rate 
and the trend rate of labor force participation began in 2011.  In particular, we currently estimate that the 
unemployment gap narrowed 0.35 percentage point between 2012:Q2 and 2013:Q2; without this round’s revisions to the natural rate, the gap would have narrowed 0.48 percentage point. 
10 The degree of slack in the manufacturing sector appears to be smaller than that for the broader 
economy, in part because of unprece dented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010 that 
occurred as manufacturers shuttered plants that had be en chronically underutilized.  Note that we estimate 
capacity in the industrial s ector based largely on survey data that seek to capture the highest level of output

  The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
We expect overall consumer prices as m easured by the PCE price index to rise at 
an annual rate of only 0.4 pe rcent in the first half of this year, held down by large 
declines in energy prices and surprisingly lo w core inflation.  This forecast is little 
changed from April:  Although consumer ener gy prices now appear likely to decline 
somewhat less rapidly than we previously proj ected, core prices offset this development 
by surprising us to the downside once again. 
In particular, core PCE prices came in mu ch lower than expected in April, with 
about half of the miss accounted for by a downw ard surprise to medical services prices.11  
As a result, we now expect core consumer prices  to rise at an annual rate of 0.8 percent in 
the second quarter, down 0.6 percentage point relative to our April Tealbook forecast.  
We believe that April’s decline in medical se rvices prices was mostly attributable to a 
one-time reduction in Medicare pri ces associated with the sequ estration that has few, if 
any, implications for future inflation.  That said, we did take some signal from our overall 
miss on core PCE inflation (as well as from  softer-than-expected readings on core 
imported goods prices) and have therefore marked down our third-quart er core inflation 
forecast by 0.4 percentage point, to 1.3 percen t.  For 2013 as a whole, these revisions 
leave the projected change in core PCE prices at 1.2 percen t, 0.3 percentage point below 
our April forecast. 
As in the past several forecasts, we proj ect sizable reductions in consumer energy 
prices through the first half of this year, largely mirroring the downward tilt in spot and 
futures prices for imported crude oil.  Howeve r, crude oil prices are higher and gasoline 
price margins appear to have recovered a littl e faster than we had expected in April, 
leading us to trim our projected first-ha lf decline in consumer energy prices by 
5 percentage points, to an annual rate of 9 pe rcent.  Given our projected oil price path, we 
expect PCE energy prices to edge lower over the remainder of the medium term. 
                                                                                                                                                 
that plants can sustainably maintain given sufficient availability of variable inputs such as labor and 
materials. 
11 For the 12 months ending in April, the wedge between core CPI inflation and core PCE inflation 
stood at 0.7 percentage point.  Although this wedge is volatile year to year, its current level is much wider than the 0.1 percentage point average seen over the past 10 years.  Roughly 0.2 percentage point of this differential can be ascribed to a smaller-than-usual cont ribution of PCE medical services prices to core PCE 
inflation.  Another 0.3 percentage point of the differen tial reflects an atypically low rate of change in core 
nonmarket services prices (excluding medical), which are not included in the CPI.  Over the medium term, 
we expect the CPI–PCE wedge to narrow as both PCE components return to somewhat more typical rates 
of increase.

  Consumer food prices are on track to rise  1¼ percent on average in the first half 
of this year, in line with our April forecast.  Earlier c oncerns about weather-related 
planting delays for corn and soybeans have mo stly abated, and futures prices point to a 
decline in crop prices of about 10 percent by th e time of the autumn harvest.  All told, 
consumer food price inflation is  anticipated to run a little below core inflation over the 
medium term, at a pace that is unc hanged from our April projection. 
Core import prices are another factor lik ely holding down dome stic inflation at 
present.  After rising at an annual rate of ¼ percent in the first qua rter of 2013, prices of 
imported core goods are expected to decline 1 percent in the current quarter in response 
to earlier declines in commodity prices and a stronger dollar.  In the second half of 2013, 
we expect core import prices to increase ¼ perc ent at an annual rate ; for the remainder of 
the forecast period, core import price inflation is expected to run about 1½ percent per 
year—little changed from our previous projec tion and in line with the relatively flat 
projected trajectory for commod ity prices and our assumed pace of dollar depreciation. 
Readings on long-term inflation expecta tions remain generally stable.  Median 
5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from the final May Michigan survey were 
unchanged from April and within  the relatively narrow range seen in recent years.  
Median expected PCE price inflation over the next 10 ye ars from the second-quarter 
Survey of Professional Forecasters stood at 2 percent, unchanged from the first-quarter 
survey.  Finally, measures of inflation co mpensation derived from TIPS yields have 
moved down a little more than ¼ percentage point since the time of the April Tealbook. 
Given our projection of continued stabili ty in long-run inflation expectations, 
relatively modest movements in commodity and import prices beyond this year, and a 
gradually diminishing margin of slack—as well as our judgment that much of the recent 
softness in core inflation reflects transitory factors—we expect core PCE inflation to rise from 1.2 percent this year to 1.6 percent in 2014 and to edge up furt her to 1.8 percent in 
2015.  Total PCE inflation is expected to run a bit below the core, rising about 1½ percent 
per year in 2014 and in 2015.  Thus, throughout the medium term, the PCE inflation projection remains below both the Committee’s long-run objec tive of 2 percent and the 
threshold level of 2½ percent. 
The swing in wage and salary disbursements implied by the BEA’s incorporation 
of the data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages resulted in a large 
upward revision to nonfarm compensation per hour  (CPH) in the fourth quarter of last

  year, with a corresponding downw ard revision to first-quarter CPH growth.  We continue 
to expect hourly compensation growth to rise  slowly over the medium term as the labor 
market gradually tightens.12 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the 
FRB/US model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side  conditions, fiscal policy, 
and other factors.  The c ontour of the long-term outl ook depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s st rategy statement.  As noted earlier, 
the Committee’s threshold for the unemployment rate is crossed in the 
baseline projection in the first quarter of 2015.  Thereafter, the federal funds 
rate is set according to the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule.     
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates in 2016 and 2017, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The process of re turning the SOMA portfolio to a normal 
size is expected to be completed by 2019. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd bonds continue to decrease gradually 
to normal levels, and financial instituti ons further ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit begins to widen after 2016, primarily reflecting 
fast-rising transfer payments  for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal 
debt stabilizes temporarily at almo st 75 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018 but 
then begins to edge up later in the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar declines 2 percent per year from 
2016 to 2018 and moves down more slowly th ereafter.  The price of crude oil 
decreases slightly in 2016 and then hold s steady in real terms.  Foreign real 
                                                 
12 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the employment cost index (ECI) releases 
for the first quarter of 2013 and last two quarters of 2012 contained errors.  While the BLS did not provide 
any details about the extent of th ese errors, we are treating all recen t ECI data as suspect until the BLS 
publishes corrected ECI estim ates at the end of July.

  GDP growth slows from 3½ percent in 2015 to a 3 percent annua l rate late in 
the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is  5¼ percent throughout the longer-term 
outlook.  Potential GDP rises just over  2 percent per year in 2016 and 2017 
and around 2¼ percent thereafter.  (S ee the box “Information Technology and 
Labor Productivity” for a discussion of th e effects of high-tech investment on 
the economy’s long-run pr oductive potential.) 
The economy is projected to enter 2016 w ith output a little below its potential 
level, unemployment correspondi ngly above its natural rate, and inflation below the long-
run objective of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term forecast, further improvements 
in household and business confidence, diminishing uncertainty, and supportive financial 
conditions enable real GDP to rise 2¾ percent in 2016.  Thereafter, the pace of gains in 
real GDP moves down closer to the rate of  growth in potential output, in large part 
reflecting the progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation.  The unemployment 
rate falls through 2016 to 5¼ percent and is roughly unchanged thereafter.  Long-run 
inflation expectations are assumed to remain well anchored, and, with the margin of slack 
in labor and product markets diminishing, cons umer price inflation moves up to 2 percent 
by 2017.  The nominal federal funds rate is 3¾ percent at the end of this decade and 
eventually stabilizes at around 4 pe rcent early in the next decade.

 Information Technology and Labor Productivity 
Labor productivity —output per hour worked —is a crucial determinant of potential output , 
long-run real interest rates, and, ultimately, living standards .  As shown by the bars in the 
figure below, output per hour rose 1½ percent per year, on average, from 2004 to 2012 after 
having risen 3 percent per year from 1995 to 2004.  Below we provide an estimate of the 
share of the recent labor productivity growth that can be attributed to information 
technology ( IT)—including computers, communication equipment, and software —and we 
consider the prospects for IT to buttress labor productivity growth in the future. 
A growth-accounting framework is commonly employed to decompose gains in labor 
productivity into contributions from capital deepening (namely, net investment in 
structures, equipment, and software) ; improvements in labor quality (from education, 
training, and experience); and rising multifactor productivity (MFP) —the ability of firms to 
produce more output from a given combination of inputs (from, for example, technological 
change or improved business practices).   With this framework, we can drill down even 
further and calculate the separate contributions of IT capital deepening —that is, the greater 
use of IT capital throughout the economy—and non -IT capital deepening.  We can also 
distinguish MFP increases within IT -producing industries from those elsewhere in the 
economy .  
Staff research using this framework has found that the combined contribution from IT 
capital deepening (the blue portion of the bars in the figure below ) and MFP growth for IT-
producing industries (the  green portion of the bars ) accounted for about one-half of the 
robust labor productivity gains in the 1995 –2004 period and for about one-half of the 
marked deceleration in productivity since 2004.1

 Looking ahead, observers hold a wide range of opinions on the future prospects for 
IT-fueled labor productivity gains.2  Some believe that the 1995 –2004 period was exceptional 
and the more recent period is a better guide to the future —that dwindling IT innovation has 
weakened MFP growth and IT capital deepening and will continue to do so in the future .  
Others believe that recent and prospective improvements in computing and 
communications may bring more substantial productivity gains. 
To the optimists, the recent surge in the adoption of new computing and communications 
technologies evokes the IT-driven boom of 1995 to 2004.   Among these emerging trends are 
the widespread use of powerful smartphones and tablets, which free workers from 
attachment to desktop and even laptop computers, and the rapidly increasing reliance on 
“cloud computing”—the purchase of highly efficient computer services delivered through 
the Internet —by businesses seeking to avoid costly IT investments.  Exploiting these new 
types of equipment and services
 may require time-consuming adjustments to business 
practices, management structure, and training.  Thus the full effect on labor productivity 
may only become apparent after these “intangible” investments have been made , as 
appears to have been the case for personal computers. 
We can use our growth-accounting framework to project t he trend rate of labor productivity 
growth that might result when firms have completed the se adjustments to their production 
processes.  The two right-most bars in the figure on the previous page explore two such 
future scenarios for long-run labor productivity growth.  In the baseline scenario (which is 
broadly consistent with the staff’s long -run GDP growth rate of 2¼ percent) , we assume that 
MFP in the IT sector grows at roughly its average rate for the 1974 –2012 period, raising 
productivity directly and inducing capital deepening through lower investment prices.   This 
reasonably balanced scenario suggest s that labor productivity growth will move modestly 
higher in the future, to 1¾ percent.  In the optimistic scenario, we assume that new 
technologies drive up MFP in the IT sector to about two-thirds of the rapid pace seen in the 
1995 –2004 period, and that the complementa
ry investments mentioned above also raise 
MFP in the non-IT producing industries (part of the orange portion of the bars).  In this 
scenario, labor productivity growth is noticeably higher, rising to 2½ percent per year. 
Neither scenario gives rise to stellar labor productivity growth, but the baseline is a little 
better than the pace in recent years, and the optimistic scenario results in labor productivity 
growth slightly above the 1947 –2012 average (the dashed line).  In each scenario, labor 
productivity growth is damped by the diminished contribution from labor quality (part of the 
orange portion of the bars) anticipated because of slower increases in educational 
attainment.  Nevertheless, both of these speculative scenarios include a substantial 
contribution to labor productivity growth from the production and use of IT.

Confronts the Six Headwinds,”  NBER Working Paper Series 18315 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of 
Economic Research, August) for a pessimistic view, while Martin Baily, James Manyika, and Shalabh Gupta 
(2013), “U.S. Productivity Growth:  An Optimistic Perspective,” International Productivity Monitor , vol. 25 
(Spring), pp. 3 –12, provide a more upbeat assessment.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Prospects for foreign economic growth remain lackluster, especially for 2013.  
Foreign real GDP  rose only 2 percent in the first quarter  of this year , down from 
2.3 percent in the last quarter of 2012.  Econo mic growth in the emerging market 
economies (EMEs) slowed sharply following an outsized fourth-quarter performance, led 
by a step -down in Chinese growth.  In contrast, GDP picked up in t he adv anced foreign 
economies (AFEs) , albeit at  a pace of only 1.5 per cent, follow ing a contraction  in the 
fourth quarter.  T he pace of decline  in the euro  area moderated , and Japanese growth 
surged amid Abenomics-inspired improvements in confidence and declines in the yen .  
However, on net , total foreign growth in the first quart er came in ¼ percentage point 
below our April Tealbook  estimate , as faster -than-expected growth in the AFEs was more 
than offset by disappointing activity  in the EMEs . 
This weaker momentum together with more recent soft  data led us to mark down 
forei gn growth nearly ½  percentage point in the second quarter and ¼ percentage point in  
the third quarter.  We now project foreign GDP to rise  2¼ percent in the  current quarter  
before accelerating to nearly a 3¼ percent pace  by year-end and to 3½  percent by 2015, 
sustained by the stronger U.S. expansion, a return to trend growth in China, and supportive policies by most foreign central banks . 
In this outlook, the recession in the euro area come s to an end later this year .  
Indeed, as financial strains in the region have declined substantially since mid-2012, output appears to be contracting less rapidly , and we project a modest  recovery will take 
hold next year amid  diminishing fiscal consolidation, accommodative monetary policy, 
and a stronger global recovery .  However, there remains a risk that the euro- area 
recession may be more severe and more prolonged than we are anticipating, a scenario 
we explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  Prospects outside Europe also appear 
quite uncertain.  In particular, we have been surprised by the slowdown this year in China and in the  EMEs  more generally, and are alert to  the possibility that this  soft patch might 
last longer than we are expecting. 
Foreign inflation is on track to step down from 2.3 percent in the first quarter to 
less than 2 percent in the second quarter, owing to persistent resource slack  and lower 
commodity price pressures .  Going forward , we expect  foreign inflation to average

  2¼ percent in the second half of 2013 and nearly 2¾ percent over the rest of the forecast 
period.  Our outlook for foreign inflation is little changed from the April Tealbook, a s the 
effect of a modest  markup of oil prices is roughly offset by the softer near -term outlook 
for economic activity.  Amid subdued inflation and concerns about growth, several 
foreign central banks, notably the European Central Bank (ECB), have loosened monetary policy since the time of the April Tealbook.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Following a mild contraction in the final quarter of 2012, AFE output ro se 
1.5 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, double the pace we had estimated in the April Tealbook.  Economic activity was surprisingly strong in Canada and Japan, thanks 
to vigorous exports.  In the United Kingdom, inventory rebuilding helped G DP advance 
despite stagnating final demand.  Euro -area output shrank for the sixth consecutive 
quarter but the pace of contraction slowed , as private consumption growth turned 
positive.  Growth  in the AFE s is expected to average 1½  percent  through the rest  of 2013, 
slightly higher than previously forecast , reflecting better -than-expected data in Canada 
and Japan .  Thereafter, we  expect diminishing fiscal drag, accommodative monetary 
policies , and improving private balance sheets to  lift AFE growth to 2  perc ent in 2014 
and 2¼ percent in 2015, unchanged from the April Tealbook.  
First-quarter AFE inflation came in about as expected at ¾ percent  and should 
remain near that pace in the current quarter.  We project inflation to rise to 1¼  percent in 
the second half of 2013, 1¾ percent in 2014, and nearly 2 percent in 2015, as activity 
firms  and Japan overcomes deflation .  Consistent with their medium- term inflation goals, 
we continue to ex pect the Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to 
deliver additio nal stimulus.  
Euro Area  
Euro -area GDP declined 0.8 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, a slower 
pace of contraction than the 1½ percent decrease  registered in the second half of 2012, as 
private consumption stabilized .  On balance, data for th e second quarter point to a further 
but smaller contraction of ¼ percent, broadly consistent with our forecast in the April Tealbook.  Although retail sales declined in April, industrial production increased further , 
and the composite PMI rose through May.

  Going forward, we see euro- area GDP bottoming out  in the second half of this 
year before expanding an anemic 1¼  percent  in 2014 and 2 percent in 2015.  While the 
timing of the economy’s exit from recession is necessarily uncertain, a number of factors 
should support the recovery:  Monetary policy will remain quite accommodative, financial stresses have eased considerably since mid -2012, external demand from the 
United States and elsewhere is projected to firm, and the pace of fiscal consolidation is slated  to substantially diminish.  In deed , concern about the economic effects of 
budget-cutting led the European Commission to extend the deadlines for some euro- area 
countries, including France and Spain, to reduce fiscal deficits below 3 percent of GDP.  This extension supports our forecast of a noticeable reduction in fiscal drag in 2013.  (See the box “Recent Changes in European Fiscal Policy.”)   
Data through May suggest euro- area inflation has remained below 1  percent  in the 
second quarter.  With the output gap continuing to widen, we expect inflation to remain subdued for the rest of the year before gradually rising to 1¾  percent by the end of 2015.  
Our forecast for inflation is little changed from that in the April Tealbook.  
As anticipated, the ECB cut its benchmark policy rate 25 basis points to 
0.5 percent in May and left it unchanged in June.  We expect the ECB to keep its main policy rate steady until late 2015 and possibly introduce measures to reduce funding costs for small - and medium -sized firms . 
Japan  
Real GDP rose a better -than-expected 4.1 percent  in the first quarter, driven by a 
jump in exports and strong private consumption.  T he economic recovery appears to have 
continued at a rapid pace in the current quarter, supported by highly accommodat ive 
fiscal and monetary polic y.  In April, industrial production and exports rose robustly and, 
in May, the manufacturing PMI moved further into expansionary territory and consumer 
confidence reached a new multiyear high .  Given these encouraging indicator s, we 
revised up our second- quarter growth estimate ½  percent age point to 3¼ percent.  
Although Japan’s stock price index has plunged and the yen has appreciated in recent 
weeks, both remain at more favorable  levels than in the first quarter. 
Going forward , we expect GDP growth to be around 3 percent through early 2014 
before dropping to an average pace of only ½ percent  over the remainder of the forecast 
period, reflecting fiscal retrenchment —including two planned consumption tax hikes—

 Recent Changes  in European  Fiscal Policy 
In recent months, as euro‐area output  has fallen further and  unemployment  has continued  
to rise, the emphasis  of European  authorities  on aggressive  near‐term fiscal austerity  has 
eased somewhat.   As a consequence,  we have moderated  our estimate of  fiscal drag on 
euro‐area growth over  the forecast period.  Our analysis  supports  the view that, as long as 
the commitment  to fiscal adjustment remains  credible, a more  gradual pace of deficit 
reduction should  be beneficial  for both near‐term growth and the longer‐term fiscal health 
of the euro area. 
Throughout  most of the euro‐area crisis, the  European  Commission (EC)  and core European  
governments  have trumpeted  the need for fiscal consolidation.   Authorities  have insisted 
that countries  conform  to the excessive  deficit procedure,  under which budget deficits  must 
be brought below 3 percent  of GDP on a rigid timeline.  When  countries  missed  their initial 
deadlines—in  part because the  targets were overly ambitious  and based on optimistic  
economic  forecasts—European  authorities  altered adjustment  paths only slightly and 
required additional  fiscal consolidation  measures;  this consolidation  weighed  further on 
growth.  Consequently,  even though euro‐area countries  have reduced their structural  
budget deficits, particularly  in the periphery,  actual deficits have come down by less because 
of the negative effect  of lower growth  on tax revenues  (see upper‐left  figure on the next 
page).1    
However, amid  a deepening  recession and  increasing  evidence  that contractionary  fiscal 
policy was weighing  on growth in core as well as peripheral  countries,  European  authorities  
began late last  year to signal  some flexibility.   In particular,  the EC indicated  that it would 
tolerate some  fiscal slippage if GDP growth turned out weaker than  forecast,  provided  that 
countries  made the required  reduction in  structural  deficits.  In addition,  France and the 
Netherlands  announced  they would not introduce further fiscal  consolidation,  despite 
acknowledging  that they would miss headline  deficit targets this year.  Most  recently,  the EC 
recommended  that the European  Council grant some  leeway to France, the  Netherlands, 
Portugal,  Poland, Slovenia,  and Spain in exchange  for accelerated  structural  reforms.2  For 
example,  the deadline for bringing  deficits down to 3 percent  of GDP was extended  by two 
years for France  and Spain (to 2015 and 2016, respectively)  and by one year for the 
Netherlands  (to 2014).   
Taking these developments  into account,  since late last  year, we  have reduced our 
projection  of the drag on real GDP growth from fiscal consolidation  about ¼ percentage 
point of GDP per year in  the 2013–15  period (see upper‐right figure  on the next page).  
Moreover,  our analysis suggests  that there should  be scope to further back ‐load 
consolidation  efforts.  To be sure, up‐front cuts were regarded  by some as essential  to 
establishing  fiscal credibility  among investors  early on in the euro‐area  crisis.  However,  
several years  of deep budget cuts, along with resultant shortfalls  in growth, likely have 
diminished  the benefits of such signaling.   
                                                 
1 The structural  deficit is the deficit that would prevail at full employment  and absent one‐off changes 
to taxes and spending  and thus abstracts  from cyclical movements  in the economy.  
2 These  recommendations  will likely be approved  by the European  Council later in June.

Simulations  using the Board staff’s open‐economy  model, SIGMA,  suggest that for the same  
cumulative amount  of fiscal restraint,  front‐loaded consolidation  depresses the path  of 
output by more than gradual, back‐loaded consolidation  (see lower ‐left figure on this page).  
This is because,  with sticky prices  and wages, private demand cannot adjust fast enough to 
offset the  effects of abrupt budget cuts  in the front‐loaded consolidation,  producing  a very 
sharp contraction  in the short run.   Moreover,  in the present situation,  the effect of the 
front‐loaded consolidation  is aggravated  because the  ECB is constrained  by the zero lower 
bound; conversely,  most of the budget cuts  under back‐loaded consolidation  occur once 
interest rates have risen off their floor, so that the ECB can partially  offset the  fiscal drag 
through monetary  easing.  
Indeed, the  drop in output in the front‐loaded consolidation  is so severe that the debt‐to‐
GDP ratio does  not improve at all in the near term relative to the  more gradual consolidation  
(see lower‐ right figure).   Beyond the near term, the debt‐to‐GDP ratio in the front‐loaded 
consolidation  rises above the back ‐loaded consolidation  because spending  cuts taper off at 
longer horizons  in the front‐loaded consolidation,  whereas  they increase in the gradual 
consolidation.    
 
Consequently,  these findings  support the  notion that too much austerity  too soon can be 
counterproductive,  especially  if the purpose is  to put public  debt on a more sustainable  path.

  and fading impetus from past yen depreciation.  Beyond the current quarter, our outlook 
is unchanged since the April Tealbook, but we are closely  monitoring developments in 
financial market s and the implementation of Abenomics . 
Consumer prices declined  in the first quarter given  persistently negative core 
inflation and surprisingly moderate import price inflation.  In April, however, consumer prices edged up, supporting our forecast for slightly positive inflation in the current 
quarter.  Inflation should creep up further thereafter as the BOJ pursues its aggressive 
asset  purchase program and the sharp depreciation of the yen since late last year passes 
through into domestic prices.  Accordingly, we continue to project that, net of the effect of consumption tax hikes, inflation will rise to 1¼  percent by the end of 2015, still below 
the B OJ’s new 2  percent target but significantly improved from the deflation of previous 
years . 
United Kingdom 
First-quarter GDP rose 1.3 percent, 1 percentage point more than we had 
estimated in the  April Tealbook.  The upside surprise was concentrated in inventory 
accumulation, with final domestic demand and net exports making small negative contributions to GDP growth.  More recent monthly data were mixed, with retail sales sliding in April but the  PMIs firming through May.  As a result, we continue to expect 
GDP growth to remain subdued, averaging about 1½ percent through the end of this year 
before increasing to 2¼ percent  in 2014 and 2½ percent  in 2015.  This gradual 
improvement is predicated on continued accommodative monetary policy, diminished fiscal drag, and the projected recovery in the euro area.  
Core consumer prices in April were weaker than we had anticipated, leading us to 
mark down our second- quarter estimate of overall inflation to 1 percent. Smoothing 
through the volatility introduced by the phasing- in of a large university tuition fee hike , 
we project that inflation will be near 2 percent through 2015, unrevised from the April Tealbook.  With inflation in check and ample resource slack , we maintain our call for 
additional monetary easing —possibly through the provision of forward guidance—
following the arrival of Mark Carney as governor of the BOE on July 1.  
Canada 
Following a 0.9 percent increase in the last quarter of 2012, real GDP gr owth in 
Canada stepped up to 2.5 percent in the first quarter of 2013, 1 percentage point higher

  than we had estimated in the April Tealbook.  The first-quarter figure was boosted by 
surprisingly robust exports.  April trade data suggest some weakening of net exports, but 
domestic indicators show greater strength .  In May, the manufacturing PMI jumped to 
53.2 after lingering near 50 for several months, and stronger labor  market conditions, 
following some recent softness,  led the unemployment r ate to tick do wn to 7.1 percent.  
All told, we see output growth averaging just above 2 percent through year -end before 
picking up to 2½ percent in 2014 and 2015.  Compared with the April Tealbook, this 
forecast is a bit higher through mid -2014 and unchanged thereafter. 
Canadian consumer price inflation weakened in April because of  falling retail 
energy prices and softness in core components.  We expect inflation to moderate to an 
annual rate of 1  percent  in the second quarter, down from 1.6 percent in the first quarter.   
Thereafter, the projected firming of economic activity should gradually push inflation to 
near the 2  percent target by the end of the forecast period.  Given our outlook for mild 
inflation along with  still-high unemployment , we continue to anticipate the  Bank of 
Canada will maintain its accommodative stance and hold  its main policy rate unchanged 
until the second half of 2014. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
With nearly all of the first-quarter GDP data in hand, we estimate that growth in 
the EMEs slowed sharpl y to a meager 2½  percent  from its robust pace of 4.8  percent at 
the end of last year.  The robust growth in the fourth quarter was supported by strong 
demand from China and an apparent revving up of production for export in anticipation 
of a firming of global activity .  With indications that Chin ese a ctivity  had slowed in the 
first quarter and that the advanced economies had recovered at only a tepid pace , we were 
already expecting a step -down in EME growth in the April Tealbook.  But growth turned 
out to b e 1½ percentage points  weaker than we had anticipated .   
The surprising depth and breadth of the first-quarter slowdown suggests weaker 
underlying momentum  in the EMEs .  This view has been  reinforced by recent in dicators  
that point, on balance, to subpar growth in the current quarter.  Although re tail sales held 
up well, readings on industrial production and exports remained weak  and PMIs  
moderated a bit .  Accordingly, we revised down EME growth by nearly 1  percentage 
point in the current quarter to 3¼ percent and by ½ percentage point to just under 4 percent in the third quarter.   
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
June 12, 2013

  We project EME growth to rise to about  4¾ percent over the remainder of the 
forecast period , in the neighborhood of its trend pace, supported by accommodative 
policies and the re covery in the advanced economies.  An anticipated end to the soft 
patch in Chinese activity should also provide support for the rest of emerging Asia and 
for commodity producers.  That said, we recognize  the possibility of less favorable 
outcomes, especially if the projected recovery in the advanced economies is  slower than 
expected  or if weakness in China persists. 
We estimate EME inflation moved down to less than 3 percent in the current 
quarter from 3.5 percent in the first, largely reflecting a moderati on of earlier food price 
pressures in some countries.  Going forward, we see inflation moving back up to  
3¼ percent in 2014 and 2015.  Amid subdued inflation and weak economic growth, 
central banks in several  countries, including Israel, India, Korea, and Thailand, lowered 
policy rates recently.  In contrast, the central bank of Brazil raised its policy rate  again  to 
rein in inflation , notwithstanding continued disappointing economic growth. 
China  
The official four -quarter GDP growth rate for China, which w as available at the 
time of the April Tealbook, suggests that quarterly GDP growth stepped down sharply in the first quarter, to an annual rate of just 6½ percent , compared with 9½ percent  in the 
fourth  quarter of last year .  Recent indicators point to con tinued subdued activity—by 
historical Chinese standards—in the current quarter.  A lthough retail sales grow th 
improved a touch in April and May relative to the first quarter, investment growth was about flat and industrial production decelerated.  Conseque ntly, we now estimate that 
GDP growth will remain at 6½  percent in the current quarter, about ¾ percentage point 
lower than forecast in the previous Tealbook.  However, w ith policies remaining 
accommodative and the advanced economies expected to pick up st eam, we see Chinese 
growth rising to a near-trend pace of about 8 percent by the end of this year and then remaining around that pace through 2015. 
Food price s have been volatile in China so far this year.  Increases in these prices 
caused headline inflati on to pick up to 3½ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter , 
and more recent declines in food prices will likely lead inflation  to subside to about 
2 percent in the current and third quarters.  Overall, we expect inflation will average 
around 2½ percent  this year and 3 percent  in 2014 and 2015.

  Other Emerging Asia  
Elsewhere in emerging Asia, first -quarter GDP growth was disappointing, 
dropping to 1¼ percent , about 2 percent age points below our April Tealbook estimate.  
Notably, growth turned negative in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand.  We had anticipated 
that the moderation of growth in China would spill over into these economies and that  
some payback from outsized growth in the fourth quarter would weigh on the region’s 
performance.  However, the slowdown was more pronounced than we had anticipated, as 
exports, particularly to China, and fixed investment (which in these economies tends to be well -correlated with exports) were surprisingly weak.  The weak ness in the first 
quarter, along with the soft t one of recent data, prompted us to mark down the near- term 
outlook for the region .  We now see GDP growth picking up to only 3 percent  in the 
current quarter.  Thereafter, g rowth is projected to rise  to 4½ percent  by next year , 
supported by accommodative policies, faster  Chinese economic growth, and firming of 
economic acti vity in the advanced economies. 
We estimate that inflation dipped to an annual rate of 1¾  percent  in the current 
quarter, reflecting weak growth and a reversal of earlier  increases in foo d prices.  As the 
economies in the region gather steam, we expect inflation to rise to 3½  percent  in 2014 
and in 2015. 
Latin America  
Economic performance across Latin America was also disappointing .  In Mexico, 
GDP growth was just 1¾ percent in the first q uarter, down from 2¾ percent  in the 
previous quarter and 1½ percent age points below our previous Tealbook estima te.  The 
manufacturing and agricultural sectors were surprisingly weak, and exports contracted.   
This weakness, along with a drop in industrial production in April and downward 
revisions to the projection for U.S. manufacturing output, led us to mark down Mexico’s 
growth by about 1 ¼ percent age points, on average,  in the current and third quarters.  We 
now expect Mexican real GDP to rise only 2¼  percent  in the current quarter befor e 
accelerating to  a pace of  almost  4 percent in 2014 and 2015, broadly mirroring the 
contour of U.S. manufacturing output. 
In South America, GDP growth declined to 1½ percent  in the first quarter from 
4½ percent in the fou rth.  Economic activity cooled across the region, largely driven by a 
decline in demand for commodities; in Chile, for example, growth fell from 8 percent in 
the fourth quarter to 2 percent in the first as copper exports plunged.  In Brazil, by

  contrast, g rowth fell only slightly , to 2¼ percent, in the first quarter from 2½  percent at 
the end of last year.  However this rate was  ½ percentage point lower than we had 
expected, denting prospects for a vigorous recovery after a lackluster performance over 
the past two years .  In the current quarter, growth is expected to increase to 2¾  percent, 
consistent with the recent pickup in manufacturing activity.  Thereafter, growth should recover further to reach 4  percent in  2015, aided by generally supportive macro policies, 
the recovery in the advanced economies, and an improvement in Chinese growth that 
should contribute to increased demand for commodities .  The  outlook for Brazil  is a little 
weaker than we wrote down in April, reflecting momentum from  the subdued 
first-quarter outcome and tighter  monetary policy than previously anticipated.  
Mexico’s inflation is on track to rise to 5½ percent  in the current quarter, partly  
reflecting a hike in administered public transport prices.  Once this effect dissipates next quarter, inflation will likely fall back to about 3½  percent over the remainder of the 
forecast period, about the same as in the previous Tealbook. 
In Brazil, inflation likely moderated further in the current quarter but remained 
elevated amid persistent food price pressures.  Twelve-month inflation cam e in at about 
6½ percent in April and May , the upper end of the central bank’s tolerance range, and 
inflation expectations remained elevated, prompting the central bank to raise the policy 
rate 50 basis points to 8  percent in late May.  Some easing of food price pressures, 
together with further monetary tightening, should bring inflation  to 5½ percent by next 
year.

Financial Developments  
Financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period  as investors digested 
the implications of incoming economic data and Federal Reserve communications .  
Equity prices and longer-term interest rates moved higher, on balance, boosted in part by 
somewhat better-than-expected U.S. economic data and an accompanying improvement in investor sentiment.   Federal Reserve communications over the period were report edly 
read by market participants as suggesting that downward adjustments to the FOMC’s flow-based asset purchase program might occur earlier than anticipated, and may also 
have contributed to the steepening of the expected path of the federal funds rate.  These 
changes in policy expectations, and an associated increase in uncertainty about the outlook for policy, boosted longer -term interest rates and appeared to damp the gains in 
equity prices. 
All told, yields on intermediate - and longer- term Treasury securities rose 
substantially , and stock prices increased modestly.  Market -based measures of uncertainty 
about both short - and long- term interest rates rose sharply but remained lower than their 
averages over the past few years .  TIPS -based measures of inflation compensation moved 
down, perhaps as investors reacted to the somewhat  less accommodative tone of Federal 
Reserve communications .  Risk sp reads on corporate bonds changed little on balance.  
Ten-year sovereign yields in most foreign economies rose substantially , with increases in 
Japan coming despite the Bank of Japan’s accelerated asset purchases .  The dollar 
appreciated , particularly  against emerging market  economy (EME) currencies amid 
weaker readings on EME activit y. 
Financing flows were general ly solid over the intermeeting period as a whole, but, 
in some sectors , the pace of borrowing waned in response to the rise in rates and market 
volatility.  Bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations was robust again in May, but high-yield issuance —which had  been  boosted by refinancing activity —declined late in 
the period.  Issuance of syndicated loans was sizable again in April and May, and issuance of commercial mortgage- backed securities ( CMBS ) and asset -backed securities 
(ABS ) remained  solid.  Consumer credit expanded further in April, as the recent pattern 
of significant increases in auto and student loans and nearly flat balances on credit card 
accounts continued.  Meanwhile, the volume of home mortgage refinancings slowed from 
elevated levels  as mort gage rates backed up .  Growth in bank credit moderated in April

  and May, as the expansion in commercial and industrial (C&I) loans slowed significantly 
and banks’ securities holdings decreased.  M2 expanded at roughly the same moderate 
pace as in the first quarter of the year.  
TREASURY YIELDS , POLICY EXPECTATIONS , AND AGENCY MBS  YIELDS  
Treasury yields and policy rate expectations rose sharply over the intermeeting 
period amid some better- than-expected U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve 
communications that were interpreted by mar ket participants as signaling a possible 
earlier -than-expected reduction  in the asset purchase program .  Markets appeared to focus 
most intently on the April and May employment reports and improved readings on consumer confidence, as well as on  the Chairman’s Joint Economic Committee (JEC) 
testimony.  Anecdotal reports suggest that actual and expected convexity- hedging flows 
may have amplified the rise in Treasury yields , at least for a time .  All told, the 10- year 
nominal Treasury yield climbed 54  basis points, while the 5-year and 30- year yields rose 
43 basis points and 45 basis points, respectively. 
Staff models attribute the bulk of the rise in long- term Treasury yields to an 
increase in term premiums.  Th e rise in term premiums, in turn, likely reflected a 
reassessment of the pace and ultimate  size of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchase 
program, and perhaps also some increas e in investors’ willingness to take on risk in light 
of the more positive U.S. economic outlook.  Greater uncertainty about future Federal Reserve policy —with regard to both the purchase program and the path of the federal 
funds rate—also likely contributed to the rise in term premiums.   Indeed, market -based 
measures of uncertainty about both short- and long- term rates  rose sharply after the 
Chairman’s JEC testimony and remained elevated subsequently, although the measures 
stayed low by his torical standards.

Market participants appeared to revise up their expectations about the path of the 
federal funds rate over  the period.2  Forward rates two to three years ahead derived from 
overnight index swaps shifted up 30 to 50 basis points, likely reflecting both an increase 
                                                 
1 Reflecting investors’ assessment that rates could rise further, the on -the-run 10- year Treasury 
note traded deeply special in the repo market in late May and early June.   The relatively small supply of the 
single issue also contributed to the security’s sc arcity.   Term repo rates for this security and market 
commentary suggested that financing rates were expected to normalize following the settlement of the 
reopening auction of the 10 -year Treasury note on  June 17.  
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 11 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5.33 basis points.

  in the expected path for the federal funds rate and an increase in money market term 
premiums.   The modal path based on interest rate caps also shifted up over the 
intermeeting period, suggesting that market participants expect the federal funds rate to 
lift off sooner than they did at the time of the previous FOMC meeting.   However, some 
of the rise in the estimated modal path of the policy rate likely also  reflected higher term 
premiums.  
In contrast to the readings from financial market quotes, the results from the Open 
Market Desk’s latest Survey of Primary D ealers showed little material change , on 
balance,  in th e dealers’ expectations for the target federal funds rate or in the median 
expectation for Federal Reserve asset purchases.   The difference between the market 
quotes and the dealer survey results may reflect, in part, a divergence between the views of the economists at dealer firms (the respondents to the Desk’s survey) and market 
participants that are actively trading in fixed -income markets.   Indeed, on a special 
question in the survey, the dealer economists attributed the rise in longer- term interest 
rates primarily to changes in perceptions regarding the FOMC’s view of appropriate 
policy and heightened uncertainty about the FOMC’s view of appropriate policy, 
suggesting the dealer economists thought that market views had changed. 
Both TIPS -based and swaps -based measures  of inflation compensation decreased 
over the intermeeting period, but both the near- and longer -term measures remained close 
to the middle of their ranges over the past two years.   The 5- year measure of i nflation 
compensation moved down 26 basis points and the 5- to-10–year-ahead measure declined 
27 basis points, perhaps in part because investors came to anticipate that monetary policy 
was going to be somewhat less accommodative going forward than they had expected.  
The softer -than- expected reading of the CPI for April  likely also contributed to the 
decline in  near -term inflation compensation .   
Yields on a gency  mortgage -backed securities ( MBS ) rose more than those on 
comparable- maturity Treasury securities, likely reflecting investors’ reassessment of the 
outlook for the Fed eral Reserve ’s MBS purchases.  Indeed, the option -adjusted spread for 
production- coupon MBS , which often reacts sensitively to changes in market 
participants’  expectations for ass et purchases, increased more than 25 basis points  over 
the intermeeting period .  Thirty -year conforming mortgage rates rose in line with the rise 
in MBS yields and end ed the period about 60 basis points higher at 3.89 percent .

  TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
The Treasury Department auctioned $203 billion in nominal securities and  
$13 billion in 10- year TIPS  over the intermeeting period.  The auctions were rel atively 
well received , with bid -to-cover ratios in line with recent averages.3 
The Desk conducted outright  purchases of Tre asury securities and agency MBS as 
planned, and the operations did not appear to adverse ly affect the functioning of either 
the Treasury or agency MBS mark ets.4  Most measures of liquidity conditions in these 
markets were generally stable, as  MBS settlement fails stayed low, and Treasury and 
MBS  trading volumes remained near the ir historical averages.   Dollar-roll-implied 
financing rates for  the 30- year Fannie Mae 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent coupon  securities , 
which had been in fairly negative territory last month, drifted up, indicating fewer 
settlement pressures in the TBA market for these secur ities.  Over the intermeeting 
period, t he Desk executed dollar ro lls on 7 percent of its scheduled agency M BS 
purchases for May settlement, in line with  the recent average.  
On May 19, the statutory debt limit was reinstated and set at $16.7 trillion, which 
was the level of federal debt outstanding on that day, and Treasury Secretary Lew declared a “debt issuance suspension period” the next day.  The Treasury has indicated 
that its available accounting measures will allow federal debt to remain below th e debt 
ceiling until after Labor Day.
5 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
Conditions in short- term dollar  funding marke ts gener ally stayed fairly benign  
over the intermeeting period .  The spread between three-month LIBOR and  
comparable- maturity OIS rates increased somewhat, on balance, over the period  but 
                                                 
3 In the refunding statement released on May 1, the Treasury announced plans to issue a floating -
rate note, starting either in the fourth quarter of 2013 or in the first quarter of 2014, with the 13 -week 
Treasury bill yield serving as the base rate.  
4 Over the intermeeting period, the D esk purchased $58 billion of Treasury securities under the 
flow-based program and $90 billion of agency MBS under the  flow-based MBS purchase program and the 
reinvestment program .   
5 The ext raordinary measures available to the Treasury include suspending daily reinvestment of 
the Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund, redeeming existing 
investments and suspending new investments in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund , and 
suspending the daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund  into Treasury 
securities .  Based on staff p rojections, these actions should allow the Treasury to continue operating under 
the current deb t limit until October .

  remained  at the low end of its range over recent years .  The spread between the  
three -month forward rate agreement and the OIS r ate three to six months ahead —a 
forward -looking measure o f potential funding pressures—was little changed .  
In secured funding markets, Treasury general collateral finance (GCF) repo rates 
decreased, on net, over the intermeeting period, in large part because of  the seasonal 
decline in the supply of Treasury securities associated with the timing of tax receipts.  In 
line with the decrease in the Treasury GCF repo rates, MBS GCF repo rates as well as other money market rates also declined  over the period (s ee the box “Recent Behavior of  
Overnight  Money Market Rates ”).  H aircuts in  repo contracts for a range of collateral 
types were reportedly little changed on net.    
Conditions in commercial paper (CP) markets  remained favorable for issuers , 
with interest rates on  unsecured CP  staying at the low end of the range seen over the past 
several years.  The outstanding amounts of unsecured CP issued by both European and U.S. financial institutions were little changed on net.  In asset -backed commercial paper 
markets, amounts outstanding were about unchanged for programs domiciled in the United States but edged down for those with European sponsors.  
Market sentiment  toward large domestic banking organizations appeared to 
improve somewhat over the intermeeting period , likely related in part to further 
reductions in nonperforming loans and the generally positive tone of the incoming economic data.  E quity prices for large d omestic banks outperformed broader equity 
indexes over the period.  CDS spreads for the largest bank holding companies (BHCs) 
were little changed , on net, and remained  near the bottom of their range over the past  
five years . 
Equity prices for other types of financial institutions, such as insurance companies 
and regional banks , also generally outperformed the market.  However, agency m ortgage 
real es tate investment trusts were a notable exception, as their equity prices were battered 
in response to the underperformance of agency MBS, weak earning s reports , and the rise 
in longer -term interest rates.  
Responses to the June 2013 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer 
Financing Terms generally suggested little change over the past three months in the credit terms applicable to important classes of counterpartie s covered by the s urvey  (see 
appendix).  R espondents also noted that the use of financial leverage by most classes of

 Recent Behavior  of Overnight  Money Market Rates 
 
As shown in  the figure below, overnight money  market rates declined  over the  intermeeting  period, 
continuing  a downward  trend that began at the  start of the year.   As of June 11, 2013, the Treasury  
general collateral  finance (GCF) repo, federal funds, and  Eurodollar  rates are 3 to 16 basis points lower 
than at th e end of April and  are near the bottom  of their ranges observed  since the zero lower bound  
period began.1   
 The main  driver of  the recent move  in rates appears to be the decline in the Treasury  GCF repo rate.  
This decline is partly attributable to the  decrease  in the supply  of Treasury collateral  in the market as  
April tax receipts allow the Treasury to reduce  net debt issuance for  a time.
2  The  ongoing asset 
purchases  by the Federal Reserve  and resulting  increase in  reserve balances  may have also contributed  
to some of the softening  in the overnight  federal funds  rate.  However, at the current level of  reserve 
balances,  this effect is likely very modest.3 
 
Despite the high level of reserve balances  and substantially  reduced volume of trading in the federal 
funds market since 2008,  the federal funds  rate continues  to be strongly correlated  with other  short‐
term money market rates, particularly  the overnight  Eurodollar  rate.4  Moreover,  futures quotes and 
basis swaps suggest that market participants  expect the federal funds  effective  rate to remain  tightly 
linked with a range of  money market rates in the future as well.   
 
 
                                                 
1 As the AA rate for nonfinancial  commercial  paper (CP)  reached a near‐record low on April 30, the current level is 
somewhat  higher.  Still, the CP rate shows a downward  trend since the start  of the year,  in line with the other overnight  
money  market rates. 
2 Although  Treasury GCF futures from earlier in the year did price in some softening  of the repo rate, larger‐ than‐
anticipated  Treasury tax receipts allowed for a greater reduction  in bill issuance than expected,  which further 
decreased  holdings of short‐ dated securities  by the public. 
3 Board staff estimates  suggest  that the federal funds effective rate responds  relatively  little to changes in the level 
of reserve balances  once reserve balances reach an elevated level. 
4 The increase in collateral  in the market associated  with the maturity extention  program  (MEP) during 2012  may 
have put some upward pressure on the Treasury GCF repo rate and increased  the spread between  the federal funds 
effective rate and the Treasury GCF repo rate at that time.   Since the end of the MEP,  this spread has narrowed.    Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr. July Oct. Jan. Apr.

  counterparties had remained basically unchanged over the same period ; however, about 
one-fourth  of dealers reported an increase in the use of leverage by hedg e funds, 
continuing the trend observed in recent surveys .  A set of special questions asked how 
current hedge fund leverage stood in  the range defined by the pre- crisis peak and  
post-crisis trough .  The responses indicated some variation in leverage based on hedge 
fund strategy, with the leverage of equity- oriented and macro -oriented funds more 
frequently described as having returned closer to their pre -crisis peaks .  As has been the 
case for several months, r espondents reported an increase in the demand for funding on a 
secured basis for a number of types of collateral —notably, non -agency RMBS,  
high-yield and investment- grade corporate bonds, and CMBS.   A second set of special 
questions focused on secured financing of distr essed assets .  Dealers reported that 
demand for such financing had increased since the start of 2013 for r eal-estate- related 
loans globally a s well as for U.S. corporate assets.    
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Broad equity price indexes ticked u p, on net, over the intermeeting period, as 
somewhat better-than- expected economic news was partly offset by the rise in interest 
rates.  Corporate bond yields rose sharply in line with the rise in comparable- maturity 
Treasury yields, leaving spreads littl e changed on net.  Corporate bond markets remained 
stable over the period, with measures of trading activity suggesting that liquidity 
continued to be reasonably high by historical standards.  
Available indicators suggest that the credit quality of nonfinan cial corporations 
stayed solid.  In the first quarter of this year, the aggregate ratio of cash  to assets ticked 
up and remained near its highest level in 20 years, while the aggregate ratio of debt to asset s stayed at a level well below its historical average for the same period.  In April  and 
May, the volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds that was  upgraded by Moody’s 
Investor s Service was slightly less than  the volume downgraded.  However,  the  
six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial firm s remained low  in April  by 
historical standards , and the  expected year -ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms from 
the KMV model continued to inch down in May and June from already low levels, reflecting an increase in asset valuation s.  Meanwhile, the C&I loan delinquency rate 
continued to fall in the first quarter.

  FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Ten-year sovereign yields in the advanced foreign economies rose substantially  
over the period.  Yields in the United Kingdom and Germany followed U.S. yields higher 
after the April  U.S. employment report and were up about 40 to 50 basis points on net, 
while y ields on Japanese government bonds rose nearly 30 basis points.  Increased 
inflation expectations may have led to higher future expected nominal short rates in Japan, although higher U.S. rates and unusual bond market volatility may have also 
boosted term premiums (see the box “Recent Moves in Government Bond Yields in Japan”).  Japanese equity markets also displayed substantial volatility , rising 13 percent 
early i n the period and then plunging 18 percent in late May and early June.  The sharp 
selloff was accompanied by concerns that the positive effects of Japan’s recent macro policies were losing momentum, but Japanese equity prices are still up significantly sinc e 
late last year.   
European equity indexes were little changed over the period despite some greater 
policy accommodation.  The ECB lowered its main policy rate 25  basis points at its May 
meeting, although communication after its June meeting appeared to s ignal  that it was 
less likely to ease further .  In addition, the European Commission proposed  that  
near-term fiscal targets be relaxed for some countries in the hope of stimulating growth.  
The euro- area financial crisis remained quiescent ; spreads of Italian and Spanish 
government debt over German bunds rose slightly, but spreads on Greek debt declined noticeably,  and Portugal issued its first 10-year bond since seeking IMF support in 2011. 
The broad dollar appreciated about 1¼  percent.  The dollar wa s little changed , on 
average, against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies but rose 2½ percent 
against emerging  market currencies amid rising U.S. yields, weak incoming data for the 
emerging market economies themselves, and monetary policy easing in several EMEs, 
including India, Korea, and Thailand.  The Reserve Bank of Australia, whose economy is 
closely linked to emerging Asia, also cut its policy rate, and the Australian dollar depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar.  EME equity p rices were  down about  
8 percent on net.  Inflows into emerging market equity and bond funds were positive for most of the period but turned to outflows more recently, and EME credit spreads widened appreciably on net.  In response to recent outflows, Brazil rescinded its tax on foreign purchases of its domestic bonds.  Despite subdued GDP growth, Brazil’s central bank

 Recent Moves in Government  Bond Yields in Japan 
On April 4, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced  that it would double the size of Japan’s 
monetary  base by sharply stepping  up its asset purchases.   Although  yields fell after  the 
announcement,  since then  longer‐dated Japanese  benchmark  yields have  increased  
substantially.   This increase contrasts  with the estimated  responses  to asset purchase 
programs by  other central banks, leading  some analysts to question  the efficacy of Japan’s 
new program.  
 
However, unlike  other central banks, which are  focused on stimulating  economic  activity by 
reducing longer‐term interest rates,  the BOJ also seeks to raise  trend inflation and inflation 
expectations,  in line with its  newly adopted  2 percent target.  If the BOJ is successful,  
nominal inter est rates in Japan ultimately  should increase.   At the same  time, BOJ asset 
purchases  ought to exert downward  pressure  on term premiums.   Thus, long‐term interest 
rates initially could rise or fall, depending  on the relative strength  of these two effects.   
 A rise in inflation expectations  should be associated  with a rise  in future expected  short‐term  
nominal interest rates.   The upper‐left  figure on the next page shows the decomposition  of 
Japan’s 10‐year rate into  expected  short‐term  rates and a term premium,  estimated  using the 
Board staff’s term structur e model for Japan.   According  to this model, an increase  in 
expected  short rates  can account  for about  two‐thirds  of the rise in yields since  the BOJ’s 
announcement,  consistent  with an increase  in inflation expectations  (and perhaps also 
better prospects  for economic  activity).    
 
Broadly consistent  with this  reading, market‐based measures  of inflation expectations  have 
increased.   The upper‐right figure  on the next page shows five‐year breakeven  inflation rates 
computed  from nominal and inflation‐linked Japanese  government  bonds (JGBs), as well as 
inflation compensation  derived from inflation swaps.  Although  both measures  have 
changed little, on net, since the BOJ’s April announcement,  they are up about 70 basis points 
since late last  year.  Some  caution should be used, however,  in interpreting  these moves,  as 
these measures  have been  volatile, and the markets underlying  them are relatively  illiquid. 
 
The remaining  one‐third of the rise in JGB yields since early  April is attributable to  a higher 
term premium  (upper‐ left figure).  While this  rise is puzzling given the experience with asset  
purchase programs in  other countries, it  is important  to note that term premiums  had 
declined prior to April in  anticipation  of BOJ action and that they are down, on net, from the 
start of the year.  A number of  factors may explain their  run‐up in recent weeks.  First, as 
shown in  the lower‐ left figure on the next page, a substantial  portion of  the rise in Japanese  
yields has  occurred  since early  May and may reflect a global rebalancing  of investor 
portfolios  in reaction to increases  in yields in other advanced  economies.    
 In addition,  the recent increase in volatility  may be boosting  the term premium.   Volatility in 
JGBs (shown in the lower‐ right figure on the next page) has spiked to multiyear ‐high levels.  
Trading in JGB futures, not  shown, has been halted  several times over the  past two months 
as large price movements  triggered  mar ket circuit breakers.

There is some uncertainty  over what accounts  for the  heightened  volatility  in Japanese  bond 
markets.  It  may be driven by the same underlying  factors that have also  pushed up volatility  
in the bond market in the United States.  Another  possibility  is simply that investors  are 
uncertain  about pricing  Japanese  bonds in the novel environment of  massive asset 
purchases  that are intended  to shift the economy  to a regime  of positive inflation after 
decades of deflation.   The  implementation  of the BOJ’s asset purchase program  has also 
been cited.  The BOJ’s  purchases  are slated to outstrip  the planned net issuance  of JGBs for 
many longer‐dated maturities.   In addition,  an infrequent  BOJ purchase schedule  and lack of 
detail regarding  the amount and maturity  of purchases  raised concerns  about market 
functioning.   Following  several meetings  with market  participants,  the BOJ made modest 
changes to its purchases,  but these changes  fall short of  some market participants’  call for a 
more detailed purchase schedule.   
 In sum, the BOJ’s  asset purchase program  appears to be boosting  inflation expe ctations.  
Success in reducing  the term premium  is less apparent.   However,  the term premium’s  
recent rise could reflect global factors (in which  case the BOJ’s purchases  may have 
prevented  an even larger  rise), problems  implementing  the new program, or  simply a 
correction to  its prior extended  decline.

  raised its policy rate in response to inflation concerns , in contrast  to other EME  central 
banks.     
Foreign official purchases of U.S. secu rities moderated in March and reversed in 
April, as several emerging market countries sold U.S. Treasury securities  to fund 
intervention efforts to support their currencies.   However, data on custody holdings at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that foreign official demand recovered some 
in May.   Foreign private investors also made moderate net sales of Treasury securities in 
April, which were partly offset by small purchases of agency bonds and corporate stocks, while U.S. investors continued to make sizeable purchases of foreign assets.  
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
On balance, c redit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained strong in May, 
particularly through corporate bond issuance.  Gross high -yield  issuance was particularly 
elevated  early in the intermeeting period, although , as has been the case for several 
months, the bulk of the resulting proceeds were reportedly earmarked for refinancing existing debt.  H igh-yield issuan ce subsequently decelerated  in response to the rise in 
intere st rates and market volatility , and high- yield bond mutual funds experienced 
significant outflows  late in the period.  Nonfinancial CP  outstanding increased in May , 
while  C&I loans , discussed later , contracted  modestly .  
Issuance of syndicated leveraged lo ans remained robust in April and May as 
issuers continued to take advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance and 
reprice exisiting loans .  Strong investor demand that outsripped new net supply pushed 
market prices higher.  I ssuance of collateral ized loan obligations (CLOs) slowed some in 
April , reportedly reflecting in part uncertainty regarding a new FDIC regulation that 
requir es banks that buy such securities  to designate them as higher -risk assets.   Issuance 
year to date, however, surpassed $35 billion, and a pickup in the CLO forward calendar 
suggests that the slowdown might be only temporary.   Inflows into loan mutual funds 
continued to be strong despite outflows from other fixed-income funds late in the 
intermeeting period . 
Turn ing to equity financing, gross public issuance has stayed strong in the second 
quarter, as solid stock market returns and generally modest volatility since the turn of the 
year have continued to support both initial and secondary offerings.  Even so, share 
repurchases by nonfinancial firms maintained their recent strength in the first quarter,

  while cash -financed mergers by such firms continued to slow.  Announcements of  merger 
activity and new share repurchase programs in the second quarter indicate that e quity 
retirements are likely to continue to significantly outpace gross issuance going forward, 
and that the current lull in M&A activity is likely to reverse in the coming months.  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate improved a bit over the 
intermeeting period , as vacancy and delinquency rates  declined  somewhat from their 
elevated levels.  CMBS issuance was strong, and spreads on commercial mortgages  were  
roughly unchanged.  Underwriting standards on CMBS deals reportedly continued to 
ease, w ith some market participants beginning to question whether, for certain deals , 
standards were inappropriately loose.  
The pace of gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed a bit in May but 
remained above the rate seen in the first quarter.   New cap ital issuance was also solid, 
reflecting continued improvements in sentiment amid strengthening tax receipts and some easing of state and local budget pressures.   The ratio of yields on 20- year municipal 
bonds to those  on comparab le-maturity Treasury securities —a gauge of the perceived 
relative risk iness of municipal bonds—decreased notabl y over the intermeeting period.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Incoming information over the intermeeting period suggested further 
improvement in the housing sector but still- tight conditions in mortgage markets.   
National house price indexes increased  between 5 and 12 percent year  over  year for the 
period ending in April, with the largest rebounds occurring in previously depressed housing markets or those that have experienced str ong job gains.   Short sales and sales 
stemming from foreclosures continued to decrease as a share of all sales, and the rate of 
new delinquencies hovered  near its historical low .  However, re financing activity fell 
notably in response to the increase in  rates, and p urchase applications stay ed low  as tight 
credit conditions persisted  for households with imperfect credit scores.   Non-agency 
mortgage s remained a small share of all originations, although the securitization o f jumbo 
mortgages pick ed up further, albeit from  very low volumes.  
Consumer credit continued to expand at a solid pace, reflecting ongoing strength 
in auto and student loans while  credit card debt  remained about flat.  Consumer credit 
ABS issuance maintained its robust pace and in May reached one of its highest monthly level s since the end of the TALF program in 2010.  Many large credit card lenders

  increased the volume of offers sent by  mail, although lending standards appeared to 
remain tight.  Most consumer credit delinquency rates continued to decline , partially 
driven by a compositional shift toward higher- quality borrowers due to a tightening of 
underwriting standards.  Delinquencies on government- backed student loans, however, 
remained elevated, likely reflec ting the lack of underwritin g on such loans and the  
still-sluggish labor market.6 
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Growth in bank credit moderated in April and May  compared with the first 
quarter, as core loans softened and securities declined slightly.  C&I loan  growth 
weakened noticeably at large banks, reportedly because of  increased paydowns and 
reduced originations .  C&I loans had ramped up late last year , partly as firms borrow ed to 
make larger -than-usual dividend payments in advance of year -end tax hikes.  Elevated  
loan sales  to nonbanks also appeared to be a factor in the weaker C&I loan growth  of late .  
In contrast, commercial real estate loans  accelerated , especially at large banks.  Overall, 
closed -end residential mortgag es on banks’ books dipped slightly over t he two -month 
period , perhaps reflecting the drop in refinancing activity.  Home equity loan balances 
also declined over the two months.  Credit card loans on banks’ books picked up a bit  
after having been generally flat earlier in the year , and strong auto loan originations 
continued to bolster other consumer loans.  As has been the case for some time, all other 
loans and leases grew  more rapidly than core loans over the period.7  Banks reduced their 
overall holdings of securities slightly , refle cting declines in  holding s of Treasury 
securities, which fell steeply for the fifth  consecutive month  in May.   
According to the May Survey of Terms of Business Lending, spreads of C&I loan 
rates over interest rates on market instruments of comparable matu rity, adjusted for 
nonprice loan characteristics , were little changed at both large and small domestic 
banks.  In contrast, spreads on loans made under smaller commitments, a proxy for small 
business loans, declined slightly, but such spreads remain elevated by historical standards.  In addition, the overall average risk rating was little changed, but the share of 
                                                 
6 In the absence of congressional action, interest rates on new originations of subsidized Stafford 
student loans are scheduled to rise from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1.  
7 The weekly bank cred it data do not  break out the dif ferent types of other loans and leases.  Call 
Report data indicate that the share of loans to foreign banks increased substantially in the first quarter of 
2013 (the latest available data) and  that the shares of loans to nonbank financial firms and state and local 
governments have risen rapidly in the past year.

  secured loan originations rose, consistent with anecdotal evidence that banks are 
extending credit to riskier borrowers , as these loans have high er spreads.  
The profitability of BHCs remained in the upper end of its subdued post- crisis 
range in the first quarter of 2013.  BHC profits  were supported by cuts in provisioning for 
loan losses and noninterest expenses even  as noninterest income decreased slightly and 
net interest margins (NIMs) narrowed further.  The decline in NIMs was most substantial 
for the largest BHCs ; NIMs at smaller BHCs also declined in the first quarter but 
continued to be much higher.  Measures of  credit quality at banks improve d further  in 
every major asset cl ass in the first quarter .  Regulatory capital rat ios remained high  
overall, although risk -based capital ratios decreased a little in the first quarter , reflecting 
the adoption of the market r isk capital rule , which increased market -risk-equivalent assets 
at large banks .8 
In April and May, M2 expanded at an annual rate of about 5½ percent.  Liquid 
deposits were boosted in April by a stronger -than-usual accumulation of balances in 
advance of annual tax payments that were high relative to recent years , but the boost 
unwound in May.  Currency growth stepped up some relative to the last intermeeting period , likely reflecting stronger demand from abroad after a weak start to  the year .   
The monetary base expanded at an annual rate exceeding  37 percent over April 
and May , driven mainly by the increase in reserve balances that resulted from the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchases.  Over the intermeeting period, the growth in reserve balan ces 
has been absorbed primarily by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks and a few of 
the largest domestic banks.
9  The current stock of reserve balances is held about equally 
by foreign and domestic institutions.

9 During the intermeeting period, in order to enhance operational readiness, the Federal Reserve 
offered the first term deposits with a fixed -rate, full -allotment format under the  Term Deposit Facility .  
Tenders  totaled $10.5 billion at a rate of 26 basis points , with 32 depository institutions participating, an 
increase from previous operations.  Outreach was conducted with major reserve holders to raise awareness of the operat ion.

Appendix  
Senior  Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms  
Responses to the June  2013 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing 
Terms generally suggested little change over the past three months in the credit terms applicable 
to important classes of counterparties covered by the survey.1  As has been true since the 
introduction of this question in September 2011, a large net fraction of respondents reported an 
increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to the manag ement of concentrated 
exposures to central counterparties and other financial market utilities.  Overall, respondents noted that the use of financial leverage by most classes of counterparties had remained basically 
unchanged over the past three months ; however, about one -fourth of all dealers reported an 
increase in the use of leverage by hedge funds.  In r esponse to a set of special questions adopting 
a longer- term perspective on this issue, asking that they categorize current leverage levels with 
respect  to the range bounded by the pre- crisis peak and the post -crisis trough, responses differed 
depending on the strategy pursued by the funds.  In particular, a net fraction of about one- fifth of 
dealers noted that leverage for equity -oriented and for macro -oriented funds  was in the upper part 
of the range , with  most -favored equity - and macro -oriented funds described as tapping more 
financing than average clients pursuing those strategies.   In contrast, a net share of nearly 
one-third  indicated that leverage f or convertible-bond arbitrage funds was only moderately above 
or near the trough level. 
As in previous surveys, respondents indicated that most nonprice terms incorporated in 
new or renegotiated over-the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives master agreements were generally 
unchanged, on balance, during the past three months.  However, small net fractions of 
respondents noted a tightening of terms related to the posting of additional margin and the types 
of acceptable collateral.  Dealers also reported that initial mar gin requirements, which fall outside 
the scope of the master agreements, were generally little changed over the same period.    
While the credit terms applicable to the funding of the various types of securities covered 
in the survey were reported to be lit tle changed, on net, over the past three months, a few dealers 
indicated that they had increased clients’ maximum allowable amount of funding for high- yield 
corporate bonds, agency residential mortgage -backed securities (RMBS ), non- agency RMBS , and 
                                                 
1 The June survey collected qualitative information on changes over the previous three months in 
credit terms and conditions in securities financing and over -the-counter ( OTC ) derivatives markets.  In 
addition to the core set of questions, this survey included a set of special questions about the current use of 
financial leverage by hedge fund clients of different types adopting the pre -crisis peak and post -crisis 
trough as reference points, and a second set of special questions about changes in funding of broad classes 
of distressed assets by client types.  The 22 institutions participating in the surv ey account for almost all of 
the dealer financing  of dollar -denominated securities to nondealers and are the most active intermediaries 
in OTC derivatives markets.  The survey was conducted during the period from May 21, 2013, to June 3, 
2013.  The core qu estions ask about changes between March 2013 and May 2013 .

  commercial mortgage -backed securities (CMBS) .  Notably, respondents indicated that demand 
for funding had increased for a number of collateral types.  In particular, significant net fractions 
of dealers reported increased demand for funding of non- agency RMBS , high-yield corporate 
bonds, CMBS , and investment -grade corporate bonds.  Modest net fractions of respondents 
indicated increased demand for term funding (that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or more) 
of CMBS , high -yield corporate bonds, and non- agency  RMBS .  About one- fifth of respondents 
noted that the liquidity and functioning of the underlying markets for non- agency RMBS and 
investment -grade corporate bonds had improved somewhat during the previous three months.  
However, a few dealers indicated tha t the liquidity and functioning of the underlying market for 
agency RMBS had deteriorated.   For other collateral types covered in the survey, the liquidity and 
functioning of the underlying markets were generally characterized as little changed on net.  
The June survey also included special questions on  funding of broad classes of distressed 
assets :  The first question addressed changes in funding across types of distressed assets in the 
United States , Europe, and Asia, and the second focused on changes across various types of 
clients.  Notable  net fraction s of dealers reported that demand for funding had increased for  
real-estate- related loans  originated in  all three regions and for U .S. corporate assets.  Moreover,  
respondents pointed to an increase in the demand for funding of such assets by most -favored 
hedge funds, other hedge funds, private equity firms , and special purpose vehicles. 
COUNTERPARTY TYPES  
Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries  
In the June survey, all but one respondent indicated that the amount of resources and 
attention devoted to management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  (See the exhibit 
“Management of Concentrated Credit Exposures and I ndicators of Supply of Credit.”)  The 
fraction of dealers reporting an increase in the amount of resources and attention devoted to 
management of concentrated exposures to dealers and other financial intermediaries has declined 
gradually from the 90 percent peak reached in the December  2011 survey  when concerns about 
the condition of European financial institutions were particularly acute.  
Central Counterparties and Other Financial Utilities  
About two- thirds of dealers indicated that they had increased the amount of resources and 
attention devoted to management of concentrated credit exposures to central counterparties and 
other financial utilities over the past three months, roughly the same share as in previous surveys.  
About four- fifths of the broad -scope dealers—dealers with a significant presence in essentially all 
of the business areas covered by the survey —reported an increase.  In light of the approaching 
implementation of new regulatory requirements mandating increased central clearing of many 
OTC contracts, continued focus on this issue is perhaps unsurprising.  About one-fourth of survey respondents noted that changes in the practices of central counterparties, including changes in 
margin requirements and haircuts, had some influence on the credit terms they applied to clients 
on bilateral transactions that are not cleared.

  Hedge Funds  
As in March , respondents to the June survey generally indicated that both price terms 
(such as financing rates) and nonprice terms (including haircuts, maximum maturity, covenants, 
cure periods, cross -default provisions, or other documentation features) offered to hedge funds for 
securities financing and OTC derivatives transactions had remained basically  unchanged over the 
past three months.  About one -fourth of resp ondents reported an increase in the use of financial 
leverage by hedge funds over the past three months.  (See the exhibit “Use of Financial Leverage.”)  Of the dealers that reported an increase in leverage, all but one a re broad -scope 
firms.  Several  broa d-scope dealers also indicated that the availability of additional financial 
leverage (such as undrawn secured funding facilities) under agreements currently in place with 
hedge funds had increased somewhat.  Nearly one- fourth of dealers further noted that  there had 
been an increase in the intensity of efforts by hedge funds to negotiate more- favorable price and 
nonprice terms over the same period.  A few respondents also noted that the provision of 
differential terms to most-favored hedge funds had increased somewhat over the same period.  
Trading Real Estate Investment Trusts  
Most respondents to the June survey reported that price and nonprice terms offered to 
trading real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) had remained basically unchanged over the past 
three  months.2  A few dealers indicated that price or nonprice terms had eased , with  improvement 
in general market liquidity and functioning the most cited  reason  for the change .  Respondents 
generally indicated that the use of financial leverage by trading REI Ts had remained basically 
unchanged.  Most r espondents noted that the intensity of efforts by trading REITs to negotiate 
more -favorable price and nonprice terms was broadly unchanged, with only a few dealers 
indicating an increase.  Most dealers also found  the provision of differential terms to  
most -favored REIT clients to be broadly unchanged. 
Mutual F unds, Exchange-T raded Funds, P ension Plans, and E ndowments  
Respondents to the June survey indicated that both price and nonprice terms offered to 
mutual funds, exchange- traded  funds ( ETFs ), pension plans, and endowments had remained 
basically unchanged over the past three months.  A few dealers indicated that either price or nonprice terms had eased  somewhat, citing  more aggressive competition from other inst itutions 
as the most prominent reason.  P rovision of differential terms to most-favored clients and the 
intensity of effort s by clients to negotiate more- favorable terms were also reported to be little 
changed, as was t he use of financial leverage.   
Insura nce Companies 
As in the previous survey, r espondents to the June  survey indicated that both price and 
nonprice terms  offered to insurance companies had changed little over the past three months, as 
had the provision of differential terms to most- favored cl ients.  The use of financial leverage by

  insurance companies also remained unchanged.  A few respondents reported an increase in the 
intensity of efforts by insurance companies to negotiate more- favorable price and nonprice terms.   
Separately Managed A ccounts E stablished with Investment Advisers  
Similarly, nearly all of the dealers reported in the June survey that price and nonprice 
terms negotiated by investment advisers on behalf of separately managed accounts were basically unchanged over the past three months.  Provision of differential terms to most- favored clients and 
the use of financial leverage by investment advisers were also reported to be little changed.  A few dealers reported an increase in the intensity of effort s by investment advisers to ne gotiate 
more -favorable terms.  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Respondents to the June survey indicated that nonprice terms  offered to nonfinancial 
corporations had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  About one- fifth o f 
respondents indicated  that they had tightened somewhat the price terms  offered to nonfinancial 
corporations over the past three months, while a few dealers pointed to an easing of price terms .  
More than one-fourth of respondents reported an increase in the intensity of efforts by nonfinancial corporations to negotiate more- favorable price and nonprice terms.  
Mark and Collateral Disputes  
As in previous surveys, a large majority of respondents in June indicated that the volume, 
persistence, and duration of mark and collateral disputes with each counterparty type included in the survey were little changed over the past three months.  A few respondents, however, reported 
an increase over the same period  in the volume, persistence, and duration  of mark and collateral 
disputes with d ealers and other financial intermediaries as well as with mutual funds, ETFs, 
pension plans, and endowments. 
OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES  
As in previous surveys, most nonprice terms incorporated in new or renegotiated OTC 
derivatives master agreements were reported to be basically unchanged, on net, over the past 
three months.3  However, a few dealers —including some broad- scope dealers—reported a 
tightening in acceptable collateral, and one- fifth of respondents also indicated that requirements, 
timelines, a nd thresholds for posting additional margin had tightened somewhat over the past 
three months. 
For all of the contract types included in the survey, nearly all of the dealers indicated that 
initial margins (which fall outside the scope of master agreements) were little changed over the 
past three months, for both average and most-favored clients.  Posting of nonstandard collateral 
                                                 
3 The survey asks specifically about requirements, timelines, and thresholds for  posting additional 
margin, acceptable collateral, recognition of portfolio or diversification benefits, triggers and covenants, 
and other documentation features, including cure periods and cross -default provisions.

  (that is, collateral other than cash and U.S. Treasury securities) also remained basically 
unchanged.  For most contract types i ncluded in the survey, dealers generally indicated that the 
volume, duration, and persistence of mark and collateral disputes had remained basically unchanged over the past three months.  However, a few dealers reported that the volume of mark 
and collateral disputes had increased for credit contracts referencing corporates and for credit 
contracts referencing securitized products including MBS and asset -backed securities.  Finally, a 
few respondents indicated that the duration and persistence of mark and c ollateral disputes  had 
increased somewhat for foreign exchange contracts over the same period.   
SECURITIES FINANCING  
As in previous surveys, dealers reported that the credit terms under which most types of 
securities included in the survey are financed were little changed, on balance, over the past three 
months.  The exception s were high -yield corporate bonds, agency RMBS, non- agency RMBS , 
and CMBS , for which a few survey respondents indicated that they had increased the maximum 
amount of funding for both m ost-favored and average clients.   Finally, a few survey respondents 
indicated that the maximum maturity had increased  somewhat for funding of agency RMBS  and 
for funding of high-yield corporate bonds and CMBS provided to most- favored clients.   
In the June  survey, dealers reported that demand for funding had increased for a number 
of collateral types.  (See the exhibit “Measures of Demand for Funding and Market Functioning.”)  T wo-fifths  of dealers reported increased demand for funding of non- agency 
RMBS, while about one -third  of respondents pointed to increased demand for funding of  
high-yield corporate bonds and CMBS.  In addition, about one- fifth of dealers reported increased 
demand for funding of investment-grade corporate bonds.  Finally, net fractions  of dealers 
ranging between one-fifth and about one-fourth reported i ncrease d demand for term funding—
that is, funding with a maturity of 30 days or more—for CMBS, high -yield corporate bonds, and 
non-agency RMBS .   
About one -fifth of respondents indicated that the liquidity and functioning of the 
underlying markets for non- agency RMBS and investment -grade corporate bonds had improved 
somewhat during the previous three months.
4  Notably, a few dealers indicated that the liquidity 
and functioning of the under lying market for agency RMBS had deteriorated.  For other collateral 
types covered in the survey, the liquidity and functioning of the underlying markets were 
generally characterized as little changed  on net. 
Finally, as in previous surveys, all of the respondents indicated that the volume, duration, 
and persistence of mark and collateral disputes were basically unchanged for all of the collateral types.  
                                                 
4 Note that survey respondents are instructed to report changes in liquidity and functioning in the 
market for the underlying collateral to be funded through repurchase agreements and similar secured 
financing transactions, not changes in the funding market itself.  This question is not asked wi th respect to 
equity markets in the core questions.

  SPECIAL QUESTION S ON THE CURRENT USE OF FINANCIAL LEVERAGE BY 
HEDGE FUND CLIENTS  
The first set of specia l questions in the June survey asked dealers to characterize the 
current use of financial leverage by hedge fund clients using the pre- crisis peak and post -crisis 
trough as reference points.  Respondents were asked to distinguish between most- favored  clien ts 
(as a consequence of breadth, duration, and/or extent of relationship) and other client s, and 
among equity-oriented funds, macro-oriented funds, credit-oriented funds, convertible-bond 
arbitrage funds, and other fixed-income- oriented relative -value funds.  Notable fraction s of 
dealers , ranging between about one -third and about one-half, indicated that  current levels of 
leverage fall roughly in the middle between the peak and trough across specified strategies for 
both most-favored and other clients.  Res ponses exhibited some dispersion around this middle 
point.  E quity -oriented and macro -oriented funds were most frequently characterized as operating 
with higher leverage :  A net fraction of about one-fifth of dealers reported that such clients were 
current ly utilizing levels of leverage near to or at the pre- crisis peak , with most-favored equity- 
and macro -oriented funds described as tapping more financing than average clients pursuing 
those strategies.  In contrast, a net share of nearly one- third  characterized the leverage currently 
employed by convertible-bond funds as only moderately above or near the trough level.5   
SPECIAL QUESTION S ON CHANGES IN FUNDING OF BROAD CLASSES OF 
DISTRESSED ASSETS  
The second set of special questions in the June survey asked  dealers about  changes in 
funding of distressed assets since the start of 2013 , distinguishing by type ( real estate loans  and 
corporate assets such as loans or trade receivables) and by region  of origin  (United States, 
Europe, or Asia) , as well as by vario us client types .   
The first question from this set addressed changes in funding of various types of 
distressed assets.  About one- fifth of d ealers , on net, reported that demand for funding of 
distressed real estate loans without regard for the region of origination had increased since the 
beginning of the year.  With respect to distressed corporate assets, about one- quarter of 
respondents, on balance, indicated that the demand for funding for such assets from the United 
States had risen , while little to no  change was reported in the demand for funding for such assets 
from Europe and Asia . 
Dealers noted that demand for funding of distressed assets had increased on the part of 
several  types of clients .  About one- third  of respondents reported an increase in demand by  
most -favored hedge funds , while nearly one-fifth, on net, pointed to  a rise in demand on the part 
of other hedge funds.  In addition, one-fourth of dealers, on balance, reported increased  demand 
for funding by private equity firms and special purpose vehicles, which are often established by 
                                                 
5 Funds focused on equity -oriented strategies, macro -oriented strategies, and convertible -bond 
arbitrage are generally regarded as those most likely to employ substantive amounts of leverage.  In 
addition , equity- oriented and macro -oriented funds are considered to be comparatively agile in adjusting 
the amounts of leverage employed, given that most of their trading occurs in highly liquid markets.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY  
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projection for economic activity 
as roughly normal relative to the experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by 
the FOMC) , a period that now includes considerable volatility.1  Sources of this 
uncertainty include the difficulty of determining the likely implications for future economic growth of the financial crisis, the deep recession, and the surprisingly slow pace of recovery to date; risks still posed by the e uro area to domestic economic growth; 
and the unclear likelihood that recent positive news in some sectors—notably, housing—
will filter through to the broader economy.  That said, on the whole, our concerns about 
these factors have diminished over the past several quarters.  A related  concern is  the 
ability of the economy to weather potential future shocks.  In particular, the resilience of the financial system remains uncertain , despite ongoing regulatory reform.  In addition, 
monetary policy still has a limited capacity to counteract the effects of any new adverse 
developments, such as a slower- than-anticipated improvement in domestic credit 
conditions and confidence, or a more severe downturn in Europe.  Given  these 
considerations , we continue to believe that the risks to domestic economic activity are 
skewed to the downside.  
Our assessment of the risks to the economic outlook has been informed by the 
quantit ative surveillance ( QS) report completed in late May , which noted both positive 
and negative devel opments  about financial risks since the previous report a few months 
ago.  On the positive side, the financial strength of systemically important U.S. banking 
organizations has continued to improve, as have the financial conditions of many businesses and households.  In addition, the prices of many  widely held assets, including 
corporate equity, nonfinancial debt, and real estate, do not, in general, appear to be 
                                                 
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past 
several years.  In particular, as the fixed 20 -year window used to assess the size of typical forecast errors 
has moved forward to include the experience of the past 5 years, the estimated standard errors for out -year 
projections of the unemployment rate almost doubled between 2008 and 2011 and have remained at this 
higher level with the current 20 -year sample.  As a result, the benchmark estimates of uncert ainty about 
economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great Moderation period.  In contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged relative to earlier sample 
periods.

 detached from fundamentals and thus likely to reverse in a destabilizing way.  On the 
negative side, the evidence continues to point to some slowly building financial 
vulnerabilities as a result of increasing exposures to credit and maturity risk and expanding leverage in the system.  Moreover, structural vulnerabilities such as fragile wholesale funding and tight connections among comple x global financial firms remain  
and make the economy susceptible to adverse shocks.  In some areas, risks of such  
shocks persist :  The  possibility  of a much more substantial spike in Treasu ry yields is still 
notable, and concerns  related to the economic and financial situat ion in Europe or about 
U.S. policymakers’ actions regarding the debt ceiling continue, although their immediacy 
is less than several months ago.  On balance, although  the QS assessment suggests that  
financial vulnerabilitie s have increased somewhat since the previous report , neither  these 
vulnerabilities  nor the combined potential for adverse shocks  appear unusually 
pronounced at the current time . 
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Long er-run inflation 
expectations appear to  have remained stable in recent years despite  large fluctuations in 
the prices of crude oil and other commodit ies and persistently wide margins of slack in 
labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast 
as balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility that the slowing in  recent readings 
on inflation,  weaker -than-anticipated economic conditions, further subdued increases in 
unit labor costs, and low levels of resource utilization could cause inflation to decrease 
over time.  On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a 
stronger- than-expected recovery or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the 
economy than assumed in the baseline.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustr ate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.   The first  
scenario contemplates  a stronger recovery in residential construction and house prices 
that spark s faster , sustainable improvements in the overall economy.  In contrast, in t he 
second  scenario , a stronger recovery is accompanied by an unsustainable buildup in 
financial risk -taking and leverage that, ultimately, leads to another recession.  The third

scenario 
explores the possibility that we have underestimated the persistence of the 
headwinds that have been restraining the recovery.  The fourth scenario considers the risk 
that recent low readings on prices are not the result of transitory fo rces, but instead reflect 
a persistent decline in inflation .  The final  two scenarios explore risks  to the U.S.  
economy from foreign economic developments—first, that the  recession in  Europe could 
be more prolonged and somewhat deeper  than we currently anticipate, and , second, that 
investor reaction to rising U.S. interest rates  lead s to an unanticipated strengthening of 
the dollar.   
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and th e last two  
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations , as in the baseline 
forecast,  the federal funds rate follows  an inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
subject to  the FOMC’s thresholds for the  unemployment rate and inflation.  For  the 
SIGMA simulations , we use a broadly similar  policy rule , subject to the same thresholds 
but employing  an alternative concept of resource utilization.2  In all cases, we assume 
that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.  
Housing-Led Recovery 
The increases in house prices, housing starts, and home sales over the past year or 
so could fuel a more robust economic recovery than assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, a stronger housing recovery, along with reduced uncertainty about the durability of the expansion more broadly, sparks a vigorous boom that is well supported by 
fundamentals.  R eal GDP rises at an annual rate of 3 ½ percent in the second half of this 
year and above 4¼ percent in 2014 and 2015; the unemployment rate falls below 
6½ percent by mid -2014 a nd below 5 percent in late 2015—a little more than 
¼ percentage point below our projection of the natural rate at that time.  With resource slack decreasing  more rapidly, wages and unit labor costs begin to accelerate gradually 
relative to the baseline; however, with long- term inflation expectations assumed to 
remain  well anchored, consumer price inflation rises to only 2¼ percent by 2017.  The 
federal funds rate lifts off  from its effective lower bound by the end of 2014 and rises 
more steeply than in  the baseline thereafter.       
2 The SIGMA policy rule u ses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence o f slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 Boom–Bust  
The faster recovery in the previous scenario incorporates a sustainable expansion 
in credit availability to households and firms .  In this scenario, by contrast, the stronger 
recovery is spurred by a more -aggressive easing  in lending standards, greater use of 
leverage, house prices that run ahead of fundamentals, and a larger reduction in risk 
spreads.  These developments boost real activity this year and next above that of the 
previous scenario but also significantly increase the vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks.  Such a shock is assumed to occur in mid -2015, bringing the leverage 
cycle to an abrupt end.  Credit market functioning  becomes impaired; p remiums on 
corporate bonds jump about 150 basis points above the baseline; house prices begin to fall back to their fundamental level ; and  spending on consumer durables, housing, and 
investment declines  sharply as the economy falls into recession .  The u nemployment rate 
rises about 2¾ percentage points, reaching almost 8 percent  by early 2017.  Monetary 
policy responds to the boom by tightening beginning in mid -2014 but later  reverses 
course once the credit market disruption begins.  Although the inertial nature of the assumed policy rule prevents a rapid return of the federal funds rate to its effective lower 
bound, the policy easing (coupled with an assumed wani ng of the adverse effects of the 
crisis) is sufficient to enable an economic recovery to begin in 2017.  After rising to 
2 percent during the boom, inflation falls during the recession and is about 1½ percent at 
the end of the simulation horizon.  
Headwinds  
Despite the disappointingly slow pace of the recovery to date and recent weakness 
in some indicators, the staff  forecast continues to feature a marked acceleration in real 
GDP.  In this scenario, however, our baseline assumptions about the normalization of 
credit availability  and anticipated improvements in household and business confidence 
turn out to be overly optimistic; as a result , real activity continues to expand at only a 
moderate rate.  Real GDP rises 2  percent per year, on average, in 2013 and 2014, and 
economic growth barely exceeds its potential for some time thereafter .  Because margins 
of resource slack remain wide , inflation stays close to 1¼ percent rather than rising as in 
the baseline.  With inflation persistently below the FOMC ’s longer-run objective and the 
unemployment rate far above its natural rate, the federal funds rate remains near zero until after 2017.

 Low Inflation 
In the baseline forecast, recent low readings on inflation prove to be transitory, 
and, over the next few years , inflation gradually moves back toward 2 percent.  In this 
scenario, the recent price data instead prove to be a harbinger of a longer- lasting decline 
in actual inflation , accompanied by a modest decrease in  long-run inflation expectations .  
Inflation runs below 1 percent next year and edges down further thereafter .  In this 
environment, investors become increasingly  concerned that  the economy is mired in a 
weak state, with  inflation running substantially below 2 percent and monetary policy 
persistently constrained by the zero lower bound.  As a result, bond premiums rise and 
put upward pressure on real long- term interest rates, thereby modestly restraining 
household and business spending and boosting unemployment relative to the baseline over the next few years.  The higher trajectory of the unemployment rate delays liftoff  of 
the federal funds rate until late 2016.  In the longer run, monetary policy is sufficiently stimulative to eventually bring the unemployment rate below the baseline and to che ck 
any further disinflation.  
Prolonged European Recession 
In the baseline forecast, the European economies expand at a modest pace next 
year and beyond while measures of financial stress, such as sovereign and corporate spreads, slowly decline to their 2010 levels.  In this scenario, the fiscal and financial headwinds in Europe instead prove stronger and more persistent than anticipated.  Specifically, continued financial uncertainty and weak credit supply leave private 
borrowing costs about 100 basis points higher than in the baseline in 2013, and consumer 
confidence remains depressed, leading to weaker business and household spending.  As a consequence, real GDP in Europe is 2½ percent lower than in the baseline by the first half of 2015, notwit hstanding a persistent real depreciation in the foreign exchange value 
of European currencies of about 10 percent against the dollar.  The stronger dollar and weaker foreign activity , in turn, cause U.S. real net exports to fall relative to the baseline.  
Nevertheless, the overall impact on the U.S. economy is not too severe because the magnitude of the assumed financial shock in Europe is not so large as to substantially disrupt financial markets outside of Europe.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands roughly 2½ percent on average this year and in 2014, almost ¾ percentage point less than in the baseline.  With a higher unemployment rate, the federal funds rate runs a little below the baseline through the end of the forecast period.

 Stronger Dollar  
In light  of the considerable appetite of investors for additional yield in today’ s 
low interest rate environment, the foreign exchange value of the dollar may respond to 
the projected increases in  U.S. interest rates to a greater extent than we have assumed.   
To capture this possibility, this scenario introduces a shock to the exchange risk premium that boosts the dollar by 10 percent above the baseline by the end of this year before 
gradually receding .  The higher foreign exchange value of the dollar restrains U.S. real 
net exports and causes the trade balance as a share of GDP to fall by 1 ½ percentage 
points by the end of 2014, although part of the drag on GDP growth is offset by stronger 
private consumption that benefits from the appreciated dollar.  All told, growth in U.S. real GDP is only 2½ percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate remains above 7 percent through most of 2014, about ½ percentage point higher by the end of 2014 than 
in our baseline.  Core inflation falls to 1 percent in 2014, due to lower U.S. real activity 
and the stronger dollar.  With a higher unemployment rate and lower core inflation, the federal funds rate stays somewhat below the baseline throughout the forecast period.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget 
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
