Editorial note: 
 
Beginning with this edition of the Teal book, we are running an experiment in 
which we are examining whether we can  provide you with the forecast-related 
information that you need in a more concise, efficient manner.  Specifically, the idea is to 
explore whether we should intersperse four traditional-format versions of the Tealbook 
(delivered in advance of SEP meetings) with four short-form versions (prepared for non-
SEP meetings).  In this first attempt at the short-form document, the sections Domestic 
Economic Developments and Outlook and In ternational Economic Developments and 
Outlook appear in condensed form. 
We are drawn to the possibility that a four-plus-four model for the Tealbook 
might better serve your needs based partly on the observation that time generally moves 
relatively slowly in the nonfinan cial economy.  To be sure, from one meeting to the next, 
we do routinely revise some aspects of the nonfinancial outlook—both domestic and foreign; but almost invariab ly, the general contour of th e outlook remains the same.  
Accordingly, our goal in the short-form versi on is to focus mostly on the key factors that 
shaped the revisions to the outlook during the intermeeti ng period and to give relatively 
less attention to rehearsing the contour  of the forecast—for the most part reserving the 
latter discussion for the long-form document. 
Even in the abbreviated format, we will continue to use boxes to illuminate 
aspects of the forecast that we believe warrant  special attention.  Indeed, the abbreviated 
format should free up staff time that can be devoted, in part, to more such special-topic 
analysis.  We will also continue to provide a full treatment of risks to the forecast in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section. 
As part of the process of considering whether to go forward with alternating 
forms of the Tealbook, we make two important commitments to the Committee:  First, 
the underlying forecast preparation process will be the same during all eight rounds; there 
will be no stinting on the care with which we sift the incoming data and assess how best 
to revise the outlook.  The only change would be in the Tealbook itself where we explain 
the forecast.  Second, we will maintain the capacity to produce a full-length Tealbook 
even during a non-SEP round (given some reasonable period of forewarning) if 
circumstances warrant. 
We will come back to you after the upcoming FOMC meeting for your 
observations on and suggestions for this experiment.

Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data we have received in recent weeks suggest that  economic activity rose at 
a slower pace over the first half of this year  than we projected in  the June Tealbook.  Our 
estimate of the average pace of real GDP gr owth in the first and second quarters now 
stands at 1½ percent, ½ percentage point le ss than in our June forecast.  Some of the 
shortfall in growth relative to our expectations occurred in consumer spending and 
residential construction.  Our reading of these data suggests that some of the surprise in these categories is likely to carry forward into the second half of the year; as a result, we 
have extrapolated forward a good portion of the miss.  However, some of the weaker-
than-expected data during the fi rst half pertained to net expor ts and inventories; in these 
areas, we expect the contribut ions to growth to rebound durin g the second half of this 
year.  On balance, these infl uences leave our projection fo r real GDP growth down only a 
bit in the second half of the y ear relative to the June Tealbook , and we continue to show a 
substantial step-up in the pace of economi c activity in the second half, averaging 
2¾ percent over that period, about  0.1 percentage point less th an in the June Tealbook.  If 
not for the resilience of the labor market, we would have marked down the forecast more. 
With mixed financial market developments and little change to other key 
conditioning assumptions, our projection fo r GDP growth over the medium term is 
essentially unrevised from June.  Nevertheless, as a result of the weaker growth this year, 
the level of real GDP at the end of 2015 is expected to be ½ percent below what was 
envisioned in the June Tealbook. 
In contrast to the spending data, the jobs report for June was a little better than we 
had expected, with payroll employment  coming in above our forecast and the 
unemployment rate es sentially meeting our expectat ion.  Nevertheless, given the 
somewhat weaker level of economic activity in  this forecast, the unemployment rate is 
projected to cross the Committee’s 6½ percent th reshold one quarter later than in the June 
Tealbook and to finish 2015 at 6 percent, ¼ percentage point higher than before.  
Although inflation has been very  low, we continue to thi nk that the soft readings 
seen during the first half of th e year partly reflected transitory influences.  Indeed the 
latest readings on core consumer prices have been slightly higher than we were 
expecting.  With long-run inflation expectati ons remaining stable, and slack in labor and 
product markets gradually diminishing, our ba seline forecast calls for core PCE price

 inflation to edge up over the medium te rm, reaching 1.7 percent in 2015.  Headline 
inflation is projected to run a little below core inflation over the medium term, as 
consumer energy prices are expected to dec line in line with our forecast for crude oil 
prices. 
As always, numerous risks attend the outlook.  Among these risks at present are 
the uncertain effects of fiscal policy—incl uding not only how the actions taken earlier 
this year will continue to play  out, but also the need this fall to lift the debt ceiling and to 
enact annual appropriations measures.  In addi tion, the rise in mortgage rates could weigh 
on the housing sector by more than we are projecting, or activity abroad—including in 
China and Europe—could fail to meet our expecta tions.  With regard to our projection for 
inflation, the most pressing risk, in our view, is that the recent soft ness fails to abate as 
we anticipate.  Moreover, with the federa l funds rate at the effective lower bound and 
given the uncertain efficacy and costs associ ated with portfolio policy, monetary policy 
has a limited capacity to counteract the effect s of any downside developments either with 
respect to real activity or inflation. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 We revised up our assumption for the cu mulative amount of purchases of long-
term securities under the current LSAP  program.  We now assume that 
purchases will begin to slow later this year and end by the middle of next year, 
cumulating to $1.2 trillion (up from our assumption of $750 billion in the June 
Tealbook).  In addition, we now assume th at the Federal Reserve will not sell 
any of its holdings of agency mortgage-b acked securities.  As best we can tell, 
market participants’ current expectations  for asset purchases are roughly in line 
with our own. 
 With the unemployment rate projected to fall below the Committee’s 
6½ percent threshold in the second quar ter of 2015, we now assume that the 
federal funds rate will begin to rise fr om its effective lower bound in the third 
quarter of 2015—one quarter later than in the June Tealbook.   
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield has increased about 35 basis points, on net, since 
the June Tealbook.  We attribute most of that increase to a rise in the term

 premium and some to market expectati ons of a higher path for the federal 
funds rate.  We assume that the Tr easury term premium will gradually 
converge back to the upward-sloping path  we had previously projected, and we 
assume that market participants’ expect ed path for the federal funds rate will 
gradually drop back to ours.  As a result,  the level of the 10-year yield at the 
end of 2015—3.85 percent—is unchanged from the June Tealbook.  (For 
further discussion, see th e box “Interpretations of Developments in Key 
Financial Markets.”) 
 Yields on investment-grade corporat e bonds have moved up about 25 basis 
points since the June Tealbook, and we assu me that yields on these corporate 
bonds will reach 5½ percent at the end of  2015.  This path is somewhat higher 
through the first half of 2015 than it was in the June Tealbook but is unrevised 
at the end of the projection period. 
 Conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgage  rates have increased about 35 basis 
points since the June Tealbook, and we e xpect these mortgage rates to reach 
about 5¼ percent by the end of 2015.  This path is also somewhat higher 
through the first half of 2015 than it was in the J une Tealbook and is unrevised 
at the end of the projection period. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Despite the increase in Treasury and other yields, equity prices have increased 
4½ percent since the time of the June T ealbook.  We project equity prices to 
rise at an average annual rate of abou t 7 percent over the medium term, leaving 
them 1½ percent higher at the end of  2015 than in the previous Tealbook. 
 With recent readings about in line with our expectations, our projection for house prices is roughly unchanged.  We assume that house prices will increase 
at an annual rate of 8½ percent over the second half of 2013 before stepping 
down to growth rates of 5 per cent in 2014 and 4 percent in 2015. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We made no revisions to our fiscal policy assumptions .  The drag on real GDP 
growth from changes in fiscal policy (at all levels of government) is still 
assumed to be 1¼ percentage points in 2013 and then to diminish to

 Interpretations  of Developments  in Key  Financial  Markets 
We have been surprised  by the significant  moves in key financial markets during the past few 
months.  Since the April Tealbook  (that is, two Tealbooks  ago), the 10‐year Treasury  yield has 
increased  85 basis points, the 30‐year fixed ‐rate mortgage  rate and the BBB‐rated corporate bond  
yield have moved up a bit more than that, and stock prices have climbed almost 8 percent.    
In putting together  our baseline projection,  we have interpreted  these financial  developments  as 
mainly reflecting  three factors.  First,  it appears that reduced risk aversion  in equity markets has 
helped boost stock  prices.  Second, we think that participants  in a variety  of asset markets have 
interpreted  the balance of  FOMC communications  as pointing to a  tighter stance of monetary  
policy for any given outlook for the economy.  Third,  money managers  and retail investors  have 
reportedly  come to view a range of fixed‐income securities  as offering a less favorable risk–return  
tradeoff than  they had previously  thought.   With respect to this third point, we think that FOMC 
communications  in recent months caused investors  to shift away from positions  that seemed to be 
predicated  on the view that interest rates and  interest rate volatilities  would remain unusually  low 
long into the future.   
Despite the large increase in  the 10‐year  Treasury yield since the April Tealbook,  we have made 
essentially  no revision to our  projection  for the level of  that yield at the end  of the 2015.  That is,  we 
have interpreted  the recent increases  in the 10‐year Treasury  yield as partly reflecting  transitory  
influences—we expect the  market to eventually  reverse its recent move toward anticipating  an 
earlier liftoff  of the federal funds rate—and  partly as pulling forward increases  in the Treasury  term 
premium  that we had expected  to occur later in the forecast period.  We have similarly flattened  
the projected  path of equit y prices in response to the  larger‐than‐expected  increase we  have seen 
in recent months.   
Of course,  interpreting  market moves is fraught with uncertainty,  and projecting  the evolution  of 
market beliefs is more difficult still.  For example,  the recent rise in the 10‐year Treasury  term 
premium  might be part of a continuing  trend rather  than a one‐ time shift.  In the “Higher Long ‐
Term Interest Rates” alternative  scenario  in the Risks and  Uncertainty  section, we explore the 
potential  macroeconomic  effects of a further rise  in long‐term interest rates.    
With regard  to the stock market, the rise of equity prices in our baseline projection  depends  
importantly  on an assumed  gradual decline in the equity risk premium  over the  medium term.  As 
noted above, a drop in the equity premium  appears to have been  an important  driver of the recent 
stock market rally.  However,  the equity premium  could decline more slowly than we assume or 
level off, in  which case we would expect a lower path  for equity  prices.  Conversely, the recent  
combination  of stock price increases  and higher bond yields could  signal the beginning  of a more 
marked reversal than  we have assumed  in our baseline projection  of the flight‐to‐safety pressures 
that have reduced Treasury  yields and  limited equity price appreciation  since 2009.  In  that case, 
the equity premium  at the  end of the projection period  might be  substantially  lower, prompting  a 
stronger rise in the stock market.  The macroeconomic  effects of this latter interpretation  of recent 
developments  are explored  in the alternative scenario  “Increased  Risk Appetite”  in the Risks and  
Uncertainty  section.

 ¾ percentage point in 2014 and ¼ percentage point in 2015 (excluding 
multiplier effects).   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Our outlook for foreign economic grow th is revised down just a touch, 
reflecting disappointing data from emerging market economies and the 
expected drag from the recent tighteni ng of financial conditions in foreign 
economies.  We estimate that foreign GDP  growth increased at an annual rate 
of 2¼ percent in the second quarter; we project foreign GDP growth to pick up 
over the medium term, reaching a pace of 3½ percent in 2015.   
 Our outlook for the broad r eal dollar is litt le changed since the previous 
Tealbook.  With financial stresses in Eu rope anticipated to abate and trend 
depreciation against the currencies of the emerging market economies expected 
to continue, we project the broad real dol lar to depreciate at an annual rate of 
2½ percent. 
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has in creased moderately since the time of the 
June Tealbook, primarily because of tensions in the Middle East.  In contrast, 
oil price futures at longer-dated matu rities were pushed down by concerns 
about slower future growth in oil de mand.  Consistent with these market 
developments, the price of imported oil is  expected to fall more rapidly over 
the medium term, from $104 per barrel in the second half of this year to $89 
per barrel by the end of 2015.    
 A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has declined about 1 percent since 
the June Tealbook.  We expect prices to decrease at an annual rate of 
3½ percent in the second half of 2013 and to flatte n out thereafter.

 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Incoming data have led us to revise down our estimate of real GDP growth in the 
first half of the year by ½ percentage point to an annual rate of 1½ percent.1  Nonetheless, 
we continue to project that real GDP growth will pick up s ubstantially in the second half 
of the year as the drag from fiscal polic y wanes and consumer spending is boosted by 
recent gains in wealth and improved sentiment. 
 Since the June Tealbook, we have recei ved disappointing news on consumer 
outlays and residential investment; in re sponse, we have tamped our projection 
for spending in these cate gories in the second half of the year.  We also 
received negative readings  on net exports and invent ory investment, but we 
expect the contributions of these cat egories to rebound in the second half. 
 The growth rate of real PCE during the fi rst half of the year fell short of our 
expectation—2 percent at an annual rate versus our forecast of 2½ percent.  We 
have interpreted the more modest first- half spending growth as reflecting both 
a slightly faster adjustment by consumers to the tax increases put in place at the 
beginning of the year and a lower underl ying pace of consumer spending.  On 
balance, the downward revision to our forecast for PCE growth in 2013:H2 is 
about half as large as the downward revision to our estimate over 2013:H1. 
 We have revised down our projection for the growth rate of residential 
investment in the second half of 201 3 based partly on the two most recent 
readings on single-family housing starts, wh ich have been on the soft side of 
our expectations.  Nonetheless, we continue to see housing construction 
activity as trending up, as suggested by the steadier numbers on building 
permits. 
o We do not think the increase in mortgage rates since May was 
responsible for the disappointing June  starts figures.  That said, we do 
expect the higher level of mortgage rates in this projection to have a 
                                                 
1 On the second day of the July FOMC meeting, the BEA will release its advance estimate of real 
GDP growth in 2013:Q2, along with revised figures fo r earlier periods.  Importantly, this revision will 
expand the concept of investment to include expenditures on a wider array of intellectual property products.  
We have not attempted to take this new concept in to account in our current forecast of GDP.

 modest restraining effect on the grow th of residential investment over 
the second half.   
 While we were also surprised on th e downside by the incoming data on net 
exports and inventory investment, for these categories we have interpreted the 
negative first-half news as pointing to ward a more positiv e contribution to 
GDP growth (up ¼ percentage poi nt) in the second half.    
 The recent data have included some upbeat news on economic activity.  The 
level of nonfarm payroll employment in  June stands about 100,000 above our 
projection in the previo us Tealbook.  Motor vehicle sales moved up to an 
annual rate of 15.9 million units in J une—their highest reading since 2007—
and sales in July appear to be running at nearly this pace.  New orders of 
nondefense capital goods have increased not iceably over the past three months.  
In addition, factory output moved up in May and June after declining in the 
prior two months, and readings from the national and regional manufacturing 
surveys have improved, on balance, recently. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Over the medium term, our forecast for GDP growth is little revised from the June 
Tealbook.  We now expect real GDP to ri se 3¼ percent pace in 2014 and 3½ percent 
in 2015.  
 The higher trajectory for interest rates in the current projection is a modest restraint on consumer and business sp ending, which is offset by the upward 
revision to our assumed path for equity pr ices.  The effects of other changes to 
our key assumptions are also small and offsetting. 
 With no changes to our supply-side assumptions this round, the GDP gap is ½ percentage point wider than in our previous projection, largely due to the 
downward revisions to growth this year.

 THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
Despite the negative surprise to GDP growth  during the first half  of this year, the 
labor market appears to have firmed a bit more than we had anticipated in the June 
Tealbook. 
 In the payroll survey, employers in the nonfarm sector ar e now reported to 
have added an average of 200,000 jobs pe r month in the second quarter, about 
30,000 more per month than in our last pr ojection and similar to the pace seen 
since late last year. 
 In the household survey, the unemploymen t rate remained at 7.6 percent in 
June, a few basis points above our previ ous forecast, leaving the second quarter 
average at 7.5 percent, unrevised from our June Tealbook forecast. 
 The staff’s Labor Market Conditions I ndex, which summarizes the movements 
of 19 labor market indicators , rose further in June.   
 We project payroll gains of 180,000 per mont h in the second half of the year 
(15,000 more per month than in the previous projection), and we forecast the 
unemployment rate to edge down to 7.4 percent by 2013:Q4 (revised up 
0.1 percentage point). 
Over the medium term, the labor market is anticipated to gradually improve in 
line with the overall pace of economic activity.  
 With a somewhat wider output gap, the unemployment rate is projected to fall 
more gradually than in the June Teal book.  The rate is projected to reach 
7 percent by the middle of 2014 and to fa ll below the Committee’s threshold of 
6½ percent in the second quarter of 2015.  By the end of 2015, we now have 
the rate at 6 percent, ¼ pe rcentage point high er than in the previous forecast. 
 We expect total payroll gains to average 200,000 per month in 2014 and then 
to step up to a monthly pace of 250,000 in  2015, a bit lower than in the June 
Tealbook.

 THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Our forecast for inflation is little changed from the June Tealbook. 
 We estimate that the overall PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 
½ percent in the first half  of this year, held down by sharp declines in energy 
prices and unusually low core inflation.  We continue to think that the recent 
low readings on core PCE prices reflect, in part, transitory influences from 
nonmarket and medical pri ces (see the box “What Is behind the Surprisingly 
Low Rate of Inflation?”). 
 Since the June Tealbook, the data on core consumer prices have been just a 
little higher than we expected, leaving our projection fo r core inflation in the 
second half of the year a t ouch higher at 1½ percent.  
 Incoming data on consumer energy prices  have been slightly higher than 
expected, and the recent increase in cr ude oil prices suggests that consumer 
energy prices will move up noticeably in the third quarter.  Thereafter, energy 
prices are projected to decline, refl ecting the downward tilt in the path of 
futures prices for crude oil.  
 With core PCE inflation anticipated to  edge up over the medium term in 
response to rising resource ut ilization, total PCE inflation is projected to run at 
about 1¼ percent in 2014 and 1½ percent in 2015.  Thus, throughout the medium term, the PCE inflation projection remains below both the 
Committee’s long-run objective of 2 pe rcent and the threshold level of 
2½ percent.

 Potential  Effects  of the ACA  on Labor Markets 
As has been discussed  widely in  the media, the Affordable  Care Act (ACA)  contains  several 
provisions  that could affect the labor  market.  Our analysis—supplemented  by a set of 
special questions  that the Reserve Banks posed to their Beige Book  contacts  in late June  and 
early July—suggests  that the ACA is likely to have only small labor market  effects, a 
conclusion  also reached by the Congressional  Budget  Office and  other outside analysts.   
Thus, the Obama Administration’s  recent decision to delay the employer  requirement  to 
provide health insurance  to employees  by one year does  not materially  affect our  labor 
market outlook.1   
The most relevant provisions  of the ACA for the labor  market are the employer  and 
individual  mandates  and the expansion of  health insurance  subsidies.  The  employer  
mandate requires  firms with 50 or  more full‐time equivalent  (FTE) workers (where  “full‐
time” is defined as 30 hours or more per week)  to offer qualifying  health insurance to th eir 
full‐time employees  or else pay an annual  penalty of $2,000 per full‐time  worker; there is no 
requirement  or penalty for part‐time workers.   Firms who do offer insurance  but whose 
insurance  is deemed “unaffordable”  face annual penalties  of $3,000 for each full ‐time 
worker who turns down  that insurance  and enrolls in subsidized  health insurance  through 
the new exchanges.   These subsidies  are quite generous  but are only available  to individuals  
without access to affordable  employer ‐provided  insurance.2 
The ACA is unlikely to have sizable labor market effects  because—as  shown on  the table on 
the next page—almost all of  the firms subject to the employer  mandate already  offer health  
insurance  to their employees.   For example,  94 percent of firms with 50 to 200 employees  
offer health  insurance  (and the fraction offering health insurance  is even higher for larger 
firms), and  90 percent of employees  work for firms th at offer health  insurance.   To be sure, 
the ACA may still raise costs somewhat  for firms already  offering insurance,  as some of them 
may have to make their health insurance  more comprehensive,  more affordable,  or offer it 
to a larger share  of their employees  (although  most of the workers who are currently  
ineligible  for insurance are  part‐time workers who would  not have to be covered under the 
ACA, a small share  of them are full‐time workers who would  have to be covered).  In  
addition, the share of eligible employees  who accept  insurance  (the take ‐up rate) may 
increase somewhat as  a result of the individual  mandate.   For most firms, however,  the 
increase in  labor costs is likely to be small. 
The ACA could, in principle,  lead to an increase  in the share of part‐time workers in  the 
economy.  The exclusion of  part‐time employees  from the employer  mandate,  combined  
with the generosity  of the exch ange subsidies  (which are  available  only to those  without 
access to affordable  employer ‐provided  health insurance),  gives some firms the incentive  to 
shift from  full‐time to part‐time workers to avoid  penalties  and gives some low‐income  
                                                 
1 The employer  mandate  has been delayed until 2015, but other elements  of the ACA  will continue to be 
implemented  as originally  scheduled  on January 1, 2014.   
2 For families  with income below 400 percent of the poverty level, the subsidies  limit premium  costs to 
a share of income that ranges  between  2 and 9.5 percent (with the limits increasing  with income).

workers the  incentive  to switch  from full‐time to part‐time work (possibly  taking multiple 
part‐time jobs) to gain access to the  exchange  subsidies.  However,  any such shifts  are likely 
to occur only gradually  and would largely affect the composition  of the workforce—there  
would be more part‐time workers  but also more part‐time jobs—and,  given that the 
magnitude of  these shifts  is likely to be small, we do not see a reason  for aggrega te work 
hours to be affected  significantly.3  Accordingly, we  have not built any  material effect of the 
ACA (and its partially delayed implementation)  into the staff’s labor market forecast.  
The responses  to our Beige Book questions  also suggest that the labor market  effects of the 
ACA likely will be small.  Only a relatively  small share  of firms reported  that they plan to do  
one or more of the following:   make more use of part‐time workers (9  percent),  outsource 
more work (9 percent),  and refrain from hiring to keep under the 50 FTE threshold 
(6 percent).   Similarly,  a relatively small share  of firms reported  that they are planning  to 
make changes to their health insurance,  including  one or more of:  making their insurance  
more comprehensive (11  percent),  offering it to more employees  (6 percent),  and cutting 
back or dropping  coverage  (5 percent).   In their comments,  many firms expressed  concerns  
about the ACA’s administrative costs  as well as the possibility  that the ACA woul d eventually  
drive up the costs of health insurance.   A sizable number  of firms said they are likely to raise 
prices, reduce other employee benefits, or  both, to defray  some of the higher costs.  Finally,  
many firms reported that  they were still quite  uncertain about  the effects of the ACA on 
both their own bottom  line and that of their customers. 
 
                                                 
3 The ACA  also  could affect labor  force participation.   The generosity  of the exchange  subsidies  may 
allow  some of those who work only to get affordable  health insurance  to exit the labor force (for example,  
workers who would like to retire  but are too young for Medicare),  but it will also  induce some people to 
enter the labor force (like low‐income or disabled individuals  who currently  stay  out of the labor force in 
order to maintain eligibility  for public health insurance  programs).

 What Is behind the Surprisingly  Low Rate of Inflation?  
Readings on  PCE inflation have been quite  low recently.  Over the  12 months ending in 
June, headline  PCE prices are estimated  to have risen about 1¼ percent,  while core PCE 
prices are estimated  to have risen  only about 1 percent.   As can be seen in the lower ‐left 
figure, many  different measures  of underlying  inflation have moved down  over the  past 
year; however, the  decline in core PCE inflation has  been especially  noticeable.   In 
evaluating  how transitory  we should expect the recent low  PCE inflation to be,  we find it 
instructive to  compare recent inflation  performance  with our  earlier expectations.  
Following  the low readings on  core PCE inflation over  the second half of 2012, we 
projected  in January that core inflation would pick up in the first half of this year.  
However, as  shown in  the table on the next page, both total and core PCE inflation have  
come in lower than we projected.   Nevertheless,  we have not changed  our view that 
inflation will eventually  and gradually  move back up toward the Committee’s  2 percent 
goal, as we see this year’s lower‐ than‐expected  readings on  headline  and core inflation as 
being largely attributable to  a few factors  that we expect to  be transitory. 
First, the nonmarket  component  of PCE prices was much softer  in the first quarter than 
we expected  in January.  This  component  is erratic and  susceptible to significant  
revisions,  and, as a result, we  take very little forecasting  signal from recent readings.1  
Indeed, with the  most recent data,  nonmarket  prices now look to have increased  in the 
second quarter by about as much as we had projected  in the January Tealbook;  
nevertheless,  the average rate of increase over the  first half is still below  our January 
projection.   
 
   
 
  
                                                 
1 In its upcoming  comprehensive  revisions,  the BEA will bring  in new data that could result in 
historical  revisions to nonmarket  prices.  In addition, the BEA will adjust the methodology  used to 
compute  imputed financial services charges—an  important  component  of nonmarket  prices.

Market-based core PCE inflation rebounded in the first quarter by a bit more than we had 
expected but was subsequently held down by two factors that we had not anticipated. 
First, as shown in the lower-right figure on the previous page, a one-time decrease in 
Medicare reimbursements (related to the federal spending sequestration) temporarily 
led the PCE measure of medical services prices to drop sharply in April. In May and June, 
these prices appear to have returned to a more normal rate of increase. Second, prices 
of core imports, which we estimate to pass through fairly quickly into consumer goods 
prices, have been much softer over the first half of the year than we anticipated in 
January.
Finally, consumer energy prices, which are of course volatile, declined more rapidly over 
the first half than we projected. In all, headline PCE prices edged up at an annual rate of 
only ½ percent in the first half—well below what we projected in January.
As noted, the very soft readings on medical prices are probably already behind us, and 
nonmarket prices, while quite uncertain, also appear to be rising at a more typical rate. In 
the second half of this year, consumer energy prices are projected to edge up on net; we 
also expect core import prices to flatten out after having declined in the second quarter, 
although if this occurred, it would still leave them much softer than we had anticipated in 
January .2 Thus, as these specific influences holding down inflation in the first half recede, 
we project headline and core inflation to rise from their recent low rates to a pace of just 
under 1½ percent in the second half—a pace we think is more reflective of underlying 
conditions than are the especially low rates observed over the past 6 or 12 months.

 THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK   
 After the unemployment threshold is cr ossed, the federal funds rate is set 
according to the prescriptions of the iner tial Taylor (1999) rule, assuming that 
monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE in flation at 2 percent over the longer 
term.  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of  securities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, and the process of returning the SOMA 
portfolio to a normal size is e xpected to be completed by 2021. 
 Further increases in household and business confidence, diminishing 
uncertainty, and further improvements in credit availability  support real GDP 
growth of 3 percent in 2016.  Thereaft er, the pace of gains in real GDP 
gradually moves down toward the longer-run growth rate of potential output of 
2¼ percent, with the unemployment rate reaching its natural rate of 5¼ percent 
in late 2017.   
 Long-run inflation expectations are a ssumed to remain well anchored, and, 
with the margin of slack in labor a nd product markets diminishing, consumer 
price inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2017.  The nominal federal funds rate 
is projected to eventually  stabilize at around 4 per cent later in the decade.

with the staff's real-time translation of those data into hours worked. These were the latest available data at the time of
the September FOMC meeting.
  2. Calculated as the mean of the 2014:Q2 and 2014:Q3 projections.
  3. Projections of payrolls and hours worked include the effects of the benchmark revision to the payroll survey.
  4. Total hours worked are aggregate hours in the nonfarm business sector. Because that series is available only on a
quarterly basis, the August 2012 figures refer to the quarterly percent change and level in 2012:Q3. The percent changes
and levels in hours are at annual rates.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Real activity in the foreign economies continues to be subdued.  After a very 
weak first quarter, we estimate that total foreign GDP growth edged up  to a still- anemic 
2¼ percent in the second quarter.  This outcome was in line with our forecast in the June 
Tealbook, as moderately better  news in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) was 
offset by less promising developments in the emerging market economies (EMEs).  Output in the euro area appears to have finally bottomed out after six consecutive quarters of contraction, and growth in Japan likely put in another strong performance.  In 
contrast, Chinese GDP growth remained at its moderate  first-quarter pace, and indicators 
for other EMEs point to growth that continues to be well  below trend.  
Going forward, we anticipate that total foreign GDP growth will rise from 
2¾ percent this quarter to 3½ percent in 2015.  This recovery is supported by continued accommodative monetary policy, lessening drag from fiscal consolidation, some further 
reduction in financial stresses in Europe, and firming growth in the United States.  
Our forecast is  only a touch weaker than in the June Tealbook.  Part of this 
revision reflects our extrapolation of some of the recent  weakness in EME data .  In 
addition, we built in a slight drag from the tightening of financial conditions in recent 
months.  In particular, long- term interest rates ha ve increased  abroad, especially in the 
EMEs.   (See the box “Assessing Recent Developments in EME Asset Markets” in the 
Financial Developments section.)  However, in many countries we expect the negative effects of higher financing costs on growth to be somewhat  offset  by the positive effects  
of depreciated exchange rates.  
Our projection of a modest recovery in foreign growth  continues to face important 
risks .  Market reaction to the eventual normalization of advanced economy monetary 
policy could result in much greater financial dislocations and spillovers to global activity than the limited  effects  we currently assume.  In addition, the ongoing slowdown in the 
EMEs, particularly in China, could prove sharper and more deep -seated —a possibility we 
explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  And, as has been the case for some time, 
the situation in Europe could deteriorate, pushing that region back into recession and 
possibly destabilizing global financial markets .

  With output growth subdued, our outlook has inflation in the AFEs edging up 
from 1¼ percent in the current quarter to only 1½ percent in 2015 (excluding the effects 
of the Japanese consumption tax hikes).  EME inflation also remains generally contained 
over the forecast period.  In the near  term, we revised inflation in both regions up a little 
because of  the recent jump in oil prices and depreciation of foreign currencies .   
In this low- inflation environment, monetary policy in the AFEs is set to remain 
accommodative.  Indeed, the European Central Bank (ECB) issued forward guidance indicating that its rates would remain low for an “extended period,” and the Bank of England (BOE) stated that market expectations of early tightening were not justified  by 
economic developments.  In contrast, EME central banks have re frained from  a further 
loosening of monetary policy in the face of capital outflows and depreciation pressures, and some countries have tightened policy, intervened in foreign exchange markets, or 
reversed previous measures that restricted  capital in flows . 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China .  The release of second -quarter real GDP data and historical revisions 
have led to a smoother path for Chinese GDP over the past year, with growth 
stepping down from a roughly 8 percent pace in the second half of last year to 
a subtrend  7 percent pace in the first half of this year.  Going forward, we 
expect growth to r ecover  to almost 8 percent by early next year, supported by 
improving demand in the advanced economies.  Thereafter, o utput growth 
slows s lightly, in line with  the downward trend in potential output growth .   
 
We lowered our outlook for Chinese growth almost ¼ percentage point over 
the forecast  period, reflecting both the more subdued tone of the incoming 
data and our view that Chinese authorities will accept more moderate growth 
as they work to rebalance the economy toward consumption and reduce the risks of financial instability .  Indeed, the authorities have taken  further steps 
recently to curb credit growth, including an apparent crackdown by the People’s Bank of China on risky balance sheet practices of financial 
institutions (see the box “Recent Developments in China’s Interbank 
Market”) .

  • Other Emerging Asia .  We estimate that GDP growth in the rest of emerging 
Asia stepped up to a still-subdued 3 percent annual pace in the second quarter 
from 1½  percent in the first .  This acceleration primarily reflect s a return to 
positive growth in the economies of Malays ia, Taiwan, and Thailand, all of 
which had unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter amid weak demand 
from the advanced economies and China.  GDP growth in the region should 
rise to 4½ percent by 2015 as external demand picks up.  However, we 
marked down growth ¼ percentage point in the second half of this year and 
next year , because of  weaker  data, spillovers from China, and  the recent 
tightening of financial conditions .   
 
• Latin America .  We estimate GDP growth in Mexico  held steady  at 
1¾ percent  in the second  quarter , well below its trend rate .  This pace is about 
½ percentage point below our previous Tealbook forecast, as industrial 
production fell , on balance, through May and consumer confidence dropped 
sharply.  Going forward, we call for Mexican growth to pick up to 3¾ percent 
by 2014 and to stay at that rate in 2015, a little less than projected in June, 
owing to a downward revision to the outlook for U.S. manufacturing activity .    
 
We estimate that GDP in Brazil rose 2½ percent in the second quarter, ¼ percentage point be low that projected in the June Tealbook.  This revision 
reflects not only weaker- than-expected data, but also increased political 
tension following a recent wave of street protests that have sh aken business 
confidence and a mplified  the financial stresses already hitting Brazil .  
Moreover, the inflationary pressures resulting from the substantial recent currency depreciation and the desire to damp capital outflows prompted the central bank of Brazil to further tighten monetary policy.  These factors  have 
led us to revise down GDP growth for the second half of this year and 2014 by ¼ percentage point.  However, we expect growth to pick up from its  
below-trend pace, rising to about 3¾ percent in 2015, supported by recovery 
in the advanced economies and the boost to exports that should result from the 
recent decline of the real .

 Recent Developments  in China’s Interbank  Market 
In June, interbank  interest rates surged to record  highs in China.  The overnight 
Shanghai  Interbank  Offered Rate (SHIBOR)  moved up from around 4 percent at 
the end of May to a peak  of 13 percent  on June 20 (see left‐hand figure on the 
next page).  SHIBOR  remained  elevated  for several  days until  the People’s  Bank 
of China (PBOC) issued a statement on  June 25 that it had injected liquidity and 
was committed  to stabilizing  money markets.  Subsequently,  SHIBOR gradually  
moved lower and  is currently  close to typical  levels.  Interbank  repo rates have 
moved in a similar fashion.  
China’s interbank  market has grown sign ificantly over the  past few years,  and 
brief liquidity squeezes  driven by seasonal  or temporary  factors have occurred  
periodically.   Indeed, part of  the recent rate increase can  be attributed  to such 
factors, including  high demand for cash ahead of the Dragon  Boat festival 
holiday.   
What makes  the recent episode unusual was the magnitude of  the jump in 
interest rates and its duration,  which is generally  believed  to at leas t partially  
reflect a conscious  decision by the PBOC to limit its response.   In the past, the 
PBOC had always injected  liquidity when there was  upward pressure  on money 
market rates,  and, as a con sequence,  the SHIBOR  rate had never reached  double‐
digit levels.  But  in this most recent episode,  the PBOC appears to have delayed 
its usual response  to the surge  in rates, likely  in order to signal  that it is serious 
about encouraging  better liquidity management,  promoting  sounder banking 
practices  more generally,  and restraining  excessive  credit growth—including,  as 
will be discussed  below, in the “shadow banking”  sector.     
As shown in  the right‐hand figure on the next page, total credit to China’s  
nonfinancial  private sector ballooned  from 120 percent of GDP in 2008 to about  
175 percent of GDP in 2012, with much of  the growth occurring  thro ugh lending   
channels that are less regulated  than traditional,  deposit‐funded bank credit.  
Such shadow banking includes lending via trust companies,  corporate bond  
issuance by  financing  intermediaries,  off‐balance‐ sheet bank  loans, and  curbside  
lending.  This lending is often funded by wealth management  products  (WMPs),  
which are typically off‐balance‐sheet instruments  offering investors  higher 
returns than are permitted  on bank deposits.   Estimates  of the total size of the 
shadow banking sector vary widely, but,  based on the Bank for International  
Settlements  data on nonbank  credit shown in  the figure, it  has reached about 
35 percent of  annual GDP.   
WMPs typically have relatively  short maturities  but are used to fund illiquid 
longer‐term assets.  When  large amounts  of WMPs are due, as at the end of the

 second quarter, this  situation  can create  temporary  demand for liquidity.1  In 
addition, recent efforts by authorities  to restrain the issuance  of new WMPs may 
have further exacerbated  some banks’ funding  needs.  By refusing to inject 
liquidity immediately  into the interbank  market when rates  soared, Chinese 
authorities  likely hoped to provide stronger  incentives  for banks  to better  
manage their liquidity risk.   This shot across the  bow could also encourage more 
prudent credit  decisions.  
Given its short‐ lived nature, the interbank  liquidity squeeze should not, by itself, 
significantly  weigh on the Chinese economy  going forward.   However,  the 
episode highlights  some of the risks to economic  activity and financial stability 
posed by rapid and  poorly regulated  credit growth, including  channeling  credit 
toward unpro ductive projects, promoting  underutilized  infrastructure and  
overcapacity  in some manufacturing  sectors, spurring excessive  development  
and inflated prices in the real estate  sector, and  undermining  the strength  and 
resiliency  of domestic  financial institutions.      
At present,  we do not believe that a major eruption  of financial difficulties is the 
most likely outcome.   First, Chinese authorities  appear to be taking serious steps 
to rein in the shadow banking sector before problems  become unmanageable.   
Second, the government  has ample resources  to shore up  the banking sector, 
should that become necessary.   Moreover,  China’s still‐ rapid pace of economic  
growth shoul d, over the  longer term, generate the demand  needed to absorb  
much of the expansion  of capacity financed  by the credit boom.  But in an 
environment  of mounting  indebtedness combined  with slowing  economic  
growth, the risks of severe financial problems  and a more abrupt and prolonged  
slowing of economic  activity certainly  exist, and we will continue  to monitor  the 
situation closely.   
 
                                                 
1 The temporary  demand for liquidity is likely exacerbated  by the relative inefficiency  with 
which the interbank  market in China recycles funds, so that institutions  with ample funds  may 
not lend them to institutions  having difficulty financing  WMP  withdrawals.    0  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16

 ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
•Euro area.  We now estimate that the euro area economy finally bottomed out
in the second  quarter .  This estimate is a touch better than projected in  the
June Tealbook, reflecting stronger industrial production, a modest increase in
retail sales, and rising consumer confidence.   Despite the second -quarter
improvement, we tempered the strength of the recovery a bit in response toslightly tighter financial conditions, partly reflecting political tensions in someperipheral countries.   All told, we continue to expect a sluggish recovery,
with GDP growth of less than ½ percent in the second half, 1 percent in 2014,
and just 2 percent in 2015, as financial stresses abate and the drag from fiscalconsolidation lessens.
At
 its July meeting, in response to the increase in long-term yields over the 
previous several weeks, the ECB stated that it “expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.”
1  In 
line with this guidance, we expect the ECB to keep rates on hold until late 2015.   
•Un
ited Kingdom .  Surprisingly strong activity in the services sector  led us to
revise up our estimate of second -quarter U.K. GDP  growth by almost
1½ percentage points to 2½ percent.  This g reater momentum should help
keep growth  at about 2 percent over the rest of the year, somewhat faster than
previously expected .  Growth should then move back up to 2½ percent in
2015, supported by continued accommodative monetary policy, diminishedfiscal drag, and euro -area recovery .  We do not expect the B OE to expand its
asset purchase program further , but instead to provide forward guidance to
reinforce its accommodative stance, possibly  mak ing use of thresholds in its
communications.
•Japan .  Recen
t indicators have been better than we had expected :  Industrial
production soared in May, and the Tankan survey showed a broad -based

  improvement in corporate sentiment.  W e now estimate that GDP rose at a 
3¾ percent pace in the second quarter, ½ percentage point faster than in  the 
June Tealbook forecast , and we expect it to  expand at a solid 3 percent rate in 
the second hal f of the year .  However, we continue to expect growth to slow 
markedly to an average pace of 1 percent  in 2014 and 2015 despite aggressive 
easing on the par t of the Bank of Japan ( BOJ), largely owing to fiscal 
consolidation efforts.  Data through May point to a ½ percent increase in 
consumer prices in the second quarter, a bit more  than we had expected in 
June.  With  the BOJ maintaining its a sset purchase program  through the end 
of 2015, inflation (excluding the effects of consumption tax hikes) should rise  
to 1¼ percent by the end of the forecast period. 
 
• Canada.  Although recent data have been relatively strong, the impact of flooding in Alberta and Toronto in June is expected to hold second- quarter 
GDP growth to 1¾ percent , a little  below the June Tealbook estimate.  W e 
expect growth to rebound in the current quarter and to average about 2½ percent over the rest of the forecast.  Surprising weakness in core prices 
held consumer prices flat in the second quarter, but we expect inflation to bounce back to 1¾ percent in the third quarter and to edge up to 2 percent by the end of 2015.

Financial Developments  
Financial markets were volatile over the intermeeting period, with interest rates 
and stock prices moving up on net.  Investors reportedly read the balance of Federal 
Reserve communications as suggesting a less accommodative stance for policy going 
forward than they had previously anticipated.  Market participants’ perception  of a tighter 
policy outlook was reinforced by incoming economic data —particularly the June 
employment report—that were seen as pointing to further improvement in labor market conditions.  All told , longer -term interest rates moved up appreciably, on net, over the 
period.  Despite the rise in rates, equity prices also moved higher, evidently buoyed by 
investors’ more optimistic assessment of the economic outlook.  P rice movements in a 
number of fixed- income markets  were reportedly amplified over the period by an 
unwinding of carry trades and related del everaging  and other technical factors.  
On balance, yields on intermediate- and longer- term Treasury securities rose  
21 to 34 basis points, with staff models attributing most of the increases to a rise in term premiums and the remainder to  an upward revision in the expected path of short- term 
rates.  Market -based measures of inflation compensation moved up modestly .  Yields on 
speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed , leaving their risk spreads 
narrower .  In contrast, yields on agency MBS advanced  slightly more than those on 
Treasury securities with comparable duration.   In the advanced foreign economies, 
increases in sovereign yields were smaller than those on Treasury securities , reflecting in 
part forward guidance and other statements by  the ECB  and the Bank of England that 
were read as affirming their accommodative policies.  On net over the period, the dollar 
generally appreciated against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies and was little changed against emerging market cur rencies.  
Financing flows to businesses and households were mixed.  Issuance of 
syndicated loans, which carry floating rates, remained sizable, although bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations declined markedly in June, as the higher interest rates made refinancing less attractive.  Similarly, the pace of mortgage purchase applications held 
about steady,  while the volume of refinancing applications fell sharply over the 
intermeeting period as home mortgage rates rose.  Consumer credit continued to expand 
in May at a solid pace.  Core bank loans to households and businesses continued to grow 
modestly in the second quarter.  In the July 2013 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on

  Bank Lending Practices  (SLOOS), moderate net fractions of banks generally report ed a 
further easing of lending policies and an increase in demand across most loan categories 
in the second quarter.  Bond mutual funds experienced substantial redemptions in June and some continued outflows in July, with part of the proceeds reportedly be ing 
reallocated into M2, which accelerated over these two months. 
TREASURY YIELDS , POLICY EXPECTATIONS , AND AGENCY MBS  YIELDS  
Longer -term Treasury  yields rose significantly, on net, over the intermeeting 
period.1  The largest increases occurred following t he release of the June FOMC 
statement , the results of the Summary of Economic Projections, and  the Chairman’s 
accompanying press conference, all of which  were seen as suggesting a less 
accommodative stance of monetary policy  going forward and  appeared to contribute to 
increased uncertainty about the level of interest rates .  The better -than-anticipated  June 
employment report also contributed to the rise in longer- term yields .  Large portions of 
the rate increases early in the period were  subsequently retraced following  additional 
communications that were read as reaffirming the Federal Reserve’s  commitment to a 
highly accommodative policy stance for the foreseeable future .  Overall , uncertainty 
about future short- and long- term interest rates  remained elevated  compared with their 
levels recorded around the time of the May FOMC meeting . 
Five-, 10- , and 30-year Treasury yields rose 26 basis points, 34 basis points, and 
21 basis points, respectively, over the period.  Increases in intermediate-horizon forw ard 
rates were notably larger than those in longer-horizon forward rates, cons istent with an 
outlook for more- rapid increases in the federal funds rate after liftoff.  Market 
participants noted that many  market forces  may have contributed to the magnitude and 
speed of price moves, as investors apparently continued to pull back from strategies predicated on an environment of low rates and low volatility.  These forces included an unwinding of carry trades, outflows from long-duration bond funds, MBS convexity-hedging flows , and diminished liquidity in some markets .  The diminished liquidity 
reportedly reflected  in part a reduction in the willingness of dealers to purchase positions 
from clients with the expectation of subsequently working these into the relevant market.   
Staff term structure models suggest that a rise  in term premiums accounts for about  
two-thirds of the increase in the 10- year Treasury yield, consistent with higher interest

  rate uncertainty , perhaps some modest downward revisions to LSAP expectations, and 
the effects of the pronounced market dynamics just described .   
The federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of financial market quotes 
steepened significantly early in the period  and then mostly retraced, largely in response to 
policy makers’  communications.2  On net, the expected policy rate path implied by 
overnight index swaps at the end of 2016 wa s up 22 basis points.  However, this standard 
measure does not incorporate an adjustment for term premiums.  A s taff term structure 
model that accounts for the zero lower bound on nominal yields attributes about half of 
the increase in the overnight index swap curve to higher term premiums , implying only a 
modest rise in the expected path of the federal funds rate.  H eightened policy rate 
uncertainty likely contributed to the rise in term premiums . 
The results from the Open Market Desk’s July Survey of Primary Dealers showed 
little change in the projected liftoff date for the federal funds rate relative to the June survey.
3  The median expect ation  of the most likely time of the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate remained in the third quarter of 2015, at which point the unemployment rate is projected to be 6.3 percent according to the median deale r, lower than the 
6.5 percent threshold announced in the December  FOMC statement.  The projected 
federal funds rate path was  little changed, perhaps pointing to a small increase in the pace 
of tightening after the first funds rate increase.  The median estimate of the aggregate size of the current asset purchase program was lowered slightly relative to the June survey.
4  
In a special question, dealers were asked to rate the importance of a range of factors that  
potentially  contribut ed to the recent increase in the expected policy path extracted from 
financial market quotes.  Dealers rated “higher uncertainty around path of policy rates” and “change in perception of FOMC’s view of appropriate asset purchase path” as important factors driving changes in the expected policy path over the intermeeting period.  Dealers also pointed to an improved economic outlook and perceptions of 
                                                 
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basis points  over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard  deviation averaging about 6 basis points.  
3 Following the June FOMC meeting, primary dealers were asked to update their expectation for 
the timing of the first federal funds target rate increase.  Their median expectation for liftoff moved in one 
quarter relative to the June survey; however, in the current survey, the median shifted back to about the same date as reported i n the June survey.  
4 Following the June FOMC meeting, primary dealers were asked to update their expectation for 
asset purchases.  Their median expectation for the aggregate size of the current purchase program  declined 
slightly relative to the June survey and remained about unchanged in the current survey.

  changes in the FOMC’s view of the appropriate path of policy rates  as contributing to the 
revision in policy expectations over the period.  
Measures of inflation compensation derived from TIPS increased  modestly, on 
net, reversing declines  posted early in the period that likely reflected , at least in part , 
reduced liquidity in the market.  Inflation compensation derived from inflation  swap s was 
similarly somewhat higher on balance.  Consistent with th ese developments, the risk-
neutral distribution of inflation calculated from inflatio n caps shifted  slightly  to the right 
at both the 5- and 10-year horizons.  Survey- based measures of longer -term inflation 
expectations remained in recent ranges . 
Yields on agency MBS rose slightly more than those on Treasury securities  with 
comparable duration  over the intermeeting period.  The option- adjusted spread  for 
production-coupon MBS widened by 11 basis points, possibly reflecting a downward 
revision in the market’s expectation for Federal Reserve MBS purchases , an increase in 
uncertainty about longer- term interest rates,  and convexity- related MBS selling.   On net, 
30-year conforming mortgage rates rose about in line with MBS yields and ended the 
period about 40 basis points higher at 4¼ percent.  
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Since the June FOMC meeting, the Treasury  Department  auctioned $200 billion 
in nominal securities and $22 billion in  TIPS.  B id-to-cover ratios were generally below 
historical average level s.  The Treasury continued to operate under a “ debt issuance 
suspension period” declared by Treasury Secretary Lew on May 19, which allows the 
Treasury to use accounting measures to remain under the debt limit while issuing new securities .
5  Staff projections suggest that these measures  should allow federal debt  to 
stay below the statutory debt ceiling at least until late September .  
The Desk con ducted outright purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS as 
planned.6  While the purchases did not seem to have material  adverse effect s on the 
                                                 
5 The accounting measures available to the Treasury include suspending daily reinvestment of the 
Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Invest ment Fund, redeeming existing investments 
and suspending new investment in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, and suspending the 
daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilizatio n Fund into Treasury s ecurities.  
6 Over the intermeeting  period, the Desk purchased $46 billion  in Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program.   In addition, the Desk purchased $ 79 billion  in agency MBS under 
the flow -based MBS program and the reinvestment program.

  functioning of either the Treasury or MBS markets, liquidity in these markets , 
particularly in agency MBS, reportedly deteriorated somewhat  during the intermeeting 
period amid heightened volatility —especially  in the days following  the June FOMC 
meeting.   Bid–asked  spreads  for some  Treasury securities  edged up a bit initially but then 
retraced, while average MBS trade sizes declined  somewhat  throughout the period.  The 
offer -to-cover ratio on Desk purchases of Treasury securities at longer maturities 
remained somewhat below its average recorded since the beginning of the year, and the 
spread between the execut ed and the second -most-favorable pr ice offered in MBS 
operations—a measure of liquidity —widened.   That said , fails-to-deliver in both the 
Treasury and MBS markets  generally  remained  relatively low, and dollar-roll- implied 
financing rates for 30 -year Fannie Mae 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent coupon securities 
suggested little settlement pressure in the TBA market for these securities .  In light of the 
latter, the Desk’s dollar roll activity in the June and July settlement cycle s diminished 
somewhat compared with earlier in the year . 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
Despite the volatility in longer- term fixed -income markets, conditions in short-
term dollar funding markets remained fairly benign throughout the intermeeting period.  
The spread between three-month LIBOR and comparable- maturity OIS rates and the 
spread between the three -month forward rate agreement three months ahead and the 
corresponding forward OIS rate were both about unchanged on balance.   
In secured funding markets, Treasury general collateral finance (GCF) repo rates 
declined , on net, over the intermeeting period, in part because of a reduction in net 
Treasury securities issuance.  The reduction in issuance, in turn, primarily reflected  
limited funding needs as a result of a $59 billion dividend payment from Fannie Mae in June.
7  MBS GCF repo rates moved down in  line with the decr ease in Treasury GCF repo 
rates.   Haircuts on repo contracts for OMO- eligible collateral remained unchanged, 
though they increased slightly for ABS collateral.  
In commercial paper (CP) markets, interest rates on unsecured CP for U.S. 
financial issuers increased somewhat but stay ed at the low end of the range seen over the 
past several years , while the amount outstanding edged down.  Consistent with the trends 
                                                 
7 In addition to its regular quarterly payment to the Treasury, Fannie Mae’s dividend on June 28, 
2013, included a one -time transfer of $51 billion , which  was the result of a change in the accounting 
treatment for  Fannie  Mae’s deferred tax asset .

  in the unsecured CP market, outstanding asset- backed commercial paper for program s 
with both U.S. and European sponsors decreased, on net, while rates were little changed. 
Stock prices of large domestic b anks followed the broad trend in the S&P 500, 
declining a bit after the June FOMC meeting  but later reversing , and ended the period 
about 7 percent higher.   In contrast, equity prices of agency mortgage  REITs continued 
their recent declines.  Follow ing tre nds in broad credit indexes, CDS spreads for the 
largest bank holding companies edged down, on net, and  they remained near the bottom 
of their ranges over the past five years.  
All of the  largest banks reported second- quarter earnings that were above 
analysts’ expectations.  Higher -than-expected earnings were driven primarily by 
increased revenues in investment banking activities and asset management operations, 
cost-reduction efforts, and improving loan performance that allowed for further 
reductions in loss provisions .  Net interest margins remained flat to slightly down at most 
banks.  Meanwhile, some of the largest U.S. banking institutions stepped up dividend payouts and share repurchases. 
OTHER DOMESTIC ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Despite the rise in longer -term interest rates, b road U.S. equity price indexes rose  
3 percent,  on net, over the intermeeting period, apparently boosted by  an upward revision 
in market participants’ outlook for the economy.  The staff’s estimate of the spread 
between the expected real equity return for the S&P 500 index and the real 10- year 
Treasury yield —a gauge of the equity premium —narrowed further.   Although the 
estimated level of the equity premium remains above its historical norm, it has receded substantially —by nearly 2 00 basis points—since the turn of the year.  The VIX, an 
options- based index of volatility on one-month returns on the S&P 500 index, increased 
notably early in the intermeeting period but subsequently fell back  to its lowest level in 
several months.   
To date, a little less than one-half of the nonfinan cial firms in the S&P 500 have 
posted earnings results for the second quarter.  Those reports, together with Wall Street analyst forecasts for firms that have yet to report, suggest that aggregate earnings per 
share were about flat relative to the level seen four quarters earlier.  Many firms 
attributed weakness in profit growth to sluggish economic conditions abroad and the 
relative strength of the U.S. dollar, as those conditions held down profits from fore ign

  operations.  Despite the lackluster growth in profits, the level of profitability —for 
instance, as measured by th e ratio of profits  to sales —remained high , in aggregate. 
Early in the period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds 
rose significantly.  Amid the associated capital losses for investors, bond mutual funds 
and bond exchange-traded funds experienced very heavy net redemptions in June.  
Outflows from both types of funds slowed in early July but remained sizable.  Liquidity 
in the secondary market for corporate bonds appeared to deteriorate early in the intermeeting period but recovered more recently.  For the period as a whole, yields on investment-grade bonds moved about in line with Treasury yields.  However, yields on speculative- grade bonds were little ch anged, on net, with their risk spreads narrowing 
noticeably .   
Available indicators suggest that the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations 
continued to be solid  on the whole.  Readings on the six-month trailing bond default rate 
and the KMV expected year -ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms both remained low 
by historical standards.   The volume of nonfinancial corporate bonds that were upgraded 
by Moo dy’s Investor s Service in the second quarter was roughly matched by the volume 
of downgrades, leaving little net imprint on the overall distribution of ratings.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
The increase in U.S. yields prompted 10-year sovereign yields in the advanced 
foreign economies to rise, as investors apparently shifted toward U.S. securities in the 
wake of  the June FOMC statement and the better -than-expected U .S. employment  report.  
However, benchmark sovereign yields and longer -dated OIS rate s in the euro area and  the 
United Kingdom fell back some after the ECB provided forward guidance that it will 
keep policy rates low for an extended period of time and after the Bank of England stated that the market -implied rise in the expected future path of its policy rate w as not 
warranted by recent developments in the domestic economy.  On net, 10- year sovereign 
yields in Germany were little changed, and U.K. yields rose 18 basis points, in part 
because of  the release of strong er-than-expected  U.K. service -sector data during the 
period.  Japanese government bond yields were fairly stable over the period after experiencing substantial volatility in May.  
The staff's broad nominal dollar index has risen about ¾ percent since the June 
FOMC  meeting .  The dolla r appreciated 2¼ percent against the currencies of the

  advanced foreign economies, consistent with the larger increase in U.S. interest rates than 
in foreign rates over the period.  Emerging market economy (EME) currencies  generally  
depreciated following the June FOMC communications and again after the release of the 
June employment report , but they subsequently recovered somewhat in response to 
statements from FOMC officials , which lessened concerns about near -term polic y 
tightening .  The Mexican peso rebounded particularly robustly, ending the period up 
about 3 percent.  In contrast, weak macroeconomic data, along with political tensions and 
social unrest , weighed on the Brazilian real, which depreciated 2¼ percent , on net, 
against t he dollar despite official foreign exchange intervention to support the currency. 
Foreign equity prices mirrored those in the United States, declining after the June 
FOMC meeting but rebounding later.  Euro -area stock prices increased  slightly , on 
balance, but the Nikkei index rose 13½ percent, reflecting better -than-expected data on 
industrial production and business sentiment in  Japan .  Equity prices were up in most 
EMEs, with the prominent exception of China.  Chinese equity prices declined  
5¼ percent as investors exhibited concern over further signs that the economy  was 
slowing and over recent volatility in Chinese interbank funding markets (see the box 
“Recent Developments in China’s Interbank Market” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).  Outflows from emerging market equity and bond 
funds were particularly rapid in late June but moderated in July (see the box “ Assessing 
Recent Developments in EME Asset Markets ”).  In response to inflationary pressures that 
may have  been exacerbated by currency depreciation  in May and June, the central banks 
of Brazil , India, Indonesia, and Turkey tightened monetary policy . 
Peripheral sovereign spreads over German bunds rose early in  the intermeeting 
period but ended the period little changed.  Political uncertainty in Portugal increased in 
early July but subsided as the prime minister staved off early elections.  Euro -area leaders 
conditionally approved the next tranche of aid for Greece, but political uncertainty remained high as one of the political parties withdrew from the governing coalition.   S&P 
downgraded Italian sovereign debt to BBB from BBB+ over the intermeeting period, but 
this announcement had little effect on market prices. 
Foreign private investors made sizable net sal es of Treasury and agency securities 
in May and moderate net sales of U.S. equities, while U.S. investors continued to make 
substantial purchases of foreign assets.  Foreign official purchases of U.S. securities recovered in May following sales in April.  However, data on custody holdings at the

 Assessing  Recent Developments  in EME Asset  Markets  
 
Foreign interest rates  have increased  substantially  since the May  FOMC meeting (that is, two 
meetings  ago), rising along with U.S.  Treasury  yields, as  can be seen  in the upper‐ left figure on the 
next page.  Emerging  market yields have  increased  even more than rates in the United States and 
other advanced  economies.   In addition,  emerging  market equity prices have declined  almost 
3 percent  on net over the  same period amid large outflows  from mutual funds investing  in equities 
and bonds of the emerging  market economies  (EMEs) (upper‐ right figure),  and EME currencies  have 
depreciated  over 3 percent  against the dollar on  average.1 
To be sure, it is not surprising  to see foreign yields rise  in response  to an increase in  U.S. yields as 
investors  rebalance their  portfolios  toward U.S. assets.  These reallocations  also likely contributed  to 
declines in foreign equity prices and depreciation  of some foreign currencies  against the dollar.  In  
addition, prospects  of tighter monetary  policies in response  to capital  outflows  and the inflationary  
pressures  created by depreciating  currencies  may have boosted yields.  Furthermore,  increased  
market uncertainty  about the future path of U.S. interest rates, reflected  in higher implied volatilities  
in U.S. and foreign markets, may  have added to global  term premiums.    
At this juncture,  however,  emerging  markets may have been particularly  sensitive  to the combination  
of rising rates in the advanced  economies  and increasing  volatility.   Over the  past several years,  low 
and stable interest rates in the advanced  economies  prompted  some investors  to seek higher returns 
via EME “carry trades”—investments  in EME debt funded by borrowing  in the advanced  
economies—which  are highly sensitive  to both narrowing  interest rate differentials  and increased  
market volatility.   Furthermore, although  EME macroeconomic  and financial policies have improved  
considerably  in recent years, these countries  still tend  to have lower credit ratings than the major 
advanced  economies, and  lower‐rated assets tend to be affected  more heavily by any pullback from 
risk.  Finally, the recent run‐up in U.S. rates occurred  as macroeconomic  indicators  showed growth to 
be slowing in many EMEs, and this likely also decreased  the attractiveness  of EME investments.   
How much of the turbulence in  emerging  markets over the past several months represents  a typical 
reaction to movements  in U.S. financial markets and how much appears  to reflect  the specific 
circumstances  of this period?  To address this  question,  we estimated  a model relating  changes in 
EME sovereign  yields, exchange  rates, and  equity prices to a set of U.S. financial market variables,  as 
well as global commodity  prices, estimated  over the  period from the end of 2001 to mid‐ 2012.2  As can 
be seen in the lower‐left  figure on the next page, EME yields declined  more than our empirical model 
predicts through early this year, as interest rates and interest‐rate  volatility in advanced  economies  
remained  quite low and capital flows to EMEs surged.  The subsequent  sharp reversal in  EME yields in 
May and June was also more than our empirical model predicts.  Similarly,  the dollar fell a bit  more 
against EME currencies  than the empirical model predicts  before the May FOMC meeting (lower‐
middle figure) and then rebounded  more strongly thereafter.   And the recent decline in EME equity 
prices (lower‐right figure)  is also unusual;  ordinarily,  as indicated  by the prediction from  our empirical 
model, EME  equity prices move fairly closely with U.S.  equity prices, but stock  prices in EMEs started 
moving down early this year and  then plunged after April.

2 The U.S. financial variables  included in the model are the 10‐year Treasury yield, the implied‐volatility index 
(VIX), the return  of the S&P  500 index, and the yield spread of BBB‐ rated corporate  bonds over Treasury securities.

In sum, some  EME asset price increases  through the early part of this year appear  to have been 
outsized,  likely fueled in part, as discussed above,  by carry trades predicated  not only on low 
interest rates but also on an abnormally  low level of market volatility.   Perhaps as a result,  the 
recent rise in U.S. interest rates and associated  increase in  volatility  appears to have depressed  EME 
financial markets to an unusual  degree.  The slowing  of EME economic  growth also appears to have 
played a role, leading stock prices in EMEs to turn down well before  they did in the advanced 
economies  and likely exacerbating  the weakness of  EME asset prices more generally  since May.    
Although  EME asset prices have recovered  slightly and the pace of outflows  has slowed in July, 
questions  remain regarding  how EME financial markets will react going  forward to the  eventual  
normalization  of interest rates and monetary  policies in advanced  economies.  We  cannot rule out 
the possibility that  further increases  in U.S. interest rates will again exert  outsized  effects on EMEs.  
However, it  is possible that at least some of the positioning  that relied, perhaps excessively, on  low 
and stable U.S. interest rates has been reduced,  and this could  lessen the reaction that might  occur 
when U.S.  yields rise  further.

  Federal Reserve Bank of New York suggest that foreign official investors sold U.S. 
assets again in June, as some EMEs  may have used the proceeds to fund intervention 
efforts to support their currencies. 
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses were mixed over the intermeeting period.  
Reflecting the reduced  incentive to refinanc e as longer -term interest rates rose, the pace 
of gross issuance of investment- and speculative-grade bonds dropped in June.  By 
contrast, the net issuance of CP  remained positive.  Corporate leveraged loan issuance 
continued to be robust, as the demand for these floating- rate instruments among investors 
stayed strong. 
Turning to equity finance, gross issuance b y nonfinancial firms maintained its 
recent strength in June, boosted by robust initial public offerings and a surge in the 
volume of secondary equity offerings.  Largely owing to completion of a few large deals, 
the volume of cash- financed mergers edged up  some in the second quarter, but overall 
activity remain ed sluggish by historical standards.  Announcements of share repurchase 
programs in the second quarter suggest ed that equity retirement by nonfinancial 
corporations is likely to continue at a brisk pa ce.  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) continued to recover 
slowl y.  CRE lending at commercial banks moved up again in the second quarter, and 
responses to the July SLOOS indicated that lending standards for CRE loans eased 
somewhat ove r the past three months, with demand picking up.  Commercial property 
vacancy and delinquency rates, although still elevated, declined further.  Moreover, 
liquidity conditions in the commercial property market continued to improve, with increased sales, shorter durations on the market, and smaller gaps between asking and sales prices.   In addition, CMBS issuance remained strong despite widening spreads that 
were apparently associated with the heightened volatility in fixed -income markets  during 
the period.   
Yields on 20- year general obligation municipal b onds rose sharply over the 
intermeeting period, about matching the increase in yields on Treasury securities.  Nevertheless, g ross issuance of long- term municipal bonds remained solid in June and 
was split roughly evenly between  refunding and new- capital issuance.   However, net 
issuance of long-term bonds became deeply negative,  reflecting outsized bond

  retirements by state and local governments.   Meanwhile, although rating downgrades of 
municipal bonds by Moody’s continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the first 
quarter, higher- frequency data on ratings changes suggested  that this trend is likely to 
have be en reversed in the second quarter amid some easing of state and local budget 
pressures . 
Over the intermeeting period, the City of Detroit filed fo r bankruptcy, with about 
$18 billion of debt reportedly being affected.  The filing was widely anticipated by market participants , and the broad  market rea ction was muted.  Longer -tenor municipal 
bond yields  across states with a variety of credit ratings trad ed 5 to 10 basis points higher 
in the days following the announcement.  CDS spreads on the state of Michigan were little changed  over the period, as were the spreads on the MCDX, which is a broad CDS 
index of municipal obligations.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Financing conditions in the household sector continued to improve in recent 
months.  Although the increase in mortgage rates will likely weigh somewhat on the housing sector going forward, most factors affecting this sector still remained favorable 
over the intermeeting period.  Mortgage purchase applications held about steady, even as 
refinancing applications fell off sharply with the rise in mortgage rates.  New delinquencies on mortgages continued to hover near their historical lows, in part due to the tight underwriting standards for new mortgages that have prevailed over the past several years.  National house price indexes increased between 5 and 12 percent year over year for the period ending in Ma y.  The price increases were broad based, with 
almost all areas  of the country experiencing positive gains over the past year.  
In the July SLOOS, a moderate net fraction of banks reported having eased 
standards on prime residential mortgage loans over the second quarter , and a large 
fraction indicated that they had experienced increased demand for new originations of 
such loans.
8  Mode st net fractions of respondents also eased standards and terms on home 
equity lines of credit.  That said, responses to special questions on the July survey 
indicated that standards on all types of residential real estate loans remained tighter than

  the midpoints of the wide  range  those standards have occupied since 2005—and, in some 
cases, tighter  than the y were at this time last year.  
Consumer credit continued to expand at a solid pace in May, driven by sustain ed 
growth in  student loans origina ted by the federal government  and in auto loans.  
Although revolving credit balances stepped up in May, the year-over- year increase 
continued to be quite small.  Interest rates on credit card mail offers remained close to 
their historical highs, while interest rates on auto loans generally stay ed flat at low levels  
in recent weeks  despite the appreciable increase in Treasury yields.   Consumer credit 
delinquency rates, with the exception of those on student loans, continued to decline in 
recent months.  Consumer credit ABS issuance was moderate in June, after a very strong month in May, and decreased further in July, reportedly reflecting in part  the heightened 
market uncertainty that prevailed over the intermeeting period. 
In the July SLOOS, moderate net fractions of respondents reportedly eased 
standards and terms on, and experienced stronger demand for, credit card loans and auto loans.  Banks reported little change in standards on, and some strengthening in demand for, other consumer loans.  Standards on auto loans were reported to be close to the 
midpoint of their range since 2005.  In contrast, standards on prime credit card loans were  
said to be tighter than the midpoint of their range over the same period .   
COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Growth of bank credit slowed in the second quarter.  Core loans advanced 
modest ly and securities holdings declined.  Commercial and industrial (C&I ) loan growth 
moderated last quarter as loan balances at large banks increased sluggish ly in April and 
May.  CRE loans held by all commercial banks increased modestly in the second quarter 
amid firmer growth at smaller banks .  Growth of closed-end residential mortgages on 
banks’ books slowed a bit from an already tepid pace, and the runoff in home equity loan 
balances continued in line with its recent trend.  Credit card loans on banks’ books rose 
modestly after having been flat in the first quarter, and, as has been the case for some 
time, a sizable increase in other consumer loans reportedly owed in part to strong auto loan originations. 
In the July SLOOS, moderate net fractions of banks generally reported having 
eased their lending standards on core loans and experienced stronger demand for such loans in the second quarter.  Regarding loans to businesses, a modest net fraction of

  banks indicated having eased standards on C&I loans, and moderate- to-large net fractions 
reported having eased pricing t erms on such loans.  However, for the second consecutive 
survey, demand for C&I loans reportedly weakened, particularly at larger banks.  A large 
number of banks indicated  that standards on most types of C&I loans were currently 
easier than the midpoints of the  respective range s that those standards have occupied 
since 2005.  Banks also indicated that the levels of standards on all three types of CRE loans were returning to the midpoints of their recent ranges, although standards for 
construction and land development loans reportedly remain somewhat tighter than those 
for nonfarm nonresidential and multifamily loans. 
 The book value of banks’ securities holdings fell slightly in the second quarter as 
several large banks completed sizable sales .  In addition, the recent rise in  longer- term 
interest  rates reduced the market value of securities held in banks’ available -for-sale 
(AFS) portfolios ; indeed, banks reported a decline of about $40 billion in net unrealized 
gains on their AFS securities over the second quarter —the largest quarterly decline since 
data became available in 1996.
9  Analysis by the staff suggests that the recent sensitivity  
is in line with the historical relationship between changes in the value of banks’ AFS securities and changes in long -term interest rates . 
M2 grew at an annual rate of 6¾ percent  in June and July, supported by flows in to 
liquid deposits and retail money market funds.  Both of these components of M2 may have been boosted recently  by sizable redemptions from bond mutual funds.  Meanwhile, 
over the past two months, c urrency increased at a rate slightly faster than its average 
historical pace amid signs of str ong demand from abroad. 
The monetary base continued to expand rapidly in  June and July, driven mainly 
by the increase in reserve balances result ing from the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases.  
This recent growth in reserve balances was absorbed by domestic depository institutions, 
                                                 
9 Of course, the values of other on - and off -balance -sheet exposures also change  when longer -term 
interest rates change, su ch as banks’ interest  rate derivative positions and deposit franchises.  In addition, 
banks’ net interest margins can also be affected.  Under Basel III, changes in the market value of AFS 
securities holdings will feed through directly to banks’ regulatory  capital positions.  For example, the three 
largest U.S. banks recently reported that the increase in longer -term interest rates that occurred over the 
second quarter pushed down their Basel III tier 1 common ratio by an average of ¼ percentage point.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline pr ojection using simulations of staff models.  In the first 
scenario, term premiums and long-term interest  rates are persistently  higher than in the 
baseline and so restrain the recovery.  The s econd scenario also f eatures higher long-term 
interest rates than in the baseline, but in this  case they reflect a move toward greater risk 
appetite, so the higher rates are associated with a rising stock mark et, greater optimism, 
and a faster economic recovery.  The third s cenario considers the risk that the recent 
softness in consumer price inflation turns out to be more persistent than expected.  The 
fourth scenario explores the possibility that various headwinds impose greater restraint on 
household spending than anticipated in the base line, and the fifth, the possibility that the 
baseline forecast may be underestimating the persistence of supply-side damage from the 
recent recession and slow recovery.  The final two scenarios explore risks to the U.S. 
economy from foreign economic developments—i n the sixth scenario, that growth in 
China is weaker than we currently anticipate,  and in the seventh, that the exchange value 
of the dollar is stronger than in the baseline.   
We generate the first five scenarios us ing the FRB/US model and the last two 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In th e FRB/US simulations, as in the baseline 
forecast, the federal funds rate follows an in ertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
subject to the FOMC’s threshol ds for the unemployment rate and projected inflation.  For 
the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly si milar policy rule, subject to the same 
thresholds but employing an alternat ive concept of re source utilization.1  In all cases, we 
assume that the size and composition of the SO MA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Higher Long-Term Interest Rates 
In the staff’s baseline forecast, long-te rm interest rates rise steadily and 
substantially over the medium term, in part reflecting a rise in term premiums as the 
effects of the Federal Reserve’s asset purch ases wane.  But our understanding of the 
                                                 
1 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack  equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 factors influen cing term premiums is limited, and Treasury yields could climb even more 
quickly than we project for any number of reasons, including an incr ease in inflation risk 
premiums or a further unexpected repositioning of investors in anticipation of a cessation 
of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve.   In this scenario, long- term interest rates are  
assumed to run persistently above baseline and are  about 75 basis points higher than in 
the baseline forecast by early next year.   The resulting tightening in overall financial 
conditions shaves about ¾ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of real 
GDP through 2015.  T he unemployment rate remains above 7 percent through early 
2015, while inflation runs close to  1½ percent through the end of 2016.  The shortfall in 
economic performance relative to the baseline causes  the first increase in the federal 
funds rate to be delayed until late  2016.    
Increased Risk Appetite 
The fact that the substantial rise in Treasury yields  since April has coincided with 
a pronounced run-up in stock market values could point to a n increasing  willingness of 
investors to bear risk.  In this scenario, we assume that this shift in risk appetite s 
continues, so that the increase in term premiums  in the previous scenario is accompanied 
by a path  for equity prices that is higher than assumed in the baseline.  As a result , the 
level of households’  stock market wealth is 13 percent above baseline at the end of 2014.  
Similarly, h ouseholds and business es become more optimistic , further stimulating  
aggregate demand.  Real GDP accelerates to a growth rate of  5 percent  in 2014, bringing 
the unemployment rate below  6½ percent by the third quarter of 2014.  Starting in 2015, 
consumer price inflation is ¼ percentage point higher than baseline.  The federal funds 
rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the fourth  quarter of 2014, t hree 
quarters earlier than in the baseline. 
Low Inflation 
In the baseline forecast, recent low readings on core inflation are anticipated to be 
partially transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradually moves back toward 2 percent.  In this scenario, the deceleration of core consumer prices  over the past year 
instead proves to be a harbinger of a longer -lasting decline in actual inflation, 
accompanied by a decrease in lo ng-run inflation expectations.  Inflation is  below 
1 percent in the near term and edges down f urther in the medium term, falling close to 
zero after next year .  In this environment, investors become increasingly concerne d that 
the economy is mired in a weak state with inflation running substantially below 2 percent and monetary policy persistently constrained by the effective lower bound.  As a result,

 bond premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long- term interest rates, thereby 
modestly restraining household and business spending and boosting unemployment 
relative to the baseline over the next few years.  While the unemployment rate falls below its 6½ percent threshold in the third quarter of 2016, the policy rule does not prescribe the first increase in the federal funds rate until mid -2017.  By then, the unemployment rate is 
nearly at its natural rate.  But given the persistent shift in inflation expectations, inflation 
remains well below the FOMC’s long -run objec tive.  
Consumer Restraint 
In the baseline forecast, strong gains in household spending are an important 
driver of the projected acceleration in the recovery .  But a number of risks surround this 
outlook.  In particular, the staff projection relies on a significant response of spending to higher levels of wealth, which m ay not materialize.  Furthermore, the recent tax increases 
may weigh more persistently on spending than we have allowed in the baseline, and depressed expectations of future income gains may also restrain  household spending by 
more than we assume.  Finally, recent increases in mor tgage interest rates may impose a 
greater drag on  residential construction than in the baseline.  In this scenario , personal 
consumption expenditures and residential construction spending rise considerably more slowly than in the baseline and the personal saving rate remains near recent levels through 2015, rather than falling as in the baseline.  Consequently, the unemployment rate stays above 7 percent through the end of 2016.  B ecause margins of resource slack 
are still wide , inflation remains  close to 1½ percent  rather than rising.  With inflation 
persistently below the FOMC’s longer-run objective and the unemployment rate far above its natural rate, the federal funds rate stays  near zero through 2017. 
Supply -Side Damage 
In previous Tealbooks, we revised down our estimates of potential GDP  in light 
of a falling unemployment rate and modest gains in real GD P in recent years.   But  it is 
possible that we  may still be  underestimating the damage done to aggregate supply 
because of  the recession  and slow recovery .  This scenario assumes that potential output 
has been expanding at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent  since 2011, ½ percentage point 
lower than in the baseline; this s lower pace of growth  in potential output is assumed to 
continue through 2015.  Actual output in  this scenario  stands 2¾ percent  below potential 
at the beginning of the simulation , implying an output gap that is  1½ percentage points 
narrow er than in the baseline.  R eal GDP rises at a rate below  2½ percent per year, on 
average, through 2015, but the u nemployment rate nonetheless continues to decline at

 roughly the same pace as it has since late 2010  and falls below its threshold value by  the 
third quarter of 2014.  Accordingly, the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective 
lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2014, t hree quarters earlier than in the baseline.   
Weaker Growth in China 
Although real GDP growth in China appears to have slowed in the first half of 
this year, in our baseline forecast we expect it to return to a pace close to 8  percent by the 
first half of 2014.  But important downside risks attend this outlook, including a sharp 
slowdown in credit growth, a real estate bust, and a collapse in construction spending.  In this scenario, we assume that real GDP growth in China slows to only 5 percent over the next year, before gradually returning to the baseline.  Moreover, we assume that the 
slowdown in China’s economy has pronounced spillovers to other major U.S. trading 
partners in emerging Asia.  In this environment, the trade- weigh ted exchange value of the 
dollar averages about 3 percent higher than in the baseline over the next two  years.  U.S. 
real net exports decline relative to the baseline in response to weaker foreign economic growth and the dollar’s appreciation.  U.S. real GDP expands only 2½ percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate is still above 7 percent at the end of next year , about 
½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation remains below  
1½ percent  until the end of 2015, because of both the appreciation in the dollar and lower 
resource utilization.  With a higher unemployment rate, the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2016. 
Stronger Dollar  
In light of the pronounced response of international financial markets to recent 
increases in U.S. interest rates, we cannot preclude the possibility that the foreign exchange value of the dollar  will respond to the projected further increases in U.S. 
interest rates to a greater extent than we have assumed.  To capture this possibility, this 
scenario introduces a shock to the foreign exchange risk premium that causes the dollar to 
rise 10 percent above baseline by the first half of next year before gradually receding.  The stronger dollar restrains U.S. real net exports and causes the trade balance as a share of GDP to fall 1½ percentage points by the end of 2014.  Growth in U.S. real GDP slows to 2½ percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate remains above 7 percent throughout next year , about ¼ percentage point higher than in our baseline.  Core inflation falls to 
1 percent in 2014, because of weaker  U.S. real activity and lower import prices .  With a 
higher unemployment rate and lower inflation, the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2016.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
