Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that we have received since the July Tealbook has been mixed 
but, on balance, seems to point to a somewh at weaker pace of economic recovery from 
this point forward than we anticipated in our previous projection.  In  the labor market, the 
past two monthly reports on payroll empl oyment were both disappointing.  The 
unemployment rate once again surprised us to the downside, but the signal from that 
downward move was muddied by a further declin e in the labor force participation rate.  
With regard to production, we now estimate that  real output rose at  an annual rate of 
2 percent in the first half of this year, ½ pe rcentage point more than our estimate in the 
July Tealbook.  However, this upward revisi on was concentrated in spending categories 
where we do not expect any carryover in mo mentum.  And in light of an apparent 
softening in the trajectory of consumer spending, as well as sligh tly more restrictive 
financial conditions, we have revised down our forecast for real GDP growth in the 
second half of the year to 2½ percent, ¼ pe rcentage point less than in our previous 
projection.   
Our medium-term projection for real activity is a little weaker than in the July 
Tealbook, reflecting a further rise  in interest rates and a higher exchange value of the 
dollar.  Even so, we still expect economic  activity to accelerate gradually through 2015 
because of the waning of a number of headwi nds that have been restraining growth in 
recent years, including the economic and fiscal  stresses in Europe and restrictive fiscal 
policy domestically.  All told, our forecast ha s real GDP increasing 3 percent in 2014 and 
3½ percent in 2015, ¼ percentage point lower in  each year than in the July Tealbook.  In 
2016, we expect real GDP to rise 3¼ percent. 
In line with the gradual pickup in aggregate demand, the unemployment rate is 
projected to fall from about 7¼ percent in the current quarter to 5¼ percent at the end of 
2016—close to our estimate of th e natural rate.  Largely as a result of its lower starting 
point, the projected path of the unemployment rate is a little lower than in the July Tealbook, and it crosses the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold in the first quarter of 2015, one quarter earlier than in our previous  projection.  However, because we also 
made a small downward revision to our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, our projection for the labor utilization gap has narrowed by a little less than implied by the 
revision to the unemployment rate.

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  last published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP) following  the June 
FOMC meeting.   The table  below summarizes  revisions  to the staff economic  projection  
since the June  Tealbook.    
The staff projection  for real GDP growth is somewhat  weaker than  in the June Tealbook, 
the result of both weaker indicators  for the near term and less favorable  financial 
assumptions.   However, the projection  for the unemployment  rate  is little revised on  net:  
It ends 2013  a bit lower, reflecting  the incoming  data, and it is unrevised  thereafter,  
reflecting  the offsetting  influences  of the weaker  GDP growth outlook and a small further 
downward  revision to our  estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.   In 2016, the 
staff projects another year  of above‐ trend GDP growth and a further decline  in the 
unemployment  rate to 5¼ percent—close  to our estimate of  the natural rate.     
The staff projection  for overall  PCE inflation has revised up  this year relative  to th e June 
projection,  reflecting  the rise in oil prices over the  summer.   Beyond this year, however,  
the projection  for both core and  headline inflation  is revised slightly  lower, largely  the 
result of a change  in the BEA’s methodology  for measuring  the nonmarket component  of 
prices.  In 2016, we project  inflation to continue to edge higher but still to be  below 
2 percent.    
The unemployment  rate is still projected  to cross the Committee’s  6½ percent threshold  
in early 2015, and  the policy rule that governs our assumption  for the federal funds  rate 
calls for the rate to lift  off from the effective  lower bound  in the second quarter of 2015, 
the same as in June.

Recent readings on core consumer prices have come in as expected and appear 
consistent with our view that the especially low pace of inflation in the first half of the 
year would prove transitory.  Accordingly, our core inflation forecast is broadly similar to 
the July Tealbook, with core PCE price inflation expected to step up to  1.4 percent in the 
second half of this year and to move gr adually higher over the medium term, reaching 
1.7 percent in 2016.  Our headline inflation for ecast has been pushed up in the near term 
by the recent rise in imported crude oil pr ices.  Over the medium term, though, energy 
prices are expected to recede, causing tota l PCE inflation to run a little below core 
inflation.  The inflation projection is a touch lower in this Tealbook over the medium 
term, reflecting a change in the measuremen t of the nonmarket component of PCE prices. 
We view the degree of uncertainty atte nding our projection of  real activity as 
being similar to the average over the past 20 years—the benchmark used by the FOMC.  
We continue to view the risk s to the outlook for real activ ity as being skewed to the 
downside, in part because of the constrai nts imposed on monetary policy by the zero 
lower bound on interest rates.  We also regard the uncertainty around our inflation 
forecast as being about normal and view these risks as roughly balanced.  This 
assessment of risk is unchanged from the June Tealbook—the last time that Committee 
participants submitted economic projections. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Our assumptions regarding purchases under the LSAP program are unrevised this 
round.  We assume that the Committee will begin to slow the pace of purchases this year 
and will end them by the middle of 2014, bringing the cumulative purchase amount under 
the current program to about $1.2 trillion.  Ma rket participants’ e xpectations for asset 
purchases appear to be aligned fa irly well with these assumptions. 
Given the revision to the unemployment rate projection alre ady mentioned, the 
policy rule that governs our assumption for the fe deral funds rate calls for the rate to lift 
off from its effective lower bound in the sec ond quarter of 2015—one quarter earlier than 
in the previous Tealbook.  After liftoff, the trajectory of the federal funds rate is quite similar to the one in th e previous projection.

Other Interest Rates 
In contrast to the staff, market participan ts have apparently s lightly raised their 
expected path of the federal funds rate ove r the medium term; als o, the Treasury term 
premium has risen noticeably further.  In sum, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased 
more than 40 basis points since the July Teal book.  We interpret much of the increase in 
the 10-year yield as having pulled forward some  of the changes we had expected to occur 
in coming quarters, so we have flattened th e projected contour of the yield somewhat.  
Nonetheless, we continue to anticipate a significant rise in the Treasury yield over the 
medium term, primarily reflecting the m ovement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual waning of the 
effects of the FOMC’s balan ce sheet policies on term premiums.  All told , the 10-year 
Treasury yield is expected to climb gradua lly from 3 percent at  present to almost 
4½ percent by the end of 2016. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds  have increased in line with those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities in  recent weeks, leavi ng their implied risk 
spreads about unchanged.  As in the July Tealbook, the projected pickup in economic 
growth that we are anticipating over the medi um term is expected to gradually narrow 
this risk spread, producing a somewhat less pr onounced rise in corporate bond yields than 
in Treasury yields.  Interest  rates on conventional 30-year home mortgages have also 
moved up since the July Tealbook, but only about 30 basis points on net.  Our previous 
forecast had anticipated such a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and 
Treasury yields by year-end, so we did not adju st our projection for a fairly flat spread 
over the medium term this round, and thus have allowed the higher path for Treasury 
yields to completely pass thr ough to higher mortgage rates.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
The Dow Jones U.S. total stock market index has edged down since the July 
Tealbook, and we have revised down the projected level of equity prices about ½ percent, 
on average, through the end of 2016.  As in our previous forecast, we expect stock prices 
to rise at an average annual rate of 7½ percent over the next few years—a pace sufficient, 
we think, to bring the implied equity risk premium down toward  more typical levels over 
time. 
The latest readings have continued to show increases in national home prices, 
although the rate of price appreciation has sl owed markedly from the especially rapid

pace seen earlier in the year.  The CoreLogi c index values for June and July came in a 
little below our forecast, leading us to revi se down the projected level of house prices 
slightly.  We continue to expect a further d eceleration in house prices to an average rate 
of about 4½ percent per year over th e next few years on average.   
Fiscal Policy 
Our fiscal policy assumptions are little cha nged in this forecast.  In particular, we 
have maintained our assumption that policy co ntinues to exert considerable restraint on 
the growth of aggregate demand.  Our best gue ss is that the restraint is beginning to 
moderate, with fiscal policy at all levels of government reducing th e rate of real GDP 
growth by a little less than 1 percentage point (excluding multiplier effects) during the 
second half of this year af ter deducting about 1¼ percenta ge points from GDP growth 
during the first half.  That sa id, the precise timing of the dr ag is quite difficult to pin 
down.  In the medium term, we expect the drag from fiscal policy to diminish to 
¾ percentage point in 2014 and ¼ percentage point in 2015.  And we continue to expect 
the federal unified budget deficit to drop from about 7 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2012 
to less than 4 percent this y ear.  Beyond this year, we project it will gradually narrow to 
around 2 percent of GDP by 2016 owing to further improvements in the economy and 
ongoing policy actions to reduce the deficit. 
Two important risks to our fiscal policy assumptions pertain to the need for 
legislative action over the next several weeks.   New legislation is required both to fund 
the federal government beyond September 30—the  end of the current fiscal year—and to 
raise the statutory debt limit, as the Treasur y has announced that it expects to run out of 
financing capacity in mid-October.  Our projection assumes that  the Congress and the 
Administration will eventually  provide funding for fiscal 2014 consistent with full 
sequestration and will lift the debt ceil ing without defaulting on any government 
obligations.  However, with negotiations between the Administration and the Congress 
currently stalled and negotiating positions far apart, we attach  considerable uncertainty to 
the policy outlook. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP growth tic ked up in the second quarter, but, at an annual rate of 
2 percent, it was well below trend and ¼ percenta ge point lower than expected in the July 
Tealbook.  Although activity firmed in the adva nced foreign economies and in a number 
of emerging market economies (EMEs), ove rall foreign growth was held down by a

surprisingly sharp contraction in Mexico, which has a high trade weight in our foreign 
aggregate.  In the second half of the year, aggregate foreign growth is expected to move 
up to an average pace of 2¾ percent, in part  as Mexican growth again turns positive.  
However, this second-half forecast is a bit lo wer than we projected in the July Tealbook, 
as the restraint from greater financial stress es in some EMEs is only partly offset by 
stronger momentum in China and in Europe.  Thereafter, we project that foreign growth 
will step up further to 3 percent in 2014 and to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, supported by waning fiscal drag and improving financial co nditions in the euro area as well as the 
influence of stronger growth in the adva nced economies on external demand for the 
EMEs. 
The broad nominal dollar index has appr eciated 1 percent since the previous 
Tealbook.  The dollar was about unchanged agai nst the currencies of the advanced 
foreign economies, but it appr eciated about 1½ percent agai nst an aggregate of EME 
currencies in response to rising interest rate s in the advanced economies as well as to a 
weaker outlook and heightened investor focu s on vulnerabilities in  certain countries.  
Over the medium term, we project the broad re al dollar to depreciate at an annual rate of 
about 2½ percent, little changed from the previous Tealbook.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
Oil prices have risen in r ecent weeks because of increas ing tensions in the Middle 
East—in particular, the potentia l for U.S. military interventi on in Syria.  Although Syria 
is not a major oil producer, an escalation of th e conflict there could fu rther destabilize the 
region and threaten crude oil tr ansportation networks.  After spiking earlier in the period, 
when U.S. intervention appeared more imminent , the spot price of Brent crude oil closed 
at about $111 per barrel on Septembe r 10, up about $3 from the July Tealbook.1  In light 
of these developments, we have revised up our forecast for the price of imported oil by 
about $3 per barrel.  In all, the price of imported oil is projected to hold steady at about 
$108 per barrel through the end of this year a nd then decline over the remainder of the 
forecast period, reaching $89 per barrel at the end of 2016; as usual, this forecast is 
guided by the path of futures prices. 
                                                 
1 The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is about unchanged over this period, held down 
by the waning of earlier North American supply disruptions.

Our broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has also been re vised up relative to 
the July Tealbook, reflecting recent increases in metals prices in response to indications 
of improved Chinese demand.  Over the forecas t period, as in the previous Tealbook, we 
expect our overall commodity price index to increase only slightly.   
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Real GDP is estimated to have increa sed at a faster—though still only moderate—
pace during the first half of th is year compared with our pr ojection in the July Tealbook.  
However, this upward revision was concentrat ed in inventory inve stment and government 
spending—two areas where we do not expect positive momentum to be carried forward.  
Indeed, we have revised down our  projection for real output gr owth in the second half of 
the year, primarily because we have a somewhat less robust take on the outlook for consumer spending.  In all, real GDP growth is projected to increas e from an annual rate 
of 2 percent in the first half of this year (½ percentage point more than in the July 
Tealbook) to 2½ percent in the second half (¼ percentage po int less than in July).   
Household Spending 
We now estimate real PCE to have increas ed at an annual rate  of 2¼ percent in 
the first half of 2013, a touch higher than in our July Tealbook projec tion.  We continue 
to expect a moderate step-up in the rate of PCE growth in the second half—supported by 
both the gains in wealth over the past year and the waning drag from fiscal policy.  
Consistent with this accelera tion, motor vehicle sales have moved up noticeably in recent 
months and are expected to remain at about the current level through the end of the year.  
Nevertheless, we have trimmed the extent of  the projected acceleration in real PCE in 
light of the weaker-than-expected pace of real  consumer spending in July and the decline 
in the Thomson Reuters/Michigan measure of consumer sentiment.  In all, our second-
half projection for the growth in real PC E is marked down by ½ percentage point to 
2½ percent.2 
The sharp rise in mortgage rates since th e spring appears to be  affecting housing 
activity, restraining c onstruction of single-family home s and pulling forward sales (see 
the box “The Rise in Mortgage Rates and Housing Activity”).  Meanwhile, multifamily construction appears to have flattened out this  year after having rise n appreciably in the

 The Rise  in Mortgage  Rates  and Housing Market Activity 
Mortgage  rates have risen roughly 100 basis  points from their lows around the time of the April 
Tealbook,  and we expect this increase to reduce  housing demand over the second half of this year.  
To illustrate the  sensitivity  of our projection  to mortgage  rates, the  left‐hand figure below provides  
three forecasts  of real residential  investment.   (Other determinants  of housing demand are 
assumed to be the same as in the current Tealbook  projection.)   If mortgage  rates had remained  
flat at their  April levels and were anticipated  to stay at those levels  through the end of this year, we  
would be forecasting  real residential  investment  to rise at an annual rate of 16 percent in  the 
second half of this year (the full height  of the rightmost bar).  If,  instead, rates had followed  the 
gradual upward‐sloping path that we anticipated  in the April Tealbook,  we would be forecasting  an 
increase of  14 percent at an annual rate (the darkest and medium‐shaded portions  of the bar).  And 
with the rate configuration  that we anticipate  in this edition of  the Tealbook,  we are forecasting  an 
increase of  7 percent at an  annual rate (the darkest portion of  the bar).  In addition,  we expect the 
slowing in demand to reduce  house price appreciation  a few percentage points.  
The sensitivity  of residential  investment  to mortgage  rates that we have built into  our projecti on is 
attenuated  by about one‐fourth relative to typical  historical  norms, for the following  reasons.   First, 
tight credit  means that a smaller fraction of  potential  borrowers  qualify for a mortgage,  making 
aggregate housing  demand less sensitive  to interest rates.  Second,  refinance activity  has plunged 
in response  to the rise in mortgage  rates, easing  the capacity constraints  that we believe to have 
held down mortgage  originations  for home  purchase to some  degree in recent years.1  Third, a 
smaller fraction  of homebuyers  are financing  their purchases  with mortgages, and  buyers who use  
other sources of funding are probably  less sensitive  to the recent rise  in interest rates.   
The data on housing activity to date suggest  that the rise in rates is beginning  to have some effect.2

 purchase of  new homes fell 13 percent,  although  these latter  data are volatile.  Meanwhile,  the 
pending home sales  index, which  reflects newly signed contracts  for existing  homes, decreased  
1 percent in July.  In addition,  applications  for home purchase mortgages, which  tend to occur soon  
after a sales contract is  signed, declined  modestly  in July and August. 
Readings on  both sales of existing homes and house prices through July show little evidence  of a 
rate‐ related decline in demand because they  are recorded  when contracts  are closed, and 
contracts  closed in July were primarily  negotiated  in May and June.  In fact, existing home sales  
rose 4 percent in July.  Part of this increase could reflect a pull‐ forward of demand as some buyers 
rushed to lock in rates in anticipation  of further rate increases.   Indeed, as  shown in  the right‐hand 
figure on the previous page, the fraction of households  in the Michigan survey  that reported  it is a 
good time to buy a home because “interest  rates will go up” or “credit will be tighter later” 
jumped in July.   
Of course,  considerable uncertainty  surrounds our  housing projection.   One downside  risk is that 
the rise in rates could  cause potential  homebuyers to downgrade  their house price expectations  
substantially.   To date, survey‐based measures  of house price expectations  show little support for 
this concern (see lower‐ left figure).  Moreover,  futures prices for the Case ‐Shiller 10‐city  composite 
index have moved up on balance since the  close of the April Tealbook.   However,  we cannot 
dismiss this  possibility going forward.   A related  downside  risk is that the rise in mortgage  rates 
could generate more  general uncertainty  about the housing market. 
On the upside, the forces supporting  the recovery—including  pent‐ up demand for housing,  the 
still‐low cost of housing in many areas, and improving  labor market conditions—could  buoy 
demand by more than we expect.  Even with the  recent increases  in mortgage  rates and house 
prices, housing still remains  affordable  by most measures  (see the lower‐right figure for one 
example).   And market participants  do not seem particularly  concerned  about the rise in rates.  
Neither builders’ nor  Realtors’  ratings of traffic of  potential  buyers or expectatio ns of sales in the 
next six months  have deteriorated  since April, and  lenders tell us that they still see solid prospects  
for home purchase mortgage  originations  going forward.

past several years.  The surge of newly co mpleted apartment units entering the market 
this year and the deceleration in rents may be deterring builders from beginning new 
projects.  All told, growth in residential inve stment is expected to slow from an average 
annual rate of 13 percent in the first half of 2013 to 7 percent in the second half. 
Business Investment 
Real private investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is projected to 
increase at a modest annual pace of only a bout 4½ percent during the second half of the 
year.  To be sure, readings on business sentiment have improved significantly of late, and 
capital goods orders remain above shipment s.  Nevertheless, shipments of nondefense 
capital goods were quite soft in June and Ju ly, the recent rise in corporate bond rates will 
likely act as a drag on investment, and business output has decelerated to a modest pace 
on average in recent quarters.  Moreover, near-term earnings expectations for capital 
goods producers remain lackluster.  Our projec tion for the growth of investment spending 
this year, which incorporates the me thodological changes in troduced with the 
comprehensive revision of the NIPA, is  weaker than in the July Tealbook.3  
Averaging through some large quarterly sw ings, real nonresidential investment 
excluding drilling and mining was flat over the year ending in the second quarter as high 
vacancy rates, low commercial real estate prices, and tight financing conditions have 
continued to weigh on demand for new buildin gs.  The information received since the 
July Tealbook points toward mo re of the same over the next two quarters, as nominal 
outlays for nonresidential construction remained low in June and July and the 
architectural billings index through July stayed at a level consistent with only tepid gains 
over the rest of the year.  Meanwhile, we expect that the level of oil and gas prices and 
continued deployment of new drilling technologies will support a moderate increase in 
real investment in drilling and mini ng structures in the near term.   
In the comprehensive revision to the NIPA, nonfarm inventory investment is 
shown as having added ½ percentage point more to real GDP growth in the first half of 
this year than earlier estimated.  However, the level of inventory investment was still 
                                                 
3 As part of the comprehensive revision, the BEA incorporated two new categories of spending 
into business investment:  (a) research and development and (b) entertainment originals.  Along with 
expenditures on software, spending in these new categories is included under the heading of private fixed investment in intangibles.  Our assessment that th e forecast for spending on E&I has been downgraded 
from July is based on a comparison of the current pr ojection for investment in E&I with the July Tealbook 
projection for investment in equipment and software.

fairly modest.  Moreover, inventory-to-sales  ratios from book-value data and the staff’s 
flow-of-goods system, as well as invent ory indexes from regional and national 
manufacturing surveys, do not  point to significant invent ory imbalances.  We expect 
inventory investment to provide only a sma ll boost to GDP growth in the second half of 
this year.   
Government 
The ongoing decline in real federal government purchases slowed unexpectedly in 
the second quarter, as these outlays fell at an annual rate of only about 1½ percent, 
following a decrease of 8½ percent in the firs t quarter.  We nevertheless continue to 
expect that the sequestrati on and other factors, includi ng the drawdown of overseas 
defense operations, will depress these purchas es going forward and that they will drop 
6½ percent in the second half of the year. 
Real state and local government purchases edged lower in the first half of the 
year, largely because of a continued fall in outlays for construction.  In contrast, the 
contraction in state and lo cal government employment appe ars to have ended as net 
hiring has been slightly positive this year.  In  the second half of 2013, we expect that the 
resources available to these jurisdictions will not change much, as a continued increase in 
tax receipts is partially offset by a reduction in grants-in-aid from the federal government 
caused by the sequestration.  Acco rdingly, we expect real purchases of state and local 
governments to be about flat. 
Foreign Trade  
Following three quarters of lackluster perf ormance, both real exports and imports 
rebounded strongly in the second quarter.  Exports rose at an  annual rate of 8 percent, 
pushed up in part by a resumption of Boeing 787 shipments following previous delays.  
We expect export growth to step down to a 3¾ percent rate in the second half of 2013, a 
pace more consistent with still-subdued foreign growth and some drag from prior dollar 
appreciation.  Meanwhile, imports rose at an annual rate of 6¼ percent in the second 
quarter; however, we expect import growth to fall to a mere 2¼ percent pace in the 
second half as real oil imports decline at a faster pace and U.S. growth picks up only a 
little.  Altogether, the external sector is expected to contribute a little less than 
¼ percentage point to the growth rate of real GDP in the second half, modestly greater 
than in the July Tealbook, as lower projected U.S. demand holds back import growth.

The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing output edged down in July a nd has been about flat, on net, since 
early this year.  However, data on work er hours and physical pr oduction suggest that 
factory output posted a solid gain in Augus t.  Moreover, indicators of near-term 
manufacturing activity, such as  the national and regional ma nufacturing surveys, are, on 
balance, consistent with moderate gains th ereafter.  We expect manufacturing production 
to expand at an annual rate of about 3 per cent in the second half of the year, broadly 
similar to our forecast in the previous Tealbook. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We have trimmed our projection for real GDP growth over the medium term, as 
the changes to our key conditioning assumptions have been negative on net.  On the 
downside, financial conditions have become  somewhat less supportive:  The exchange 
value of the dollar has increased, and inte rest rates are somewhat higher than we 
anticipated in the July Tealbook.  On the upside, though, we have made small upward 
revisions to our estimate of both actual a nd potential GDP growth over the medium term 
in response to the inclusion of additional intangibles in measured GDP.  Folding in these 
changes, we now forecast real GDP growth to  step up from 2¼ percent this year to 
3 percent next year and to 3½ percent in 2015, about ¼ percentage point lower in both 
2014 and 2015 than in our previous projection.  In 2016, we project an additional year of 
above-trend growth of 3¼ percent.  
As has been the case for some time, our projection of an acceleration in real GDP 
over the next two years reflects the expectation that a number of the headwinds that have 
been holding back the growth in economic activity in recent years will ease.  In 
particular, we believe the restraint from fede ral fiscal policy is be ginning to wane, and we 
look for European financial and economic conditions to continue their gradual 
improvement.  In addition, we think that mo rtgage credit will become more broadly 
available.  Given the still highly accommodative stance of monetary  policy, these factors 
are expected to produce a grow ing sense among households and firms that downside risks 
to the recovery have diminished, which shoul d, in turn, reduce asset risk premiums and 
gradually lead to greater consumer spending and more business investment and hiring.   
These dynamics are particularly evident in our forecast for consumer spending.  
Real PCE is projected to rise  2½ percent this year before  accelerating to increases of 
3½ percent in 2014 and 3¾ percent in 2015.  Th is projected acceleration reflects the

fading effects of this year’s tax increases,  gains in household wealth produced by rising 
house and equity prices, and improved consumer confidence.  Nonetheless, our trajectory 
for consumer spending is a little lower than in the Ju ly Tealbook, reflecting higher 
interest rates and some endogenous re sponse to the weaker economic outlook. 
Rising income and confidence are also e xpected to boost residential construction, 
although these effects will likely be damped by the further rise in mortgage rates we 
anticipate to occur over the next several year s.  We expect the growth in residential 
investment to run at a solid rate  of around 15 percent in 2014 and 2015. 
Real outlays for E&I are expected to ri se roughly 5½ percent per year in 2014 and 
2015.  Although faster than the tepid 3 percent pace of growth expected this year, our 
medium-term projection for E&I growth is mode st by historical standards and reflects our 
expectation that business output will increase at only a moderate pace over this period.  
Similarly, we expect only subdued gains in nonresidential structur es over the medium 
term. 
As foreign growth recovers and the dollar begins to depreciate, we expect real 
exports of goods and services to accelerate from a 3½ percent growth rate in 2013 to 
6 percent in 2015; this forecas t is a bit weaker than the July Tealbook due to the recent 
dollar appreciation.  Real import growth is expected to pick up from 2¾ percent this year 
to 5 percent in 2015, supported by the ongoing domestic recovery.  This projection is also 
down slightly from the July Tealbook as the boo st from the stronger dollar is more than 
offset by the drag from the weaker outlook for domestic growth.  Overall, net exports are 
expected to be about neutral for U.S. GDP gr owth in 2013 and then to be a slight drag 
through the end of 2015.  With roughly offse tting revisions to exports and imports, the 
net export contribution is  little changed relative to the July Tealbook.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION  
Recent Developments and Near-Term  Outlook for the Labor Market 
While the incoming data continue to s uggest a gradual improvement in labor 
market conditions, the news has not been uni formly positive.  Total payroll employment 
growth is currently estimated  to have averaged 137,000 in July and August, about 45,000

less per month than we had an ticipated in th e July Tealbook.4  These readings, combined 
with the downward revisions to employment in May and June, leav e the level of total 
payrolls in August about 130,000 lower than our  projection in the previous Tealbook.  
The news from the household survey was somewhat more upbeat, as the unemployment 
rate moved down to 7.3 percent in August, 0.2 percentage point lower than we expected in the most recent Tealbook.  However, the labo r force participation rate also ticked down 
0.2 percentage point in August—compared with our July Tealbook projection of no 
change—somewhat tempering the positive message from the decline in the unemployment rate.
5  That said, the broader U-5 and U-6 measures of unemployment 
also declined in July and August.   
Other indicators of labor market activity received si nce the July Tealbook also 
send somewhat mixed signals about improvement in the labor market.  Initial claims for 
unemployment insurance have continued to edge lower and the hiring plans of small 
businesses  rose substantially in July and August.  However, there has been little change, 
on net, over the past few months in measures  of job openings, hiring rates, and household 
and consumer expectations for future labor market conditions.  Finally, the staff’s labor market conditions index, which summari zes the movements in 19 labor market 
indicators, improved sligh tly over July and August. 
On the basis of this evidence, we now expect nonfarm payroll gains of around 
155,000 in September and 165,000 per month in the f ourth quarter; both figures are down 
20,000 from the July Tealbook.  
We now project that the unemployment rate will edge 
down further to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter, 0.2 percentage point lower than in our 
previous projection.  
Potential GDP and the Natu ral Rate of Unemployment  
We have made two adjustments to our es timates of potential output.  First, the 
comprehensive revision of the NIPA contained an upward restatement of real GDP 
growth, reflecting in part the incorporation of additional intangibles into the definition of 
fixed investment.  As the comprehensive revision did not substantially alter the 
                                                 
4 We have received the labor market reports for both July and August since the July Tealbook. 
5 The reported drop in labor force participation in August might have been exaggerated by 
seasonal adjustment issues associat ed with the return of teenagers to  school combined with a later-than-
usual survey week.  We therefore expect a partial reversal of the August decline in the participation rate in 
September.

relationship between the unemp loyment rate and output in the recent cycle, we passed 
this upward adjustment to past actual  output growth into our estimate of past potential  
output growth, and we carried the intangibles portion of this adjustment forward into our 
projection for potential output growth.  
Second, the decline in the unemployment rate since mid-2012 in the face of only 
modest output gains led us to reduce the gr owth of potential output in 2012 and early 
2013 relative to the higher rate implied by the comprehensive revision.  This change 
narrows the estimated GDP gap and implies that the unemployment rate has a little farther to fall to come back into line with GDP, and thus admits the possibility that we 
may see additional declines in unemployment in an environment of modest GDP growth.  
All told, the growth in po tential output is unrevised  in 2012 and is revised up 
0.1 percentage point thereafter relative to the July Tealbook.  Nonetheless, at a bit more 
than 2 percent per year, the average rate of potential output growth over the medium term 
remains broadly similar to our July forecast. 
We have also made small downward adjust ments to our projecti ons of the natural 
rate of unemployment and trend labor force pa rticipation.  We made similar adjustments 
in the June Tealbook, but in light of th e additional downward surprises in the 
unemployment and labor force participation ra tes in recent months, we have moved a 
little further in the same direction in the current projection—we revised down our 
estimate of the level of the natural rate and the trend rate of labor force participation by 
0.1 percentage point each from early 2013 onward.
6 
The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market 
Our projected path for gains in total pa yroll employment over the medium term 
reflects the acceleration in real GDP that we have  in this forecast.  In particular, total job 
gains are projected to step up from 155,000 per m onth in the second half of this year to 
about 190,000 per month in 2014 and 240,000 per month in 2015—a trajectory that is 
somewhat weaker than in the July Tealbook.  As noted above, the unemployment rate is 
0.2 percentage point lower at the start of the forecast period as a result of the incoming 
data.  From this lower starting point, the unemployment rate declines to 5.8 percent at the 
end of 2015. 
                                                 
6 Taken together, the adjustments made to the natural rate of unemployment and trend labor force 
participation have no implication for our estimate of potential output.

The top-right figure of the “Labor Mark et Developments a nd Outlook” exhibit 
compares our current unemployment rate  projection with our projection from 
September 2012, when the Committee first tie d its asset purchase decisions to an 
improvement in the outlook for labor mark et conditions.  By the end of 2013, the 
unemployment rate is projected to be 7.2 per cent, nearly 1 percenta ge point lower than 
the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed in August 2012 (the last observation that the 
Committee had in hand for the September 2012 FOMC meeting); th rough the end of 
2015, our forecast for the unemployment rate av erages about 1 percentage point lower 
than the September 2012 Tealbook’s projection.  Meanwhile, the outlook for total payroll 
employment growth past the th ird quarter of this year ha s changed relatively little, on 
average, since our forecast one  year ago.  However, our curre nt projection for the level of 
total payroll employment at the end of this year is ¾ percent, or 1.1 million jobs, above what we projected in September 2012, partly due to faster-than-expected job growth 
during the first half of this year and partly due to the benchmark revision which boosted 
the estimated level of employment one year ago.
7 
Resource Utilization   
We estimate that real GDP in the sec ond quarter of this year was 3½ percent 
below its potential level—a ½ percentage point  narrower output gap than we estimated in 
the July Tealbook; this revision reflects  the changes made to our supply-side 
assumptions, as well as the upward revision to GDP  growth in the first half of this year.  
Despite this narrower starting point, with GDP rising less quickly than in our previous projection and potential output  rising more quickly, the output gap shrinks by less over 
the medium term.  By the final quarter of 2015, the projected level of GDP stands 
1¼ percent lower than potential GDP, unchanged from our previous projection.  The labor utilization gap is also  narrower at the start of th e projection, as our downward 
adjustment to the natural rate only partially offsets the lower-than-previously-projected 
unemployment rate.  At the end of 2015, the unemployment rate is a little more than 
½ percentage point above the natural rate—a gap that is slightly narrower than in our July 
projection.
8  In the manufacturing sector, capacity  utilization is currently almost 
                                                 
7 On September 26, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to publish its preliminary estimate 
of the benchmark revision to payroll employment. 
8 The slight discrepancy between the revision to the output and labor utilization gaps at the end of 
2015 reflects a reestimation of our Okun’s law relationship.

by mid-2015.9 
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
Headline PCE prices rose at an annual rate  of only ½ percent in  the first half of 
this year as consumer energy prices dropped sharply and core prices decelerated.  Over 
the second half of this year, though, total PCE pr ice inflation is projected to increase to 
1½  percent as energy prices rebound and core  PCE price inflation edges up.  Compared 
with the July Tealbook, our projection for total PCE inflation in the second half of this 
year is up about ¼ percentage point, reflecting the recent rise in imported crude oil prices.  
After running at a very subdued 1 percent annual pace over the first half of this 
year, core PCE price inflation is forecast to pick up to just under 1½ percent in the second 
half as transitory influen ces from medical prices and nonmarket prices ebb.  Although 
recent data on core consumer prices have come in as expected, this near-term projection 
is nevertheless down a touch from the July Tealbook due to lower-t han-expected data on 
import prices.   
 We have marked up our projection for consumer energy price inflation in the 
second half of this year to around 6 percent b ecause of the increase in  oil prices; we had 
expected these prices to move sideways in  the July Tealbook.  Nevertheless, given the 
downward tilt in our projected oil price path, we continue to expect that PCE energy 
prices will edge lower over the medium term.   
Consumer food prices are projected to increase 1 percent this year and then 
decelerate to an increase of about ¾ percent ne xt year, as this year’s steep declines in 
farm commodity price futures show through to the retail level.  In 2015, we expect that 
these prices will rise 1¼ percent, a little below core inflation. 
Falling core import prices are damping domestic inflation.  After declining at an 
annual rate of 2½ percent in the second qua rter, prices of imported core goods are 
                                                 
9 The degree of slack in the manufacturing sector  appears to be a bit smaller than that for the 
broader economy, in part because of unprecedented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010 that 
occurred as manufacturers shuttered plants that had be en chronically underutilized.  Note that we estimate 
capacity in the industrial s ector based largely on survey data that seek to capture the highest level of output 
that plants can sustainably maintain given sufficient availability of variable inputs, such as labor and materials.

expected to decline at a similar pace in the current quarter, reflecting recent dollar 
appreciation as well as the c ontinued pass-through of the fall in commodity prices earlier 
in the year.  Relative to the July Tealbook, the third-quarter forecast has been revised 
down by 2 percentage points, reflecting a weak er-than-anticipated reading for July.  We 
have also marked down our projection for the fourth quarter; core import prices are now 
expected to be little changed, compared with the ½ percent increase we had projected in 
the July Tealbook.  For the remainder of the fo recast period, core impor t price inflation is 
expected to run about 1½ per cent per year, consistent with the relatively flat projected 
trajectory for commodity prices and our  assumed pace of dollar depreciation. 
Readings on long-term inflation exp ectations remain stable.  Median 
5-to-10-year-ahead inflation e xpectations from the final Augus t Michigan survey stood at 
2.9 percent—well within the relatively narrow range seen in recent years.  Expectations 
for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years,  as measured by the median of the Survey 
of Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at  2 percent in the third quarter.  Similarly, 
TIPS-based measures of inflation compensati on are little changed, on balance, since the 
previous Tealbook.  
With stable long-run inflation expecta tions, a small projec ted acceleration in 
commodity and import prices beyond this year , and a gradually diminishing margin of 
slack—as well as our judgment that the softne ss earlier in the year in core inflation 
reflected transitory factors—we expect core PCE inflation to rise from 1.2 percent this 
year to 1.5 percent in 2014 and then to edge up further, reaching 1.7 percent in 2016.  
This contour is 0.1 percentage point lowe r than in the July Tealbook owing to a 
downward adjustment to our pr ojection for nonmarket prices.10  Given the projected 
trajectory for energy prices, total PCE inflation is expected to be marginally lower than 
core inflation over the medium term.  T hus, through 2015, the PCE inflation projection 
remains below the Committee’s long-run objective of 2 percent. 
Increases in labor compensation remain subdue d.  For the second half of this year, 
we expect compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector to rise about 2½ percent, 
unchanged from our July Tealbook projection.  Over the medium term, we expect the 
                                                 
10 During this year’s comprehensive revision, the BEA made a number of changes to their methods 
for measuring implicitly priced financial services, which enters the nonmarket component of PCE.  These 
changes lowered both total and core PCE inflation over the past 25 years by an average of 0.1 percentage 
point per year.  We have carried forward this downward adjustment into our inflation projection.

gradual tightening of the labor market to push hourly compensation growth up to 
3 percent by 2015. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the 
FRB/US model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side  conditions, fiscal policy, 
and other factors.  The c ontour of the long-term outl ook depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
 Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer 
term, consistent with the Committee’s policy strategy statement.  As noted 
earlier, the Committee’s unemployment rate threshold is crossed in the 
baseline projection in the first quarter of 2015.  Thereafter, the federal funds 
rate is set according to the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed in 2021. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd bonds continue to decrease gradually 
to normal levels, and financial instituti ons further ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit begins to widen after 2017, primarily reflecting 
fast-rising transfer payments  for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal 
debt remains a little below 75 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018 before beginning to rise later in the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar stays constant from 2017 
onward.  The price of crude oil holds steady in real te rms.  Foreign real GDP 
growth slows from 3½ percent in 2016 to  an annual rate of about 3 percent 
later in the decade. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is  5.2 percent throughout the longer-term 
outlook.  Potential GDP rises at an aver age pace of 2¼ percent per year from 
2017 to 2020.   
The economy is projected to enter 2017 with output still slightly below its 
potential level, unemployment slightly above  its natural rate, and inflation below the 
long-run objective of the Committee.  In the staff’s long-term forecast, the small 
remaining gaps in activity relative to potential  are absorbed as a consequence of real GDP

rising 2½ percent in 2017.  Thereaf ter, the pace of gains in re al GDP slows to the rate of 
potential growth, in large pa rt reflecting the progressive withdrawal of monetary 
accommodation.  The unemployment rate falls through 2017 to near its natural rate of 
5.2 percent and remains close to that level ther eafter.  Long-run infla tion expectations are 
assumed to remain well anchored, and, with slack in labor and product markets having 
been taken up, consumer price inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019.  The nominal 
federal funds rate is 3¾ percent at the end of  this decade and eventu ally stabilizes at 
around 4 percent in the middl e of the next decade.11 
                                                 
11 The upward revision to long-term interest rate s in the second half of the decade reflects a 
change in our procedure for calculating the path for longer-term Treasury yields.  The longer-term Treasury 
yields now reflect perfect foresight on the part of financial market participants about the future path of the 
federal funds rate, which is more in line with the methods used for the medium-term financial assumptions.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign real GDP expanded at an annual rate of only 2  percent in the second 
quarter , a little higher than in the first quarter but still quite subdued by historical 
standards .  Although economic activity accelerated in the advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs)  from its very weak pace earlier this year , growth barely increased  in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs), held back by a significant contraction of output in Mexico.  
Economic growth strengthened in many other EMEs, particularly in Asia, but generally 
remained  below trend.   
We project foreign economic growth to rise to 2¾ percent in the second half of 
this year and strengthen further over the forecast period to reach 3½  percent in 2016.  In 
the AFEs, encouraging data from the euro area support our conviction that the region has exited recession.  However, we anticipate that the recovery there will remain sluggish in the face of  continued fiscal and financial headwinds.  Elsewhere in the AFEs, still 
accommodative monetary policies should help sustain the improvement in activity .  And 
a firming recovery in the United States, along with stronger activity in the AFEs, should support external demand and an acceleration of output for the EMEs  despite some  
near-term drag from tightened financial conditions (as discussed in more detail later ).  
Our outlook for aggregate foreign growth is revised down a bit in the second half 
of this year and the first half of next year  but about unchanged thereafter.  Although we 
revised up near- term growth in Europe and China based on more promising indicators, 
this revision was  more than offset by markdowns elsewhere.  We extended  forward some 
of Mexico ’s surprising first -half weakness .  Perhaps more importantly, financial 
conditions in a number of EMEs  worsened further of late, as outflows from emerging 
market funds accelerated again, interest rates moved up, and currencies depreciated.  All 
told, these developments should restrain economic activity, and in response we marked down our forecast for economic growth in EMEs by about ¼ percentage point in the near term.  Nonetheless, th is revision i s tempered by the positive effects of currency 
depreciation.  Those economies with the weakest macroeconomic fundamentals, such as Brazil and India, have experienced the greatest financial turmoil, and we revised down their growth the most .  (See the box “Financial Distress and Vulnerabilities in E merging 
Market E conomies.” )

 Financial  Distress and Vulnerabilities 
in Emerging  Market Economies 
The financial  stresses experienced  in May and June by many emerging  market economies  
(EMEs) have re‐emerged  after a brief respite.  Outflows  from emerging  market bond and 
equity funds, shown in  the upper‐ left figure on the next page, have  accelerated  again in 
recent weeks, although  they remain smaller than  the large outflows  seen in June.  At the 
same time, as can be seen in the upper‐ right figure, the  currencies  of several EMEs  
resumed their depreciations  against the dollar in mid‐ July and have declined  a substantial  
amount since then.  Additionally,  emerging  market bond yields have  moved up further 
(not shown). 
Nevertheless,  financial conditions  have not deteriora ted uniformly  across the  EMEs.  
Since mid‐ July, for example,  the currencies  of Korea and Taiwan have been quite  stable, 
even as those of Brazil, India, and Turkey have moved down further despite significant  
interventions  in these countries.  This  variation suggests  that even though the emerging 
market selloff has been driven  in part by common factors, such as  changes in market 
perceptions  regarding  the future policies of the Federal Reserve  or cloudier prospects  for 
EME growth, investors  are distinguishing  among EMEs.   
We investigated  the importance of  economic  vulnerabilities  to this variation in investor  
response.   To do so, we first ranked each economy  from least vulnerable  to most 
vulnerable  according  to four macroeconomic  indicators:   (1) the ratio of  the current 
account to GDP, (2) the ratio  of government  debt to GDP, (3) the  average inflation rate 
since the beginning  of 2012, and (4) the rise in domestic  credit to the private  sector as a 
share of GDP in recent years.  Averaging  each country’s  rankings across  these four  
categories, we  created an index  with larger  values indicating  greater relative 
vulnerability.   Based on this index (lower‐left figure on the next page), the most 
vulnerable  economies  are Brazil, Turkey,  and India, and the least vulnerable  are Korea, 
Chile, and Taiwan.  We then examined  the relationship  between the extent of  
vulnerability  and one measure  of financial market stress—how  much the exchange  rate 
has changed  since the end  of April.  As  can be seen in the lower‐ right figure, more  
vulnerable  economies, according  to our criteria, have indeed experienced  more currency 
depreciation.   We also verified that greater vulnerabilities  are associated  with larger  
increases  in interest rates since the end  of April, further suggesting  that country‐specific 
factors have contributed  to recent market pressure  on EMEs. 
Although  currency  depreciations  should offer some  macroeconomic  stimulus over time,  
our sense is that the increase in interest rates and declines in confidence  associated  with 
financial stress will constitute  a net  negative for economic  activity in EMEs.  Accordingly, 
we substantially  revised down  our activity outlook for Brazil and India because of  
increased  financial stress and reduced to a lesser degree our outlook for other  EMEs.

Moreover,  there is some chance that the interaction  of domestic vulnerabilities  with 
rising global interest rates  and increased  investor jitters could trigger a financial  crisis in 
an EME.  Were such an event  to occur,  there might well be  serious contagion  effects 
among other EMEs, possibly pushing them into crisis as well.  Under  those circumstances,  
economic  activity in the EMEs more generally  could slow sharply, leading  to serious  
consequences  for U.S. growth, a scenario  described  in the Risks and  Uncertainty  section.  
This is not our baseline scenario,  but the risk of such an outcome  has increased.

  Our baseline forecast assumes that financial stresses in EMEs level off in coming 
months.  However, the recent deterioration in investor sentiment toward vulnerable 
economies  indicates that the risk of greater financial turbulence has increased , potentially 
involving contagion to other EMEs and engendering a broad -based slowdown in foreign  
economic activity.  Another downside risk is that an escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could push oil prices up, undermining the already tepid global recovery.  
(We explore both of these scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section.)  Finally, 
notwithstanding the more positive tone of news from the euro area and China, risks 
remain  that financial and economic conditions in these economies could deteriorate 
sharply.  
Inflation in the AFEs should pick up to 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the second 
half of this year, nearly ½  percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook, amid 
higher energy prices.  Further out, inflation is expected to hover around this pace, little changed from our previous Tealbook forecast.  EME inflation is also expected to pick up a bit, to 3¼ percent over the forecast period, in some cases boosted by pass -through 
effects of recent currency depreciations.   
With still large output gaps and limited price pressures, monetary policy in the 
AFEs is slated to remain accommodative.  In contrast, a number of central banks in vulnerable EME countries have tightened policy and intervened in foreign exchange markets to stem capital outflows and depreciation pressures.  As financial stresses persist, we expect additional tightening measures in these countries.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Following a modest expansion in the first quarter, AFE output rose at nearly a 
2 percent p ace in the second quarter, ½ percentage point above our July Tealbook 
estimate.  GDP in Europe rebounded more vigorously than expected and recent indicators point to stronger momentum, leading us to mark up the outlook for the region.  In 
contrast, the weaker U.S. projection is expected to weigh a little on near- term prospects 
for Canada.   On net, we anticipate that AFE GDP growth will remain just below 
2 percent in the second half of 2013, a bit higher than projected in July.  Thereafter, as 
euro-area financial pressures ease further, fiscal drag wanes,  and monetary policy 
remains accommodative , we continue to project AFE growth to edge up  throughout the 
forecast, reaching almost 2½ percent in 2016.

  Increases in consumer energy prices led us to revise up our forecast for AFE 
inflation in the current quarter by ½ percentage point to nearly 2  percent.  Inflation 
should moderate to 1½ percent next quarter, as energy prices stabilize, and remain around 
that rate through the end of 2015 (excluding the effects of the Japanese consumption tax hikes).  Consistent with a somewhat improved economic outlook for Europe, we now expect the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE) to raise their policy rates one quarter earlier than previously projected, in the second half of 2015, and 
to implement further rate hikes in 2016.     
Euro Area 
The recession in the euro area appears to be at an end.  After six consecutive 
quarters of contraction, euro- area GDP expanded 1.2  percent at an annual rate in the 
secon d quarter, much better than the zero growth we had estimated in the July Tealbook.  
This figure may somewhat overstate the underlying momentum in the economy, as output 
was boosted by temporary factors, including a rebound in construction activity from a weather -related slump in the first quarter.  That said, recent data point to continued 
positive growth.  In July, euro-area retail sales moved up, supporting the view that 
consumption is gradually firming, and the unemployment rate held steady at 12.1 percent.  
In August, the composite PMI finally moved into expansionary territory and consumer confi dence reached its highest level in two years.  We now project that euro -area GDP 
will expand ¼ percent in the current quarter and nearly 1  percent in the next, a bit faster 
than we had previously anticipated.   
We see the recovery strengthening modestly next year but continuing to face 
significant headwinds, including tight fiscal conditions, distressed balance sheets, and limited credit availability.  Therefore, we project that euro -area GDP growth will edge up 
to just 1¼ percent in 2014 before rising to 2 percent in 2016.  Compared with the July Tealbook, this projection is a tad higher in 2014— mostly reflecting a lower expected path 
for financial stresses —and unchanged thereafter.   
Amid rising energy prices, euro-area inflation is projected to increase to 
1½ percent in the second half of this year from ¾ percent in the first half.  As the output gap slowly closes, inflation should tick up to 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, as in the July Tealbook.  At its September meeting, the ECB kept the benchmark 
policy rate at 50 basis points and reiterated its intention  to maintain low rates for an 
extended period.  Consistent with our revisions to the euro-area outlook, we now expect

  the ECB to raise the benchmark rate in the third quarter of 2015, one quarter earlier than 
in the July Tealbook, and to bring it to 1¼ percent by the end of the forecast horizon. 
United Kingdom  
Second -quarter U.K. GDP rose 2.9 percent, ½ percentage point more than we had 
estimated in the July Tealbook, with upside surprises in net exports, government 
spending, and investment.  Recent indicators suggest ongoing strength .  Retail sales grew 
1.1 percent in July, and PMIs for construction and  manufacturing rose sharply in  August.  
Accordingly, we revised up our forecast for GDP growth in the second half of this year ¾ percentage point, to 2¾ percent.  Our projection for output growth in 2014 is also a touch higher, at 2¼ percent, partly reflecting better growth prospects in the euro area.   
We expect GDP growth to reach 2½  percent  in 2015 and to remain at that rate in 2016, 
nearly unchanged from the July Tealbook. 
We estimate that the recent upswing in oil prices and a planned hike in university 
tuitions will lift quarterly inflation in the second half  of this year to an average of 
2¾ percent, a bit higher than in the July Tealbook.  Thereafter, our inflation forecast is unchanged as we project that inflation will settle down to about 2 percent.  Consistent with the BOE’s recently announced forward guidance (see the box “Forward Gui dance 
by the Bank of England”) and our forecast for the unemployment rate, we expect the BOE to keep the Bank Rate at 0.5 percent through the third quarter of 2015 and to maintain the current size of its asset holdings for some time beyond th en.  Our forecast 
for the first rate hike is one quarter earlier than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the stronger outlook for the U.K. economy.   
Japan 
Real GDP rose 3.8  percent in the second quarter following similarl y strong 
performance in the first , driven by further gains in private consumption and net exports.  
Indicators for activity in the third quarter have been mixed.  Industrial production rebounded in July and the manufacturing PMI points to further expansion in August, but in July merchandise exports p lunged and real consumption edged down, leading us to 
mark down third- quarter GD P growth by ½ percentage point.  That said, growth should 
average a solid  2¾ percent in the second half of the year, owing to highly accommodative 
fiscal and monetary policies .  We expect that two planned consumption tax hikes and 
diminishing stimulus from past yen depreciation will cause output growth to slow to an average rate of about 1 percent in 2014 and 2015.

  Consumer prices rose sharply in June and July, largely reflecting the effect of yen 
depreciation and higher oil prices .  Accordingly, we forecast that inflation will jump from 
0.8 percent in the second quarter to 3 percent in the current quarter.  As energy prices 
stabilize, inflation should hover just above ½ percent over the next two quarters.  Thereafter, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) assumed to maintain its asset purchase program through the end  of 2015, inflation should gradually rise to 1 percent by 2015 (net of the 
effect of consumption tax hikes) and  to 1½ perce nt in 2016.  With inflation approaching 
its 2 percent target, we expect the BOJ to implement its first rate hike in late 2016.  
Canada 
Real GDP growth in Canada slowed as expected to 1.7 percent in the second 
quarter from 2 .2 percent in the first.  This slowing reflected temporary factors, including 
the effect  of flooding in Alberta and Toronto in June.  Recent data support our projection 
that growth will rebound to an average rate of 2¼ percent in the second half of the year.  Employment and  the manufacturing PMI w ere above their  second -quarter level s through 
August.  Going forward, we see Canadian output growth at 2½ percent in 2014, increasing g radually to 2¾ percent in 2016.    
We expect inflation to average 1¾  percent in the second half of the year, a little  
higher than in the July Tealbook because of higher energy prices.  Thereafter, we project that firming economic activity will gradually push inflation to the 2  percent target by the 
end of the forecast period.  W e conti nue to assume  that the Bank of Canada will start 
raising its policy rate in the second half of 2014.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Aggregate second -quarter growth for the EMEs came in at an annual rate of only 
2¼ percent, about ¾ percentage point lower than projected in the July Tealbook and 
some 2 percentage points below its trend pace.  This revision was driven almost entirely 
by data from Mexico, which saw a surprisingly large contraction in activity .  In contrast, 
a number of other emerging ec onomies (particularly in Asia) finally showed in the 
second quarter the moderate pickup of growth that we had been forecasting .  In addition, 
third -quarter indicators point to a firming of growth in China.  
We expect EME growth to step up to 3¾ percent in the second half of the year 
and to rise to a trend -like pace of 4½ percent by the middle of next year, as Mexico 
returns to positive growth in the current quarter, Chinese activity picks up, and the

 Forward  Guidance  by the Bank of England 
On August 7, the Monetary  Policy Committee (MPC)  of the Bank of England (BOE) announced  forward 
guidance on  its policy.1  The MPC said that it intends to keep the policy rate (the  Bank Rate) at its 
current level  of 0.5 percent and the stock of assets purchased  at £375 billion at least until the 
unemployment  rate has fallen to 7 percent,  which the MPC expects to occur around mid‐ 2016.   
That guidance would  cease to hold if any of the following  three “knockouts” were  breached:  
1. The MPC projects  consumer  price inflation 18 to 24 months ahead to be 0.5 percentage point 
or more above the 2 percent target.  
2. “Medium ‐term inflation expectations  no longer remain sufficiently  well anchored.”   
3. “The Financia l Policy Committee judges  that the stance of  monetary  policy poses a significant  
threat to financial  stability.  . . .” 
In addition to providing  greater clarity  about the MPC’s reaction  function,  the guidance  was intended  
to keep market participants from  “revising  up excessively their  expectations  of the future path of 
Bank Rate” as the economic  recovery gains  traction.   However, the  market‐implied path of U.K. policy  
rates, shown  in the upper‐ left figure on the next page, has risen significantly  since early  August, 
appearing  to price in a rate hike in early 2015. 
Part of the explanation  for the failure of the BOE’s guidance to restrain  the run‐ up in rates may lie with 
the strength  of recent data on the U.K. economy.  Part may  also be driven by global factors  such as 
anticipations  of Federal Reserve  policy.  However,  on the day of the announcement,  U.K sovereign  
yields edged  up, the British pound appreciated,  and stock prices fell.  That immediate market  reaction 
may have reflected  concerns  that the unemployment  threshold  or any one of the three knockouts  
might bring  about a rate  hike earlier than  in the BOE’s forecast,  despite the BOE’s statement  that 
there is “no presumption  that breaching  any of these  knockouts  would lead to an immediate  increase 
in Bank Rate  or sale of assets.”2 
On the eve of the guidance  release, market expectations  appeared  to have coalesced  around a range 
of 6½ to 7 percent for the  unemployment  rate threshold.   The announced  7 percent threshold  was at 
the high side of market expectations  and therefore  did not signal a commitment to greater  policy 
accommodation.   Moreover, as  shown by  the BOE’s fan chart in  the upper‐right figure, the speed  at 
which the unemployment  rate is projected  to fall to the  threshold  is quite uncertain.   Although  the 
BOE sees around a 50 percent  probability  that the rate will remain  above 7 percent through  mid‐2016, 
the outlook also includes a significant  chance that the threshold  will be reached much earlier.  The  BOE 
is counting  on a rebound  in labor productivity,  which collapsed  after the recession,  to slow the fall in

 unemployment,  even as GDP growth picks up.  However,  market participants  may expect productivity  
to underperform  and the unemployment  rate to fall more  rapidly.   
Markets also may be assigning  some probability  to the prospect that  one of the inflation  knockouts  
could be triggered  before the unemployment  rate crosses the  7 percent threshold.   In particular,  the 
BOE’s current inflation forecast, shown in the lower‐ left figure, has  a central  tendency within the  
18‐to‐24‐month window of just above 2 percent.   However, with U.K. inflation  running persistently  
above 2½  percent,  markets may be concerned  that inflation could fall more slowly than currently  
forecast.  In addition,  as shown in  the lower‐right figure, the BOE’s forecast for inflation  18 to 
24 months ahead, which  over the  past six years  has almost uniformly  underpredicted  actual inflation,  
has been rising  over time  and is currently  quite near the 2½ percent knockout  level. 
Our projection  for the path of the U.K. policy  rate falls  between that  of the market and that implied by  
the BOE’s forecast for the  unemployment  rate.  In our baseline forecast,  which assumes  some pickup 
in labor productivity,  the unemployment  rate falls  below 7 percent in 2015, and  we see the first BOE 
rate  hike late  that year.

  recovery in the advanced economies continues to  boost ext ernal demand .  Reflecting  
recent positive indicators, we marked up our outlook for China and some other  emerging 
Asian economies .  Nevertheless, o ur near-term outlook for growth in the EMEs is 
¼ percentage point lower than in the July Tealbook.  We downgraded the outlook for Mexico significantly in light of the second-quarter downward surprise and a markdown to U.S. manufacturing activity.  In addition, to account for the recent heightening of financial stresses, we have revised down growth in some especially vulnerable EMEs —
Brazil, India, and Indonesia—by around ½ percentage point, and in several others by lesser amounts .  Although, over time, the cumulative depreciations of their currencies  
should provide some offset  via net exports, the rise in interest rates and capital outflows 
should restrain activity through increased financing costs and a falloff in credit growth.   
Our baseline forecast does not call for any of the EMEs to enter into a crisis .  
Despite the markets ’ focus on economies  with pronounced vulnerabilities , economic 
fundamentals and policy space generally remain much better than they were during the 
crisis periods of the 1980s and 1990s.  However, the downside risk of much greater financial turbulence, which could push one or more of these economies into crisis, has increased . 
We see inflation in the EMEs remaining at an annual rate of about 3  percent in the 
current quarter .  EME inflation is expected to pick up a bit to 3¼ percent over the 
remainder of the forecast period, as recent currency depreciations in some economies pass through to consumer prices.  Over the intermeeting period, the central banks of Brazil and Indonesia raised their policy rates, citing concerns about currency depreciation 
and its implications for inflation.  Some other countries, such as India and Turkey, also 
implemented measures to tighten policy.  In contrast, the Bank of Mexico cut its policy rate in response to the surprisingly weak GDP data . 
China  
In China, data since the July Tealbook indicate that GDP growth has picked up 
from the soft  7 percent pace in the first half of the year.  In July and August, industrial 
production accelerated, and investment and retail sales growth remained relatively strong.  The PMI also moved higher in August , with a large increase in the new orders subindex, 
suggesting that the positive momentum should continue in  the coming months.  Thus, we 
marked up GDP growth in the second half of this year about ¼ percentage point, to a little more than 7½  percent in the third quarter and nearly 8 percent in the fourth.  GDP

  growth is projected to remain around that pace in the first half of 2014—about our 
estimate of Chinese potential—before gradually slowing to 7½ percent by the end of the 
forecast period as t rend growth declines.  Chinese authorities enacted some targeted 
stimulus measures in late July, such as tax cuts for smaller enterprises, but with the 
improved outlook for the economy, larger- scale stimulus policies are unlikely as 
authorities remain focu sed on economic reforms. 
Other Emerging Asia 
Real GDP growth stepped up to 3¾ percent in the second quarter, 1 percentage 
point higher than what we had estimated in the July Tealbook, reflecting surprisingly strong data releases in  many countries.  An exception was India, where growth 
disappointed, led by a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector.  We expect growth for these economies will average about 3¾ percent in the second half of the year.  W e 
marked down our estimate of growth in Indonesia and India given recent  financial 
turbulence and weak incoming data such as PMIs, but these revisions w ere offset by 
stronger exports and output data elsewhere in the region.  Over the medium term, we have growth rising  to 4½ percent, as external demand from the advanced economies 
picks up. 
We expect inflation in emerging Asia to increase from 1¾ percent in the second 
quarter to 3¾ percent in the third quarter, in part as Indonesia reduces its subsid y on 
energy prices  and food prices rise in Korea.  W e expect inflation to stabilize around 
3½ percent over the rest of the forecast period.   
Latin America 
Mexican real GDP fell nearly 3  percent in the second quarter, a whopping 
4½ percentage points below our July Tealbook estimate, and first-quarter GDP growth was also revised down to about zero from an already tepid 1¾  percent.  Although GDP 
components will not be released until late September, other second-quarter data point ed 
to weakness in domestic demand that appeared to  reflect a combination of factors—
higher uncertainty about future taxes, softness in housing construction, and shortfalls in 
some categories of U .S. manufacturing production.  However, the auto sector remained a 
bright spot, as vehicle production and exports expanded .   
We anticipate a modest economic recovery in Mexico, with growth rising to 
2¾ percent in the second half of this year and to about 3½ percent  thereafter.  Incoming

  data su pport this view, with exports up in July and the manufacturing PMI moving into 
expansionary territory in Augu st.  Nevertheless, t he forecast is revised down 
½ percentage point in the second half of this year, as we have taken on board some of the 
weakness in the first half, and just a bit thereafter because of  a lower path for U.S. 
manufacturing production over the forecast period.   
Inflation in Mexico jumped to an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the second quarter 
as administered prices  for public transport ation  were increased .  We estimate that 
inflation will moderate to about 2 percent in the current quarter , reflecting declines in 
food prices through August .  Once these transitory factors play out, we see Mexican 
inflation hovering near 3½ percent over the forecast period.  In response to concerns of  growing economic slack, the B ank of Mexico  cut its policy r ate 25 basis points. 
Brazilian real GDP jumped 6  percent in the second quarter, 3½ percentage points 
above our July Tealbook estimate, boosted by a sharp rebound in exports.  But recent indicators have worsened —exports contracted in July and August and PMI s weakened 
further through August.  Moreover, there are signs that recent financial stresses are weighing on the economy.  In July, consumer confidence fell sharply , credit growth 
slowed, and the cost of credit rose further for households and firms.  Accor dingly, we 
expect real GDP growth to average 1¼ percent in the second half of the year before gradually rising to 3¾ percent by 2016, as financial conditions slowly improve and growth in the advanced economies strengthens further.  This projection is marked down from the previous Tealbook, especially in the near term, on higher financial stresses and tighter monetary policy conditions. 
We estimate that inflation in Brazil moderated further to an annual rate of 
4¾ percent in the current quarter from almost 6  percent in the second quarter , reflecting a 
decline in food prices  after earlier increases.  Despite this moderation and a further 
tightening of monetary policy, we project inflation to pick up again to 5¾ percent over 
the next few quarters —a somewhat hig her forecast than we wrote down in the July 
Tealbook—because of the pass -through from substantial past  depreciation of the real .  
Thereafter, we see inflation settling at about 5¼  percent.

Financial Developments 
Market expectations that the Committ ee will begin to cut the pace of asset 
purchases at the September meeting appeared to  increase over the inte rmeeting period.  In 
addition, the implied path for the federal funds rate priced into derivatives markets shifted 
up, apparently reflecting in part wider te rm premiums associated with increased 
uncertainty about the monetary policy outlook.  Reflecting these developments, interest 
rates moved up and the foreign exchange va lue of the dollar increased slightly.  
 Responses to the Survey of Primary Deal ers suggest that market participants 
have marked up somewhat the odds that  the FOMC will begin to cut the pace 
of asset purchases at the September m eeting.  Views on the likely size of the 
reduction (conditional on its occurring) were unchanged, with a $10 billion 
reduction for Treasury securities and a $5 billion reduction for MBS seen as 
most likely. 
 Five- and 10-year Treasury yields ro se about 40 basis points and 35 basis 
points, respectively, over the period.  In creased uncertainty  about the policy 
outlook, along with investors’ apparent tendency to view a lower path for 
asset purchases as likely to be associ ated with a higher path for the federal 
funds rate, reportedly contributed to the rise in yields.  Yields on corporate 
bonds and agency MBS rose about in line with those on Treasury securities.  Concerns about the U.S. debt limit have  left no significant imprint in markets 
thus far.  
 Equity prices over the period were fairly  volatile but, on net, little changed.   
 The foreign exchange value of the dolla r increased a bit less than 1 percent 
over the period, with most of the gains coming against emerging market currencies.  Many emerging market economies continued to experience 
financial turbulence, partly  in response to the hei ghtened expectations of 
policy normalization in th e United States and other advanced economies.  
 
 The available data suggest that aggregate borrowing by households and 
nonfinancial firms has been fairly resilient in the face of higher interest rates, 
but the full effects of hi gher rates on borrowing have probably not yet shown 
through.

 TREASURY AND OTHER BENCHMARK YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
Five-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury yields increased  about 40, 35, and 25 basis 
points, respectively, over the intermeeting peri od.  These increases came amid somewhat 
higher expectations among market participants that the FOMC will begin to cut the pace 
of large-scale asset purchases at its September meeting and greater uncertainty about the 
outlook for monetary policy.     
The federal funds rate path implied by a st raight read of financial market quotes 
steepened notably during the period, and in termediate-horizon forward interest rates 
showed pronounced increases.1  A staff model that accounts for the zero lower bound on 
nominal interest rates attributes a substantial portion of the shift in the implied federal 
funds rate path to higher term premiums, c onsistent with the rise in option-implied 
measures of uncertainty about the future traj ectory for the federal funds rate.  Market 
commentary suggested that a portion of this in creased uncertainty may be attributable to 
investors’ sense that potential changes in Fe deral Reserve leadership could influence the 
Committee’s approach to monetary policy.  Moreover, some investors apparently 
continued to revise up their expectations for the federal funds rate, as they placed higher 
odds on a reduction in asset purchases. 
In contrast to the market-based quotes, the results from the Open Market Desk’s 
September Survey of Primary Dealers showed little change in the projected liftoff date 
for the federal funds rate and the subsequent path of the policy rate  relative to the July 
survey.  The median expectation of the mostly  likely time of the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate remained at the th ird quarter of 2015.  Compared with the July 
survey, the median dealer is a bit more confident that the FOMC will begin to cut the 
pace of asset purchases at its September meeting.  Among those who expect a reduction 
in September, the median dealer now expect s a cut of $10 billion in Treasury securities 
and $5 billion in MBS purchases, unchanged from  the July survey.  In a special question, 
dealers were asked to rate the importance of a range of factors that potentially contributed 
to the recent increase in the 10-year Treasury yield.  Dealers rated “change in market 
perception of appropriate polic y rate path,” “uncertainty  over monetary policy,” and 
“uncertainty over Federal Reserve leadership succession” as the most important factors 
driving the increase in  the 10-year yield. 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 8 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

 In addition to these developments, hei ghtened tensions in Syria reportedly 
triggered intermittent flight-to-safety flow s, resulting in some downward pressure on 
Treasury yields.  The perceived odds and potential scale of a U.S. intervention have 
fluctuated but seemed to have diminished  significantly by the end of the period.   
Market dynamics such as deleveragin g, convexity hedging, and crowded trades 
that were thought to have amplified the increas es in longer-term intere st rates earlier in 
the summer appear to have moderated in August and September.  Indeed, mortgage 
convexity-hedging flows have reportedly been small, and the pace of net redemptions from bond funds—though still significant—slow ed over the intermeeting period.  That 
said, anecdotes from some market participants  suggest that the reba lancing process that 
has been associated with the re cent increase in interest rates ma y not yet be complete.     
Agency MBS yields and interest rates in the primary mortgage market rose about 
in line with the 10-year Treasury yield, endi ng the period approximately 30 basis points 
higher at about 3.7 percent and 4.55 percent,  respectively.  Yields on investment- and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds also rose about in line with those on Treasury 
securities of comparable maturity.  In a ddition, yields on Treasury inflation-protected 
securities (TIPS) followed those on nominal Treasury securities, leaving TIPS-based 
inflation compensation little changed, on net, over the in termeeting period. 
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
The Treasury continued to operate unde r a “debt issuance suspension period,” 
which allows it to use accounting measures to remain below the statutory debt limit while 
issuing new securities.2  Consistent with the staff’ s view, the Treasury announced on 
August 26 its expectation that these accounting measures will be exhausted in  
mid-October, and that thereaf ter, the Treasury would be forced to fund the government 
only with the cash on hand on any given day.  Yields on Treasury bills maturing after 
October 15 suggest that market participants have not thus far pri ced in any financial 
                                                 
2 In the latest quarterly refunding statement, th e Treasury announced that it expected to reduce 
auction sizes in the two- and three-year nominal sector over the coming quarter in light of improvement in 
the fiscal outlook.  It also anticipated that the first auction of floating-rate notes (FRNs) would be in January 2014.  The Treasury FRNs ar e expected to provide several benefits to the market, including 
assisting the Treasury in managing the maturity profile of the nation’s marketable debt, expanding the Treasury’s investor base, and helping to finance the government at the lowest cost.  Treasury FRNs will 
have a two-year maturity and an interest rate that is  reset daily; the rate from  the most current 13-week 
Treasury bill auction will serv e as the reference rate.

 market disruptions from the potential debt-limit breach (see the box “Debt Subject to 
Limit”).  
The Desk continued outright purchases of  Treasury securities and agency MBS as 
liquidity in the latter market improved mode stly but remained below long-term averages.3  
The spread between the executed and the sec ond-most-favorable price offered in Federal 
Reserve MBS operations—a measure of liqui dity—narrowed a bit compared with the 
widest level reached during the preceding in termeeting period.  That said, the average 
MBS trade size continued to be smaller than it was at the start of th e year amid continued 
volatility in the market, fewer mortgage or iginations, and light summer trading.  Dollar-
roll implied financing rates for 30-year Fannie Mae 3.5 percent and 4.0 percent coupon 
securities stayed near their recent high levels, suggesting limited settlement pressure in 
the TBA market for these securities, and the Desk engaged in less dollar roll activity 
during the July and August settlement cycles than earlier in the year.4 
DOMESTIC EQUITY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Equity prices trended down, on net, in Augus t, as investors appeared to have been 
focused primarily on the tighter outlook for mone tary policy and the risks associated with 
a wider conflict in Syria.  However, the decl ine was fully retraced later in the period as 
concerns about Syria ebbed and the news on economic activity in China improved on net.  
The VIX, an index of options-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 
index, was little changed, on net, during the period, and the equity risk premium—as 
measured by the difference between the staff’s es timate of the expected equity return for 
the S&P 500 index and the expected real  10-year Treasury yield—was also about 
unchanged.  Gross equity issuance by nonfinanci al firms remained solid, boosted in part 
by a surge in initial public offerings.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, investors cont inued to pull back from exposure to 
the emerging market economies (EMEs) against a backdrop of higher interest rates in the 
                                                 
3 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purc hased $58 billion of Treasury securities and  
$88 billion of agency MBS, including the reinvestment of principal payments from agency debt and MBS 
holdings. 
4 The Desk began purchasing 4.5 percent coupon agency MBS this intermeeting period, which are 
currently scheduled to settle in November.

 Debt Subject to Limit 
The U.S. Treasury  is operating  under a debt issuance suspension  period (DISP) and  
using extraordinary  measures  to avoid breaching  the statuatory  debt limit of 
$16.699 trillion.1  The Board  staff estimates  that $29 billion remain of the roughly 
$305 billion in extraordinary  measures,  implying,  as shown in the top figure on the 
next page, that the Treasury  can continue  operations  and not breach the debt ceiling 
until at least mid‐October.2  Consistent  with this projection,  in a letter to the Congress 
on August 26, Secretary  of the Treasury  Lew noted that the Treasury  expects to 
exhaust extraordinary  measures  in the middle of October.  However,  forecasts  for the 
breach date are inherently  uncertain,  in part reflecting  difficulties  in predicting  
Treasury nonmarketable  debt issuances  and September  corporate  tax payments.3   
Market participants  do not thus far appear  to be pricing in any financial market 
disruptions  as a result of the looming debt limit breach.  For example,  as shown in  the 
bottom figure on the next page, Treasury  bill yields  around the projected  breach date 
do not exhibit noticeable  spikes around mid‐October.  Similarly,  spreads on one ‐year 
and five‐year U.S. credit default swaps are little changed  over the  intermeeting  period.  
That said, in  past debt limit episodes, stresses  in these measures  usually did not 
emerge until a debt limit breach appeared  imminent.    
Fitch Ratings  recently stated that failure to reach agre ement on raising the debt limit 
in a timely manner would prompt a review of  the U.S. sovereign  credit rating.  
However, S&P  raised the outlook on the U.S. government’s  credit rating from 
negative to stable  in June, under the assumption  that the debt limit would be raised 
without any market disruptions.   Simila rly, Moody’s  changed  the outlook on its U.S. 
sovereign  bond rating from negative  to stable in July, with no mention of  debt limit 
concerns.    
 
                                                 
1 On May 20, 2013, the Treasury declared a three‐month DISP that was extended  by two  months 
on August 2, 2013.  The Treasury is allowed to use the following  accounting  measures:   suspend daily 
reinvestment  of the Treasury securities  held by the Government  Securities  Investment  Fund 
($160 billion), redeem existing investments  and suspend new investment  in the Civil Servi ce 
Retirement  and Disability  Fund ($115 billion), suspend the daily reinvestment  of dollar  balances held 
by the Exchange  Stabilization  Fund into Treasury securities  ($23 billion), and suspend new 
investments  in the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund ($5 billion).   
2 The staff projection  assumes  the Treasury’s  net bill issuance falls to near zero in the second 
half of October and coupon issuance patterns in October remain in line with recent months’ 
issuances.   The breach date could  be extended  by at most a couple of weeks if the Treasury 
decreased  net coupon issuance,  which would be a notable deviation  from its “regular and 
predictable”  debt management  strategy.   The smaller  amount of net coupon issuance would keep 
debt  subject to limit  under  the ceiling,  but drain the Treasury’s  cash balance.   The Treasury’s  cash 
balance would fall and could possibly allow  the government  to operate  until late October. 
3 Nonmarketable  debt  includes the Federal  Old‐Age and Survivors  Insurance  Trust Fund (Social 
Security)  and the Civil Service Retirement  and Disability  Fund.

 advanced economies, some improvement in the outlook for Europe, and slowing growth 
in the EMEs themselves.  As a result, flows out of EME bond and equity funds, which had been substantial in June, continued through early September, though at a more 
moderate pace.  On a trade-weighted basis,  EME currencies have depreciated a bit less 
than 1 percent against the dolla r since the July FOMC meeting.  The currencies of Brazil, 
India, Indonesia, and Turkey continued to depreciate sharply agai nst the dollar through 
August but have since retraced some of these declines.  In response to market pressures, 
some governments took actions to support thei r currencies, including tightening monetary 
policy, modifying capital controls, and purchasin g their currencies in foreign exchange 
markets.  EME sovereign yields and CDS prem iums on sovereign debt increased over the 
period, particularly in those c ountries experiencing the sharpest  currency depreciations.  
EMEs that have experienced disappointing growth, high inflati on, or large current 
account deficits have come under the greatest market pressure (see the box “Financial 
Distress and Vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Economies” in the International 
Economic Developments and Outlook section).  
Sovereign yields in the United Kingdom a nd Germany continued to rise as data 
on economic activity in Europe generally came in  above market expectations.  As in the 
United States, the rise in yi elds appears to have reflect ed increases in both policy 
expectations and term premiums.  OIS rates at the one- to two-year maturity rose in the 
euro area and the United Kingdom despite the recent provision of forward guidance by 
central banks in both economies that seems to  preclude any near-term rise in policy rates 
(see the box “Forward Guidance by the Bank of England” in the International Economic 
Developments and Outlook section).  Sovereign yield spreads in Spain and Italy declined 
during the period and European equity market s rose modestly.  On net over the period, 
the dollar was up slightly against the major currencies.   
Foreign official investor s, including those from the EMEs facing currency 
depreciation pressures, made substantial sale s of U.S. securities, especially Treasury 
securities, in June.  However, July data indi cate smaller sales of Treasury securities that 
were more than offset by purchases of agen cy debt, and recent data on custody holdings 
at the FRBNY suggest that foreign offici al investors continue d buying agencies in 
August.  Foreign private investors bought sm all amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and 
sold U.S. corporate securiti es in both June and July.

 SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS  
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets remained generally benign during 
the intermeeting period.  The spread betw een three-month LIBOR and comparable-
maturity OIS rates was about unchanged, and forward-looking measur es of funding stress 
were quiescent.  Although rates on U.S. unsecu red financial CP stepped up a bit in early 
September, they ended the period about unchanged.  In secured funding markets, 
overnight GCF repo rates continued to be low across collateral types, consistent with a 
reported scarcity of available collateral and reduced financing activities of dealers.  
Responses to the September 2013 Senior  Credit Officer Opinion Survey on 
Dealer Financing Terms generally  suggested little change over  the past three months in 
the credit terms applicable to most classes of counterparties covered by the survey.  One 
notable exception was that ne arly one-fourth of the deal ers reported tightening nonprice 
terms offered to trading REITs.  Respondents noted that the use of financial leverage by 
most classes of counterparties remained larg ely unchanged during this  period.  That said, 
a moderate net fraction of respondents reported  a decline in financial-leverage use by 
hedge funds, and a more substantial net fract ion of dealers reported a decrease in 
financial-leverage use by trading REITs.  About one-fourth of res pondents also indicated 
that demand for funding for agency MBS had decreased somewhat.  In response to special questions in the survey, dealers indicated that liqui dity and functioning 
deteriorated in a number of  fixed-income markets duri ng the period of heightened 
volatility from May to early July.  These ma rkets included those for Treasury securities 
and agency MBS, which are typically perceived to be the most liquid and deep, as well as 
those for TIPS and corporate bonds.  
Stocks prices for financial-sector firms underperformed the broad equity market 
somewhat over the intermeeting period.  That  said, CDS spreads for the largest bank 
holding companies remained stable at levels near the bottom of their range over the past 
five years. 
BORROWING BY THE NONFINANCIAL SECTORS  
The available data suggest that aggreg ate borrowing by nonfinancial businesses, 
households, and municipal governments has been  fairly resilient in the face of higher 
longer-term interest rates.  However, the full effects of higher ra tes on borrowing have 
probably not yet shown through.

 Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained robust, as the overall credit 
quality of nonfinancial corporations stayed so lid.  Relative to typical summer lulls, gross 
issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged lo ans was robust in August, while commercial 
and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books cont inued to expand moderately, on average, 
in July and August.  Moreover, available re ports from firms on their bond-financing plans 
suggest that gross issuance will likely pick up further in the coming months.  Commercial 
real estate (CRE) loans at banks accele rated over the summer, and CMBS issuance 
remained strong despite a slight wi dening of CMBS spreads.     
News about the home mortgage market has been mixed.  While refinancing 
applications plunged with the rise in longer-te rm interest rates, applications for purchase 
mortgages declined modestly.  Anecdotes from the mortgage industry are broadly 
consistent with the aggregate applicati ons data:  Although several lenders have 
announced layoffs in response to the decline in refinancing activit y, lenders reportedly do 
not anticipate a persistent decline in purch ase mortgage originations, which appear to 
have been supported by labor market im provements and pent-up housing demand.  
Indeed, although the pace of home price appreci ation moderated a bit in July, it has so far 
remained robust despite higher in terest rates, with  national house price indexes increasing 
between 6 and 12 percent from a year earlier.   A better read on the full effects of higher 
interest rates on household borrowing is e xpected to be available in the fall. 
In terms of nonmortgage credit, auto a nd student loans both continued to expand 
rapidly in recent months, while revolving cr edit balances stayed about flat, reflecting 
still-tight credit conditions in many segments  of the credit card ma rket.  Consumer ABS 
issuance remained robust in Ju ly and August as ABS yield sp reads stabilized at levels 
somewhat wider than earlier this year. 
Regarding the municipal bond market, de spite persistent outflows from  
tax-exempt bond funds, ongoing bankruptcy proceed ings for Detroit, and greater scrutiny 
of Puerto Rico’s significant fiscal problem s, few signs of widespread distress emerged 
during the intermeeting period.  Broad mark et sentiment was reportedly buoyed by a 
further modest easing of budget pressures for many other states and localities.  Gross 
issuance of long-term municipa l bonds remained solid in August, and yield ratios on 
general obligation municipal bonds over comp arable-duration Treasury securities were, 
on balance, about unchanged.

 COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY  
Bank credit declined in July and Augus t amid the ongoing rise in longer-term 
interest rates.  Growth in loan categories such  as C&I, CRE, and auto that are more likely 
to have floating interest ra tes or relatively short matur ities—and therefore less duration 
risk—has tended to hold up in recent months.  Indeed, according to the August Survey of 
Terms of Business Lending, inte rest rates and loan rate sp reads on newly originated C&I 
loans declined amid ongoing competition among banks for such assets.  In contrast, assets with longer duration—including reside ntial mortgages and some securities—have 
decreased.  Net unrealized ga ins on banks’ holdings of ava ilable-for-sale securities 
decreased somewhat further in July and August.   
M2 expanded fairly rapidly in July and August as the sharp selloff in fixed-
income markets that began in June, along w ith the associated out flows from bond funds, 
likely continued to support real locations to M2 assets.  The monetary base continued to 
expand rapidly, primarily reflecting the increas e in reserve balances resulting from the 
Federal Reserve’s asset purchases.
5  The accumulation of reserve balances over the 
period left the stock of balances last mont h about evenly split between those held by 
domestic institutions and those held by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. 
                                                 
5 During the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve conducted its third fixed-rate, full-allotment 
offering of term deposits under the Term Deposit Facility (TDF).  Tenders totaled $11.7 billion at a rate of 
26 basis points, with 25 depository institutions particip ating.  Participation in TD F operations has increased 
coincident with the change in format and staff outr each.  As a result, the depository institutions (DIs) 
participating in the most recent operations together hold a larger portion of total excess reserve balances 
than the pool of DIs that partic ipated in earlier operations.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projection for economic activity 
as roughly normal relative to the experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by  
the FOMC), a period that includes considerable volatility .1  We see a number of risks  
attending our forecast, including those posed by an intensification of economic and 
financial stresses in emerging  market  economies  (EMEs)  or the euro area;  the need to lift 
the federal debt limit and settle on annual budget appropriations in the coming months; and the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions  in recent months will exert 
greater restraint on the recovery , particul arly in the housing sector , than we project.  A 
related concern is the ability of the economy to weather future negative shocks, as  
monetary policy has  a limited capacit y to counteract the effects of any new adverse 
developments.  Given these considerations, we continue to believe that the risks to domestic economic activity are  skewed to the downside.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook has been informed by the staff’s 
recently completed quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment of  vulnerabilities in the 
financial system, which concluded that developments over the summer had mixed and largely offsetting  implications for financial stability .  On the one hand, the sharp rise in 
interest rates and the associated outflows from bond funds eased concerns about 
overvaluation in some fixed-income markets and reduced some of the momentum toward 
greater risk -taking.  On the other hand, some developments this summer —including 
continued strong demand for risky business credits, forced asset sales by some levered 
investors, and reduced liquidity provision by dealers during the period of market 
volatility —highlighted the presence of channels that could amplify future shocks.  T he 
September  QS assessment reiterated the financial system’s vulnerabilities stemming from 
                                                 
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past 
several years.  In particular, as the fixed 20 -year window used to assess the size of typical forecast errors 
has moved forward to include the experience of the past five years, the estimated standard errors for out -
year projections of the unemployment rate almost doubled between 2008 and 2011 and have remained at 
this higher level with the current 20 -year sample.  As a result, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty about 
economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great Moderation period.  In contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged relative to earlier sample 
periods.

 the complexity and interconnectedness of large financial institutions and from structural 
issues in wholesale short- term funding markets.  Nonetheless,  it suggested that current 
vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system are not unusually pronounced, in large part 
because, relative to the period before the crisis  and regulatory reform, loss-absorbing 
capital  has increased , and the reliance on short-term funding and the exposure of financial 
institutions to household credit risk have decreased.     
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Long er-run inflation 
expectations appear to  have remained stable in recent years despite  large fluctuations in 
the prices of crude oil and other commodit ies and persistently wide margins of slack in 
labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as broadly balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility that the soft  readings  on 
inflation  seen  earlier this year could reemerge if  low levels of resource utilization or 
subdued increases in unit labor costs persist longer or have larger effects than we currently project.  On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a stronger- than-expected recovery or a larger amount of damage to the supply side 
of the economy than assumed in the baseline. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of  staff models.   In the first 
scenario, long- term interest rates are  persisten tly higher than in the baseline, restrain ing 
activity in  the housing sector  and boosting the dollar relative to the baseline.  The second 
scenario  considers the possibility that the substantial decline in the unemployment rate 
seen over the past year  is a more accurate signal of the pace of the recovery than the 
modest gains in real GDP , and that going forward GDP accelerates more markedly .  In 
the third scenario , by contrast, the combination of steady declines in the unemployment 
rate and tepid GDP growth seen over recent quarters reflects  greater damage to the supply 
side than assumed in the baseline.  The fourth  scenario considers the risk that the softness 
in consumer price inflation  seen earlier this year  will prove to be more persistent than 
expected .  The final  two scenarios explore risks  to the U.S.  economy from foreign 
economic developments—in the fif th scenario , recent financial stresses experienced by

 EMEs  escalate into a full-blown crisis, and in the six th, geopolitical tensions lead to a 
sharp run-up in oil prices.   
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and th e last two  
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations , as in the baseline 
forecast,  the federal funds rate follows  an inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
subject to  the FOMC’s thresholds for the  unemployment rate and projected inflation .  For  
the SIGMA simulations , we use a broadly similar  policy rule, subject to the same 
thresholds, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.2  In all cases, we 
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Higher Interest Rates with Housing Spillovers 
Over the past six months, long er-term interest rates have  moved markedly higher 
than we had expected .  In this scenario, we assume Treasury yields once again surprise 
us.  Specifically, longer -term interest rates are assumed to run persistently above the 
baseline and are about 75 basis p oints higher by early next year, causing the dollar to 
appreciate about 2½ percent relative to the baseline by 2014.  Moreover, and in contrast 
to the baseline forecast, we assume that these increases in yields have a sharp depressing effect on housing activity.
3  House prices decelerate sharply through late 2015 and are 
10 percent below baseline by 2016.  These developments  shave about ¾ percentage point 
off the average annual growth rate of real GDP through 2015.  T he unemployment rate 
remains above 6½ percent until late 2015, at which point total inflation is still run ning 
below 1½ percent.  The shortfall in economic performance relative to the baseline causes  
the first increase in the federal funds rate to be delayed until the second quarter of 2016.    
Faster Recovery 
Real GDP has grown only modestly over the past few years, and yet the 
unemployment rate  has declined substantially .  In the staff baseline projection , we have 
interpreted the weak readings on GDP as result ing from headwinds that will continue to 
restrain  aggregate demand going forward.  A n alternative possibility is that the recent 
                                                 
2 The SIGMA policy rule us es a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence o f slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 gains in real GDP growth have been unders tating the true strength of the economy, and 
other indicators—such as GDI and labor mark et conditions—have in fact been sending a 
clearer signal.  In this scenario, the improvements seen in household wealth and 
consumer sentiment over the past year lead to a more rapid pickup in consumer spending 
than in the baseline projecti on.  Real GDP rises at an annua l rate of 4 percent in the 
second half of this year and about 3½ percent on average over 2014 and 2015; the 
unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent by mid-2014 and reaches its natural rate of  
5.2 percent by early 2016.  With  resource slack decreasing mo re rapidly, wages and unit 
labor costs accelerate gradually relative to the baseline; howev er, with long-term inflation 
expectations assumed to remain well anchor ed, consumer price inflation rises to only 
2 percent by 2018.  The federal funds rate lif ts off from its effective lower bound by the 
third quarter of 2014.      
Supply-Side Damage 
In this scenario, the observations of sluggish real GDP growth and a falling 
unemployment rate in recent ye ars indicate not that the esti mates of GDP understate the 
strength of the economy, as in the previous  scenario, but rather that the damage to 
aggregate supply during the past several years is greater than is assumed in the baseline.  
Accordingly, potential output is assumed to have expanded at an annual rate of only 
1¼ percent since 2011, ½ percentage  point lower than in the baseline, and continues to 
rise more slowly than in the baseline through 2018.  As a result, the current output gap is 
1½ percentage points narrower th an in the baseline.  Real GDP rises at a rate of  
2½ percent per year, on average, through 2015, but the unemployment rate nonetheless 
continues to decline at roughly the same p ace as it has since late 2010 and falls below 
6½ percent by the th ird quarter of 2014.4  With resource slack s ubstantially narrower and 
productivity gains smaller than in the baseline, inflation rises to 2 percent by 2016, and 
the federal funds rate begins to rise from its  effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of 
2014, two quarters earlier than  in the baseline.    
Low Inflation 
In the baseline forecast, the low readings on core inflation seen  earlier this year 
are assumed to have been partially transito ry, and over the next few years, inflation 
gradually moves back toward 2 percent.  In  this scenario, the recent performance of 
                                                 
4 Although the projection of the unemployment rate is lower than in the baseline, living standards 
are lower in this scenario as a result of slower productivity growth.

 inflation proves to be a harbinger of a longer- lasting decline in actual inflation , bring ing 
down lo nger-run inflation expectations and thereby leading to a mutually reinforcing 
downward dynamic .  Inflation is  below 1 percent next year and edges down further 
thereafter , falling  close to zero .  In this environment, investors become increasingly 
concerned that the economy is mired in a weak state with price behavior verging on 
deflation and monetary policy remaining constrained by the effective lower bound for the 
federal funds rate.  As a res ult, bond premiums rise and put upward pressure on real long-
term interest rates, modestly restraining household and business spending and boosting 
unemployment relative to the bas eline over the next few years.  While the unemployment 
rate falls below its 6 ½ percent threshold in the third quarter of 2015, the policy rule does 
not prescribe the first increase in the federal funds rate until the third quarter of 2016.  By then, the unemployment rate is nearly at its natural rate.  But given the persistent downward shift in inflation expectations, inflation remains well below the FOMC’s long -
run objective.  
Financial Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies  
Financial conditions in the EMEs have deteriorated over the past several months 
as EME growth has com e in weaker than anticipated and interest rates have risen in the 
advanced economies.  In our baseline, we expect these stresses to remain manageable, but the likelihood of more disruptive events has risen.  This scenario considers the possibility that financial stress in the EMEs intensifies markedly, precipitating a financial crisis in one or more of the most vulnerable economies which  then spills over to EMEs more 
broadly.  Sovereign and private borrowing costs in the EMEs soar, and the confidence of EME households and businesses weakens significantly.  These events cause EME 
currencies to depreciate more than 5 percent on average relative to the baseline, even 
though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates in order to attenuate capital outflows.  All told, real GDP in the EMEs declines 4½ percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2014.  
The financial stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to 
the rest of the world, including the United States:  Corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight- to-safety flows push down term 
premiums on government bond yields.  In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  As a result, U.S. real GDP growth drops to a meager 1¾ percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate stays 
above 7 percent through 2014 before beginning to gradually decline.  With substantially

 greater resource slack and lower import prices, overall U.S.  consumer price inflation 
slows to ½ percent in the second half of 2013 and to nearly zero  in 2014.  Under these 
conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound two quarters longer 
than in the baseline, until the end of 2015. 
Higher Oil Prices  
The escalating tensions in Syria and the political turmoil in Egypt have elevated 
the risk of an abrupt reduction in global oil supply.  In this scenario, we assume that greater geopolitical stresses and supply and transportation disruptions temporarily increase oil prices $35 per barrel above baseline at the end of this year, but that prices then partially recede, leveling out at $15 per barrel above baseline.
5  U.S. domestic 
demand falls relative to the baseline because higher oil prices red uce households’ real 
income and lower the return on firms’ investments, while real exports also decline because of weaker foreign economic activity.  U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 2½ percent, on average, in the second half of this year and next year —
¼ percentage point below baseline—and the unemployment rate is roughly 6¾ percent at the end of 2014, about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Reflecting the rise 
in energy costs, overall PCE inflation jumps to  4½ percent at an annual rate in the second 
half of this year.  However, because the public recognizes that the direct impetus of 
higher oil prices to inflation is only temporary, inflation expectations remain well anchored and actual inflation subsequently moves back to baseline.  In response to the partly offsetting implications for policy of higher inflation and weaker real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound at the same time as in the baseline but rises more gradually thereafter.  
                                                 
5 Financial markets appear to assign a fairly low weight to the possibility that oil prices will rise  
significantly more than envisioned in this scenario.  In particular, staff analysis u sing options on oil futures 
suggests a less than 5 percent chance that the price of crude oil will rise more than $35 relative to the 
Tealbook baseline by the end of this year.  Even so, much larger oil -price hikes seem conceivable in 
response to a range of possible geopolitical developments, including a more pervasive disruption of Middle 
East production than is captured in our scenario .

Note: "Staff" represents Tealbook forecast errors applied to the Tealbook baseline; baselines for FRB/US, BVAR, EDO, and 
the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are 
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet 
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget 
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2005) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
