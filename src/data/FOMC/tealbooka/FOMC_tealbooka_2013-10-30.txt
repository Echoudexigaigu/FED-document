Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Based on the news we have received si nce the previous Tealbook—which is more 
limited than normal because of the data delays caused by the federal government 
shutdown—economic activity appears to have been increasing a little more slowly than 
we had expected.  Spending by consumers a ppears to have risen less than we had 
anticipated, and we think a portion of this weakness will persist through the end of the 
year.  In addition, the direct and indirect effects of the gove rnment shutdown are expected 
to temporarily reduce economic growth by an annual rate of about ½ percentage point in 
the current quarter.  We now pr oject that real GDP will rise at  an annual rate of just over 
2 percent in both the third and fourth quarters, which, coupled with the downward 
revisions to the second quarter, leave real GDP  growth in 2013 at 2 percent, ¼ percentage 
point less than the September forecast.  
We have slightly revised up our forecas t for real GDP growth over the medium 
term, however, as recent financial market developments have led us to adjust our key 
conditioning assumptions for the foreign exchange  value of the dollar, interest rates, and 
household wealth to be a bit more supportive of economic growth than in the September 
Tealbook.  Combining the weaker economic grow th anticipated for this year and the 
slightly stronger projected pace of economic expa nsion in the next two years, the level of 
real GDP at the end of 2016 is expected to be  just a little lower than in the September 
Tealbook. 
We read the employment report for Septem ber as a bit weaker, on balance, than 
we expected, but it and the other labor market  data remain broadly consistent with our 
projection of continued gradual improvements in labor market conditions.  As in our 
September Tealbook forecast, the unemployment rate is projected to cross the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold in the firs t quarter of 2015 and to end 2016 at just 
under 5½ percent.   
The limited data that we have received on consumer prices have been largely as 
we had anticipated.

to be published on October 30, the second day of the FOMC meeting.

  projected pickup in import prices over th e medium term, and gradually diminishing 
margins of slack in labor and product market s anticipated over the next few years, we 
expect core PCE inflation to increase slowly  from 1¼ percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 
2016; this forecast is the same as in the September Tealbook.  We continue to expect 
energy prices to edge down over the forecast period, and thus headline inflation still is 
projected to run a bit below core  inflation over the medium term. 
As always, numerous risks surround our outlook.  We see se veral risks stemming 
from federal fiscal policy, including the uncertain repercussions of the ongoing budget 
consolidation and tax increases put in place at  the beginning of this year, the potential for 
greater fallout from the government shutdown, and the uncertain path for fiscal policy 
going forward.  Regarding private demand, consumer spending growth could remain sluggish and not pick up as we anticipate, a nd the increase in mortgage rates since the 
spring could weigh on residentia l construction by more than we currently expect.  Also, 
the pace of economic activity abroad continues to be a substantial risk, especially given 
the vulnerabilities of ma ny emerging market economies (EMEs).  However, it is possible, 
as suggested by the most recent four-quarter change in GDI, that economic activity has in 
fact been rising more rapidly than indicated  by the current GDP data.  With regard to 
inflation, the very low rates of core inflation seen earlier this year appear to have passed 
as expected, but some risk remains that infl ation could stay stubbornl y low.  That said, 
there is also the risk that inflation coul d pick up by more than we expect, perhaps 
stemming from an unanticipated and persiste nt firming in energy or other commodity 
prices.  Finally, with the federal funds rate  at its effective lowe r bound, monetary policy 
likely has less capacity to counteract the eff ects of downside developments with respect 
to either real activity or inflation. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 With the unemployment rate still projected to fall below the Committee’s 6½ percent threshold in the first quarter  of 2015, we continue to assume that 
the federal funds rate will begin to ri se from its effective lower bound in the 
second quarter of 2015.  The path of the fe deral funds rate after liftoff is also 
about unchanged from the September T ealbook, averaging 2 percent in the 
final quarter of 2016.

   Our assumption for asset purchases is  also broadly unchanged from the 
September Tealbook, as we continue to assume that purchases of long-term 
securities under the current LSAP program will end by the middle of 2014.  
However, we nudged up the cumulative amount of purchases under this 
program by about $90 billion, to $1.3 trillion.  
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield has fall en about 40 basis points since the 
September Tealbook.  We attribute about ha lf of that declin e to a shift in 
market expectations toward more accommodative paths for both Federal 
Reserve asset purchases and the federal f unds rate.  Market pa rticipants appear 
to expect somewhat more accommodative monetary policy than is consistent 
with staff assumptions, and we anticipate that market expectations will move 
into line with our forecast over time.   The remainder of the decline in 
Treasury yields since the September T ealbook reflects a reduction in the term 
premium beyond what we think can be ascr ibed to a change in expectations 
for asset purchases and has led us to  revise down our projection for the 
10-year Treasury yield over the next several quarters. 
 Over the medium term, the forecast stil l calls for Treasury yields to rise 
significantly, primarily to reflect the movement of the 10-year valuation 
window through the period of extremely lo w short-term interest rates and a 
gradual waning of the effects of th e FOMC’s balance sheet policies.  
 Yields on investment-grade corpor ate bonds and rates on conventional 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages have fallen roughly in line with yields on 
comparable maturity Treasury securities.  As a result, our forecasts for 
corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium term have been 
revised essentially in line with Treasury yields. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have risen about 4 pe rcent since the time of the September 
Tealbook, about 3 percentage points more than we anticipated.  We have 
carried forward the higher stock prices over the next few quarters, but because we think that the recent gains largely reflect a narrowing of the equity risk 
premium that we anticipate d to occur later in the pr ojection, our forecast for

  stock prices is essentially unrevised by the end of 2016.  As in the September 
Tealbook, we expect stock prices to m ove up at an average annual rate of 
about 7½ percent over the next few years—a pace that, we think, will move 
the equity risk premium some wa y toward more typical levels. 
 House prices have risen by a bit more than we projected in the September 
Tealbook, and we now expect them to rise at an annual rate of 9½ percent 
over the second half of this year.  We continue to expect a slowing in house 
price appreciation to an average rate of  about 4 percent per year from 2014 to 
2016. 
Fiscal Policy 
 The federal government was partially shut down from October 1 through 
October 16 because of a temporary laps e in budget appropriations for the 
current fiscal year.  Beyond the near-ter m effects of the shutdown, the staff’s 
assumptions for fiscal policy are little  changed.  (See the box “Fiscal Policy 
Developments” for a discussion of th e continuing budget resolution and the 
extension of the federal debt limit that ended the shutdown, along with our 
estimates of the effects of the shutdown on economic activity.)   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Our outlook for total foreign economic gr owth is little changed from the 
September Tealbook.  Real GDP growth in the foreign economies is estimated to have moved up to an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the third quarter, 
supported by a pickup in the EMEs.  L ooking ahead, foreign GDP is expected 
to increase to 3¼ percent next year and 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, 
supported by waning fiscal drag and further improvement of financial 
conditions in the euro area, the effe ct on EME exports of stronger economic 
growth in the advanced economies, a nd a gradual abatement of financial 
stresses in the most vulnerable EMEs.   
 The broad nominal dollar index depr eciated about 1¾ percent since the 
previous Tealbook, having declined ag ainst the currencies of both the 
advanced foreign economies and the EMEs .  We project that the broad real 
dollar will depreciate at an  annual rate of about 2¼ percent over the medium 
term, in part reflecting a further abatemen t of financial stress in the euro area.

 Fiscal Policy Developments 
Political wrangling  over budget appropriations  for fiscal  year 2014  and the federal debt limit 
led to a partial shutdown of  the federal government.   The shutdown  ended when a 
temporary  continuing  resolution  was passed to fund the government  programs covered  by 
discretionary  appropriations  through January 15.  During  the shutdown,  about half of 
defense civilian workers were  furloughed  for one week and about 40 percent of nondefense  
civilian workers were  furloughed  for almost  two and a half weeks.  We estimate that  the 
reduction in  hours worked by these federal employees  will reduce  real government  output, 
subtracting  0.3 percentage  point from the annual  rate  of real GDP growth in  the fourth 
quarter of 2013 and  boosting  economic  growth by the same amount in the first quarter of 
2014 as government output  returns to baseline.1  Because  government  employees  will be 
paid retroactively  for the days they  were furloughed,  nominal compensation  will be 
unaffected  by the shutdown and  the GDP deflator will be increased  by the same amount 
that real GDP  will be decreased.   Government purchases  for goods  and services excluding  
compensation  were also reduced during the shutdown,  but we assume that these purchases  
will be made up before the end of the year.  However,  there is some risk that the disruptions  
in federal purchases  could last longer than we have assumed.  
The temporary  continuing  resolution  funds the government  at levels consistent  with 
maintaining  the full effects of  the budget caps  and sequestration.   We assume that the 
Congress will  pass legislati on to fund the government  at levels consistent  with the 
sequestration  through the rest of the fiscal year without  further shutdowns.2  The Congress 
also reached an agreement to raise  the federal debt  limit through February  7 (though this 
limit will likely  not be binding until the middle of 2014).  We  assume that the debt limit will 
eventually  be extended  for a longer  period before significant  market disruptions  occur.   
Our assumptions  for fiscal policy beyond the near term are similar  to those in  the September  
Tealbook.   Specifically,  we continue to assume  that the sequestration  and spending  caps 
from the Budget Control Act will remain  in effect and, together  with further downward  
pressure on defense expenditures  from reduced overseas  military operations,  will restrain  
discretionary  federal spend ing over the  medium term.  Moreover,  we continue  to anticipate  
some small degree  of additional  fiscal tightening  from higher taxes and lower mandatory  
spending  as the bonus depreciation  provisions  for businesses  and the Emergency  
Unemployment  Compensation  program  end at the beginning  of next year.  Our estimate of  
total fiscal impetus, which excludes  multiplier  effects, indicates  that changes in federal, 
state, and local fiscal policies will subtract  1.1 percentage points  from real GDP  growth in 
2013, 0.6 percentage point in  2014, 0.3 percentage point  in 2015, and  will be roughly neutral 
for economic  growth in 2016; these assumptions  are little changed  from the September  
Tealbook  forecast.   
                                                 
1 These  direct  effects  plus the spillover  effects  of the shutdown  into private‐ sector spending  are 
expected,  in total, to reduce real GDP growth by about  ½ percentage  point in the fourth quarter  and then to 
add ½ percentage  point  to GDP growth in the first quarter  of next year.   
2 Starting January 15, the level of funding consistent  with the sequestration  will be about  $20 billion 
lower than in 2013.

  This pace is a little slower than we had projected in the September Tealbook, 
but the recent decl ine in the dollar  leaves its level lower throughout the 
projection.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
 The spot price for Brent crude oil has d eclined slightly since the time of the 
September Tealbook, likely reflecting an eas ing of geopolitical tensions in the 
Middle East, although futures prices for o il at longer-dated maturities are a 
little higher.  Consistent with thes e market developments, the price of 
imported oil is projected to fall from about $105 per barrel this quarter to 
$93 per barrel by the end of 2016, a flatter trajectory than in the September 
Tealbook.   
 A broad index of nonfuel commodity prices  has declined about 3 percent since 
the September Tealbook.  From this lower level, we expect prices to move up 
modestly over the projection period. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As a result of the federal governme nt shutdown, we have received fewer 
economic data releases than usual since the September Tealbook.  (See the box “Effects 
of the Government Shutdown on Economic Data” for more details.)  The information we 
did receive, particularly for consumer spendi ng, in conjunction with our estimates of the 
direct and spillover effects on economic activity  of the government shutdown, led us to 
reduce our forecast for real GDP growth in th e second half of the year by ¼ percentage 
point to an annual rate of just over 2 percent.2   
 With incoming data weaker than expected, we now estimate real PCE growth 
to have slowed in the third quarter to  an annual rate of  just 1½ percent.3  We 
continue to anticipate that the increa ses in net wealth and personal income, 
along with the waning effects of the tax increases put in place at the beginning 
of the year, will contribute to a pick up in spending growth in the fourth 
quarter.  However, the recent data on consumer outlays suggest a shallower 
                                                 
2 In addition, real GDP growth in the second quarter was revised down about ½ percentage point 
to an annual rate of 2½ percent. 
3 The retail sales report for September is now sche duled to be published on October 29, the first 
day of the FOMC meeting.

  trajectory moving into the quarter.  Also weighing on our projection for 
spending this quarter are a sizable dr op in September vehicle sales that 
appears likely to be only slightly revers ed this month, the decline in consumer 
sentiment in September and early Oct ober, and a small reduction in outlays 
related to the government shutdown.  In response, we have trimmed the 
forecast for real PCE growth in the curre nt quarter by ½ percentage point, to 
2½ percent. 
 The rise in mortgage rates since th e spring appears to be damping housing 
activity, but not by more than we ha d anticipated.  New home sales and 
applications for home purchase mort gages decreased modestly, on net, from 
June to August.  In addition, existing home sales edged down in September, 
though the level remained higher than in the spring.  In all, we expect real 
residential investment to rise at an annual rate of 9½ percent in the second half 
of this year, somewhat less than the pace seen in the first ha lf of the year.  
o We anticipate that the decline in mortgage rates since the September 
Tealbook will, in coming months, re verse part of the recent drag on 
single-family home sales and  construction.     
o Activity in the multifamily sector appears to have softened somewhat, 
and we have lowered our near-term forecast for construction of these 
units. 
 With the latest available readings on orders and shipments somewhat weaker 
than we had expected, we revised down our estimate of the growth in business 
spending on equipment and intangibles in th e third quarter to an annual rate of 
2½ percent, 1 percentage  point below our projection in the September 
Tealbook.  Given the generally positive t one of survey measures of business 
conditions, we still expect the growth of  equipment outlays to pick up in the 
fourth quarter, but at a slower pace than in our previous projection. 
 We reduced our estimate of net exports in the third quarter based on available 
data showing a larger-than-expected ri se in imports, but we anticipate that 
surprise to be reversed this quarter, le aving the second-half contribution of net 
exports to real GDP growth at an annua l rate of about ¼ percentage point, 
little revised on net.

 Effects  of the Government  Shutdown  on Economic  Data 
The federal government  shutdown  has affected the collection,  processing,  and publication  of 
key economic  data.  Here we describe  the effects of the shutdown  on selected  data releases 
from the Bureau of  Labor Statistics  (BLS) and  the Census Bureau—specifically,  the Employment  
Situation,  the Consumer  Price Index,  Retail Sales,  and reports on orders and  shipments  of 
capital goods—as  well as the implications  of delays in  data releases for derived data  products,  
such as industrial  production  and real GDP.  
The table  on the next page lists a broader array  of data releases affected  by the shutdown and  
shows their previously  scheduled  release dates, along  with an updated  release calendar.   
The Employment  Situation.   The September employment  report,  which comprises  the payroll 
survey (Current Employment  Statistics,  or CES) and the household  survey (Current Population  
Survey, or CPS), was  due to be released  on October 4.   The September data were  collected  and 
mostly processed  prior to the  shutdown.   As a result, the employment  report for September  
was released  on October 22,  fairly soon after the federal government  reopened.  
The report  containing  the October data  has been postponed  by a week to November  8.  The 
quality of the employment  and related data in the CES should not be substantially  affected, as  
they are based on employer  payroll records.1  However, the  CPS for October—including  the 
unemployment  rate and participation  rate—may  be less reliable  than usual.  Data collection  for 
the October  CPS was scheduled  to begin on October  13 but was  delayed a week.  While  the 
reference  week for the survey  was not changed, the  delay in collecting  the data could affect the 
results, for example,  because of  recall bias.  
Consumer  Price Index (CPI).  The CPI  data for September  were scheduled  to be released on 
October 16  and will instead  be released  on October 30.   However,  the collection  of the 
underlying  price data was unaffected  by the shutdown,  so there  should be no adverse effects 
on the quality of the published  CPI for September. 
Data collection for the  CPI data occurs throughout  the month  and concludes  on the last 
business day.  Consequently,  the government  shutdown will affect the  timing and number of 
price quotes included  in the sample, and, thus,  the October CPI  release may not be as reliable as 
usual.2 
Retail Sales.  Data on retail sales for September (and  the revised data  for July and August) were  
scheduled  to be released  on October 11  by the Census Bureau.  The retail sales  data are based on 
direct mail and  Internet surveys of  firms,  with follow ‐up interviews  performed  by the Census 
Bureau.  While the paper‐copy responses  are currently  available  for tabulation  by Census Bureau 
employees,  online responders  were unable to submit  the requisite  information  while the Census 
website was inoperable.   Nonetheless, the  Census Bureau has indicated  that the September  
data will be released  October 29.  
                                                 
1 The BLS Electronic  Data Interchange  Center  did not allow  the transmission  of data files  during the 
shutdown,  but it reopened  on the morning of October 17.  It is possible that some establishments  will be less 
likely to report because of the downtime.  
2 Because some items in the CPI are priced only in alternate  months,  and rents are only priced every 
6 months, some portion of any problems  with the October CPI may carry through until April of next year.

Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders. The Census Bureau released the August 
Advance Durables report at the end of September, just prior to the government shutdown. The 
collection of survey responses for the Bureau’s full report for August—the Manufacturers’ 
Shipments, Inventories, and Orders Survey—was mostly completed before the shutdown. 
Although the quality of the August data should be minimally affected, the report, which was 
scheduled for October 3, will not be issued; instead, the August data for the full manufacturing 
sector will only be released with the September report on November 4.
The September Advance Durables report was scheduled to be released on October 25 and will 
be released on time. However, the Census Bureau was unable to collect online responses 
because of server downtime during the shutdown; therefore, response rates and data quality 
might be affected.
Derived data. In addition to the four primary data releases discussed above, several important 
derived data releases have been delayed because of the government shutdown. The Federal 
Reserve’s G.17 statistical release on Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization was not 
published as scheduled on October 17; the production indexes incorporate a range of data from 
other government agencies that were delayed (notably including manufacturing production 
worker hours from the employment report). The G.17 release with data for September will be 
issued on October 28.
Finally, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates of gross domestic product for the 
third quarter of 2013 and personal income and spending for September also incorporate a range 
of other data that have been delayed. These BEA releases were scheduled to be published on 
October 30 and 31, respectively, but with the delays in the underlying source data and the 
furloughs of BEA staff, these data releases have been postponed until November 7 and 8.

   The available data suggest that manufactur ing IP rose at an annual rate of just 
1¾ percent in the third quarter, but the pace of production appears to have 
picked up, on net, in August and September.  As a result of its recent 
trajectory, the new orders components of  the latest manuf acturing surveys, 
and the motor vehicle assembly schedules in hand, we expect factory output to 
rise 3¼ percent this quarter.  This in crease is a bit less than the September 
projection, in part from new data on Boeing commerci al aircraft schedules.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Our forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term is just a little higher than 
in the September Tealbook.  We expect real GDP growth to step up to 3¼ percent in 
2014 and 3½ percent in 2015, then to ease slightly to 3¼ percent in 2016.   
 On the positive side, the lower trajectori es for interest rates and the dollar, 
together with the higher paths for ho use prices and the stock market, are 
anticipated to provide a greater lift to r eal output growth than in the previous 
projection.  In addition, the reversal of  the government shutdown effects will 
boost GDP growth early next year.  
 However, these positive forces were part ly offset by our decision to trim the 
acceleration in real PCE for next year.  In particular, we now assume that 
some of the factors that we believe have been holding down consumer outlays 
in recent quarters, such as tight credit conditions and pessimism about future 
income prospects, will weigh on spen ding over the coming quarters by more 
than we had previously expected.   
 Coupled with the downward revisions to 2013, these changes leave the level 
of GDP a touch lower at the end of the medium-term projection. 
 We have made no material changes to our supply-side assumptions this round.  
Thus, the small revisions we made to  the GDP forecast carry through to the 
GDP gap, leaving the gap just a little wi der at the end of the medium term 
compared with the September projection.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The available readings on labor market indicators remain consistent with our 
projection of a continued gradual improvement in the coming months. 
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 148,000 in September, in line with our 
expectations in the September Tealbook.4  However, we took more signal 
from private payrolls, which rose only 125,000 last month, somewhat lower 
than expected in the September projec tion.  In response, we marked down our 
projection for private payroll gains in the fourth quarter to 160,000 per month, 
15,000 less than in the September Tealbook.5   
 The unemployment rate edged down in September to 7.2 percent.  We 
anticipate that the furlough of governme nt employees will temporarily push 
up the unemployment rate to 7.5 percent in  October, but we expect the jobless 
rate to return to 7.2 percent in November and December.   
 Other labor market indicators that we have received also appear consistent 
with a gradual ongoing labor market r ecovery.  The staff’s labor market 
conditions index, which summarizes th e movements in 19 labor market 
indicators, edged up further in September. 
As in our previous projection, the labor ma rket is anticipated to gradually improve 
over the medium term in line with the overall pace of economic activity.  
 The path of the unemployment rate is slightly higher than in the previous 
projection and ends 2016 at just under 5½ percent, a little above the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.   
 Our forecast for payroll employment is close to the September Tealbook 
projection.  We expect total payroll gains to step up to a pace of 200,000 per 
                                                 
4 In late September, the BLS released the prelim inary estimate of the benchmark revision to the 
level of payroll employment in March 2013.  Abstracting from a change in the scope of the payroll survey, 
which boosted the level of employment by around 475,000 workers, total nonfarm payroll employment is expected to be revised down by 124,000, or 0.1 percent, a relatively small revision. 
5 We anticipate that the government shutdown will reduce private employment gains in October by 
25,000 and will provide an offsetting boost in Novemb er, leaving no imprint on the quarterly figures.  
Because the government worker s returned before the end of the releva nt pay period, we do not expect that 
government employment will be affected by the shutdown.

  month in 2014 and to 250,000 per month in 2015, then to edge back down to 
about 200,000 per month in 2016.  
 As shown in the “Labor Market Data a nd Projections” exhib it, compared with 
our projection in September 2012, when the Committee first tied its asset 
purchases to an improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the 
current projection for the unemployment rate in mid-2014 is about 
1 percentage point lower.  By contra st, the monthly change in payrolls 
currently projected for mid-2014 is lit tle different from the September 2012 
forecast.  The level  of total payroll employment , however, in mid-2014 in this 
projection is nearly 1 million jobs (roughly ¾ percent) higher than in the 
September 2012 Tealbook, partly due to faster-than-expected job growth 
during the second half of last year and th e first half of this  year and partly 
reflecting last year’s benchmark revision. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Our forecast for inflation is little changed from the September Tealbook.   
 After having been held down in the firs t half of the year by declines in energy 
prices and by unusually low core infl ation, total PCE price inflation is 
projected to pick up to an annual rate of  2 percent in the third quarter before 
slowing to 1 percent in the fourth.  
 The available data appear consistent w ith our view that the low readings on 
core PCE inflation earlier this year were  transitory.  We continue to expect 
core PCE prices to rise 1½ percent in the second half of th is year, up from the 
1 percent pace registered in the first half of the year. 
 We project consumer energy prices to rise at an annual rate of 3¼ percent 
over the second half of this year, do wn 2¾ percentage points from the 
September Tealbook as a result of the r ecent decline in oil prices.  Given the 
downward tilt to our projected path for o il prices, we continue to expect that 
consumer energy prices will move lower over the medium term. 
 Core PCE inflation is anticipated to edge up gradually ove r the medium term, 
from 1¼ percent in 2013 to 1¾ percen t in 2016.  Reflecting the projected 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  declines in consumer energy prices, total PCE inflation is expected to run a bit 
below core price inflation over the forecast period.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK   
 In the long-term outlook, the federal funds  rate continues to  be set according 
to the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) rule.  As a 
result, the federal funds rate gradually rises from 2 percent at the end of 2016 
to 4 percent by 2020.  The Federal Reserve’ s holdings of securities continue to 
put downward pressure on l onger-term interest rates, and the process of 
returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal  size is expected to be completed by 
2021.   
 Increasing household and business c onfidence, diminishing uncertainty, 
further improvements in credit availab ility, and a declini ng equity premium 
support real GDP growth of 2¾ percen t in 2017, when the unemployment rate 
reaches its natural rate of 5.2 percent.  Thereafter, the pace of gains in real 
GDP gradually moves down toward the longer-run growth rate of potential 
output of 2¼ percent.  Despite the low le vel of the federal funds rate in 2016 
and the gradual increase thereafter, the unemployment rate does not fall 
notably below the natural rate.  (S ee the box “Headwinds and the Federal 
Funds Rate in 2016” for further discussion.) 
 With long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain well anchored and 
essentially no margins of slack in labo r and product markets, consumer price 
inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019.

 Headwinds  and the Federal Funds Rate in 2016 
In the staff’s baseline forecast,  the federal funds  rate stays  at its effective  lower 
bound until the second quarter of 2015, one  quarter after the unemployment  rate 
moves below the Committee’s  6½ percent threshold;  thereafter,  it is set according  to 
an inertial  version of  the Taylor (1999) rule.  As a result of this procedure,  the federal 
funds rate in the baseline projection  is 2 percent at the end of 2016, well below  its 
assumed long‐run value  of 4 percent.   This outcome  may at first seem surprising  
because, at the end of 2016, the output gap is nearly closed, the unemployment  rate is 
close to its  assumed  natural rate, and core inflation is  only about ¼ percentage point 
below its long‐run target.   However, in  our analysis, important  headwinds  continue  to 
weigh on economic  activity even in 2016, and a continued  accommodative  stance  of 
monetary  policy is required  to achieve the  economic outcomes  we project. 
Moreover,  while the federal funds rate is lower than  its assumed  long‐run value  in 
2016, in the staff projection,  the unemployment  rate falls  only slightly below the 
natural rate  and inflation rises gradually  to its target level  over the  2016–20 period.  
The lack of any significant  undershooting  of the unemployment  rate or overshooting  
of inflation suggests  that the monetary  accommodation  in the staff projection  is just 
sufficient  to return  the economy  close to full employment  and 2 percent inflation  in 
2018 and to keep it there going  forward.   In other words, the projected  level of the 
federal funds rate during  those years is running close to a notion  of an equilibrium, or  
neutral, funds rate.1     
In the staff’s view, the economy  continues  to be faced with substantial  headwinds  
that lift only gradually  through 2016.  Thus, such factors  as household  and business  
confidence,  perceptions  of uncertainty,  and credit availability  still have  some room for 
improvement,  even at the  end of 2016.  Similarly,  although the  equity premium  is 
forecast to narrow over the next  three years, it is still  above our  estimate of  its longer‐
run value  in 2016.  Stimulative  monetary  policy can serve  to offset the  adverse effects 
of these factors, and  under the staff outlook,  with the federal funds  rate at only  
2 percent in 2016, inflation and employment  are closer to their objectives  than would 
be the case under a higher path for the federal  funds rate.         
Fiscal policy has been a factor  supporting  the level of economic  activity since the 
beginning  of the recession,  but it has become increasingly  less accommodative in  
recent years—thus  restraining  economic  growth—as  the earlier fiscal  stimulus policies 
wind down and policy changes have been implemented  to bring the federal budget 
deficit back toward a sustainable level.  These  forces are expected  to continue  over 
the next several years.  As a result, in  the staff’s  view, fiscal policy will be providing  
only a small degree of  support to the level of  economic  activity at the end of 2016.  
After 2016, however,  the staff expects pressures  from the aging of the population  and 
rising health‐care costs to put the debt ‐to‐GDP ratio  on a rising trajectory  and to put 
upward pressure  on the level of  the federal funds rate needed  to maintain full 
employment  and price stability.  
                                                 
1 It is worth noting  that under a different set of economic  conditions,  the inertial Taylor  (1999) 
rule with thresholds  could deliver an outcome  involving  substantial  undershooting  of the 
unemployment  rate or overshooting  of inflation.

with the staff's real-time translation of those data into hours worked. These were the latest available data at the time of
the September FOMC meeting.
  2. Calculated as the mean of the 2014:Q2 and 2014:Q3 projections.
  3. Projections of payrolls and hours worked include the effects of the benchmark revision to the payroll survey.
  4. Total hours worked are aggregate hours in the nonfarm business sector. Because that series is available only on a
quarterly basis, the August 2012 figures refer to the quarterly percent change and level in 2012:Q3. The percent changes
and levels in hours are at annual rates.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
We estimate that foreign real GDP growth increased to a near -trend pace of 
2¾ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter from 2¼ percent in the second quarter, 
largely  reflecting an acceleration of activity in China, Mexico, and Canada.  Growth 
appears to have moderated in Europe and Japan, but we had expected this slowing in our 
September Tealbook forecast.  Overall, our third- quarter estimate for the foreign 
economies is slightly higher than we wrote down in September, mainly reflecting China’s unexpectedly strong performance.  
We expect total foreign growth to rise further over the forecast period, to 
3¼ percent next year and 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), several factors should support the increase in growth, including accommodative monetary policies, diminishing drag from fiscal consolidation, and further reduction of financial stresses in the euro area.  The anticipated recovery in the advanced economies, including the United States, should support an acceleration of 
output in the emerging market economies (EMEs), as should a fading of the near- term 
drag from stressed financial conditions in the more vulnerable EMEs.  Relative to the 
previous Tealbook, our foreign growth outlook is up slightly in 2014 on account of stronger activity in the United States, and little changed thereafter.  
As always, the foreign outlook is subject to important risks.  The euro area’s exit 
from recession has been encouraging, but the recovery remains fragile and any number of shocks could undermine it.  In the EMEs, we have been heartened that the financial stresses that emerged in May have eased somewhat in the past two months, but the risk of a generalized emerging market crisis has not gone away.  The forecast has some upside risks as well.  For example, the welcome rebound in both EME and AFE growth in the 
past several quarters suggests that a positive, self -reinforcing dynamic could be 
materializing, engendering a faster rebound in global consumer and investor sentiment, 
and thus resulting in more vigorous global economic growth than assumed in our baseline.  These latter two risks —the upside risk and the risk of a possible crisis in the 
EMEs —are explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
With economic resource slack persisting and commodity prices projected to 
remain quiescent over the forecast period, we expect  that foreign inflation will remain

  subdued at an annual rate of roughly 2½ percent, little changed from our previous 
forecast.  In this low-inflation environment, monetary policy remains generally 
accommodative.  Recent policy guidance has led us to push back our anticipated first policy rate hike for the ECB from mid -2015 to early 2016.  In the EMEs, we now expect 
the Bank of Mexico to cut its policy rate again soon, following last month’s rate cut, to support growth.  In contrast, the central banks of Brazil, India, and Indonesia—some of the more vul nerable EMEs —raised policy rates, citing concerns about inflation, and we 
expect them to raise rates again before the end of the year.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro area.  Recent activity indicators support our estimate that GDP growth 
stepped down in the third quarter to ½ percent after transitory factors boosted 
growth during the second quarter to 1 percent.  Nevertheless, data on PMIs and confidence suggest that the underlying strength of the economy continued 
to improve.  We expect GDP growth to pick up to 1¼ percent in 2014 and 
then rise to 2 percent in 2015 and 2016, supported by diminishing drag from fiscal consolidation and further reduction of financial stresses.  Our near- term 
projection is a touch higher than in the September Tealbook, reflectin g 
slightly better -than-expected economic data and financial conditions.  
Recently, the ECB signaled more explicitly its willingness to keep interest 
rates low for an extended period.  Thus with inflation projected to remain 
comfortably below 2 percent for the foreseeable future, we now expect the ECB to wait until early 2016 (two quarters later than in the September Tealbook) to begin raising its policy rate. 
• United Kingdom .  Third-quarter GDP growth is estimated to be about 
2½ percent, down a little from the second -quarter pace, as August data 
showed surprising pullbacks in industrial activity and construction.  Still, PMI 
readings point to continued strength, and we project that GDP growth will 
remain around 2½ percent through the rest of the forecast peri od.  Higher -
than-expected core consumer prices and announced increases in utility prices 
led us to revise up our projection of inflation in the second half of the year to 3 percent, but we expect inflation to settle down at an average rate of 2 percent fro m 2014 onward, amid persistent economic slack.  Although the 
mapping of GDP growth into lower unemployment will depend on the

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  uncertain path of productivity growth, we continue to expect the 
unemployment rate to fall to the Bank of England’s 7 percent threshold in 
mid-2015 , with the first rate hike following later that year.  
• Japan .  Following a strong performance in the first half of the year on the 
back of Abenomics- related exchange rate depreciation and rising confidence, 
we estimate that growth slowed to  a 2 percent pace in the third quarter.  
Private consumption growth was sluggish through August and merchandise exports were down for the quarter as a whole.  September data on consumer 
confidence, car registrations, and corporate sentiment, suggest that growth 
will pick up to 3½ percent in the current quarter.  However, growth should decline markedly next year in response to April’s hike in the consumption tax, which Prime Minister Abe recently confirmed will occur as scheduled.  Although Abe also announce d a new fiscal stimulus package, we estimate that 
it will boost 2014 GDP by less than ½ percentage point, offsetting only about one-fourth of the drag from the consumption tax hike and the expiration of 
previous fiscal stimulus measures.  All told, we see growth averaging slightly 
above 1 percent over the next three years.  Although this is a paltry 
performance by the standards of most other economies, it is nearly double the pace of Japan’s estimated potential growth, and thus helps narrow its output gap.  Accordingly, and assuming continued monetary policy stimulus in 2014 and 2015, we project that inflation will settle at 1½ percent in 2016, just 
below the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent target. 
• Canada.  Data on monthly GDP and the manufacturing PMI suggest that growth bounced back to about 2½ percent in the third quarter, as projected in 
the September Tealbook, following flood- related weakness in the second 
quarter.  As the rebound dissipates, we see growth moderating to 2 percent in the current quarter before rising to 2¾ percent by mid -2015, supported by 
improvements in global economic conditions.  Following a flat reading in the second quarter due largely to falling food and energy prices, inflation 
rebounded to 1½ percent in the third quarter, and we expect it to edge up to 
2 percent in 2016.

  EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China .  Third-quarter GDP data suggest that the Chinese economy grew at an 
annual rate of 9½ percent, up from a 7 percent average pace over the first half 
of the year and 1¾ percentage point higher than we expected at the time of the September Tealbook.  The surge from relatively  weak to above- trend growth 
reflected a s trong acceleration in industrial production, as well as solid 
investm ent and retail sales  growth, which were supported by continued 
accommodative policy.  We expect growth to moderate to a more sustainable 
8 percent pace in the current and next quarter.  This projection is supported by a somewhat softer tone of the Septembe r data and also reflects our belief that 
authorities will again attempt to rein in the shadow banking sector, damping credit growth.  We then see Chinese growth gradually edging down to 7½ percent in 2016 in line with our estimate of downward-trending pote ntial 
growth.  This projection is up a bit in the current quarter from the previous Tealbook and little changed thereafter.  Inflation is projected to be around 
3 percent throughout the forecast period. 
• Other Emerging Asia .  We estimate that GDP in the rest of emerging Asia 
expanded at a 3¾ percent pace in the third quarter, about the same rate as in 
the previous quarter, and ½ percent faster than our previous Tealbook projection.  The region appears to have benefited from the strong growth in China, which supported an increase in exports in the third quarter following a second -quarter contraction.  Industrial production and the PMIs also have 
picked up in much of the region.  However, in India and Indonesia—where financial stress remained elevated —recent in dicators , on balance, point to a 
further slowing of growth after a weak second quarter.  Despite subdued growth, central banks in both countries raised policy rates, primarily to curb inflation ary pressures.  Going forward, we see growth in the region risi ng to 
about 4½ percent in 2015 and 2016, supported by a pickup in external demand 
from the advanced economies.   
• Latin America .  After contracting in the second quarter, Mexico ’s GDP likely 
grew 2¼  percent in the third quarter.  Our expectation of renewed growth is 
supported by the upbeat tone of several recent Mexican indicators, including 
the index of overall domestic economic activity, industrial production, and exports.  With economic slack still noticeable and inflation pressures

  relatively subdued, the Bank of Mexico cut its policy rate early last month and 
we expect another rate cut soon.  Supported by the expansion of activity in the 
United States, we see Mexican GDP accelerating to 3¾  percent next year, a 
bit faster than projected in the September Tealbook, before settling at 3½ percent thereafter, broadly in line with the contour of U.S. manufacturing output. 
After Brazil ian GDP growth surged to 6 percent in the second quarter, recent 
indicators—including industrial production, PMIs, and exports—suggest that 
GDP was flat in the third quarter, about as we had expected in September.  We expect GDP growth to rise to 1¾ percent in the current quarter and further to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, as the drag from financial stresses wanes and global economic growth picks up.  Despite the recent slowdown, the Brazilian central bank raised its main policy rate earlier this month by 50 basis points to 9.5 percent, a cumulative increase of 225  basis points since April, citing 
concerns about inflationary pressures, and we expect another rate hike before the end of the year.  Although 12-month headline inflation moderated to 5.9 percent in September, it remains significantly above 4.5 percent —the 
midpoint of the inflation target range and the central bank’s ultimate goal.

Financial Developments  
Largely in re sponse to expectations for more-accommodative monetary policy, 
conditions in domestic financial markets eased , on balance, over the intermeeting period, 
with longer- term interest rates lower, stock prices higher, and the foreign exchange value 
of the dollar down.  That said, financial markets— particularly the Treasury bill and short-
term funding markets— were adversely affected  for a time by investors’ concerns about 
the outcome of the fiscal standoff and uncertainty about its effects on the economy; 
however, strains eased quickly after a deal was reached in the Congress on October 16.  (See the box “Financial Market Effects of the U.S. Fiscal Standoff.”)   
• Investors pushed out their anticipated timing of a change in monetary 
policy—both the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases and the first hike in the target federal funds rate—in response to three factors:   Federal 
Reserve communications at the time of the September FOMC meeting, which 
were seen as more accommodative than expected ; uncertainty about the 
economic outlook and the fiscal situation in coming months ; and somewhat 
weaker -than-expected economic data releases .  
• Borrowing by nonfinancial businesses slow ed somewhat during the fiscal 
standoff amid increased market volatility; however, access to credit remained ample for large firms , and equity prices rose , on net, over the intermeeting 
period.  
• Household financial flows appeared little affected by the fiscal standoff.  
House prices showed further improvement in August, while mortgage rates 
declined about 45 basis points over the intermeeting period.      
• Financial conditions also eased in the adv anced foreign economies on balance:  
Equity prices moved higher, sovereign bond yields fell, and expectations for 
policy rates declined.  In emerging market economies  (EMEs) , financial 
conditions continued to improve.

 Financial  Market Effects  of the U.S. Fiscal Standoff  
Investors  began to focus on the U.S. debt ceiling debate as  the October 17  deadline announced  by 
the Treasury  approached.1  Market participants  reportedly  anticipated  that the Treasury  would run 
out of cash by the end of October if  the debt ceiling was not raised.  Reflecting  these concerns,  
yields on Treasury  bills maturing  between mid‐ October and  early November  rose sharply (top‐left 
figure on the following  page), some Treasury  bill auctions  in early October saw reduced  demand,  
and liquidity in the T‐bill market  deteriorated, especially  for certain securities  that were seen as “at 
risk” of delayed payment.   In addition,  one‐ and five‐year U.S. sovereign  credit default swap (CDS) 
spreads rose notably, and the CDS curve inverted,  as in 2011.2  In the weeks leading up to the 
deadline,  implied volatility  in the equity market rose considerably,  but the S&P  500 index declined  
only marginally  and for a brief  period, a notable contrast  with 2011, when debt  ceiling concerns  were 
compounded  in part by the escalating  fiscal and financial crisis in Europe. 
Conditions  in secured dollar funding  markets were particularly  strained for a time.  Overnight 
general collateral  (GC) repo rates on Treasury  and agency MBS collateral  rose markedly (top ‐right 
figure on the following  page), reaching  highs similar to  those seen in  2011, and  term repo rates also 
moved higher.  Rates implied by  general collateral  financing  futures for October and  November  also 
rose notably.  Rates on unsecured  commercial  paper (CP) rose  sharply as well, and  financial CP 
outstanding  declined  in the days immediately  before the deadline.   By contrast,  federal funds and 
Eurodollar  markets showed little reaction  to debt ceiling concerns.  
Outflows  from institutional  taxable money market funds (MMFs) accelerated  in the two wee ks 
leading up to the October 17  deadline,  although  the magnitude  of these outflows,  at roughly  
$70 billion in aggregate,  was somewhat  smaller than in  2011 (bottom  figures on the following  
page).3  Market participants  noted that the sharp  rise in short‐dated  T‐bill yields  likely was due in 
part to MMFs  offloading  at‐risk securities,  and the funds’ aggregate holdings  of Treasury  securities  
declined notably in the two weeks prior to the  deadline.4  MMFs also pared back holdings  of CP 
leading up to the deadline.   Consistent  with these flows, deposit  balances  appeared  to rise sharply 
at custodian  banks.5 
                                                 
1 The Treasury had been operating  under  a debt issuance suspension  period and using extraordinary  
measures  to avoid  breaching  the debt  limit since May 20, 2013.  Treasury  Secretary  Lew stated in a letter  to the 
Congress  on August 26, 2013, that the Treasury expected  to exhaust  extraordinary  measures  in the middle of 
October and revised the estimated  date to “no later than October 17” in a follow‐up letter  on September  25, 
2013.   
2 U.S. CDS are not very liquid, as indicated  by the infrequent  quotes and wide average  bid–asked  spreads  in 
the market.  Market participants  note that U.S. CDS are often traded to hedge positions  or to take macro views 
rather than for hedging sovereign  risk. 
3 In the two weeks before the 2011 debt  ceiling deadline,  institutional  U.S. government  MMFs had net 
outflows  of $63 billion,  while  institutional  prime funds  had $67 billion in net outflows.   Over  a similar period prior 
to the October 17, 2013, deadline,  institutional  government  and prime  funds  had net outflows  of $54 billion and 
$19 billion,  respectively.  
4 As of September  30, 2013, MMFs’  holdings included $156 billion in securities  maturing  between  October 17 
and November  15 and another $125 billion in securities  maturing  later in 2013.

 The debt  ceiling impasse also raised some operational  issues.  There  had been reports  of market 
participants  considering  amending  legal documentation  in repo contracts  to exclude  certain at ‐risk 
securities  from eligibility  as collateral.   Some central clearing counterparties  also apparently  
considered  whether  to prohibit members from  providing  as collateral  Treasury  securities  perceived  
to be at risk of  delayed payment.   Three exchanges  announced  other margin and haircut changes.6  
In addition,  investors  expressed some  uncertainties  about the eligibility  of at‐risk securities  at the 
Federal Reserve’s discount  window and in open market operations.  
Shortly after the agreement to raise  the debt  ceiling was reached on October 16,  strains in Treasury  
bill and secured funding markets eased significantly  and institutional  MMF assets rebounded  
smartly.  U.S. sovereign  CDS spreads also declined  somewhat.   Nonetheless, market  participants  
noted the potential  for financial  market strains to reemerge  leading up to the next debt ceiling 
deadline in  2014.7 
 
                                                 
6 The Hong  Kong Exchange  increased  haircuts on U.S. Treasury bills from 1 percent to 3 percent on October 
10, while  the Intercontinental  Exchange  raised haircuts on U.S. Treasury notes  and bonds on October 17.  On 
October 15, the Chicago  Mercantile  Exchange  announced  a temporary  increase in margin  requirements  on over‐
the‐counter interest  rate swaps. 
7 The debt  ceiling was raised through early February,  although  the Treasury Department’s  use of 
extraordinary  measures  could extend the deadline  considerably  further.

POLICY  EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY AND AGENCY MBS  YIELDS  
Implied rates on money market futures contracts and T reasury yields declined 
sharply on the September FOMC announcement, the release of results from the Summary 
of Economic Projections, and the press conference , which market participants  viewed  as 
more accommodative than expected .  Investors had reportedly put fairly high odds on a 
reduction in the pace of asset purchases at the September meeting and so were surprised by the FOMC’s decision to “await more evidence that progress will be sustained before 
adjusting the pace of its purchases.”  Implied volatility on interest rate options that expire 
within three to six months moved markedly lower, while implied volatility on interest 
rate options that expire at longer horizons declined by less. 
Intermediate - and longer- term interest rates subsequently fluctuated within narrow 
ranges amid limited and mixed domestic data releases, as investors increasingly focused 
on the fiscal standoff and its implications for monetary polic y.  Toward the end of the 
period, interest rates declined in response to the delayed and somewhat weaker -than-
expected September employment report.   Other FOMC communications during the 
intermeeting  period, including the September FOMC minutes, were reportedly viewed as 
largel y in line with expectations and elicited limited reactions in financial markets.  Over 
the period as a whole, the federal funds rate path implied by overnight index swap ( OIS) 
quotes shifted down and flattened , with the rate at the end of 2015 falling about 
40 basis  points.
1  This decline likely reflected , in part , lower term premiums associated 
with reduced intermediate -term uncertainty on the policy rate, as implied volatilities on  
swaptions with short- term underlying interest rates and on options on Eurodollar futures 
moved markedly lower.  Based on an assumption of a term premium of zero basis points per month, OIS  quotes suggest that investors now expect liftoff to occur around the 
second quarter of 2015 and the federal funds rate to rise about 20 basis points per quarter for the subsequent two  years.    
Consistent with the market-based quotes, median responses to the Open Market 
Desk’s October Survey of Primary Dealers, which was closed after the release of the 
September employment report,  indicated  that dealers pushed out their projected liftoff 
date for the federal funds rate and revised down the subsequent path of the policy rate 
relative to the September survey.  The fraction of dealers expecting a liftoff in the first 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

half of 2015 declined notably , while the fraction expecting a liftoff in the fourth quarter 
of that year rose significantly.   In addition, survey respondents pushed out the timing  of 
the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases  into 2014, consistent with results from 
recent surveys conducted by private- sector institutions.   While d ealers placed only a 
10 percent probability on a reduction in the purchase pace later this year and an 
additional 20 percent on a reduction at the January meeting , they assigned about a 
35 percent  chance on the March 2014 meeting and another 30 percent chance on the 
meetings later next year .  The total amounts of Treasury and MBS purchases during 2013 
and 2014 were projected to be around $840 billion and $760 billion, respectively, $200 billion and $175 billion higher than at the time of the September survey and $125 billion and $80 billion higher than at the time of the “flash” survey conducted immediately following the September meeting.    
Five-, 10- , and 30-year Treasury yields dropped about 30, 30, and 20 basis points, 
respectively, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Decreases in forward rates were particularly pronounced at three- to five -year horizons, suggesting the largest change in 
expectations about the federal funds rate in that time  frame.   
The reduction in longer- term Treasury yields since the September FOMC meeting 
was reflected in other longer- term rates.  A gency MBS yields declined somewhat more 
than the 10- year Tr easury yield , while the option-adjusted spread for production-coupon 
MBS tightened  noticeably .  On net, 30- year conforming mortgage rates ended the period 
about 45 basis points lower at 4.0 percent.   In addition, yields on Treasury inflation-
protected securities (TIPS) declined about in line with their nominal counterpar ts, leaving 
TIPS -based inflation compensation little changed  over the intermeeting period. 
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE  AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
The Desk conducted outright purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS as 
planned, and the operations did not appear to have material adverse effects on market 
functioning.2  
                                                 
2 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $ 54 billion of Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program and $67 billion of agency MBS under the flow -based MBS 
program and the reinvestment program.

Notwithstanding the strains in the Treasury bill market during the fiscal standoff, 
liquidity conditions in the Treasury coupon security market remained within historical 
ranges over the intermeeting period.  In particular, the Desk saw no evidence of a material increase in securities considered at risk of delayed payment being offered into its  
securities lending or purchase operations during the fiscal standoff.  Liquidity conditions in the agency MBS market improved modestly further following the  deteriorations seen 
during the summer, although they remain below long- term averages.  Dollar -roll-implied 
financing rates for 30 -year Fannie Mae 3.5 percent and 4 percent coupon securities 
increased and stayed near their recent high levels, consistent with limited settlement 
pressures.    
EQUITY PRICES AND BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
The S&P  500 index increased 2.9 percent  over the period despite elevated 
volatility during the fiscal standoff.  Share prices for nonfinancial firms have slightly outperformed the broader market, increasing 3.0 percent over the same period.  Third -
quarter earnings reports for nonfinancial firms have been coming in, on balance, about as expected and suggest only modest growth on a seasonally adjusted basis relative to the second quarter.  
Despite  a temporary slowing of b usiness borrowing during the fiscal standoff , 
financial markets  generally  remained accommodative.  Issuance of nonfinancial corporate 
bonds and commercial paper , which had been particularly strong in September , weakened 
temporarily in October amid the elevated financial market volatility.   Nevertheless, 
financing conditions for larger firms eased somewhat over the intermeeting period, as  
corporate bond y ields  declined a little more than longer- term Treasury yields, leaving 
both investment- and speculative- grade corporate bond spreads moderately  narrower over 
the period.   
Smoothing through the monthly moves, our most recent data indicate that  
commercial and industrial (C&I)  loans continued to advance, on balance, in the third 
quarter at about the pace posted in the previous quarter.  More recently, C&I loans 
jumped temporarily  in early October as some banks reported funding firms’ 
precautionary draws on credit lines.  In response to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  (SLOOS) , a modest net fraction of banks 
indicated they had eased standards on C&I loans over the third quarter, and survey respondents reportedly  continued to ease many of the surveyed loan terms on net.

However, banks reported no significant change in demand for C&I loans.  (See the memo 
“The October 2013 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,” 
which will be distributed to FOMC participants on October 24, 2013.)  Leveraged loan 
issuance continued to be robust in September, boosted by a number of M&A and LBO transactions .  In the first three quarters  of th e year , issuance of collateralized loan 
obligations reached  $80 billion  at an annual rate, similar to the pace seen prior to the 
financial crisis .  
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets continued to 
improve slowly.  CRE loans at banks rose moderately in September and early October , 
and banks again indicated in the SLOOS that they had eased standards on CRE loans over the past three months.  CMBS issuance remained strong , as fundamentals in the 
CRE market continued to improve gradually.   
Funding conditions in the municipal bond market improved on balance.  Outflows 
from tax -exempt bond funds slowed.  Issuance for new capital projects remained solid , 
while refunding issuance declined amid elevated financial market volatilit y related to the 
fiscal standoff.  Yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds decreased largely 
in line with  long- term Treasury yields , leaving the ratio between the yields of municipal 
bonds and Treasur y securities  of comparable maturities little changed  on net .  In contrast, 
the yield on general obligation bonds issued by Puerto Rico rose to a new high over the 
intermeeting period as investors continued to avoid those securities amid increasing 
concern over the territory’s fiscal situation.   Tax-exempt bond mutual funds are important 
investors in bonds issued by Puerto Ric an government entities.  M oney market funds also 
own Puerto Rican debt, but most of those holdings are insured by large U.S. or global banks. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Developments affecting f inancing for the household sector were generally 
favorable over the intermeeting period.3  House prices posted further gains  in August but 
increased at a slower pace relative to the beginning of the year.  New delinquencies on 
                                                 
3 The government shutdown is expected to have had little impact on mortgage origination s and 
issuance .  The effect of  scaled -down FHA and Ginnie Mae operations is expected t o be modest , and the 
GSEs temporarily extended the time allowed for income verification through the IRS to the loan delivery 
date.

mortgages stayed  near historical lows, owing in part to the tight underwriting standards 
for new mortgages that have prevailed over the past several years.  Mortgage rates 
declined about 45 basis points over the intermeeting period but are still about 70 basis  points above their early -May lows , and the higher rates continued to weigh on 
mortgage refinancing applications .  Purchase applications moved  a bit lower , although, 
on a seasonally  adjusted basis , they remained  only about 6 percent below their level s 
prior to the rise in  mortgage rates  last spring and summer .  Respondents to t he SLOOS 
also indicated  that they had experienced a much smaller decline in purchase applications 
than refinancing applications since the spring .  Moreover, a large fraction of banks 
reported having eased standards  on home-purchase loans to prime borrowers, on net, 
though comments from some banks suggest that the easing was  narrowly  concentrated in 
specific sector s.   
Nonmortgage credit flows were little changed in August relative to earlier in the 
summer.  Auto loans and student loans continued to expand at a robust pace, while credit 
card debt stayed about flat—a pattern consistent with changes in bank credit through early October .  In the October SLOOS, a moderate fraction of banks reported having 
eased standards on, and experienced stronger demand for,  credit card and auto loans on 
balance.  More generally, auto credit remained widely available, even for subprime loans.  
Credit card solicitation mail volume moved sideways at moderate levels through August, 
but underwriting standards for such loans reportedly remained tight compared with longer- term norms .  Consumer ABS issuance stay ed robust during the third quarter but 
slowed noticeably in early October, reflecting in part some deals being delayed amid heightened market uncertainty related to the fiscal standoff.   
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
Bank credit declined slightly during the third quarter.  Growth of core loans 
slowed, primarily because of  a sizable decline in outstanding balances of closed -end 
residential mortgage s on banks’ books.  The reduction in mortgage refinancing activity 
likely reduced the stock of loans held by banks prior to securitization.  Banks’ s ecurities 
holdings declined sh arply , likely reflecting in part sales in response to the rise in longer-
term interest rates  in the third quarter.  Consistent with the reduction in longer- term 
interest rates since the September FOMC meeting, unrealized losses on securities held in banks’ available- for-sale portfolio s declined .

Third -quarter e arnings reports for large banks generally met or exceeded analysts’ 
modest expectations .  Earnings were reduced by elevated litigation expenses and weak 
trading income.  Banks also reported flat or lower net interest margins and substantially 
lower revenue in mortgage banking due to lower refinancing volumes, with several announcing sizable reductions in mortgage staff.  However, the release of loan loss reserves due to substantial improvements in cr edit quality, especially for residential 
mortgages, continued to support bank profitability.    
Preliminary data indicate that M2 growth picked up temporarily in the days 
leading up to the debt ceiling deadline, after growing moderately in September.  Deposits appeared to increase sharply at major custodian banks as institutional investors shifted from money fund shares to bank deposits, and as money funds liquidated short- dated 
Treasury securities  and increased their bank deposits in anticipation of possible 
redemptions.
4 These in flows  to M2 are estimated to have quickly reversed  following the 
October 16 settlement.  
FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
The immediate reaction in foreign financial markets to the Se ptember FOMC 
announcement was substantial, with foreign stock prices rising, yields and spreads declining, and the dollar depreciating against most currencies.  Although the partial shutdown of the U.S. government and heightened concerns over the debt ceil ing 
temporarily reversed these moves, foreign markets reacted positively to the resolution of the crisis on October 16. 
Like U.S. Treasury yields, 10-year benchmark yields in Germany, the United 
Kingdom, and Canada declined, on net, over the period, falling 20 to 30 basis points.  Implied future short- term interest rates one  to two years ahead also declined for those 
countries, suggesting that market participants scaled back somewhat their expectations for future monetary policy tightening.   
Equity market indexes in the advanced foreign economies ended the period 
higher.  Euro-area stock prices outperformed, with bank stock prices rising 10 percent, 
                                                 
4 Reserve balances at major custodian banks rose sharply, which is estimated to have been the 
result of large deposit inflow s, for which data lag .  Complete data for the 2011 debt ceiling episode show 
that increases in deposit and reserve balances at these institutions were synchronous.

led by those in Spain and Italy.  In emerging market economies, stock prices have 
recovered from the financial turmoil of early May and June.  Mutual fund flows to 
emerging markets have stabilized, following large outflows earlier this year.  
The dollar depreciated about 1 percent over the period, with declines against both 
advanced economy and emerging market cur rencies, as market participants pushed out  
their expectation s for the timing of the next change in U.S. monetary policy.  In addition, 
several EMEs  continued to intervene to support their currencies, and the central banks of 
Brazil and India increased their benchmark policy rates.   
Although demand by some EMEs for U.S. Treasury securities has been weak, 
particularly in those economies that have been facing depreciation pressures, recent data on custody holdings at the FRBNY suggest that foreign official in vestors continued to 
purchase Treasury securities in September and October, notwithstanding concerns about the debt ceiling.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first  
scenario considers the possibility that the substantial decline in the unemployment rate 
seen over the past year is a more accurate signal of the pace of the recovery than the modest gains in real GDP, and that, going forward , GDP  rises more strongly than in the 
baseline.  In the second scenario, by contrast, the combination of steady declines in the unemployment rate and tepid GDP growth in  recent years reflects greater damage to the 
supply side than assumed in the baseline.  T he third  scenario  articulates why several of 
the factors  we believe have held down consumer spending growth in the past could be 
more persistent  than we anticipate , preventing the projected acceleration  in the baseline 
from materializing.   The fourth  scenario considers the risk that the softness in consumer 
price inflation  seen earlier this year reemerges and proves to be more persistent than 
anticipated .  The final two scenarios consider downside and upside risks to the U.S. 
economy from foreign economic developments—first, that financial stresses experienced by EMEs escalate substantially , and, second, that the pace of economic growth abroad 
could increase more rapidly than assumed in the baseline.  
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and th e last two  
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations , as in the baseline 
forecast,  the federal funds rate follows  an inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
subject to  the FOMC’s thresholds for the  unemployment rate and projected inflation .  For  
the SIGMA simulations , we use a broadly similar  policy rule, subject to the same 
thresholds, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.
1  In all cases, we 
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Faster Recovery  
In the staff’s view, recent weakness in GDP growth reflects headwinds that will 
continue to restrain aggregate demand.  However, it is possible that measured GDP may 
                                                 
1 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 be understating the true strength of the economy, and other indicators—such as GDI and 
labor market conditions—may be  sending a more accurate signal.   This scenario adopts a 
more optimistic view of aggregate demand conditions.  With headwinds assumed to be 
easing more rapidly t han in the baseline, a faster , broad-based recovery is able to gain  
momentum , as improvements in household wealth and consumer and business sentiment 
boost spending, and the increase in spending, in turn, leads to increased employment, 
higher incomes, and further spending gains.  All told, real GDP rises at an annual pace of 4 percent in 2014 and 2015.  The unemployment rate falls below the 6½ percent threshold by the fourth quarter of 2014, prompting liftoff in the federal funds rate  
one quarter ahead of baseline.  Despite tight labor markets , inflation rises only marginally 
above the baseline, reaching  2 percent  in 2018.  
Supply -Side Damage 
In this scenario, the observations of sluggish real GDP growth and a falling 
unemployment rate in recent years indicate not that the estimates of GDP understate the 
strength of the economy, as in the previous scenario, but rather that the damage to aggregate supply during the past several years is greater than is estimated in the baseline.  Accordingly , we assume a slower growth of structural productivity such  that potential 
output has expanded at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent since 2011, ½ percentage point 
lower than in the baseline, and continues to rise more slowly than in the baseline through 
2018.  As a result, the current output gap is 1½ percentage points narrower than in the baseline.  Real GDP rises at a rate of 2 ¾ percent per year, on average, through 2015, but 
the unemployment rate nonetheless continues to decline at roughly the same pace as it has since late 2010 —and thus more steeply than in the baseline—and it falls below 
6½ percent by the third quarter of 2014.
2  With resource slack substantially narrower and 
productivity gains smaller than in the baseline, inflation rises to 2 percent in 2016, and 
the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of 
2014, two quarters earlier than in the baseline. 
Consumer  Restraint 
The staff projects that consumer spending will accelerate appreciably  in 2014, 
based on a judgment that the forces restraining the growth in household expenditures are likely to begin to lift.   However, for a number of reasons, the expected acceleration  could 
                                                 
2 Although the projection of the unemployme nt rate is below the baseline, living standards are 
lower in this scenario as a result of slower productivity growth.

 be smaller and may not materialize  at all .  For example, the unexpectedly  sluggish 
recovery to date may indicate that households have become more pessimistic in forming 
expectations of their permanent income , or less willing to spend out of increases in 
wealth .  In addition, increased financial regulation and the disappearance of certain credit 
products may permanently reduce credit availability .  In this scenario , consumer spending 
continues to increase at a 2 percent annual pac e over the coming years , similar to  the pace 
over the past two years.  As a consequence, GDP growth remains subdued relative to the baseline, and the rate of labor market improvement slows significantly.  With the 
unemployment rate lingering above the 6½ percent threshold until 2017, the federal funds 
rate remains at  the effective lower bound for an additional two and a half  years.  The 
inflation  rate remains  almost ½ percent age point below the C ommittee’s target at the end 
of the forecast horizon.  
Low Inflation 
In the baseline forecast, the low readings on core inflation seen earlier this year 
are assumed to have been largely transitory, and over the next few years as the recovery 
continues, inflation gradually moves back toward 2 percent.  In this scena rio, the recent 
performance of inflation proves to be a harbinger of a longer- lasting decline in actual 
inflation, bringing down longer-run inflation expectations and thereby leading to a 
mutually reinforcing downward dynamic.  Inflation is below 1 percent  next year and 
edges down further thereafter, falling close to zero.  In this environment, investors 
become increasingly concerned that the economy is mired in a weak state with price behavior verging on deflation and monetary policy remaining constrained by the effective 
lower bound for the federal funds rate.  As a result, risk  premiums rise and put upward 
pressure on real long-term interest rates, modestly restraining household and business spending and boosting unemployment relative to the baseline over the next few years.  
The unemployment rate falls below its 6½ percent threshold in the second quarter of 
2015, but because inflation is so low, the policy rule does not prescribe the first increase in the federal funds rate until mid -2016.  While the unem ployment rate is nearing  its 
natural rate by that time , the persistent downward shift in inflation expectations means 
that inflation remains well below the FOMC’s long -run objective.  As a consequence, the

 on both EME vulnerabilities  and the prospective effects of policy normalization in 
advanced economies , the risk of a substantial ratcheting up in financial stress  in EMEs 
remains significant .  In this scenario, we consider the effects of a financial crisis in one or 
more of the most vulnerable of these economies, which then spills over to the EMEs 
more broadly.  Sovereign and private borrowing costs in the se countries  soar, and the 
confidence of their  households and businesses weakens significantly.  These events cause 
EME currencies to depreciate almost 7  percent , on average, against the dollar relative to 
the baseline, even though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates to attenuate capital  outflows.  All told, real GDP in the EMEs declines 4½ percent relative 
to the baseline by early 2015.  The financial stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to the rest of the world, including the United States:  Corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight -to-safety flows 
push down term premiums on government bond yields.  In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  As a result, U.S. real GDP growth is only 2 percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate stays above 7  percent until the end of 2014 before beginning to gradually decline.  With 
substantially greater resource slack and lower import prices, core U.S. PC E inflation dips 
to around 1 percent in 2014.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound through the end of 2015.  
Higher Global Growth  
The headwinds facing many of  our foreign trading partners —including financial 
stresses in the EMEs and credit constraints in Europe—may ease more rapidly than envisioned in our baseline, spurring a faster recovery abroad.   In this scenario, foreign 
output expands at an annual pace about 1 percentage point above the baseline through the end of 2015 as  improvements in financial conditions and sentiment lead to higher 
business and household spending.  Moreover, the broad real dollar depreciates about  5 percent relative to the baseline as confidence in foreign econom ies improves and 
monetary policy abroad tightens.  The stronger foreign activity and the weaker dollar cause U.S. real net exports to rise relative to the baseline.  As a result, U.S. real GDP rises at a 3¾ percent  annual rate in 2014 and 2015, and the une mployment rate falls 
below 6½ percent by the end of 2014.  Higher import prices and stronger activity boost 
core PCE inflation to close to 2 percent in 2015.  The federal funds rate lifts off from its 
effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2015, one quarter sooner than in the baseline, and rises more quickly thereafter .

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget 
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
