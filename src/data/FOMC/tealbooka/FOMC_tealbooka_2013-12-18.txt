Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that we have received  since the October Tealbook suggests that 
real GDP is increasing a bit more, on average, over the second half of  this year than we 
had previously expected.  In part, the mode st upgrade in our assessment reflects larger 
contributions from categories, such as i nventory investment and government purchases, 
that convey little signal for the ongoing thrust of aggregate demand.  But the data on 
private domestic final demand also appear to ha ve been a bit better, on balance, than we 
had anticipated.  In particular, consumer sp ending appears to be acce lerating more in the 
fourth quarter than we had assumed, and business fixed investment seems to be on a 
slightly stronger trajectory.  In contrast, housing activity has once again surprised us on 
the downside, as the rise in mortgage rate s since the spring seems to be restraining 
housing activity by somewhat more than we ha d expected.  In all, our forecast for real 
GDP growth over the second half of this year now stands at an average annual rate of 
2½ percent, ½ percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook, and we expect 
growth to pick up to a 2¾ percent pace in th e first quarter of next year.  In the labor 
market, increases in payroll employment were  greater in October and November than we 
had anticipated, and the unemp loyment rate declined more , on net, since September. 
Our medium-term projection for real activity also is a bit stronger than in the 
October Tealbook, as the slight reduction in fiscal restraint from the recent federal budget 
deal, a lower trajectory for interest rates, a nd somewhat higher paths for equity prices and 
home values more than offset a higher path fo r the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  
We continue to expect that economic activity  will expand more quickly over the next few 
years than it did in 2013, reflecting a stil l-accommodative stance of monetary policy and 
the waning of some of the forces—including federal fiscal policy and the stresses in 
Europe—that have restrained economic growth in recent years.  Our current forecast has 
real GDP growth stepping up from a pace of 2¼ percent this year to 3 percent in 2014 
and 3½ percent in both 2015 and 2016.   
Consistent with the acceleration in real GDP, we project the unemployment rate 
to decline from about 7 percent in the curr ent quarter to 5¼ per cent at the end of 2016, 
thereby reaching the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  As in our October Tealbook 
forecast, the unemployment rate crosses th e Committee’s 6.5 percent threshold near the 
beginning of 2015.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP
The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following 
the September FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the 
staff economic projection since the September Tealbook.
The staff projection for real GDP growth is about the same as in the September 
Tealbook on net. The unemployment rate has come in lower than we expected 
in September. We have taken this lower level on board in the near term, but we 
still project the unemployment rate to end 2016 at 51 /4  percent, in line with the 
essentially unrevised GDP outlook.
The staff projection for both overall and core PCE inflation has revised a little 
lower this year relative to the September projection. Beyond this year, however, 
the projection for both core and headline inflation is about unrevised, with 
inflation edging gradually higher.
The unemployment rate is still projected to cross the Committee’s 6.5 percent 
threshold in early 2015, and the policy rule that governs our assumption for the 
federal funds rate calls for the rate to lift off from the effective lower bound in 
the second quarter of 2015, the same as in September. The trajectory of the 
federal funds rate after liftoff is also the same.

The data we have received on PCE pri ces since the October Tealbook have been 
softer than we had anticipated, in part refl ecting lower-than-expected prices for medical 
services.  But beyond the near term, our projec tion for core inflation is essentially the 
same as in our previous forecast, with core PCE inflation expected to rise from about 
1 percent in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 2016.  We continue to anticipate that energy prices will edge down over the forecast period, causing headline inflation to run a bit below core 
inflation. 
We view the degree of uncertainty attendi ng our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as being similar to the average over the past 20 years—the benchmark used by the FOMC.
1  We continue to view the risks to our forecast for real 
GDP growth as being skewed to the downside,  in part because neither monetary policy 
nor fiscal policy appear well positioned to combat future adverse shocks to economic 
activity.  However, we see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as 
roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse demand-side 
developments countered by the possibility of a continuation of th e downward surprises 
for the unemployment rate that we have seen in recent years.  In addition, we regard the 
uncertainty around our inflation forecast as be ing about normal and view these risks as 
broadly balanced.  Our assessment of the ri sks around our forecasts for real GDP growth 
and inflation is unchanged from the Sept ember Tealbook—the last time that Committee 
participants submitted economic projections.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
We have shifted our assumption for the slowing in purchases under the current 
LSAP program toward a slightly later tim ing than we had assumed in our October 
projection, thereby increasing the cumulative account of purchases under the current 
program by $165 billion.  We now assume that  the pace of purchases will begin to slow 
in the first quarter of 2014 and will end in th e latter half of 2014, br inging the cumulative 
amount of purchases under the cu rrent program to $1.4 trillion. 
                                                 
1 Beginning with this Tealbook, in order to better align our assessment with the Committee’s 
Summary of Economic Projections, we separately eval uate the risks and uncertain ties for our forecasts of 
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate.

With the unemployment rate projected to fall below the Committee’s 6.5 percent 
threshold near the beginning of 2015, we contin ue to assume that the federal funds rate 
will lift off from its effective lower bound in  the second quarter of 2015 and thereafter 
rise at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) 
policy rule.  As in the October Tealbook, the federal funds rate reaches 2 percent at the 
end of 2016. 
Other Interest Rates 
The 10-year Treasury yield has risen about 30 basis points since the October 
Tealbook, a larger increase than we had projec ted.  Over the medium term, our forecast 
still calls for Treasury yields to rise signi ficantly, primarily reflect ing the movement of 
the 10-year valuation window through the peri od of extremely low short-term interest 
rates as well as a gradual waning of the effects of the FOMC’s LSAP program.  
Nonetheless, toward the end of the projecti on period, we have the 10- year Treasury yield 
somewhat lower in this Tealbook than in the previous one, reflecting the slight increase 
in the expected size of the LSAP program a nd a lower assumed medium-term level of the 
term premium. 
Rates for conventional 30-year fixed-rate  mortgages have increased roughly in 
line with the yields on comparable maturity Treasury securities over the intermeeting 
period, and yields on 10-year i nvestment-grade corporate bo nds have risen just a bit 
less.  As a result, our forecasts for corpor ate bond yields and mortgage rates in the 
medium term have been revise d essentially in line with the revision to Treasury yields. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Equity prices have risen about 1½ per cent since the October Tealbook, a bit more 
than we had anticipated.  We have carried fo rward the higher level of  stock prices over 
the next few quarters, but because we think that the recent gains largely reflect a 
narrowing of the equity risk premium that we had anticipated to occur later in the 
projection, our forecast for stock prices is essentially unrevised by the end of 2016.  We 
continue to expect equity pri ces to move up at an average annual rate of about 6½ percent 
over the next few years, a pace that we think will bring the equity  risk premium down 
toward more typical levels by the end of the medium-term forecast. 
House prices have moved up by a bit mo re since the October Tealbook than we 
had projected.  However, the projected rate of house price appreciation over the forecast

period is little changed rela tive to the October Tealbook pr ojection, and we continue to 
anticipate that house prices w ill decelerate from the rapid pace of increase seen over the 
past year. 
Fiscal Policy 
We have adjusted our fiscal policy assu mptions to incorporate the enactment of 
the recently announced budget deal in the Congre ss.  We continue to anticipate that the 
federal debt limit will be lifted again in the coming months before significant financial 
market disruptions occur, and that the emergency unemployment compensation program 
will be allowed to expire at the end of this year. 
Federal fiscal policy has exerted considerab le restraint on the gr owth of aggregate 
demand in 2013 as a result of the sequestrati on, additional decreases in defense purchases 
associated with the drawdown of overseas military operations, the expiration of the 
payroll tax cut, and the implementation of ot her tax increases at the beginning of this 
year.  Excluding multiplier effects, changes in fiscal policy at all levels of government are 
projected to reduce real GDP gr owth by 1 percentage point th is year, ½ percentage point 
in 2014, ¼ percentage point in 2015, and to have little effect in 2016; in addition, we estimate that the recent budget deal will ease the fiscal rest raint on real GDP growth in 
2014 by 0.1 percentage point.  As in the pr evious projection, the federal unified budget 
deficit is projected to narrow from 4 percen t of GDP in fiscal y ear 2013 to 2¼ percent of 
GDP by fiscal 2016, reflecting both ongoi ng budget consolidation and further 
improvements in the economy that generate stronger gains in tax receipts. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We estimate that foreign real GDP w ill post a second consecutive quarter of 
3 percent growth in the current quarter, up cons iderably from its sluggish first-half rate.  
Our estimates for both the third and fourth quart ers are a little higher than in the October 
Tealbook, mainly reflecting slight ly stronger growth in the emerging market economies.  
The Mexican economy rebounded somewhat more sharply than expected in the third 
quarter following a second-quarter contracti on, and recent indicators of economic activity 
in China have been positive.  The euro-area economy continued its slow exit from 
recession and financial stress.  We continue  to expect foreign economic growth to 
improve gradually over the forecast period, averaging 3¼ percent next year and then leveling off near 3½ percent through the end of 2016.

The broad nominal dollar index has increas ed about 1¼ percent since the previous 
Tealbook.  The dollar strengthened against most other currencie s as market participants 
assigned a higher probability to an earlier start to Federal Re serve tapering and increased 
their expectations for additional monetary  accommodation in some foreign economies.  
Looking ahead, we project that the broad real dol lar will depreciate at  an annual rate of 
about 2¼ percent over the medium term, about the same pace that we had projected in the 
October Tealbook.  Our forecast of dollar depreciation continues to be driven by our 
assumption that financial stress in the euro area will abate further over the forecast period, resulting in reduced safe-haven demands  for the dollar; we also assume that the 
dollar will resume its trend depreciation against emerging market currencies. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The spot price of Brent crude  oil is little changed sin ce the time of the previous 
Tealbook, closing at $109 per barrel on December 10.  Market analysts have become more pessimistic about the outlook for Libyan oil production—and apparently by enough to offset any optimism that might have been engendered by the temporary agreement to 
contain Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for an easing of sanctions.  The spot price of 
West Texas Intermediate is also little cha nged.  As in the October Tealbook, we project 
the price of imported oil to remain at about  $100 per barrel in 2014 and then to decline 
over the remainder of the forecast period, re aching $93 per barrel at the end of 2016. 
Our broad index of nonfuel commodity pri ces is little change d relative to the 
October Tealbook, with the prices of many commodities exhibiting the lowest daily 
volatility in recent years.  Over the for ecast period, as in the previous Tealbook, we 
expect this index to increase only slightl y, consistent with fu tures prices and our 
projected depreciation of the dollar. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The information we have received si nce the October Tealbook has led us to 
increase our forecast for real GDP growth  over the second half of this year by 
½ percentage point to an average annual ra te of 2½ percent, and we expect economic 
growth to rise to a 2¾ percent pace in the first quarter of next year.  Consumer spending appears to be accelerating more in the fourth quarter than we had previously projected, 
and business fixed investment seems to be on a slightly stronger trajectory.  Inventory 
investment and government purchases in the th ird quarter were also notably stronger than 
we had anticipated, but we e xpect the surprise from these categories to mostly unwind

over the near term.  Moreover, the slowing in housing activity since midyear now appears 
to have been more pronounced than we prev iously expected, and we have marked down 
our near-term projection for the gr owth of residential investment. 
Household Spending 
We now estimate that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the 
current quarter, up from a 1½ percent pace in the third quarter.2  The October reading for 
PCE was solid, and light motor vehicle sales surged in November, consistent with a 
pickup in real PCE growth for the fourth quart er as a whole that is  about ½ percentage 
point greater than in the October Tealbook.  In addition, the level of private wages and 
salaries was revised up, and th e preliminary December reading of the Michigan survey 
measure of consumer sentiment reversed the declines seen since the summer.  In the first 
quarter of next year, we now  project that real PCE will rise at an annual rate of 
2¾ percent.  As before, we attribute the near-term acceleration in consumer spending 
relative to that seen earlier this year to th e effect of gains in h ousehold net wealth, the 
waning effects of the tax increases imposed at the beginning of the year, and further 
increases in personal income.  The projected increase in spending ne xt quarter would be 
larger if not for the currently scheduled termination of the emergency unemployment 
compensation program. 
In the staff’s view, the rise in mortgage rates since the spring has been restraining 
housing activity by more than we had anticipated.  Existing home sales fell 5 percent in 
the three months ending in October, and the latest readings on pending home sales point 
to further weakness in these sales in the coming months.  The level of single-family 
construction spending in October was below our expectation, and permits in September 
and October were also notably w eaker than we had anticipated.3  As a result, we now 
project the recovery in single-family constr uction to be somewhat slower than in the 
previous Tealbook.  Meanwhile, construction in  the multifamily sector still appears to 
have flattened out this year after rising quickly over the past couple of years.  All told, the 
growth in real residential investment is expe cted to slow from an  annual rate of about 
13 percent in the first half of this year to just 5½ percent in  the second half, 4 percentage 
points weaker than in  the October Tealbook. 
                                                 
2 This projection does not reflect information from the retail sales release published on 
December 12. 
3 A consequence of the government shutdown is that the Census Bureau will release their estimate 
of single-family housing star ts for September, October, and November on December 18.

Business Investment 
Real private investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is projected to 
increase at a moderate annual rate of 6¼ per cent this quarter after rising at a tepid pace 
earlier in the year.  Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in October point to 
some pickup in the pace of business equipment outlays this quarter, and survey measures 
of business conditions in November suggest  solid spending increases in the coming 
months.  The near-term trajectory for E&I grow th is consistent with the modest pace of 
business output growth since the end of last year. 
Averaging through some large quarterly sw ings, real nonresidential investment 
excluding drilling and mining has increased by just 2 percent over the four quarters 
ending in the third quarter of this year, as high vacancy rates and tight financing 
conditions for new construction continue to curb demand for new buildings.  Both the 
incoming spending data and indicators like the architectural billings index point toward a 
continued sluggish pace of spending for new bu ildings in the current quarter and early 
next year.  Meanwhile, increa ses in real investment in drilling and mining structures 
remain robust, supported by high oil pr ices and new dril ling technologies. 
Nonfarm inventory investment rose substa ntially in the third quarter, contributing 
1½ percentage points to real GDP growth.  This contribu tion was about ½ percentage 
point stronger than we had anticipated at the time of the October Tealbook.  We assume 
that the pace of nonfarm invent ory investment slows a bit in the current quarter and then 
flattens out;  consequently, inventory i nvestment is a small drag on real GDP growth, on 
balance, over the near term.  Inventory-to -sales ratios from book-value data and the 
staff’s flow-of-goods system, as well as gauges of inventory sentiment from regional and 
national manufacturing surveys, do not point to significant inventory imbalances in most 
industries. 
Government 
Real federal purchases dec lined at an annual rate of  1½ percent in the third 
quarter, a smaller decrease than we had anticipated given the sequestration and the 
ongoing drawdown in overseas military spending.  However, we anticipate that federal purchases will fall sharply in the current quarter, owing to the effects of the temporary government shutdown in October as well as the ongoing pressure on federal purchases 
from budget restraint.  The reversal of th e shutdown effects, along with less spending

restraint because of the recent budget deal, are an ticipated to lead to a small increase in 
real federal purchases in the first quarter of next year.   
In the state and local government sector, the information we have received since 
the October Tealbook is consistent with mode st increases in real purchases by these 
governments.  State and local employment gains averaged 13,000 per month during the 
past five months, up from a pace of 2,000 per m onth over the first half of this year.  In 
addition, real state and local c onstruction spending rose robustly  in the third quarter after 
declining in the first half of the year, and data for October suggest a further increase this 
quarter.  Overall, real state and local purchases  are projected to incr ease at an annual rate 
of about ½ percent in both the current quarter and the first quart er of next year. 
Foreign Trade  
After increasing at an annual rate of 3¾ pe rcent in the third qu arter, real exports 
of goods and services are expected to rise 6¾ percent in the current quarter, supported in 
part by solid demand from the emerging ma rket economies and consistent with the 
strength of the October trade da ta.  We expect the surge in exports to be transitory and 
project that exports will step  down to a 4¼ percent rate of increase during the first 
quarter, a pace more in line with the rate of  foreign growth and recent movements in the 
dollar.  The growth of real imports of goods and services is expected to step up to an 
annual rate of 4¾ percent in the fourth qua rter of this year, supported by a temporary 
leveling off of real oil imports following earli er declines.  We expect oil imports to 
resume their decline, and, partly as a consequence, we anticipate that real imports will 
increase at only a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of 2014.  All tol d, the external sector 
is expected to add about ¼ pe rcentage point to the rate of  real GDP growth both in the 
current quarter and in the first quarter of ne xt year; this projecti on is little changed, on 
average, from the previous Tealbook. 
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing activity appears to have accelerated this qu arter after increasing at 
an annual rate of just 1 percen t in the third quarter.  Factory output rose at a moderate 
pace in October, reflecting broad-based production gains across industries, and the available data for physical products and produc tion worker hours poi nt to a somewhat 
larger increase in November.  Taking account of the new orders indexes from the latest 
manufacturing surveys and automakers’ produc tion schedules, we expect factory output 
growth to pick up to an annual rate of 4¾ percent this quarter , 1½ percentage points

above our forecast in the October Tealbook, and then to moderate somewhat in the first 
quarter of next year. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Our forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term is slightly stronger than 
in the October Tealbook.  The lower projecte d path for interest rates, the somewhat 
higher equity and house prices, and the easing of fiscal restraint because of the recent 
budget deal are expected to provide a bit more  lift to real output growth than in the 
previous projection.  This positive impetus is  partly offset by the higher level of the 
exchange value of the dollar.   All told, the level of r eal GDP ends the medium-term 
projection period a little higher than in the October Tealbook.  We now forecast real GDP 
growth to step up from 2¼ percent this year to 3 percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in both 
2015 and 2016.   
Our projection of faster real GDP growth during the next three years continues to 
reflect our expectation that a number of the forces that have been holding back the 
growth in economic activity in recent years wi ll recede.  In particular, we expect the 
restraint from changes in federal fiscal pol icy to wane over time.  We also look for 
European financial and economic conditions to  continue their slow improvement.  In 
addition, we think that mortgage  credit will gradually become more broadly available.  
Given the still highly accommodative stance of  monetary policy, these developments are 
expected to foster a growi ng sense among households and firms that downside risks to 
the recovery have diminished, which should, in turn, reduce asset risk premiums and 
provide additional support to consumer sp ending, business investment, and hiring.   
These dynamics are particularly evident in our forecast for consumer spending.  
Real PCE is projected to rise  2¼ percent this year and th en accelerate to a 3½ percent 
pace, on average, over the medium term.  Th is acceleration reflects the fading effects of 
this year’s tax increases, gains in household wealth produ ced by rising house and equity 
prices, and improved consumer confidence.  Our trajectory for consumer spending in the 
medium term is little changed, on net, from the October Tealbook. 
Rising income and confidence also ar e expected to support higher household 
formation and thereby boost residential construction, although the effect on home 
building will likely be damped by rising mortgage rates.  We expect the growth in 
residential investment to run at a rate of about 15 percent in 2014 and 2015 before

slowing to about 8 percent in 2016.  Our projec tion is slightly less robust than in the 
October Tealbook, as we have carried forward so me of the recent softness in residential 
investment into next year.  However, we have revised up growth in 2015 and 2016; as a 
result, the level of residential construction ac tivity is still projected  to reach its long-run 
average by the end of the medium term. 
Real outlays for E&I are expected to ri se 5½ percent per year, on average, over 
the next three years.  Although faster than the 2¾ percent pace of growth expected this 
year, our medium-term projection for E&I growth is modest by historical standards and 
reflects our expectation that business output will increase at only a moderate pace over 
this period.  Similarly, we continue to e xpect only subdued growth in outlays for 
nonresidential structures over the medium term. 
The external sector is ex pected to be about neutral for GDP growth in 2014 and 
2015 and then to provide a sma ll boost in 2016; on average, these contributions are a bit 
smaller than in our previous projection, reflecting the highe r path for the dollar.  As 
foreign growth recovers and the dollar begins  to depreciate, we expect real exports to 
grow 4¾ percent in 2014 and then to accelerate over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching a 6¾ percent pace in 2016.  Real imports  are expected to increase at an average 
pace of 4½ percent over the medium term, as the ongoing domestic recovery more than offsets the restraint from the projected depr eciation in the real ex change value of the 
dollar.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION  
Recent Developments and Near-Term  Outlook for the Labor Market 
We received the labor market reports for both October and November since the 
October Tealbook, and these reports were, overa ll, somewhat stronger than we had been 
expecting.  Total nonfarm payroll employme nt growth averaged 200,000 in October and 
November, about 50,000 more per month than we had anticipated in the past round.  
These readings, combined w ith the upward revisions to employment in August and 
September, leave the level of total payro lls in November about 175,000 higher than our 
projection in the previous T ealbook.  In the household survey, the unemployment rate has 
decreased 0.2 percentage point  since September to 7.0 percent in November, whereas we

had projected it to stay at its September level.4  The labor force part icipation rate also 
decreased 0.2 percentage point over the same  period, reaching 63.0 percent, contrary to 
our projection of no change.  
Forward-looking indicators of labor mark et activity have generally remained 
consistent with a gradual labor market r ecovery.  The four-week moving average of 
initial claims for unemploymen t insurance has moved back down to its August level, and 
the staff’s labor market conditions index, wh ich summarizes the movements in 19 labor 
market indicators, edged up further in Octobe r and November.  The hi ring plans of small 
businesses have increased, on net, from a y ear ago, and job openings have continued to 
edge up over the past few months, although the hiring rate remains re latively flat.   
All told, we now expect nonfarm payro ll gains of about 185,000 in December and 
195,000 per month in the first quarter of next year, about 35,000 more per month than in 
the October Tealbook.  We have carried forw ard the lower level of the unemployment 
rate and now project it to hol d steady at 7.0 percent in D ecember and then gradually 
move down to 6.8 percent by March 2014—a path th at is 0.2 percentage point lower than 
in our October forecast.  Similarly, we have adjusted down the path of the labor force 
participation rate and now expect that it wi ll remain at its current level of 63.0 percent 
through March. 
Potential GDP and the Natu ral Rate of Unemployment  
We have not revised our estimates of pot ential output or th e natural rate of 
unemployment in this projection.5  We continue to project that the natural rate of 
unemployment will edge down from 5½ per cent in 2013 to 5¼ pe rcent in 2015, and we 
estimate that potential output will rise by a bit more than 2 percent per year over the 
projection period, a slightly faster pace than se en in the past few years.  This acceleration 
                                                 
4 We do not believe that the quality of the October payroll survey was materially affected by the 
government shutdown.  In contrast, the quality of the October household survey may have been impaired 
because of the longer-than-usual delay between the reference week and th e data collection week.  As such, 
we believe it is better to compare the November readings in the household survey with their September values. 
5 We have lowered our estimate of trend labor fo rce participation in response to the downside 
surprises since the September Tealbook but left our estimate of potential GDP growth unrevised.  In effect, 
we boosted our assumption for the difference between productivity in the total economy and productivity in 
the nonfarm business sector.

reflects a step-up in structural productivity as well as the projected decline in the natural 
rate of unemployment. 
The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market 
Total payroll employment is projected to increase 200,000 per month in 2014 and 
then rise 240,000 per month, on average, in 201 5 and 2016, a trajectory that is slightly 
stronger, on net, than in the October Tealbook.  As in previous forecasts, the pace of job 
gains over the medium term is somewhat le ss rapid than what the acceleration in real 
GDP would normally imply, reflecting a projec ted pickup in labor productivity to a pace 
more in line with its structural growth rate. 
As noted previously, the unemployment rate  is 0.2 percentage point lower at the 
start of the forecast period as a result of the incoming data.  From this lower starting 
point, the unemployment rate declines a bout ½ percentage point per year, thereby 
reaching 5¼ percent, the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of une mployment, at the end 
of 2016.  We continue to project that the unemployment rate will cross the 6.5 percent 
policy threshold around th e start of 2015.   
Over the four quarters of 2012, the unemployment rate declined 0.9 percentage 
point; during 2013, it is projecte d to decline 0.7 percentage po int.  During each of the 
next three years, the unemployment rate is projected to decline slightly less per year—
0.6 percentage point in each y ear—despite the fact that real  GDP growth is forecast to 
run at a faster average pace than in 2012 or 2013.  This outlook stems from two 
considerations.  First, we j udge that the natural rate of  unemployment was declining a 
little more quickly during 2012 and 2013 than it  will from here forward; accordingly, the 
unemployment rate gap will be closing about as rapidly over the next three years as it has 
during the past two years.  Second, we judge that between the end of 2011 and the end of 
this year, productivity was incr easing at a below-tr end pace; as a resu lt, the gains in 
output that we observed c ould only be supported by relatively rapid increases in 
employment.  In contrast, over the next thr ee years, we expect productivity growth to 
proceed at its trend pace; therefore, a given in crease in GDP will require a smaller gain in 
employment, all else being equal.   
As shown in the “Labor Market Data and Projections” exhibit, the current 
projection for the unemployment rate in mid- 2014 is about 1 percenta ge point lower than 
our projection in September 2012, when the Committee first tied its asset purchases to an

improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions.  The monthly change in payrolls 
currently projected for mid-2014 is about the same as in the September 2012 forecast; however, the level  of total payroll employment in mid-2014 in this projection is about 
1¼ million (roughly ¾ percent) higher than in the September 2012 Tealbook, partly due to faster-than-expected job growth during the se cond half of last year and the first half of 
this year and partly reflecting last year’s benchmark revision.  
Resource Utilization   
The incoming data have led us to narrow our estimate of the unemployment rate 
gap by ¼ percentage point at the start of the projection period relativ e to our forecast in 
the October Tealbook, with the unemploymen t rate 1¾ percentage points above our 
estimate of the natural rate.  The GDP gap is also a little narrower, with real GDP 
currently 3½ percent below potential.  These gaps are projected to  diminish gradually 
over the medium term; by the end of 2016, the unemployment gap is expected to close, 
and real GDP is projected to be nearly at its potential level.  In the manufacturing sector, 
capacity utilization is current ly almost 2½ percentage point s below its long-run average 
but rises to its long-run average by mid-2015.6 
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
After rising at an annual rate  of 2 percent in the third quarter, total PCE prices are 
estimated to increase at just a ¾ percent pace in the fourth quarter, as energy prices 
decline and other consumer prices decelerate.  Core PCE inflation was 1½ percent in the 
third quarter but appears to be  running at a rate of only a bout 1 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  We project that early next year bot h total and core PCE inflation will be about 
1½ percent. 
We have marked down our projection sli ghtly for consumer energy price inflation 
in the fourth quarter because of recent move ments in the prices of  crude oil and refined 
products.  Overall consumer energy prices are now projected to fall at  an annual rate of 
5 percent, although we expect this decline will be reversed ea rly next year.  Nevertheless, 
                                                 
6 The degree of slack in the manufacturing sector appears to be smaller than that for the broader 
economy, in part because of unprece dented declines in production capacity from 2007 to 2010 that 
occurred as manufacturers shuttered plants that had be en chronically underutilized.  Note that we estimate 
capacity in the industrial s ector based largely on survey data that seek to capture the highest level of output 
that plants can sustainably maintain given sufficient availability of variable inputs, such as labor and 
materials.

given the downward tilt in our projected oil price path, we still forecast that PCE energy 
prices will decline modes tly over the medium term. 
Consumer food prices are projected to incr ease at an annual rate of ½ percent this 
quarter and ¾ percent in the first quarter of next year.  The subdued pace of food price 
inflation reflects a bumper domestic crop, which has pushed down prices for food 
commodities and should continue to restrain f ood price increases next year.  We expect 
PCE food inflation to remain at about ¾ perc ent in 2014 before rising steadily throughout 
the remainder of the medium term to a pace that is slightly below core inflation. 
The data we have received on core PCE prices since the October Tealbook have 
been softer than we had anticipated, and our  projection for core PCE inflation in the 
current quarter has been revise d down about ¼ percentage point.   Medical services prices 
account for part of the recent so ftness in the core PCE index, as the Center for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services reduced the rate of increase in Medicare reimbursements at the 
time of their typical October adjustme nt by more than we had expected.7  We expect that 
reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid  will continue to be restrained by tight 
government budgets over the next couple of years, and, as a result, we have reduced our 
projection for PCE core services inflation a bit to better account for the slowdown in 
medical services inflation. 
Part of the recent softness of core PCE infl ation likely also reflects import prices.  
Prices of imported core goods d eclined at an average annual ra te of nearly 3 percent in 
the second and third quarters but are expected  to increase at about a 1 percent pace in 
both the current quarter and the first half of next year.  Re lative to the Oc tober Tealbook, 
the projection for the first half of 2014 wa s revised down by ½ percentage point in 
response to the higher dollar.  For the remai nder of the forecast period, core import price 
inflation is expected to run about 1½ percent per year—a pa ce that would have a roughly 
neutral effect on U.S. consumer price inflati on—in line with the relatively flat projected 
trajectory for commodity prices and our  assumed pace of dollar depreciation. 
                                                 
7 In contrast, core CPI inflation has come in closer to our expectations and is little revised since 
the previous Tealbook.  The CPI price index for medical services focuses on out-of-pocket expenses by 
households, while the PCE price index includes all medical services provided to households regardless of the payer.  In particular, although the PCE price i ndex includes prices for Medicare and Medicaid, these 
prices are not included in the CPI.  The wider scope fo r medical services in the PC E index leads to a weight 
of about 20 percent in core PCE inflation, compared with  a weight of only 7 percent in core CPI inflation.

Readings on longer-term in flation expectations have remained stable.  The 
preliminary December reading on median 5-to-1 0-year-ahead inflation expectations from 
the Michigan survey stood at 2.8 percent, well  within the relatively narrow range seen in 
recent years.  Expectations for PCE price infl ation over the next 10 years, as measured by 
the Survey of Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2 percent in  the fourth quarter.  
Similarly, TIPS-based measures of longer-ter m inflation compensation are little changed, 
on balance, since the October Tealbook. 
With stable long-run inflation expectati ons, a projected pickup in commodity and 
import prices next year, and gradually dimini shing margins of slack, we expect core PCE 
inflation to increase from just over 1 percen t in 2013 to 1¾ percent in 2016; this forecast 
is essentially the same as in the Octobe r Tealbook.  Given the trajectory for energy 
prices, total PCE inflation is projected to be a bit below co re inflation over the medium 
term.  Thus, through 2016, the PCE inflation projection remains below the Committee’s 
long-run objective of 2 percent. 
The incoming data suggest that labor compensation has continued to rise 
modestly.  We now estimate that compensa tion per hour in the nonf arm business sector 
will increase at a 2 percent a nnual rate in the current quarter —close to the average rate 
seen over the past two years.  We expect th e gradual tightening of the labor market over 
the medium term to push hourly compensation growth up to 3½ percent by 2016.   
Also, see the box “Tealbook Forecast Errors  over the Recovery So Far” for a 
discussion of the recent errors in the st aff’s forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and 
inflation. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
  We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the 
FRB/US model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side  conditions, fiscal policy, 
and other factors.  The c ontour of the long-term outl ook depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of th e Taylor (1999) rule. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates through 2017, albeit to a diminishing

Tealbook Forecast Errors over the Recovery So Far  
In 2009 and 2010, staff forecasts of real GDP growth were too optimistic, while our 
forecasts of the unemployment rate were relatively accurate.  S tarting  in 2011 , 
circumstances have reversed:  O ur forecasts of real GDP have thus far proven quite 
accurate, while we were not able to anticipate the extent of the decline in the 
unemployment rate that has taken place.  R espond ing to this constellation of forecast 
errors, we have substantially downgrad ed our assessment of the supply side of the 
economy .  Meanwhile, inflation in 2011 and 2012 came in well above the staff’s 
expectations; in 2013, by contrast, we have been surprised by how low inf lation has been .  
In this box we present and discuss these recent forecast errors.  
Staff projections for the level of real GDP from the current and past four December Tealbooks are plotted in the left panel of figure 1.  The solid red and dashed orange lin es 
show the overly optimistic projections made by the staff in 2009 an d 2010 .  In mid -2010 and 
mid-2011, the BEA released revised estimates of real GDP that painted a considerably darker 
picture of the severity of the recession and the immediate post -reces sion period, and the 
staff substantially marked down its GDP forecast in 2011.  Since then, revisions to the projected level of real GDP have been relatively minor.   
The right -hand panel presents the same information in growth -rate terms, and rather than 
focusing on the year in which  the forecast was made, it focuses instead on the year in 
which the economic outcome took place.  The gray bars in th is panel show the currently  
published Q4/Q4 percent change s in real GDP in 2010, 2011, and 2012, while the red dots, 
blue squares, and green triangles over each bar show forecasts  for growth that year from 
December Tealbooks two years prior, one year prior, and the contemporaneous year, 
respectively.  The whisker bands around the dots, squares, and triangles demarcate 
approximate 70 percent confidence bands using staff forecast errors over the past

20 years.1  Unusually large forecast errors are represented by cases where the top of a gray 
bar (the actual value) falls outside one of the whisker bands, as was true for the two- year-
ahead projections  for growth in 2011 and 2012, both too high  by an unusually large 
2½ percentage points (p.p.).  Attempts to identify the cause of these forecast errors are 
fraught with uncertainty, but the current GDP data show that PCE is the category that 
contributed most to these two -year- ahead forecast misses (about 1 p.p. to the 2011 GDP 
growth miss  and 1½ p.p. to the 2012 miss) .  Growth in real PCE may have been held down 
by a surge in energy prices in 2011 , which acted like a tax on consumers, contributing to 
lower- than -expected real disposable personal income.2    
The left panel of f igure 2 shows  the staff’s forecasts of t he unemployment rate from  the 
current and past four December Tealbooks.  The overly pessimistic projections in 
December 2011 and December 2012 are particularly striking; in each case, the unemployment rate was ¾ p.p. lower one year later than the staff  had projected.  These 
larger- than -expected declines in the unemployment rate in the face of only  modest 
measured GDP growth led the staff to substantially  mark down its estimates of potential 
GDP , leading  to a sizable narrowing of  the estimated  GDP gap despit e only minor revisions 
to real GDP since 2011  (see the right panel of figure 2 ).  Even conditional on our revised 
potential output  path, the unemployment rate has declined somewhat more than we  
would have expect ed based on GDP growth alone.  In our current view, possible 
explanations for that development might include excessive, panicked firing in 2009 
followed by subsequent normalization in the labor market; m easurement error in GDP 
1 These bands are plus or minus the root mean square error of the forecast for each horizon over the 
past 20 years, so an implicit assumption has been made here that forecast errors follow a normal 
distribution.  Other procedures yield somewhat different er ror bands.  
2 Among other expenditures categories, government purchases contributed about 1 p .p. to the 
forecast miss for 2011, as defense spending and state and local purchases fell much more sharply than expected.  The contribution to the GDP forecast err or from overall fiscal policy was smaller than that fr om 
government purchases, as the federal government unexpectedly put in place a payroll tax cut in 2011 that we think bo osted aggregate demand somewhat .

growth , with the official GDP estimates understating the tru e pace of growth; and greater-
than -expected cyclical declines in labor force participation.3 
Finally, f igure 3 shows the staff’s forecasts, with standard error bands, for total and core 
PCE price inflation over the recovery so far, along with bars for the latest realized values.  
In both 2011 and 2012, inflation came in higher than the staff had projected earlier; indeed, 
the one- and two -year- ahead forecast errors for both total and core PCE price inflation in 
2011 we re unusually large, as was the two- year- ahead core inflation forecast error for 2012.  
These forecast misses appear to be due to a mix of factors.  First, higher- than -anticipated  
oil prices  contributed to the errors in overall inflation.  This oil-price surprise probably 
contributed to the errors in core inflation as well, as did  larger- than -expected increases in 
other commodity and import prices.  More broadly, there may have been less downward 
pressure from slack (as can be seen from the errors in our projections of resource utilization), less persistence in the inflation process, and greater anchoring of inflation 
expectations than we had earlier assumed.  
However, for 2013, both inflation measures now appear likely to come in somewhat lower 
than we had earlier projected.  The ½ p.p. downward revision over the past year to our estimate of core PCE inflation in 2013 likely stems from several factors, including a stronger 
exchange value of the dollar than we had projected and surprising weakness in both the 
PCE measure of medical prices and the nonmedical portion of the non -market -based prices.

extent.  The process of returning th e SOMA portfolio to a normal size is 
expected to be completed by 2021. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities  and bonds continue to decrease 
gradually, returning to normal levels by 2020, and financial institutions further 
ease their lending standards. 
 The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) is 3¾ percent of GDP 
in 2017 and widens thereafter, primar ily reflecting fast-rising transfer 
payments for retirement and health-car e programs.  Federal debt stabilizes 
temporarily at 74 percent of GDP in 2017 but edges up later in the decade.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar stays constant from 2017 
onward.  The price of crude oil holds steady in real te rms.  Foreign real GDP 
rises at about a 3 percent annual rate in the period from 2017 to 2020. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is 5¼ percent, and potential GDP rises 
around 2¼ percent per year from 2017 to 2020.  
The economy is projected to enter 2017 w ith output at its po tential level and 
unemployment at its natural rate, but with in flation below the long-run objective of the 
Committee.  In the staff’s long-term for ecast, further improvements in household and 
business confidence and credit availability, in conjunction with diminishing uncertainty, 
enable real GDP to rise near ly 2¾ percent in 2017.  As a re sult, real GDP moves slightly 
above potential and the unemploym ent rate declines a bit be low the natural rate; these 
small gaps are eventually closed as mone tary policy accommodation is progressively 
withdrawn.  Long-run inflation expectations are assumed to remain well anchored, and, 
with slack in labor and product markets having been eliminated, consumer price inflation 
moves up to 2 percent by 2019.  The nominal federal funds rate rises gradually from 
about 2 percent at the end of 2016 to 4 percent by 2020.8

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign economic activity is pulling out of  a protracted soft patch.  Real GDP 
growth picked up to 3 percent in the third qu arter after averaging onl y about 2 percent for 
more than a year, and recent indicators are po inting to another 3 percent expansion in the 
fourth quarter.  Europe is emerging from its  long recession, China’s growth has recovered 
from a slowdown in the firs t half of the year, and th e Mexican economy has rebounded 
from a second-quarter contraction.  Foreign GDP growth is expected to average 
3¼ percent next year and then level off n ear 3½ percent through 2016.  This outlook is a 
little stronger in the current quarter than in the October Tealbook and not much changed 
thereafter.    
With activity throughout the advanced and emerging market economies (EMEs) 
accelerating simultaneously, there is some chan ce that positive synergies could result in 
stronger global growth than we have projected in our baseline.  At the same time, 
however, some of the downside risks we have previously identified have not gone away.  Europe continues to face daunting economic and political challenges, which could result 
in a resurgence of financial turm
oil and po ssibly a triple-dip recession.  And financial 
stresses in some EMEs became a little more pronounced over the intermeeting period.  Although not the most likely outcome, such st resses could snowball into a broader EME 
crisis, a scenario explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section.   
Inflation in the advanced foreign economies  (AFEs) is estimated to have fallen to 
just ½ percent in the current quarter, nearly 1 percentage poin t lower than we had 
predicted.  Although recent soft ness in retail prices for energy and other commodities 
contributed to the decline, core inflation al so decreased somewhat.  With inflation below 
central bank targets and subs tantial resource slack remaini ng, we expect monetary policy 
in the AFEs to remain expansionary.  Mone tary policy moves have been more divergent 
across the EMEs.  Although some central banks have recently cut policy rates to support 
growth, in some of the more vulnerable EM Es, including Brazil, India, and Indonesia, 
policy rates have been raised to contain inflationary pressure s and curtail currency 
depreciation.

  ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
We expect real GDP growth in the AFEs to remain about 2 percent in the current 
quarter for the third consecutive quarter, as the euro area continues its slow exit from 
recession while the other economies expand at a mo re robust pace.  Growth is expected to 
edge up to just 2¼ percent over the forecast pe riod, with a significant further recovery in 
the euro area partly offset by a slowing of  Japan’s expansion from its rapid 2013 pace. 
Outside of Japan, AFE inflation has declined significantly in recent months, 
raising concerns that disinflation could depress expectations and ultimately turn into 
outright deflation.  Indeed, persistent weakness in core infla tion, especially in Canada and 
the euro area, has led us to mark down our forecast for inflation a touch going forward.  
However, our sense is that the current low ra tes of inflation are c onsistent with resource 
slack and declines in retail energy prices.  With output gaps projected to shrink over the 
forecast period, we expect AFE inflation to rise gradually, reaching 1¾ percent in 2016.        
With inflation well below targets, we expect monetary policy in most economies 
to be a little more accommodative than prev iously assumed.  Following a surprise policy 
rate cut to 0.25 percent in early November, we expect the European Central Bank (ECB) 
to refrain from tightening until early 2016, tw o quarters later than we had previously 
assumed.  We also pushed back the Bank of Ca nada’s (BOC) first policy rate hike by two 
quarters and built in an assumption that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will increase the pace of its asset purchases starting in the second quarter of next year.  We continue to expect the 
Bank of England (BOE) to hold rates steady until late 2015.  
Euro Area 
The euro-area economy emerged from r ecession in the second quarter with 
growth of 1.2 percent, boosted by some transitory factors, th en slowed as expected to a 
meager ¼ percent in the third quarter.  Export growth dropped fo llowing a surge in the 
second quarter, while final domestic dema nd again grew only modestly.  Recent 
indicators suggest that growth  will remain sluggish in the cu rrent quarter at an estimated 
rate of ¾ percent.  In Oct ober, euro-area retail sales d eclined and industrial production 
fell in most euro-area countries.  In add ition, the composite PMI edged lower in both 
October and November.  We expect a gradua l improvement in the pace of expansion to 
1¼ percent in 2014 and about 2 percent in  2015 and 2016 as financial conditions ease 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  further, monetary policy remains accommodative, and the pace of fiscal consolidation 
diminishes. 
Recent data suggest that eu ro-area headline inflation fell below an annual rate of 
1 percent in the current quarter, mostly becau se of a decline in retail energy prices, and 
that core inflation moderated to roughly 1 perc ent.  Inflation expecta tions also have edged 
down.  In response, we lowered our forecast slig htly, although we still expect inflation to 
increase to 1¼ percent in 2014 and to 1½ pe rcent in 2015 and 2016 as the recovery gains 
traction.  In addition to th e surprise rate cut at its November meeting, the ECB 
subsequently signaled that it still has scope fo r further cuts in the policy rate, as well as 
for unconventional policy easing.  However, our  sense is that as long as growth and 
inflation do not dip below our current forecast, the ECB would find such options 
unpalatable.  Accordingly, we have assumed th at the policy interest rate will remain at 
0.25 percent through 2015 and will increase to 0.75 percent over the course of 2016.  
United Kingdom 
Real GDP rose a robust 3.2 percent in th e third quarter, continuing its recent 
strong performance.  Growth was considerably faster than we had projected, driven by a 
pickup in domestic demand, while exports fell.  Recent data, including strong PMI readings in all sector s and improving business confidence, le d us to raise our estimate for 
the current quarter by ½ percentage point to 3 percent, and we also carried some of this 
strength forward.  We now project growth to average 2¾ percent in 2014 and 2½ percent 
in 2015 and 2016.   
We had expected inflation of 3 percent in the current quarter as increases in 
tuition fees continue to be pha sed in.  However, October data indicated that the effect of 
this year’s increase in tuition fees was considerably smaller than last year’s, while 
transport costs fell.  As a result, we cut our forecast of current-quarter inflation to 1½ percent.  With sizable economic slack erodi ng only gradually, we expect inflation to 
remain moderate over the forecast period, aver aging 2 percent.  We thus continue to 
project that the BOE will not raise the Bank Rate until the fourth quarter of 2015 and will 
maintain the current size of its asset purchase program into 2016.  The latest BOE 
forecast suggested that the unemployment rate  would hit 7 percent—the BOE’s threshold 
to consider raising rates—much  earlier than it had indicate d in August.  This change 
brought the BOE’s unemployment rate forecast closer to our own projection, and so we

  did not alter our assumptions for BOE policy.  The BOE has continued to stress that 
crossing the threshold would not necessa rily trigger a rate hike.     
Japan 
After surging 4 percent in the first half  of this year on Abenomics-inspired 
increases in consumer confidence, fiscal s timulus, and declines in the yen, real GDP 
growth slowed to 1 percent in the third quarter as exports dipped and household spending 
moderated.  However, real merchandise e xports bounced back in October, and the 
composite PMI through November points to ra pid expansion.  Accordingly, we expect 
GDP growth to rebound to an average of 4 percent this quarter and next, supported by 
higher household spending ahead of a consumpti on tax hike scheduled for April.  Growth 
should then fall back and average about 1 percent over the remainder of the forecast 
period, as the ending of previously enacted  fiscal stimulus measures along with 
forthcoming consumption tax increases are on ly partly offset by some new business tax 
cuts and additional public spending.  Neverthe less, with potential growth at only about 
½ percent, the output gap shrinks over the forecast period. 
In contrast to the other AFEs, core in flation picked up in Japan in October, 
prompting us to revise our forecast of fourth-quarter inflation up a bit to 1 percent.  We expect inflation (excluding the direct impact of the tax hikes) to average ¾ percent in 
2014, 1¼ percent in 2015, and 1¾ percent in 2016, still slightly  below the BOJ’s 
2 percent target.  With inflation rising only slowly toward that target, and in line with 
recent indications from policymakers, we now assume that the BOJ will step up the pace 
of its already substantial asset purchases beginning in  the second quarter of 2014. 
Canada 
Real GDP growth in Canada rebounded to  2.7 percent in the third quarter from 
1.6 percent in the second, when it had been re strained by temporary factors that included 
flooding in Alberta and Toront o.  We expect GDP growth to step down to about 
2¼ percent in the fourth quarter before risi ng to 2½ percent in 2014 and 2¾ percent in the 
following two years, supported by improvement in U.S. activity.        
Headline inflation slowed sharply in Octobe r, largely as a result of a surprisingly 
steep drop in gasoline prices.  With energy pr ices lower than previously expected, we 
marked down our current-quarter inflation forecast by 1½ percentage points to only 
¼ percent.  Core inflation also has been persistently low in recent months.  Going

  forward, we expect inflation to  edge up as economic activity firms, but to not reach the 
BOC’s 2 percent target until 2016.  This path is a little lower than in our previous 
forecast.  Given our outlook for lower inflat ion along with still-high unemployment, we 
now project that the BOC will keep its main policy rate unchanged until the first quarter 
of 2015. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Real GDP growth in the EMEs picked up to 4 percent in the third quarter from 
3 percent in the second, reflecting a rebound of Mexican economic activity from its 
second-quarter contraction along with a pickup in  China.  Recent indicators suggest that 
EME growth will edge up to 4¼ percent in the current quarter.  We expect the pace of 
expansion to pick up a little more to an av erage of 4½ percent over the remainder of the 
forecast period, about its trend rate, suppor ted by firming activity in the advanced 
economies.  This projection is a little stronger in the current quarter than in the previous 
forecast, reflecting stronger-than-expected da ta for both China and Mexico, and is little 
changed thereafter. 
We estimate that aggregate EME inflation picked up to 3¾ percent in the current 
quarter, largely reflecting a rise  in Mexican inflation, as food prices reversed their earlier 
declines.  Afterward, inflati on is expected to moderate to 3¼ percent.  Over the 
intermeeting period, the central banks of Brazil, India, and Indonesia raised their policy 
rates further to contain inflation and support their currencies.  In contrast, the central 
banks of Chile, Mexico, and Thailand eas ed monetary policy to support growth.  
China 
Recent indicators suggest that the econo my continued to expand briskly in the 
current quarter, at a pace of about 8½ percen t, up ½ percentage point from the October 
Tealbook.  Although investment growth moderated in October and November, industrial 
production and retail sales growth remained robust, while exports strengthened.  We 
continue to expect a gradua l slowing of growth to 7½ percent by 2016, reflecting both a 
decline in trend growth as well as our belief that the authorities will be reining in credit expansion, particularly in the shadow banking s ector.  Credit growth slowed somewhat in 
October and November and interbank interest  rates moved up, as the People’s Bank of 
China appeared to shift toward a somewhat  less accommodative monetary policy stance.

  We estimate that consumer price inflation registered 3½ percent in the current 
quarter, up from earlier in the year, reflec ting a temporary increase in food prices.  
Inflation is expected to fall ba ck to about 3 percent next quarter and remain at this rate 
throughout the forecast period.   
In mid-November, Chinese leaders agreed  on an ambitious blueprint for reform 
aimed at increasing the role of markets in th e economy.  The plans ar e largely in line with 
our assumption of gradual liberalization of markets and further pr ogress in moving away 
from heavy dependence on the external sect or, and should help sustain growth and 
decrease the likelihood of a disruptive financ ial crisis.  (See the box “China’s Reform 
Agenda.”)  
Other Emerging Asia 
Real GDP expanded at a 4 percent pace in  the third quarter, a little higher than 
projected in the October Tealbook.  However,  performance varied across the region.  
Driven by stronger exports, growth was robus t in India, Thailand, and Malaysia, but the 
pace of expansion was more muted in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Indonesia.  Recent 
indicators for activity in the current quar ter, including PMIs, exports, and industrial 
production, suggest that growth is continuing to average abou t 4 percent.  Growth would 
be higher if not for the effect of Nove mber’s Typhoon Haiyan on Philippine GDP.  We 
anticipate that the Philippine economy will ma ke up its lost ground early next year, with 
growth getting a boost from reconstruction effort s.  We also marked down fourth-quarter 
growth in Thailand somewhat in response to th e recent political unrest.  We expect real 
GDP growth in the region to remain at 4 pe rcent through the first ha lf of 2014 and to rise 
to 4½ percent thereafter. 
We estimate that consumer price inflati on was again close to  4 percent in the 
current quarter, up from the first half of  the year, reflecting pass-through of earlier 
currency depreciations and, in some countries , higher food prices.  These effects should 
dissipate next quarter, and we project that inflation will decline to 3½ percent over the 
next three years. 
Latin America 
Mexico’s real GDP rebounded more strongly than we had expected from its 
second-quarter contraction, increasing at a 3½ percent rate in the th ird quarter.  Sizable 
gains in exports and government expenditures co ntributed to this expansion.  Growth is

  expected to remain at 3½ percent in the cu rrent quarter, marked up from the previous 
forecast in part because of upw ard revisions to U.S. manufactur ing activity, and to stay at 
about that pace over the next three years.  
Inflation in Mexico is estimated to have risen from 2 percent in the third quarter 
to 4 percent in the current quarter as earlier  food price declines we re reversed.  Next 
quarter, tax increases are expected to push in flation up further to 4¾ percent.  However, 
headline inflation should fall back to 3½ percent thereafter, within the central bank’s 
target band of 2 to 4 percent. 
After surging more than 7 percent in the second quarter, Brazilian real GDP 
contracted 2 percent in the third quarter, a weaker outcome than we had expected, with declines in both investment and exports.  Recent data on exports, as well as the 
manufacturing PMI and confidence indicators, have been more positive, and we expect 
growth to pick up in the current quarter to 1¼ percent.  But this expansion is still quite 
weak, as the economy is being held back  by ongoing financial stresses and sluggish 
demand for commodities.  As financial conditions slowly improve and global recovery 
continues, we should see some pickup in growth  to 3 percent next ye ar and 3½ percent in 
2015 and 2016. 
We estimate that Brazilian inflation rose  to 5½ percent in the current quarter, 
reflecting the pass-through of real depreciation and a pickup in food price inflation in 
October.  These pressures should abate next  year, allowing inflation to moderate to 
5¼ percent by the end of 2014.  Citing concerns over inflationary pressures, Brazil’s central bank has continued to tighten monetary policy, with November’s 50 basis point 
increase in the main policy rate, to 10 percent, bringing th
e cumulative increase in the 
rate to 275 basis points since April.

China’s Reform Agenda  
On November 15, the Communist Party of China (CPC) unveiled an ambitious 
blueprint for economic reform, reflecting decisions made at the Third Plenum of 
the 18th CPC Central Committee.  Third Plenums, which are held every five years, 
have historically been used to set out the new leadership’s policy agenda and have occasionally —for example, in 1978 and 1993 —heralded major market 
reforms.  This year’s document calls  for sweeping reforms long thought 
necessary to enhance the role of markets in the economy, help address 
worrisome imbalances, and improve prospects for sustainable economic 
growth.
1  
The document gives emphasis to strengthening the foundations of the mark et-
based economy, notably by according a “decisive” role to the market in 
allocating resources (an upgrade from the “basic” role in previous reform documents) and advocating a more limited role for government in the economy.  
The reforms highlighted includ e the following:  
• Financial reforms  to improve financial access and promote a more
efficient use of capital, including gradually liberalizing interest rates,
introducing deposit insurance, developing domestic capital markets,
moving toward a market -based exchange rate regime, liberalizing the
capital account, and opening up services sectors such as finance, healthcare, and education to foreign investment.
• Fiscal reforms  to reduce local governments’ reliance on transfers from
higher levels of government and lessen incentives to raise revenue vialand sales and opaque off -balance- sheet borrowing vehicles.  The
reforms would centralize some government spending responsibility(which currently resides mostly with local governments), provide local
governments with more taxing authority, allow local governments to
issue debt, and improve transparency in local government finances.
• Labor and land reforms  to facilitate urbanization and address growing
social inequities.  Reforms in this area include easing restrictions on
migration of rural residents to urban areas and reducing farmers’
vulnerability to land expropriation by strengthening their property rights.
• Natural resource pricing reforms  to encourage a more efficient use of
water, oil, natural gas, and electricity and thus reduce the energyintensity of China’s growth.
• Reforming state -owned enterprises (SOEs) to  improve corporate
governance practices, create state- owned asset management companies
focused on maximizing returns, and allocate more SOE profits to so cial
1 The formal title of the document is “The Decision on Major Issues Concerning 
Comprehensively Deepening Reforms.”  An abbreviated version of the document is available in 
English at www.china.org.cn/china/third_plenary_session/2013 -11/16/content_30620736.htm.

spending.  These reforms have generally been perceived to be among 
the least ambitious on the agenda; notably, the document fails to 
mention reducing barriers to entry in “strategic” and “pillar” industries, 
such as telecommunications, which are currently shielded from 
competition.  That said, other reforms, such as moving toward market -
based prices for natural resources and liberalizing interest rates, would likely force changes on SOEs indirectly.  
• Other reforms  include those for governance such as cracking down on
corruption and waste and relaxing  the one -child policy for families.
Although this latter policy has received much attention, it is lessconsequential than it might appear, as it only applies to families in which
one or both of the parent s is a single child.
Most of these reform initiatives have been articulated before, and some 
(including several of the financial reforms) are already under way.  But the 
comprehensive range and decidedly pro- market tone of the plenum’s agenda has 
strengthen ed the perception that the current leadership both recognizes what 
reforms are needed and intends to implement them.   
Timely and successful implementation of these reforms remains an open 
question, however, and will require strong coordinated action from the party 
leadership.  Encouragingly, oversight of the implementation of the reform 
agenda will be chaired by President Xi Jinping himself, who appears to carry more 
weight in the party than some of his predecessors.  His oversight may help 
counter resistance at various levels of government.  Moreover, President Xi 
benefits from the support of other reform -minded officials, notably Premier Li 
Keqiang, who heads the State Council, the highest executive body.  Reformers also head some of the most important government departments, including the 
People’s Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance.  
The timeline for reforms remains vague; the document s tates only  that “decisive 
results are to be obtained in key areas in 2020.”  We continue to expect gradual and ca utious implementation  of the reform agenda, particularly in areas where 
vested interests  are more formidable (for example, SOEs), where technical 
barriers  are significant (for example, developing rural land market s), and  where 
financial stability concerns come into play (for example, revamping local 
government finances ).   
Overall, the Third Plenum’s reform agenda is a welcome development.  Its implementation would both support continued rapid economic expansion in the 
coming years, albeit at a decelerating  pace, and decrease the likelihood of a 
disruptive financial crisis.  Since we had already factored in several of the reforms and still believe that it will take some time for them to bear fruit, the agenda has 
not led us to alter our forecast.  The announced agenda does give us more 
confidence, though, that the authorities will indeed carry out these reforms over 
time and thus increases the conviction with which we hold our baseline outlook.

Financial Developments  
Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were driven largely 
by incoming data on employment and economic activity that exceeded investor 
expectations as well as by Federal Reserve communications .  On balance, market  
participants  moved closer their expected timing of the first reduction in the pace of asset 
purchases  but continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would remain low for a 
substantial time .  The yield curve steepened over the period, equity price s moved up, and 
spreads on corporate bonds narrowed somewhat .  The dollar appreciated against most 
other currencies.  
• Responses to the December Survey of Primary Dealers  indicate that the 
perceived probability of a reduction in the pace of purchases at the upcoming 
meeting has risen significantly since the October survey.  However, the median anticipated date for the first reduction in asset purchases remains March  2014. 
• The expected path of the federal funds rate priced into derivatives markets 
was little c hanged  through the end of 2015, but it became somewhat steeper 
thereafter.  The two -year Treasury yield was about unchanged, whereas the 
10-year yield  rose 30 basis points. 
• Financial flows to nonfinancial businesses picked up again after a temporary dip associated with the fiscal standoff.  In the household sector, auto loans 
continued to expand strongly, whereas credit card and mortgage lending remained restrained,  reflecting  in part  tight lending conditions.  
• Hints  of a growing confidence in the economic outlook included a surge in 
initial public offerings , ongoing strong issuance of subprime auto ABS, and 
the first significant increase in bank holdings of construction and land development loans in five years. 
POLICY  EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET PRICES

were seen as raising the odds that the FOMC might decide to reduce the pace of asset

purchases at its December meeting , though analysts remained uncertain and divided in 
their views on this question.  In addition, the October FOMC statement and minutes 
reportedly were viewed as indicating  that the Committee’s stance on asset purchases 
would be a touch less accommodative than previously expected.    
The December Survey of Primary Dealers indicates that dealers now place 
probabilities of 25 percent and 18 percent on a reduction at the upcoming meeting  in the 
pace of Treasury and MBS purchases, respectively.  At the time of the October survey, the probabilities were around 10 percent.  For the January  and March meetings, 
respondents place probabilities of 27 percent and 30 percent, respectively, on a first reduction in the pace of either Treasury or MBS purchases ; the reported probability for 
March is about 5 percentage points lower than at the time of the October survey.  Nonetheless, by  a relatively slim margin, t he median anticipated date for the first 
reduction in asset purchases remains March 2014. 
Market participants, however, did not appear to interpret these developments as 
suggesting an earlier liftoff of the federal funds rate.   A variety of  Federal Reserve 
communications—including other language in the October FOMC minutes, Vice Chair 
Yellen’s confirmation testimony, and the Chairman’s speech at the National Economists 
Club—were seen as  strengthen ing the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal 
funds rate.  Two research papers by senior Federal Reserve staff members may have reinforced this development.  Respondents to the primary dealer survey anticipate that the  
most likely timing of the first increase in the target rate has shifted to the fourth quarter of 2015, after generally remaining at the third quarter of 2015 since the August  2012 
survey.
1 
On net, the expected federal funds rate path through the end of 2015 based on a 
straig ht read of OIS quotes moved only slightly since the October meeting, and 
uncertainty about short- term rates two - to three-years ahead, proxied by swaption implied 
volatilities, inched up .2  The expected federal funds rate path further out rose somewhat, 
and the Treasury yield curve steepened, with the 2- year Treasury yield about unchanged  
1 In the flash survey conducted after the June 2013 FOMC meeting, respondents anticipated that 
the most likely timing of the first increase in the target rate was the second quarter of 2015.  
2 The staff’s term structure model that respects the zero -lower-bound constraint yields 
qualitatively similar behavior of the expected path of the short rate.

and 5- and 10- year yields higher by 16 and 30 basis points, respectively.3  The staff term 
structure models suggest that more than half of the rise in the 10- year yield wa s due to an 
increase in term premiums, consistent with a shift in asset purchase expectations 
influencing the long end of the curve and a modest  rise in interest rate uncertainty .   
The TIPS -based measure of 5- year inflation compensation dipped 13 basis points, 
while the 5- year forward measure was unchanged.  The 30- year current -coupon agency 
MBS yield increased a bit more than the 10- year Treasury yield.  
Consistent with the gen erally better -than-expected  news  regarding economic 
activity , stock prices moved up 2 percent, on net, and some broad equity price indexes 
touched all -time high s during the period.  As discussed in greater detail in the December 
QS assessment,  aggregate ratios of broad equity price indexes to forward earnings 
measures are generally no t far above their historical median values, while valuations in 
some segments of the stock market —including small firms in the high -tech sector —
appear stretched.  Both near - and far- term spreads of yields on corporate bonds to those 
on Treasury securities of comparable maturity  narrowed somewhat over the intermeeting 
period.  
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Business finance flows were robust over the intermeeting period, likely reflecting 
in part a growing comfort with the economic outlook as well as the resolution of the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal standoff.  Total  funds raised through seasoned and 
initial public offerings  by the nonfinancial corporate sector in October and November 
reached levels not seen in a decade.   Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations 
picked up again after a dip related to the fiscal standoff, and a larger  amount of 
speculative- grade issuance was earmarked for investment  spending, leveraged buyouts 
(LBOs) , and mergers and acquisitions (M&As) .  Similarly, institutional issuance of 
leveraged loans rose in October, boosted by a number of M&A and LBO transactions, 
and remained solid in November.  CLO issuance was also robust. 
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets were also 
consistent with increased  investor confidence.  Year -to-date CMBS issuance is 80 percent 
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 8  basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday stan dard deviation averaging about 5 basis points .

higher than the equivalent measure for 2012, although issuance remains well below the 
levels seen before the financial crisis.  Responses to the December 2013 Senior Credit 
Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS)  suggest that demand for 
funding for CMBS has picked up since September .  CRE loans on banks’ books 
expanded in October and November at an increasing pace , and third -quarter Call Report 
data indicate that construction and land development loans, generally the riskiest type s of 
CRE loans, registered the ir first significant incr ease in five years.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Auto loans continued to expand  in October, and bank credit data suggest that this 
trend was sustained  in November.  Data from  credit bureau records indicate that these 
loans are broadly available, including to consumers with subprime credit histories.  Auto 
ABS issuance accelerated in November, and , within the category, issuance of paper 
backed by subprime auto loans stay ed stro ng.  As discussed in the QS assessment, 
although underwriting standards applied to loans included in  recent subprime auto ABS 
deals  appear to have slipped a touch, overall credit enhancement appears  adequate.  In 
contrast to conditions in the auto loan ma rket, credit card balances, measured on a year -
over-year basis, continued to move sideways, and ABS issuance in the sector has stayed flat. 
In the mortgage finance market, market sources reported  that several large lenders 
eased their mortgage underwriting  standards slightly, but a ggregate data through 
September suggest that lenders continue to be reluctant to extend credit to borrowers with less-than-pristine  credit scores.  Mortgage rates increased about 30 basis points over the 
intermeeting period and ar e about 100 basis points above their early-May lows.  On 
balance, re finance applications hovered roughly 65 percent below their early -May level , 
while purchase applications have declined only 13 percent.  Banks’ holdings of closed -
end residential real estate loans in November ran off for the fifth consecutive month, as mortgage originations, which were held down by the sharp drop in refinancing, were outpaced by sales to the government-sponsored enterprises of loans held on balance 
sheet , reflecting  the usual lag between loan originations and sales .  House prices as 
measured by the Core Logic index rose significantly in October, but other indicators 
suggest that the pace of house price gains continues to decelerate relative to its pace at the beginning of the year.

TREASURY  AND AGENCY FINANCE  AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury market remained close to long- term average 
levels .  Agency MBS market liquidity continued to show some further signs of 
improvement from the challenged levels seen this summer , with some measures returning 
to near their average levels for most of the current MBS purchase program.  Dollar -roll-
implied financing rates for main production coupon agency MBS securities stayed near 
their recent high levels, re flecting limited settlement pressures.4  Since the October  
FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned $225 billion of nominal coupon securities and $13 billion of TIPS.
5     
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets have been generally stabl e since 
the October FOMC meeting.   The Open Market Desk continued to conduct daily, 
overnight, fixed- rate, capped -allotment reverse repurchase operations as part of an 
operational readiness exercise and gradually raised the offered rate to 5 basis points, the maximum rate authorized by the FOMC.
6 
Responses to the December SCOOS generally showed little change in dealer -
intermediated financing since September .  Credit terms applicable to most clas ses of 
counterparties were little changed .  One -third of respondents reported a decline in the use 
of financial leverage by trading real estate investment trusts, whereas the use of leverage 
by other classes of counterparties was unchanged.  Despite reports of an uptick in the financing of longer-duration assets since September, the current use of repo and other similar financing for longer -duration assets was roughly in line with or somewhat below 
the levels seen early in 2013.  
4 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $ 68 billion of Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program and $78 billion of agency MBS under the flow -based MBS 
program and the reinvestment program.   In addition, the Federal Reserve began an exercise consisting of a 
series of small -value purchase and sale operations of agency MBS via FedTrade.   Although only purchases 
have been tested to date, sales will be conducted as well; gross operations through January will not exceed 
$500 million.    
5 The Treasury will conduct its initial auction of floating -rate notes in late January 2014, which 
represents the first introduction of a new type of Treasury security in 17 years.  The floating -rate notes will 
have a maturity of two years and will pay a variable interest rate composed of an index rate equal to the 
high rate of the most recently issued 13 -week Treasury bill and a spread that is determined at auction.  
6 In addition, over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve conducted a 28 -day, fixed -rate, 
full-allotment term deposit operation at an interest rate of 26 basis points.  The operation, as part of 
ongoing operational readiness exercises, resulted in an award of $13½ billion in term deposits, marking the 
largest such operation to  date.

  BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
Bank credit rose slightly in October and November, as the growth in C&I, CRE, 
and consumer loans was partially offset by de clines in holdings of residential mortgages 
on banks’ balance sheets.  A ccording to the November Survey of Terms of Business 
Lending, interest rates and loan rate spreads on newly originated C&I loans declined over 
the past three months, likely in part because  of the ongoing elevated competition for such 
loans.  Stock prices for large and regi onal domestic banking firms outperformed the 
broad equity market over the intermeeting period, rising about 4½ percent amid better-
than-expected economic data and the settleme nt of mortgage-relat ed litigation by some 
large banking organizations.  CDS spread s for the largest bank holding companies 
declined relative to a broad index of liquid CDS referencing investment-grade firms. 
 After a brisk advance in October, M2 gr owth contracted in November as market 
conditions normalized following the fiscal sta ndoff and investors reallocated out of cash 
positions.  Notably, institutional money f und investors and money funds themselves 
appeared to reallocate out of bank deposits  following the fiscal deal, reversing the 
increases seen during the debt  ceiling impasse.  The monetary base continued to expand 
rapidly in November, primarily reflecting the increase in reserve balances resulting from 
the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
The dollar appreciated against most currenc ies in the wake of the October FOMC 
meeting and after the October jobs report, in line with expectations for a more imminent 
slowing in the pace of asset purchases.  Ov er the period as a whole, the broad dollar 
index increased nearly 1 percent.  Against other major currencies, the dollar rose the 
most—appreciating 4¾ percent—against the Japanese yen, refl ecting in part comments 
by Finance Minister Aso that raised the possibility of currency-market intervention and comments by Governor Kuroda th at indicated that the Bank of Japan will continue easing 
and may expand monetary stimulus.   
Asset prices in some of the vulnerabl e emerging market economies remained 
especially sensitive to information regarding the timing of a potential reduction in the 
pace of Federal Reserve asset purchases.  The dollar appreciated 6¼ percent against the 
Brazilian real and 7½ percent against the Indonesian rupiah.  B ond yields in these 
economies rose sharply, with long-term Brazi lian local currency yields increasing

150 basis points.  In addition, most emerging market equity indexes fell, on net, over the 
period, even though they reacted favorably to the outcome of China’s Third Plenum (see 
the IEDO box “China’s Reform Agenda”).   
Prompted by lower- than-expected inflation in the euro area, which fell in October 
to its lowest level in four years, the European Central Bank (ECB) surprised markets by 
cutting its main refinancing rate 25 basis points to ¼ percent, sooner than had been 
expected.  Since the meeting, several ECB policymakers have noted possibilities for further easing in the euro area, including cutting the main refinancing rate further, lowering the r ate paid at the ECB’s deposit facility into negative territory, and conducting 
a new l onger -term r efinancing operation.  These factors likely restrained the increase 
over the period in German long-term sovereign yields, which rose only 8 basis points, comp ared with increases of nearly 30 basis points in comparable U.K. and U.S. yields.    
Major headline equity prices in the euro area and the United Kingdom fell 
1¾ percent and 3½ percent, on net, respectively.  In contrast, Japan’s Nikkei index rose 
9 percen t amid the weakening of the yen and large foreign purchases of Japanese 
equities.  
Foreign private investors, on net, sold a sizable amount of Treasury bills in 
October, perhaps reflecting concerns over the fiscal standoff.  However, demand for Treasur y sec urities  by foreign official investors remained strong, especially for longer-
term bonds and notes.  More recent data on custody holdings at the FRBNY suggest that 
foreign official investors continued to purchase Treasury securities at a brisk pace in 
Novem ber.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP  growth 
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20  years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable volatility .1  We see a 
number of risks  attending our forecast for economic activity , including those posed by the 
possibility  that the extent of supply- side damage to the economy since the recession has 
been greater than we have assumed,  that the tightening in mortgage rates  since last spring 
will continue to exert greater restraint on the recovery  in the housing sector than we have 
projected , and that  economic and financial stresses in emerging market economies 
(EMEs) or the euro area will intensify .  In addition, we see neither monetary policy nor 
fiscal policy as being well positioned to help the economy weather  any future  adverse 
shocks.  Given these considerations, we continue to believe that the risks to our forecast 
for real GDP grow th are skewed to the downside.  However, we view the risk s around 
our projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced , with the risk of a higher 
unemployment rate from adverse demand -side developments roughly countered by the 
possibility that the une mployment rate continues to surprise us to the downside as it has 
in recent years .   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook has been informed by the staff’s 
recently completed quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment , which concluded that the 
vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks has remained at moderate levels overall, with mixed and largely offsetting changes over the fall.  The moderate level of vulnerability reflects the relatively strong capital profiles of large domestic b anking 
firms, the low levels and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the nonfinancial sectors, and some progress in ongoing efforts to reduce reliance on fragile short- term wholesale 
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity have increased sharply over the past 
several years.  In particular, as the fixed 20 -year window used to assess the size of typical forecast errors 
has moved forward to include the experience of the past five years, the estimated standard errors for out -
year projections of the unemployment rate and real GDP growth increased between 2008 and 2011, almost 
doubling for unemployment  and increasin g by about 50 percent for GDP growth , and have remained at 
these higher levels with the current 20 -year sample.  As a result, the benchmark estimates of uncertainty 
about economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of the Great Moderation period.  In contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged relative to earlier 
sample periods.

funding across the financial sector.  In addition, valuations in most asset markets are 
broadly in line with historical norms, and an increase in  term premiums in  the past few 
months has pushed yields on Treasury and investment- grade corporate securities closer to 
average levels.  T he QS assessment reiterated the importance of certain structural 
vulnerabilities in the financial system, including the complexity and interconnectedness 
of large financial institutions, and noted potential concerns related to a growing appetite 
for higher- yielding assets and associated pressures o n underwriting standards, but it 
suggested that current vulnerabilities are not  unusually pronounced.    
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Long er-run inflation 
expectations appear to  have remained stable in recent years despite  fluctuations in the 
prices of crude oil, other commodit ies, and imports more generally, as well as  persistently 
wide margins of slack in labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as broadly balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility that the soft  readings  on inflation seen this year could prove more persistent than we 
expect, especially if low levels of resource ut ilization or subdued increases in unit labor 
costs  persist longer or have larger effects than we currently project.  On the upside, an 
increase in inflation expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet  and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current 
stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a stronger- than-expected recovery 
or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than is  assumed in the 
baseline.  
ALTERNATI VE SCENARIOS
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  T he first 
scenario  considers the possibility  that in our baseline assessment, we have underes timated 
the extent of labor market damage caused by  the recession  and its aftermath .  In the 
second scenario , restrained demand slows residential  investment and cause s house prices 
to decelerate more than in the baseline.  In the third , a stronger recovery  is accompanied 
by an unsustainable buildup in financial risk- taking and leverage in corporate finance that  
ultimately leads to another recession .  The fourth scenario considers the possibility that 
the substantial decline in the unemployment rate seen ove r the past year is a more 
accurate signal of the pace of the recovery than the modest gains in real GDP, and that

GDP will rise more strongly  in the next couple of years  than  is projected  in the baseline .  
In the fifth scenario , the softness in consumer price inflation seen this year proves to be 
more persistent than anticipated.   The final two scenarios explore risks to the U.S. 
economy from foreign economic developments—in the six th scenario, financial stresses 
experienced by EMEs escalate into a full -blown crisis, and in the seven th, easing of 
geopolitical tensions lead s to a gradual , but sizable , decline of oil prices.   
We generate the first f ive scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations, as in the baseline 
forecast, the federal funds rate follows an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, subject to the FOMC’s thresholds for the unemployment rate and projected inflation.  For the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy  rule, subject to the same 
thresholds, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.
2  In all cases, we 
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Hysteresis 
The prolonged period of slack demand in recent years appears to have had some 
persistent adverse effects on the productive capacity of the economy.  The staff’s baseline analysis incorporates the negative effects of the weak economy on physical capital accumulation, a modest rise in the natural unemployment rate, and some steepening of the downtrend in labor force participation.  That said, the baseline forecast assumes that labor markets are in the process of healing.  In this scenario, the damage to potential labor 
supply is more extensive, ref lecting a deeper manifestation of hysteresis  than we have 
assumed in the baseline.
3  As a result, the natural rate of unemployment is ¾ percentage 
point above the baseline and the trend labor force participation rate falls 1½ percent age 
points below the ba seline by  2013, leaving the current output gap 2½ percentage points 
narrower .  Potential labor input is eroded in future years because of hysteresis, but with 
the labor market improving, the effects going forward are smaller than in the past, although potential output is still 1½ percentage points below the baseline by the end of 
2018.  In this scenario, the annual rate of r eal GDP  growth is  about ½ percentage point 
less than in the baseline, on average, through 2016, and  it returns to its  baseline pace by 
2 The SIGMA policy rule uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.  
3 We modeled the alternative by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the natural 
unemployment rate and for trend labor force participation with hysteres is-generating components that 
become active when labor market slack is elevated.

2018.  Resource slack decreases more rapidly in coming years, and the unemployment 
rate therefore initially falls faster than in the baseline.  Eventually, however, the higher 
natural rate manifests itself , and unemployment is higher  by 2017.  Even w ith a narrower 
margin of  resource slack, inflation is only slightly higher than in the baseline because the 
model’s Phillips curve is very flat.  T he federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective 
lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2014.   
Weak Housing Market  
The most recent indicators of housing demand and residential investment have 
been weaker than we expected , plaus ibly reflecting a greater restraint  from the increase in 
mortgage rates this year.  This scenario considers the possibility that this rest raint is 
greater and persists  longer than we have allowed for in the baseline.  In particular , 
residential construction is assumed here to  edge up only slightly over the next two years .  
These weaker demand conditions cause house price  gain s to average 2 p ercent  per year  
less than in the baseline.  These developments shave about 1 percent  off the level  of real 
GDP by the end of 2015, and the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent until the second half of 2015.  The weaker pace of  economic growth and low er inflation  relative to 
the baseline cause the first increase in the federal funds rate to be delayed until the fourth  
quarter of 2015.    
Corporate Credit Boom and Bust  
As noted in the recent  QS Assessment of Financial Stability,  the provision of 
financi ng to speculative-grade corporate borrowers through high- yield bonds and  
syndicated l everage d loans has remained robust this year, raising the possibility of large 
future losses for investors.  T his scenario  initially features a more aggressive easing  in 
lending standards, greater use of leverage , a larger reduction in risk spreads, and rapid 
increases in equity prices .  In response, business capital investment and consumer outlays 
for d urables  and housing move strongly above the baseline, and the unemploym ent rate 
drops below 5 percent in 2015.  However, the financial froth proves unsustainable, and about two years from now the leverage cycle reverses abruptly, leading to a sharp curtailment of credit.  The resulting plunge in business and household spending is severe  
enough to cause the economy to fall into recession , with the unemployment rate reach ing 
almost 7½ percent by  late 2017.  Monetary policy responds to the credit  boom by 
beginning to tighten  in mid -2014 but reverses course once the credit disruption begins.  
Although the inertial nature of the assumed policy rule prevents a rapid decline in  the

federal funds rate, the policy easing is sufficient to enable an economic recovery to take 
hold.  Inflation is little changed over the simulation horizon. 
Faster Recovery 
As currently measured, r eal GDP has risen  only modestly over the past few years, 
but the unemployment rate has declined substantially.  In the staff baseline projection, we 
have interpreted the weaker  readings on GDP growth  as resulting fro m factors  that 
continue to restrain aggregate demand.  An alternative possibility is that the recent gains in real GDP have been understating the true strength of the economy, and other indicators—such as GDI and labor market conditions—have been accurate in signaling a more rapid economic recovery.  In this scenario, the improvements in household wealth 
and the labor market over the past year lead to a stronger pickup in spending than in the 
baseline projection.  Additionally, the equity premium is assumed  to decline faster than in 
the baseline.  Real GDP rises at an average annual rate of about 4 percent  in 2014 and 
2015; the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent by mid-2014 and reaches its natural rate of 5 ¼ percent by the end of 2015.  With resource s lack decreasing more rapidly, 
wages and unit labor costs accelerate gradually relative to the baseline; however, with 
long-term inflation expectations assumed to remain well anchored, consumer price 
inflation rises to only 2 percent by 2018.  The federal f unds rate lifts off from its effective 
lower bound by the third  quarter of 2014, three quarters earlier than in the baseline.    
Low Inflation 
In the baseline projection, the downside surprise on core inflation this year is 
assumed to be largely transitory, and over the next few years inflation gradually moves up toward 2 percent  as the recovery continues .  This view is based on the staff’s 
assumption of firmly anchored longer-run inflation expectations, a view  shared by most 
New Keynesian Phillips curves .  In this scenario, we examine the possibility that inflation 
is currently behaving according to an accelerationist Phillips curve, which in current circumstances  generates declining longer-run inflation expectations, thereby leading to a 
mutually reinforcing downward dynamic.  As a result, i nflation falls  below 1 percent next 
year and edges close to  zero  thereafter .  While the unemployment rate falls below its 
6½ percent threshold in the first  quarter of 2015, the very low inflation that prevails in 
this sc enario causes the policy rule to prescribe the first increase in the federal funds rate 
only in the fourth  quarter of 2015.  By then, the unemployment rate is 6 percent .

Financial Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies  
We expect financial market stresses in the EMEs to remain generally manageable.  
However, with investors focused on both EME vulnerabilities and the prospective effects 
of policy normalization in advanced economies, the risk of a substantial ratcheting up in financial stress in EMEs remai ns significant.  In this scenario, we consider the effects of a 
financial crisis that engulfs many EMEs.  Sovereign and private borrowing costs in these 
countries soar, and the confidence of their households and businesses weakens 
significantly.  These events cause EME currencies to depreciate roughly  7 percent, on 
average, against the dollar relative to the baseline, even though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates to attenuate capital outflows.  These factors lead real GDP in the EMEs to de cline 4½ percent relative to the baseline by early 2015.
4  
The financial stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to 
the rest of the world.  In the United States, corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight -to-safety flows push down term premiums on 
government bond yields.  In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  As a result, U.S. real GDP growth 
is less than  2 percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate hovers around 7 percent 
through most of 2014 before beginning to decline gradually.  With substantially greater 
resource slack and lower import prices, core U.S. PCE inflation dips to around 1 percent in 2014.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until early 2016. 
Lower Oil Prices 
In our baseline forecast , global oil prices decline gradually over the next few 
years.  However, it is possible that various geopolitical tensions that have restrained global oil supply, including the Iranian export embargo and civil unrest in Libya, will 
diminish considerably more than is assumed, particularly if the recent agreement with 
Iran over its nuclear program presages a quicker return by that country to full production.  In this scenario, we assume that oil prices fall $25 per barrel below the baseline by the end of 2014.

4 In the QS background report on EME vulnerabilities, the staff considered a variant of this 
scenario in which the EME financial crisis was even deeper and more broadly based.   That alternative 
scenario assumed more- adverse financial spillover effects to the United States and the AFEs and, hence, 
implied larger declines in U.S. and AFE GDP than the scenario examined here.   
5 Financial markets appear to assign a fairly low weigh t to the possibility that oil prices will fall  by 
more  than envisioned in this scenario.  In particular, staff analysis using options on oil futures suggests a

household income and increasing the return on investment.6  U.S. real GDP rises at an 
annual rate of about 3½ percent, on average, in 2014 and 2015—¼ percentage point 
above the baseline—and the unemployment rate is 5¾ percent  at the end of 2015, about 
¼ percentage point lower than in the base line.  Reflecting the decline in energy costs, 
total PCE inflation drops to ½ percent in 2014, one percentage point below the baseline.  However, because longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored, core inflation runs only about ¼ percentage po int below the baseline over the next couple of years.  
Given the largely offsetting implications for monetary policy of lower core inflation and stronger real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound at about the same time as in the baseline but rises a bit faster thereafter.  
roughly 10 percent chance that crude oil prices will fall by $25 per barrel or more below the December 
2014 futures price.

more reliant on imported oil.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
