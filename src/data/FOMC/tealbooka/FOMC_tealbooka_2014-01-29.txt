Editorial note:  
 
Many of you have indicated over the y ears that you would appreciate greater 
transparency on the part of the staff with re gard to the economic and financial outlook.  
Some of those requests have focused mostly  on your wish to have us demystify the 
baseline forecast; others have focused mo re on gaining a greater appreciation for the 
range of views and debates that figure prominently in our forecast-preparation process 
but have mostly been hidden from your view.  For our part, we have been eager to ensure 
that we foster an atmosphere that puts a high value on the expression of differences in 
views about key aspects of the outlook, so l ong as those views are well reasoned and well 
grounded in theory and em pirical observation.   
 In response to your requests, we have implemented several steps, including 
introducing debate-style foru ms for the benefit of Board members here at 20th and 
C Streets covering key issues related to the outlook, as we ll as the expositional memos 
that unpack selected aspects of the judgme ntal forecast—the latest example being the 
memo that focuses on the inflation forecast, prepared by Alan Detmeister, Jean-Philippe Laforte, and Jeremy Rudd. 
 With this edition of the Tealbook, we are introducing another f eature that we hope 
will be helpful in this regard—namely, a regul ar box that will attempt to make the case 
for an off-baseline pathway for the economy (in this Tealbook, see “Alternative View:  The Recovery Is Complete” in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section).  Although these boxes will serve a si milar purpose to the alternative scenarios 
that already appear in the Risks and Uncer tainty section of the Tealbook, we see three 
key differences:  First, the material will appear with specific attribution to the author or 
authors.  Indeed, I am grateful to Andrew  Figura for preparing th e first box in this 
lineage.  We intend that the intellectual ownership of thes e boxes will reside with the 
author(s) rather than with the staff collec tively.  Second, by devoting up to two pages of 
text to each one of these new boxes, we w ill allow the authors to make the case more 
thoroughly for the alternative po int of view than is possible in the R&U section, where a 
single paragraph is the norm.  Third, we will not require the analysis in the alternative 
views section to be model-based and will oftentimes not complement it with a specific quantification of the implic ations for monetary policy.  I should also mention one 
commitment I have made to potential future authors:  I do not expect authors will necessarily see the scenario out lined in the box to be more lik ely than the staff baseline; 
rather, I expect them to make the best possibl e case for the scenario being taken seriously 
as a relevant alternative for policymakers to consider.   
 For now, we intend to provide you with su ch an “Alternative View” periodically, 
perhaps about four times per year. 
 I hope you will let me know if you find th ese Alternative View boxes to be a 
useful addition to our repertoire.

Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received sin ce the December Tealbook suggests that 
economic activity expanded at a much more ra pid pace over the second half of last year 
than we had anticipated.  Both consumer and business spending now appear to be on a 
firmer trajectory than we previously thought , and net exports have  been well above our 
expectations as well.  Although the latest readings on reside ntial construction have been 
softer than we anticipated, we continue to think that activity in this sector will trend 
upward this year.  We now estimate that real GDP rose at an average annual rate of 
3¾ percent over the second half of last year , 1¼ percentage points faster than we 
expected in the December Tealbook.  In the curre nt quarter, we project that real GDP will 
increase at a 2½ percent pace, ½ percentage point less than in the previous forecast, reflecting a moderation in the pace of inventor y investment and a judgment that some of 
the strength in net exports late last year will be reversed.  Even so, the level of real GDP 
in the first quarter is ½ percent hi gher than in the previous Tealbook.  
While we have largely carried forward this higher level of GDP, our medium-
term projection for real GDP growth  is little changed, on net, from the December 
Tealbook.  We have once again upgraded our  outlook for U.S. oil production and, 
consequently, anticipate lower imports of crude  oil.  But domestic financial conditions 
are projected to be somewhat tighter on balance, and the foreign exchange value of the 
dollar has risen.  As a result, we project real GDP to increase 3 percent this year, 
3½ percent in 2015, and 3¼ percent in 2016; all three of these growth rates are similar to the forecasts we provided in December.   
The information from the December labor market report was mixed, with an 
unexpectedly small increase in payroll employment accompanied by an outsized decline in the unemployment rate.  We took only a little signal from the payroll employment data, partly on the hypothesis that adverse weather conditions may have held down the 
reported total and partly because the reporte d employment figures seemed inconsistent 
with other information on labor market conditio ns.  In response to the ongoing surprising 
declines in the unemployment rate—of which last month’s result was only the latest 
installment—we lowered the assumed pace of potential output growth in 2013 and 2014, thereby better allowing for the possibility of  further reductions in unemployment amid 
only moderate growth of real GDP.

  Together, the higher reading on actual real  GDP and our supply-side adjustments 
imply an output gap that is currently about ½ percentage point narrower than we had 
previously assumed.  From its lower starting va lue, the unemployment rate is projected to 
decline steadily over the medium term and to fall below the Committee’s 6½ percent 
threshold in the third quarter of 2014, two quarters earlier than  in the previous Tealbook.  
At the end of 2016, we now have the unemployment rate reaching about 5 percent, 
¼ percentage point lower than before and slightly below our assumption for the level of 
the natural rate at that time.   
Recent readings on consumer prices have been largely as we had anticipated, and 
our inflation forecast is little changed.  As  before, we expect core PCE inflation to 
increase from 1 percent in 2013 to 1¾ pe rcent in 2016—reflecting diminishing margins 
of slack in labor and product markets and a projected pickup in core import price 
inflation over the medium term—against a backdrop of stable longer-run inflation 
expectations.  We continue to expect energy prices to edge down over the forecast period; 
as a result, headline inflation is projected to run a bit below core inflation over the medium term. 
As always, numerous risks surround our outlook.  We view the downside risks to 
our forecast for real GDP growth as having dimi nished, but we still see the risks as tilted 
a little to the downside because neither mone tary policy nor fiscal policy appears well 
positioned to offset any future adverse shocks to the economy.  We continue to see the 
risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, and we regard 
the uncertainty around our inflation forecast as being balanced as well.  The low rates of core PCE inflation in 2013 could be more pe rsistent than we have assumed.  But there 
also is a risk that inflatio n could pick up by more than we  expect, perhaps stemming from 
an unanticipated and persistent firming in en ergy or other commodity  prices or from a 
loss in confidence about the ability of the Fe deral Reserve to wind down its historically 
large balance sheet. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are essentially unchanged.  
We assume that asset purchases will c ontinue to slow at a relatively steady 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
January 23, 2014

  pace and will conclude before the end of this year, leaving the cumulative 
amount of purchases under the pr ogram at close to $1.5 trillion. 
 We have revised our procedure for se tting the baseline assumption for the 
federal funds rate in order to bring our forecast into better alignment with the 
intention of the Committee “to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 
6½ percent.”  We now assume that the fede ral funds rate will remain within its 
current range for three quarters (versus our previous assumption of one quarter) after the unemployment rate initially falls below 6½ percent.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate is set according to the dictates of the same 
inertial Taylor (1999) policy rule that we have used in the past.  All else being 
equal, this change in methodology would have extended the period during 
which the federal funds rate is forecast  to remain at its effective lower bound 
by two quarters relative to our previous projection.  However, because our 
forecast now calls for the unemployment rate to move below 6½ percent two quarters earlier than the previous round, liftoff of the federal funds rate 
remains in the second quarter of 2015.  Nonetheless, with the narrower output 
gap in this forecast, the federal funds rate  rises more steeply after liftoff.  The 
federal funds rate is projected to average 2½ percent in the fourth quarter of 
2016, ½ percentage point higher than  in the December Tealbook.  
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield is roughly unchanged, on net, since the December 
Tealbook, but we raised its projected medi um-term path to reflect the steeper 
increase in the federal funds rate in  the current forecast.  Our projection 
continues to call for a significant rise in Treasury yields, primarily because of 
the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of 
extremely low short-term interest rates,  as well as a gradual waning of the 
effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies. 
 Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have fallen only a bit since the 
December Tealbook, while rates on c onventional 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages are roughly unchanged.  Conse quently, our forecasts for corporate 
bond yields and mortgage rates in th e medium term have been revised 
essentially in line with our revisions  to the path for Treasury yields.

  Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have risen about 3½ percent since the December Tealbook—
more than we anticipated.  We carried forward the higher level of stock prices 
over the next few quarters but flattened the trajectory thereafter, leaving the 
level of equity prices ab out unrevised at the end of 2016.  As a result, annual 
stock price appreciation in the medium-t erm forecast averages about 6 percent 
over the next few years, just sligh tly faster than no minal GDP growth. 
 Recent readings on house prices have b een a little above our expectations, 
leading us to revise up slightly the le vel of prices through the medium term. 
Nevertheless, with valuations now more consistent with historical norms, we 
continue to expect house price a ppreciation to slow  markedly—from 
11 percent in 2013 to an aver age rate of about 5 percen t per year from 2014 to 
2016.   
Fiscal Policy 
 Our assumptions for fiscal policy are th e same as in the December Tealbook.  
We continue to assume that the EUC pr ogram, which expired at the end of last 
year, will not be renewed.  We still expect the drag from fiscal policy to ease 
this year because of a diminishing effect of the tax increase s put in place last 
year and a smaller decline in real fede ral purchases.  As before, we project 
that the restraint on real GDP growth from  fiscal policy actions at all levels of 
government (excluding multiplier effects) will shrink from about 1 percentage 
point last year to ½ percentage point this year, ¼ percentage point in 2015, 
and roughly zero in 2016.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign economic activity appears to ha ve moved onto a more solid footing 
following a soft patch in the first half  of 2013.  We estimate that real GDP 
growth in the foreign economies stepped up to an annual rate of 3¼ percent in 
the fourth quarter.  Foreign economic growth is expected to remain near 3¼ percent in 2014 before edging up to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, as fiscal 
and financial restraint in Europe wane s and stronger economic growth in the 
advanced economies boosts exports a nd activity in the emerging market 
economies (EMEs).  This outlook is nearly unchanged from the December 
Tealbook.

   The broad nominal dollar index has appreci ated 1¾ percent since the previous 
Tealbook, with much of that  appreciation occurring ju st after the December 
FOMC meeting.  We project that the broad real dollar will depreciate at an 
annual rate of about 1¾ percent, driv en by our assumptions that financial 
stress in the euro area will abate fu rther over the forecast period (reducing 
safe-haven demand for the dollar) and th at EME currencies will appreciate in 
line with rapid productivity growth and rebalancing in the EMEs.  This pace 
of depreciation is slightly less than proj ected in December, in part as recent 
improvements in euro-area financial conditions have led us to assume that 
more of the reduction in safe-haven de mand has probably already occurred.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has decreased about $2 per barrel since the 
December Tealbook, closing at approxima tely $107 per barrel on January 21; 
the decline in part reflected increas ed optimism regarding a resumption of 
Libyan oil production and continued pr ogress on a nuclear agreement with 
Iran.  Recent improvements in transporta tion infrastructure linking relatively 
low-price oil in the Midwest and Canada  to the U.S. Gulf Coast region have 
put downward pressure on the price of imported oil relative to global 
benchmarks.  Domestic production ha s displaced high-quality, high-price 
grades of imported oil, re ducing the average price of  our imports; moreover, 
some foreign oil producers apparently ha ve cut their prices to maintain U.S. 
market share.  Consequently, we lowered our forecast for the price of imported oil by $6 per barrel through the end of the forecast period.  Overall, 
the price of imported oil is projected to decline slowly from about $97 per 
barrel in the first half  of 2014 to $88 per barrel at the end of 2016.   
 The broad index of nonfuel commodity pri ces that we track is little changed 
relative to the December Tealbook.  We  continue to expect nonfuel 
commodity prices to increase only slightly over the forecast period. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Incoming data have led us to revise up our estimate of real GDP growth in the 
second half of last year by 1¼ percentage points to an annual rate of 3¾ percent.  In the 
current quarter, we expect real GDP to rise  2½ percent.  The slowdown in GDP growth 
this quarter relative to the second half of last year refl ects substantial swings in the 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  contributions from inventory investment and net exports, which are partially offset by a 
swing in government purchases.  In additi on, the expiration of the EUC program at the 
end of last year is likel y to restrain consumer spending early this year. 
 Real GDP rose 4 percent in the third qua rter, ½ percentage point faster than 
previously estimated, and our projection for growth in the fourth quarter is 
now 3½ percent, 1¾ percentage points higher than before.  In previous 
Tealbooks, we speculated that the str onger growth of real GDI and ongoing 
declines in the unemployment rate mi ght be signaling that real GDP was 
painting too weak a picture of the st ate of aggregate demand.  The upgrading 
of our estimate of real GDP growth ove r the second half of  this year is 
consistent with that hypothesis.   
 We judge that the margin of slack in product and labor markets was somewhat 
narrower around the turn of the year than we previously thought.  The 
½ percentage point decline in the un employment rate now appears more 
understandable, coming against the backdr op of a more substantial increase in 
aggregate production.  The improvement in household and business views on 
labor market conditions corroborates our  assessment of tighter margins of 
slack.   
 Real PCE appears to have increased at an  annual rate of 4 pe rcent in the fourth 
quarter of last year, abou t ¾ percentage point faster  than in our December 
Tealbook projection, as incoming data on retail sales have been surprisingly 
strong.1  The recent data put consumer outlays on a higher trajectory, and we 
have raised our forecast for real PC E growth for the current quarter by 
¼ percentage point to 3 percent.  As in our previous forecast, the expiration of EUC benefits is anticipated to subtra ct ½ percentage point from real PCE 
growth this quarter. 
 The incoming data on residential invest ment have been softer than we 
anticipated.  While housing starts were surprisingly strong in November and 
December, single-family permits, which ty pically are a better indicator of the 
underlying pace of activity, were lower than we anticipated.  We are inclined 
                                                 
1 In addition, real PCE growth in the third quarter  was revised up ½ percentage point to an annual 
rate of 2 percent.

  to discount the message from the permits  data, however, as other indicators, 
such as new home sales and builder attitudes, support our view that the market 
is beginning to regain some traction fo llowing last year’s run-up in mortgage 
rates.  In all, we estimate that real residential invest ment fell at an annual rate 
of 5 percent in the fourth quarter, and we  expect it to increase 9 percent in the 
current quarter; both figures are somewhat weaker than in our previous 
forecast. 
 The latest available readings on capita l goods expenditures were stronger than 
we had expected.  As a result, we re vised up our estimate of the growth in 
spending on business equipment and intangibles in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 10 percent, 4 percentage points above our previous projection.  
We expect the growth of spending in this  category to slow in the first quarter 
to a 3½ percent pace, reflecting a leveling-off in business spending for motor vehicles and aircraft along with th e expiration of bonus depreciation tax 
provisions at the end of last year.   
 We anticipate that real federal purchases declined sharply in the fourth quarter 
because of the ongoing downtrend in de fense spending and the government 
shutdown in October, thereby reducing real GDP growth by a little more than 
1 percentage point—similar to our ex pectation in the December Tealbook.  
For the current quarter, the reversal of th e effects of the shutdown is expected 
to result in a small increase in real federal purchases.  At the state and local 
government level, we continue to project real purchases to rise at an annual 
rate of just ½ percent in both the fo urth and first quarters—a pace that we 
expect to be maintained this year.   
 We estimate that net exports contribute d 1¼ percentage points to real GDP 
growth during the final quarter of last year (our expected contribution in the 
December Tealbook had been close to zer o) owing to a robust increase in 
exports and a modest rise in imports.  Net exports are expected to be a roughly neutral factor for the growth of real  GDP in the current quarter, as export 
growth steps down to a still-solid rate that is more in line with the pace of 
foreign growth. 
 Manufacturing production increased at an  annual rate of 6 percent in the 
fourth quarter, more than 1 percentage  point faster than expected in the 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  December Tealbook.  With automakers scheduled to reduce the pace of 
production, we expect factory output to moderate to a 3 percent increase in the current quarter, consistent with the r eadings on new orders from the national 
and regional manufact uring surveys.   
POTENTIAL GDP  AND THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT  
 The greater-than-anticipat ed decline in the unemployment rate in 2013—
occurring against a backdr op of only moderate growth of real GDP—led us 
once again to adjust our s upply-side assumptions.   
o We raised the growth rate of  potential output from 2008 through 2010 
to better account for the rapid in crease in the unemployment rate in 
those years, and we lowered the potential growth rate from 2011 
through 2013 to better capture the decline in the une mployment rate 
over that period.2  For 2013, we reduced the growth rate of potential 
output by ½ percentage point to 1½ percent.  In addition, we made 
smaller reductions to our estimate of potential output growth in 2014 
and 2015 on the hypothesis that whatever adverse forces may have 
been operating in recent years (p erhaps some ongoing damage from 
the financial crisis and Great Recessi on) may persist a while longer.   
o In addition, we have steepened the downward trajectory of the natural 
rate of unemployment a bit.  We ha ve taken the opportunity of revising 
our supply-side assumptions to raise our estimate of the natural rate 
prior to the recession by ¼ percentage point to 5¼ percent.  As before, 
the effects of the recession are assumed to increase the natural rate by 
1 percentage point, and it now peak s at 6¼ percent in 2010.  From that 
                                                 
2 These changes diminish the role of the “panic and normalization” story that we previously relied 
on to help explain the magnitude of the movements in the unemployment rate since the onset of the Great 
Recession.  In particular, we now assume that the panic phase of this narrative accounts for only about half as much of the increase in the unemployment rate as we had previously assumed; the normalization phase, 
during which firms returned their workforces to more sustainable levels, is correspondingly smaller and is 
now assumed to have been largely completed by the end of 2012.

  higher level, it declines to 5¼ pe rcent in 2015, the same as in our 
previous projection.3 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Our forecast for the growth of economic activity over the medium term is little 
changed, and we project real GDP growth of 3 percent in 2014, 3½ percent in 2015, and 
3¼ percent in 2016.  Economic growth over the medium term is supported by less fiscal 
drag and continued improvements in foreign economic activity along with 
accommodative monetary policy.  
 Relative to the December Tealbook, real GDP  growth is bolstered by lower oil 
imports because of a higher trajectory for U.S. oil production over the medium 
term.  
 In contrast, changes in our financial a ssumptions lower the path a bit for real 
GDP over the medium term on net.  In particular, the trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dolla r is about 2 percent highe r than in the previous 
projection.  In addition, longe r-term interest rates are a little higher, reflecting 
the steeper post-liftoff trajectory for th e federal funds rate assumed in this 
projection.  These forces are partially offset by the boost from higher equity 
and house prices as well as lower oil prices.  
 By itself, the slower growth of potential GDP in 2014 and 2015 would have 
implied similar changes to actual re al GDP growth as consumers and 
businesses respond to the lower paths for permanent income and business 
sales.  But the stronger growth of real  GDP in 2013 suggests that demand is a 
little stronger than we ha d previously thought, and we  have allowed some of 
that favorable surprise to persist.  
 Taking account of all the revisions to supply and demand in this forecast, the 
output gap at the end of 2013 is now es timated to have been 3 percent, 
                                                 
3 Despite starting from a somewhat higher point prior to the recession, we have left our estimate of 
the natural rate in 2015 and 2016 unrevised at 5¼ percent.  Whereas we had previously believed that some 
of the hysteresis generated by the recession would l eave the natural rate ¼ per centage point above its pre-
recession level, our current assessment suggests that any greater hysteresis in the labor market is roughly 
offset by the changing demographics of the labor force, in particular the reduced participation of teenagers, 
which, all else being equal, puts downward pressure on the natural rate.

  ½ percentage point narrower than in the December Tealbook, and the 
unemployment rate gap is estimated to have been 1½ percen t, ¼ percentage 
point narrow than before.  By the end of 2016, actual GDP is projected to be 
½ percent above  potential GDP and the unemployment rate is a little below  
the natural rate. 
 See the box “Alternative View :  The Recovery Is Complete” for a different 
assessment of resource utilization.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The information on the labor market that we have received since the December 
Tealbook has been mixed. 
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 74,000 in December, and while the November increase in payrolls was revised up, the level of payrolls in December was 70,000 less than we had forecast.
4  Of course, there is noise in these monthly 
data, and some of the shortfall may reflect unusually bad weather during the 
survey week last month.5  Moreover, other indicators  of current labor market 
conditions are more encouraging:  Initial UI claims have returned to relatively low levels in recent readings, households’ expectations for the labor market in both the Michigan and Conference Board surveys were strong, on balance, 
since the previous Tealbook, and the help wanted index increased in 
December to a level not seen since the recession began.  Accordingly, we took 
only a little signal from the latest BLS jobs report and marked down our 
projection for total payroll gains in the current quarter to 175,000 per month, 20,000 less than in the December Tealbook.  
 The unemployment rate decreased 0.3 percentage point to 6.7 percent in 
December; we had expected it to remain  unchanged at 7 percent.  We think it 
                                                 
4 Even this subdued pace of job growth is consis tent with some improvement in labor markets.  A 
rough rule of thumb is that changes in payroll employment in the vicinity of 50,000 to 75,000 per month is 
sufficient to hold the unemployment rate constant if th e labor force were to decline in line with our estimate 
of its trend rate.  (This calculation assumes no di fference between changes in establishment survey 
employment and employment as measured in the household survey.)  
5 Opinions vary widely about how much of a role adverse weather may have played.  Our own 
estimate is that weather may account for only about 20,000 of the over all shortfall in the December jobs 
number.

  is likely that the 6.7 percen t figure overstates the improvement in labor market 
conditions by a little, a view that is informed by weakness in other indicators, 
including measures of marginally attach ed workers and part-time workers, as 
well as the implications of a model th at analyzes underlying labor market 
flows.  Therefore, we are now expecti ng the unemployment rate to edge back 
up to 6.8 percent in January but to average 6.7 percent fo r the first quarter as a 
whole, slightly below our previous projection.  Similarly, we lowered our 
projection for the labor force participation rate in response to the lower-than-
expected reading in December. 
 Overall, the data that we have receiv ed appear consistent with a gradual 
ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  The staff’s labor market conditions index, which summarizes th e movements in 19 labor market 
indicators, edged up further in December. 
As in our previous projection, the labor ma rket is anticipated to improve gradually 
over the medium term, in line with the pace of overall economic activity. 
 From its lower starting point, the unemployment rate is projected to decline, 
on average, roughly ½ percentage point pe r year, reaching 5 percent at the end 
of 2016, a little below our estimate of the natural rate and ¼ percentage point 
lower than in the pr evious Tealbook.   
o The unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent in the third quarter of 2014, two quarters earlier than in the previous Tealbook.   
 Our forecast for payroll employment gain s over the next few years is similar 
to the December Tealbook pr ojection.  We expect tota l payroll gains to step 
up to a pace of 220,000 per month in 2014 and to around 230,000 per month, on average, in 2015 and 2016.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Our forecast for inflation is little changed from the December Tealbook.   
 We estimate that total PCE prices increas ed at an annual rate of ¾ percent in 
the fourth quarter, as energy prices d eclined and core consumer prices rose 
only 1 percent.  For the current quarter, we expect total PCE inflation to edge

 Alternative View:  The Recovery I s Complete 
This box proposes an alternative to the staff’s baseline interpretation of recent economic 
developments.1  In this alternative view, growth in aggregate supply over the past decade has 
been considerably slower than the staff currently estimates.  As a result, the seemingly sluggish 
growth in aggregate demand since the trough has been sufficient to essentially  eliminate 
economic slack:  In short, the recovery is complete.  
 In this view, the marked weakness in the growth of aggregate supply stems from changes in the economic environment that have rendered obsolete the skills of many workers, whose reservation wages have not declined commensurately.  As a result, many of the adversely 
affected workers have very low probabilities of finding employment, leading to a natural rate of unemployment that is considerably  higher and a structural labor force participation r ate that is 
considerably lower than the staff currently estimates.  Evidence in favor of this view , along with 
its imp lications for the forecast, is  described below.     
 As shown by the dashed red line in the figure below  and to the left, the job openings  rate—which 
this box uses to identify labor demand— has increased noticeably over the past four  years .  
Indeed, its current level is similar to the level in the first quarter of 2005, when the unemployment rate was 5¼ percent, suggesting that labor demand is back to pre- recession norms.  Typically, 
increases in job openings lead to an increase in the rate at which workers move from unemployment to employment, shown by the solid black line.  However, this has not happened in 
the current recovery, suggesting that a low supply of the types of workers desired by employers, 
rather than low aggregate demand, is behind the low job -finding rate.   
 Further evidence on weak supply comes from the extremely elevated share of unemployment accounted for by individuals who have been unemployed for longer than six months.  As shown 
by the figure to the right, the recently  unemployed (the leftmost dot) are at least three times 
more likely to find a job than those unemployed for longer than  six months .  As a result, a very 
large share of the currently unemployed h ave characteristics that make job finding extremely 
difficult, depressing the jo b-finding rate relative to the job openings rate.

Indeed, if we account for this apparent mismatch between the type of worker that employers 
desire and the type of worker that is currently unemployed, then estimates of the natural rate are 
close to the current rate of unemployment.2 
 Even if the unemployment rate is currently at its  natural rate, economic slack could still be 
present in other measures of resource utilization, such as the labor force participation rate.  However, there is little evidence that recent movements in participation have been significantly 
affected by changes in labor demand.  As shown in the figure below  and to the left , over the 
recent recession and recovery, the labor force participation rate has moved steadily downward in 
periods of both increases and decreases in the job openings rate.  Moreover, recent research suggests that reductions in labor supply due to an aging population and a continued worsening in 
the labor market prospects of less -skilled workers —such as young people and less -educated 
men —can explain much, if not all, of the downward movement in participation.  
 Measures of inflation are also consistent with a moderate increase in economic slack during the recession and early recovery, as well as with the recent elimination of slack.  Total and core PCE inflation during the recovery  have been only moderately below their averages from 2000 to 2007.  
Moreover, as shown in the chart  to the right, unit labor costs, which had fallen during the 
recession and early recovery, are now rising at about a 2 percent pace, consistent with the absence of disinflationary pressures emanating from the labor market and with the recent elimination of  economic slack. 
 With economic slack  no longer present, increases  in demand ought to become increasingly 
manifest in increases in prices rather than increases in output .  Moreover, if monetary policy 
remains extremely accommodative in the face of elevated  levels of resource utilization , rising 
inflationary pressures, and increasing asset prices, inflati on expectations could become 
unanchored and risks to financial stability could become acute.  
 
 
                                                 
2 Although the job -finding rate among the long -duration unemployed is very low, it is not zero, suggesting 
that the increase in the natural rate caused by the large share of long -term unemployment should fade over time 
as these individuals eventually find j obs (or drop out of the labor force).  However, some of the workers entering 
unemployment may also have characteristics that impair job finding and lead to long -term unemployment.  If the 
number of these workers is substantial, then the elevated share of l ong -term unemployment and the low rate of 
job finding, relative to the rate of job openings, may be quite persistent.

  up to only 1 percent, as energy prices d ecline further and co re inflation steps 
up just a little.  
 We project core PCE inflation to be 1¼  percent in the current quarter.  One 
factor behind the recent low readings on core PCE inflation has been 
exceptionally low core goods prices, which are influenced by core import 
prices.  Core import prices declined sharply in the middle of 2013, but they 
appear to have stabilized in  the fourth quarter and are projected to edge up in 
the current quarter. 
 While data on consumer energy prices in the fourth quarter have been close to 
our expectations, recent declines in o il prices point to lower consumer energy 
prices in the first quarter than we ha d assumed.  Consumer energy prices are 
expected to follow the downward tilt in our projected path for oil prices. 
 Core PCE inflation is anticipated to  move up over the medium term, from 
1 percent in 2013 to 1¾ per cent in 2016, as resource slack diminishes, core 
import prices rise, and longer-run inflati on expectations remain well anchored.  
Reflecting the projected declines in consumer energy prices, total PCE 
inflation is expected to r un a bit below core price in flation over the forecast 
period.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK   
 In the long-term outlook, the federal funds  rate continues to  be set according 
to the prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  As a result, the federal 
funds rate gradually rises from 2½ per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 
4¼ percent by 2020.  The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to 
put downward pressure on l onger-term interest rates,  albeit decreasingly so, 
and the process of returning the SOMA por tfolio to a normal size is expected 
to be completed by 2021. 
 In 2017, real GDP growth slows to 2¾ pe rcent.  The unemployment rate edges 
down further and is almost ½ percentage point below its natural rate at the end 
of 2017.  Thereafter, real GDP growth slows to below its potential rate such 
that the level of GDP moves back to  potential and the unemployment rate 
moves back to its natural rate as monetary policy accommodation is

  progressively withdrawn, balancing the ongoing abatement of the headwinds 
that have restrained the recovery thus far.   
 Inflation initially is below the long-r un objective of the Committee, but, with 
long-run inflation expectations assume d to remain well anchored, consumer 
price inflation reaches 2 percent by 2018.

the staff's real-time translation of those data into hours worked. These were the latest available data at the time of the September
FOMC meeting.
  2. Calculated as the mean of the 2014:Q2 and 2014:Q3 projections.
  3. Projections of payrolls and hours worked include the effects of the benchmark revision to the payroll survey.
  4. Total hours worked are aggregate hours in the nonfarm business sector. Because that series is available only on a quarterly
basis, the August 2012 figures refer to the quarterly percent change and level in 2012:Q3. The percent changes and levels in
hours are at annual rates.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
We estimate that foreign economic activity continued to improve in the fourth 
quarter, in line with our December projection, bringing growth in the second half of last 
year to an annual rate of 3 percent, up from an anemic 2 percent in the first half.  The 
sharp pickup in the second half was driven  primarily  by a recovery in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs) after a very weak performance earlier in  2013.  In addition, 
activity in Europe continued to firm.  Going forward, foreign GDP growth is expected to 
edge up a bit more, averaging 3¼ percent this year and then leveling off at 3½ percent through 2016, as financial and fiscal headwinds in the advanced foreign economies  
(AFEs)  continue to wane and  growth in EMEs settles at near -potential rates.  
Although the forecast is little changed, we see the downside risks surrounding our 
outlook as having diminished somewhat.  T he Federal Reserve’s decision to begin 
reducing the pace of  its asset purchases did not lead to substantial disruptions in  EME 
financial markets:  EME yields increased and currencies  depreciated, but these moves 
were relatively muted in most of these economies.  In addition, even though Europe continues to face daunting economic and political challenges, financial conditions in the region have improved and the euro-area recovery is moving onto a more solid footing.  Indeed, given the recent decline in sovereign spreads in peripheral  Europe and buoyant 
financial conditions in the AFEs more generally, improvements in spending and sentiment could boost growth in the AFEs above our current subdued projection, a 
scenario we explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
However,  low inflation readings in some AFEs have raised concerns about 
deflation .  In the fourth quarter, we estimate that consumer prices in the AFEs were 
nearly flat , bringing inflation down to 1 percent on a four- quarter basis.   Although recent 
softness in retail prices for energy and other commodities contributed to this decline, core 
inflation  also decreased somewhat.  We see quarterly  inflation in the AFEs (excluding 
Japan)  rebounding from an estimated ¼  percent annual rate in the fourth quarter to 
1 percent  in the current quarter , as gasoline prices stabilize,  before  gradually picking up 
to 1¾ percent by 2016, as output gaps narrow and  inflation expectations remain relatively 
well-anchored.  (See the box “Inflation Developments in the Advanced Foreign 
Economies .”)  But, as outlined in the Risks and Uncertainty section, we cannot rule out 
the possibility that persistent low inflation outcomes could unhinge inflation

 Inflation Developments in the Advanced Foreign Economies  
With the notable exception of Japan, h eadline  inflation in the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs ) has declined  sharply over the past two years  (see upper- left 
figure o n the following  page ), raising concerns about the risks of deflation.  In 
Canada and the euro area, recent inflation readings have fallen  well below the 
targets of  their respective central banks .  Here we examine the sources of  this 
decline in AFE inflation and assess  the implications for our projection of inflation.   
A large portion of the recent step -down in AFE headline inflation can be 
attributed to lower inflation for energy and food  prices , two components that 
are usually  volatile.  A simple accounting decompos ition of  headline inflation into 
energy , food, and core  inflation  (shown in the upper -right figure on the following 
page) suggests that about  one- half of th e 2 percentage point declin e in AFE 
inflation  between 2011 and 2013 can be explained by  a sharp reduction  in energy 
price inflation , in part  reflecting a leveling off of oil prices  and, more recently, a 
fall in refiner margins .  Another one -fourth  of the decline can be attributed  to 
slower f ood price inflation , consistent with a stabilization  of global food prices  in 
recent years.   
 
This simple decomposition  can account for neither the second -round effects of 
changes in energy and food prices on core inflation nor the role of oth er 
potentially important factors  such as economic slack, inflation expectations, and 
consumption  taxes.   To better identify the determinants of  AFE headline 
inflation, w e estimate, for each country, an expectations -augmented Phillips 
curve equation  
 
𝜋𝑡=𝛽1𝜋𝑡𝑒+ 𝛽2𝜋𝑡−1+ 𝛽3𝑆𝑡+  𝛽4𝑇𝑡+𝛾𝑍𝑡+𝜀𝑡, 
where 𝜋𝑡denotes quarterly headline inflation , 𝜋𝑡𝑒 is a measure of longer- term 
inflation expectations , 𝑆𝑡 is the staff’s estimate of the output gap , 𝑇𝑡 is changes 
in consumption taxes (value- added taxes and excise duties) , 𝑍𝑡 is a set of supply 
shocks (changes in oil and import prices) , and 𝜀𝑡 is a residual that captures 
sources of variation in inflation not accounted for by the model.1   
The lower-l eft figure on the following page shows a decomposition of the 
determinants of AFE  aggregate  inflation  (excluding Japan) based on our Phillips 
curve analysis.  Consistent with the accounting decomposition presented  above , 
roughly  one-half of the 2 percentage point reduction  in AFE inflation  is allocated 
to supply factors .  The output gap also contributes , albeit modestly , to the 
decline in inflation.  In addition , the abatement of tax hikes —as earlier fiscal 
consolidation efforts eased —helped slow  the pace of inflation.

 Longer- term inflation expectations and their contributions to inflation (shown by 
the blue bars in the lower- left panel  below ) have been remarkably stable, 
notwi thstanding the large swings in inflation that have occurred since the start of 
the global financial crisis.  The panel  on the right shows that survey -based 
measures  of inflation expectations for individual economies (which we used in 
our Phillips curve models ) have fluctuated very little in recent years .   
Drawing on these results , we judge  that the reduction in inflation abroad over 
the past couple of years largely reflects supply developments and the waning of 
tax-hike effects .  Going forward, we are forecasting  that these factors will not 
exert  much further downward pressure on inflation  and that inflation will 
eventually pick back up as the recovery proceeds.  This forecast depends critically 
on our projection  that slack will narrow and inflation expectations will remain 
anchored.  However, with the recovery still fragile, interest rates near their zero 
lower bound, and unemployment rates  elevated , we cannot rule out that 
inflation expectations will start drifting down and cause further disinflation.  
While a temporary dip in inflation is unlikely to have much effect on output, a 
persistent decline in inflation associated with lower inflation expectations , 
especially at the zero bound , could cause prolonged  economic weakness , a 
scenario explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section .

  expectations , which in turn could weigh heavily on the economic recovery .  We are less 
concerned about disinflation elsewhere in the global economy .  EME inflation  is 
estimated to have moved up to 3¾ percent in the fourth quarter and is projected to stay  
above 3 percent for the remainder of the forecast period.   In Japan, inflation has moved 
solidly into positive territory , and we expect it to end up near the Bank of Japan’s 
(BOJ’s ) 2 percent inflation ta rget by the end of the forecast period. 
With subdued inflation and resource slack diminishing only gradually, we expect 
monetary policy across the AFEs to remain expansionary.  In the EMEs , monetary policy 
was on hold during the intermeeting period  except in Brazil, where the policy rate was 
hiked again in response to high  and rising inflation . 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro area.  Recent  data suggest that the recovery in the euro area firmed in the 
fourth quarter.  Industrial production and consumption indicators through 
November were above their third -quarter averages , and  PMIs  improved further in 
December.  We expect euro -area GDP growth to edge up from around 1 percent 
last quarter to 1¼ percent in 2014 and to reach 2  percent in 2016.  Our near- term 
forecast is a touch higher than in the December Tealbook, reflecting slightly 
better -than-expected data and improved financial conditions.  Quarterly  inflation 
declined  to zero at the end of 2013, as retail energy prices fell and core inflation 
remained low .  With  energy prices leveling  off and the output gap projected to 
shrink, inflation should rise to 1½ percent by the end of the forecast period.  We 
continue to anticipate  that the European Central Bank will keep its benchmark 
policy rate at 0.25 percent until early 2016 before raising it  to 0.75 percent  by the 
end of that  year. 
• United Kingdom .  We estimate  that GDP  continued to expand at a 3 per cent pace 
in the fourth quarter, given robust PMIs and retail sales .  Strong growth 
throughout last year came after a prolonged period of subdued performance and was supported by easing credit conditions, waning fiscal consolidation, and the end of the euro- area recession.   We project  growth to  normalize  to a still-solid 
2½ percent  pace by 2015.  Consumer prices rose only 1.3 percent in the fourth 
quarter  because of  lower food and energy inflation.  However, with the output gap 
projected to close, inflation should gradually pick  up to near  2 percent over the 
forecast period .  The unemployment rate surprisingly dropped to 7.1 percent in

  the three months through November—just above the 7 percent forward -guidance 
threshold of the Bank of England (BOE)—leading  us to lower our forecast for the 
unemployment rate and narrow our estimate of the amount of slack remaining .  
Nevertheless, with inflation projected to remain moderate, we assume that the 
BOE will wait several quarters after the 7  percent threshold is crossed  to begin 
tightening policy .  All told , we brought forward the date of the BOE’s first policy 
rate hike from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of that year .   
• Japan .  GDP growth is estimated to have picked up to 3½ percent in the fourth 
quarter .  The manufacturing PMI rose to a multi year high in December , and 
exports through November rebounded from a dip in the third quarter.  In addition, a surge in new vehicle registrations suggests that households started  pullin g 
forward some of their spending ahead of April’s consumption tax hike.  Household spending should build up further in the current quarter, which will help push GDP growth to 4½ percent.  After the tax increase takes effect,  growth 
is projected to  slow sha rply and average about 1  percent over the remainder of the 
forecast period.   
We estimate that consumer prices rose 1¾  percent in the fourth quarter, the 
highest reading  of quarterly inflation among the major AFEs  for the second 
consecutive quarter.  With recent inflation largely reflecting past depreciation and 
with the yen assumed to stabilize going forward, inflation (excluding the direct effect  of the tax hike) should move back to near 1 percent in 2014.  However, a 
further narrowing of the output gap and rising inflation expectations associated with continued accommodative monetary policy, including an expansion of the BOJ’s stimulus program starting next quarter , should support inflation picking up 
to 1¾ percent b y year -end 2016. 
• Canada.  Indicators of domestic demand generally remained solid .  However, 
exports were weak through November, suggest ing that fourth -quarter  real GDP 
growth moderated to 2 percent.  We expect exports to recover this quarter, boosting growth to 2½ percent, with the pace of output growth edging up only 
slightly thereafter , in line with U.S. growth.  Compared with  the December 
Tealbook, this forecast is a bit higher in the first half of 2014 given the recent 
depreciation of the Canadian dollar.  We estimate that inflation fell  to ¼ percent 
in the fourth quarter, largely  reflecting lower gasoline prices .  Core inflation 
remained surprisingly weak, leading us to mark down our near- term inflation

  forecast and to push back the Bank of Canada’s first hike in its policy rate target 
by one quarter to mid-2015.  As the output gap closes and the recent currency 
depreciation passes through to consumer prices, we expect inflation to rise to 2 percent  by 2016. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES   
• China .  Fourth-quarter GDP data suggest that the Chinese economy grew at an 
annual rate of 8 percent, down from an 8¾ percent pace in the previous quarter and ½ percentage point below our December Tealbook projection.  Retail sales  
and exports grew strongly , but industrial production and fixed investment 
decelerated, the latter  as credit growth continued to slow from its surge early in 
2013.  Chinese authorities underscored their intent to continue to rein in  credit 
grow th, which included presiding over another liquidity squeeze in the interbank 
market in December, during which interbank rates spiked to their highest levels since June.  R eal GDP growth should edge down to 7½ percent by late  2015, as 
tighter credit restr ains investment further and potential growth moderates.  
Relative to the previous Tealbook, this projection is a touch softer  in the near 
term.  Inflation slowed to 3 percent  in the fourth quarter from 3½ percent in the 
third  quarter  on weaker food price inflation, and we expect it to remain near that  
level over the forecast period . 
• Other Emerging Asia .  We estimate that GDP growth in the rest of emerging 
Asia rose to 4½ percent in the fourth quarter from 4 percent in the third quarte r.  
Strong export growth more than offset a number of negative country- specific 
developments, including ongoing effects of tight financial conditions in India and Indonesia, the disruption caused by Ty phoon Haiyan in the Philippines, and the 
political cris is in Thailand .  We see growth in the region hovering near  4½ percent 
over the rest of the forecast period, supported by firming external demand from the advanced economies.  
• Latin America .  We estimate that GDP growth in Mexico  remained at  3½ percent 
in the fourth quarter.  Recently , the Mexican  Congress approved important 
reform s to the country’s energy and financial sectors .  We judge that these and 
other reforms that were approved since President Pe ña Nieto’s government took 
office in Decem ber 2012 will raise Mexico’s potential growth by ½ percentage 
point to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016.  The effect of the reforms, along with

  robust U.S. manufacturing activity, should help the Mexican  economy grow at a 
roughl y 3¾  percent pace over the forecast period. 
Following a 2 percent contraction in the third quarter, recent indicators—
including industrial production, PMIs, and exports—suggest that Brazilian GDP 
expanded in the fourth quarter , albeit at a modest 2 percent pace.  We see growth 
picking up to 3½ percent by 2015, supported by a near-term boost from spending 
related to the soccer World C up, ongoing depreciation of the real , and a firming 
of the recovery in the advanced economies.  Despite the current weak ness in 
economic activity , the Brazilian central bank raised  its main policy rate  another  
50 basis points this month to 10.5 percent , bringing the cumulative increase since 
April 2013 to 325 basis points.  The policy tightening  is aimed at  combating 
inflation , as 12-month headline inflation edged up to 5.9 percent in December, 
well above the 4.5 percent midpoint of the inflation target range.  This persistently 
elevated inflation reflects a combination of tight labor ma rkets  and earlier 
currency depreciation .  Inflation expectation s have also moved up, likely owing to  
a loss of confidence in the central bank’s ability to control inflation  and concerns 
about the government’s ability to maintain fiscal discipline .

Financial Developments 
Financial market developments over th e intermeeting period reflected Federal 
Reserve communications and generally bette r-than-expected incoming economic data 
releases, both of which appeared to leave ma rket participants somewhat more optimistic 
about the economic outlook.  On balance, the expected path of th e federal funds rate 
steepened beyond 2014, interest rates rose at  intermediate horiz ons, equity prices 
increased, and the dollar appreciated moderately against most other currencies. 
 The FOMC’s decision to reduce the p ace of its asset purchases and its 
rationale for doing so seemed to boost  market participants’ confidence in 
the strength of the recovery. 
 Broadly consistent with other surveys,  primary dealers generally anticipate 
that the asset purchase program will end in October, with the first increase 
in the federal funds rate still expe cted in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
 Year-end positioning contributed to record participation in the Federal 
Reserve’s overnight reverse repo exer cise over the turn of the year. 
 Credit conditions facing large businesses remained favorable; those for 
households continued to be mixed.  Ba nks reportedly eased their standards 
on most major categories of loans in the fourth quarter on balance.1 
 Investors appear to have judged that the risks to the outlook for the foreign 
economies diminished some:  Confidence in the recovery boosted asset 
prices in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), and market sentiment 
toward most of the vulnerable emerging market economies (EMEs) 
appeared to be stabilizing.

  POLICY  EXPECTATIONS  AND TREASURY YIELDS  
The FOMC’s decision in December to reduce the monthly pace of its purchases  of 
longer- term Treasury securities and agency MBS by $5 billion each, and the rationale 
given in the Committee’s  statement and other Federal Reserve communications, 
evidently bolstered market participants ’ confidence in the strength of the recovery .  In 
particular, inves tors reportedly  took note of the somewhat more upbeat characterization 
of labor market conditions in the FOMC’s statement, as well as the Committee’s 
assessment that the risks to the outlook had become “more nearly balanced.”  Although 
the cut in the pace of purchases came somewhat earlier than many  investors had 
reportedly expected , volatility in domestic and g lobal financial markets generally 
remained subdued i n the days following the announcement . 
On the whole, t he tone of the incoming economic data over the intermeeting 
period also seemed to reinforce investors’ confidence in the economic outlook.  A notable exception was the B LS employment report, which contained mixed signals and was 
reportedly interpreted as weak  overall, although some market participants noted that the 
weakness  may have reflected,  in part, the temporary effects of severe winter weather .  
The minutes of the December FOMC meeting, released on January 8, were viewed as largely  reinforcing recent FOMC communications, includ ing the Chairman’s comments 
at the December press conference, and elicited little market reaction . 
On net since the December FOMC meeting , the path of the federal funds rate 
implied by financial market quotes steepened somewhat beyond this year, and yields on Treasury securities at intermediate horizons rose .  In part, the improved economic 
outlook likely resulted in higher expectations for the federal funds rate, although such 
increases  may have been damped somewhat by the Committee’s enhancements to  its 
forward rate guidance.
2  The staff estimates that higher term premiums also likely 
boosted rates at intermediate maturities, consistent with a n increase in uncertainty about 
the path of future rates as seen in the rise in swaption -implied volatility  for one-year 
underlying rates.  Indeed, with the unemployment rate approaching the 6.5 percent 
threshold, uncertainty about the path of the federal funds rate may have increased even 
with the enhanced forward guidance.  On balance, the five -year Treasury yi eld rose about 
                                                 
2 In its December s tatement, the Committee noted that it anticipates that the target federal funds 
rate will remain low “well past” the time that the unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and it added 
“especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’ s 2 percent longer -run goal.”

  15 basis points, driven mainly by an increase in one- year forwa rd rates two to three years 
ahead.  
In contrast , the 10- year Treasury yield  was little changed , likely  held down in part 
by a reduction in  uncertainty around the trajectory of the Federal Reserve’s current asset  
purchase program .  Market participants noted that the Chairman’s December press 
conference and the FOMC meeting minutes had emphasized that, although further 
reductions in the pace of purchases w ould be data dependent, they were likely to be taken 
in “measured steps ,” which market participants reportedly interpreted to be additional 
reductions of approximately $10 billion per meeting over the course of 2014.  In addition, 
it was noted that the market reaction to the initial reduction in the pace of purchases had been smaller than some had anticipated, and this  outcome may have also reduced near-
term uncertainty about longer- term yields.  On net , the 10- year Treasury yield  declined a 
couple of basis points, agency MBS yields edged  down, and option-adjusted spreads on 
production-coupon MBS narrowed slightly .  TIPS -based measures of inflation 
compensation registered modest mixed changes amid continued subdued readings on inflation . 
According to the Open Market  Desk’s January survey, primary d ealers ’ 
expectations about monetary policy seem to be about in line with those priced into market s.
3  The median dealer  continues to expect that the first increase in the federal 
funds rate will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 but now projects a slightly steeper path of the federal funds rate after liftoff.  Regarding the forward rate guidance, most dealers expect that  changes will be introduced within the next three FOMC meetings, with 
roughly half viewing the March 2014 meeting as the most likely time for a change.  T he 
most likely change to the guidance was seen as being the provision of additional 
information about the timing of the first increase  in the federal funds rate after the 
6.5 percent unemployment rate threshold is  reached.  In addition, t he median dealer 
reportedly expects  that asset  purchases will be decreased by a further $10 billion at each 
upcoming FOM C meeting , split evenly across Treasury and agency MBS, and that the 
program w ill end with a final $15 billion reduction at the October 2014 meeting, 
                                                 
3 In addition to the staff’s indirect readings from financial market quotes and various anecdotal 
reports, in January the Desk began surveying active investors directly as part of a one- year pilot effort to 
better understand market  expectations .  Overall, the inaugural survey results from the active investors were 
similar to those from the p rimary dealers, although the active investors reported that they expect a slightly 
earlier timing of liftoff for the federal funds rate .

  implying a total size  of the program  that is roughly $100 billion smaller than expected  
prior to the Decem ber meeting .  Relative to the previous survey, dealers ’ responses  
indicated  reduced uncertainty and exhibited less disagreement regarding the  purchase 
program’s ultimate size and end date. 
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE  AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Functioning in the markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS remained 
stable , albeit with a typical seasonal dip in liquidity at year-end.  Settlement of Federal 
Reserve purchases as a share of gross MBS issuance reached a record level of about 
95 percent  in December , continuing its upward trend of recent months.  Even so, m arkets 
for agency MBS exhibited limited settlement pressures .  The dollar- roll-implied 
financing rates for main production-coupon agency MBS  stayed relatively steady , and the 
Desk engaged in no dollar rolls over the intermeeting period.4 
At the same time , the Treasury  Department’s  auctions of securities have gone 
smoothly.5  Bill auction sizes continued to be held down as  a consequence of the ongoing 
debt limit suspension agreement (see the box “ Debt Subject to Limit”).  On January 29, 
the Treasury will hold its first auction of two -year floating rate notes (FRNs).  T he Desk 
announced on January 13 that  it will treat FRNs in a manner similar to that of other 
Treasury securities in operating its reinvestment program , its securities lending program, 
and its repo operations. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND YEAR-END DYNAMICS   
Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets generally remained stable.6  
Spread s sensitive to  current or pote ntial near -term funding pressures were little changed 
and remained at the low end of their  range s over recent years.   Year -end funding 
pressures were modest , and overnight money market rates declined about in line with 
their typical behavior at the end of a year.  Repo rates were quite low at year -end, and 
                                                 
4 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $ 34 billion in Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program  and $53 billion in agency MBS under the flow -based MBS program 
and the reinvestment program.   In addition, the Desk concluded its series of small -value purchase and sale 
operations of agency MBS via FedTrade.  
5 The Treasury has auctioned $128 billion of nominal coupon securities and $16 billion of TIPS 
since the December FOMC meeting. 
6 The effective federal funds rate averaged 8 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

 Debt Subject to Limit  
The Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014, which was passed last October 17, 
suspended the federal debt limit until February 7, 2014.  Because the act 
effectively prohibit s the Treasury from accumulating cash during the suspension 
period, the Treasury has been cutting bill auction sizes to bring its  cash balance 
near its October 17 level of $32 billion.1  If the Congress fails to raise the debt limit 
by February 8, the Treasury will begin using an estimated $200  billion available in 
extraordinary measures to remain below the debt ceiling.2 
 Treasury Secretary Lew, in his letter to the Congress on January 22, stated that the use of extraordinary measures will allow the Treasury to extend borrowing 
only until late February and urged the Congress to take prompt action to extend 
normal borrowing authority to avoid the risk of default and  any interruption on 
payments.  The date when the debt limit would be breached is highly uncertain 
because the amount and timing of tax payments and refunds  during tax season 
are hard to predict; if receipts are stronger than expected, the breach date could 
possibly be delayed until the beginning of April.  
 As shown in the figure on the next page, m arket participants appear to be pricing 
in some marginal probability of stress related to the debt ceiling episode, with 
rates on Treasury bills maturing in March hav ing slightly higher yields than those 
maturing right after them.
3 
                                                 
1 Specifically, the act stipulates that all debt issued between October 17 and February 8 must be 
to fund commitments incurred between these two dates, implying that the Treasury’s cash 
balance must be at or below its October 17 level on February 8. 
2 The Treasury is allowed to use the following accounting measures:  suspend daily 
reinvestment of the Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund, 
redeem existing investments and suspend new investment in the Civil Service Retirement and 
Disability Fund, and suspend the daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund into Treasury securities . 
3 In December 2013, the Treasury Market Practices Group released a white paper titled 
“Operational Plans for Various Contingencies for Treasury Debt Payments” 
(www.ny.frb.org/tmpg/Operations_Contingency_Plans.pdf) that outlines steps that market 
participants might take to reduce some of the adverse conseq uences that may arise in the 
event of a delayed payment on Treasury debt because of a debt ceiling crisis.

  there was record take -up of the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse rep o exercise (s ee the 
box “ Year -End Dynamics in Money Markets”).7  Market participants reportedly expect 
the FOMC to authorize at its January meeting an extension of the exercise beyond its 
scheduled expiration date of January 29. 
EQUITY VALUATIONS AND BOND SPREADS  
Increased confidence in the economic outlook on the part of investors appeared to 
buoy the prices of risky assets  over the i ntermeeting period , with broad  equity indexes  
increas ing about 3½ percent  and credit  spreads on corporate bonds narrowing.  Indeed,  
with investors becoming more confident in the economic outlook, some major equity 
indexes  reached all -time high nominal levels  over the intermeeting period, measures of 
implied equity volatility ended the period in the neighborhood of their historic al lows, 
investment- grade bond spreads stood at their  lowest levels in several years , and  those on 
speculative-grade corporate bonds approached  their pre -crisis l evels.   However,  equity 
valuations for the broad market do not yet appear to be stretched, as the ratios of equity price indexes to forward earning s are generally  not far above their historical median 
values .  In addition, the balance sheet s of large corporations remain very strong.  
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
Credit remained widely available to large nonfinancial corporations.  Aside from  
a seasonal slowdown in financing around year-end, bond issuance by domestic corporations generally stay ed strong, with indications that speculative- grade firms have 
used a smaller share of proceeds to refinance existing debt in recent quarters.  In addition, 
C&I loans on banks’ books increased notably late in the fourth quarter, and  issuance of 
leveraged loan s and CLOs generally continued apace .  Meanwhile, equity issuance by 
nonfinancial corporations accelerated , supported by the rising stock market.   Analysts  are 
currently  forecast ing that the earnings  of large nonfinancial corporations grew modestly 
in the fourth quarter. 
Commercial real estate (CRE) markets continued to recover in the fourth quarter, 
with rising property prices and fewer distressed sales.  Investor demand for CMBS

 Year -End Dynamics in Money Market s  
Money market funding pressures were modest over year- end, while participation 
in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) 
operations picked up  as repo rates dropped to quite low levels.  As shown in the 
top figure on the next page, secured and unsecured overnight money market  
rates  declined  at the end of the year.  For example, the overnight Treasury 
general c ollateral f inance ( GCF) repo rate dropped to 1 basis point on 
December 31, 2013, with rates on some general collateral trades reported as low 
as negative 10 basis points.  
 
The decline in the Treasury GCF repo rate probably  partly reflected a reduction in 
collateral supply, as , consistent with seasonal issuance patterns, Treasury bills 
outstanding fell $29 billion in December.  Moreover, reflecting typical end of the 
year balance sheet management dynamics , net borrowing by primary  dealers 
dropped by more than $100  billion  in December , likely also depressing GCF repo 
rates .  Furthermore, foreign bank organizations pulled back from borrowing in 
dollar funding markets in an effort to trim the size of their balance sheets ahead 
of year- end.   
 These developments left money market participants —and money market  funds , 
in particular —with sizable cash balances to invest.  Typical year- end patterns 
show money funds depositing excess cash balances at their custodian banks; 
however, this year money funds also utilized the ON RRP  operation .
1  As shown in 
the bottom figure on the next page, after  the cap for individual bids was raised 
from $1 billion to $3 billion  on December 23 , take- up at the daily operation s rose .  
It then surged before the end of the year as repo rates fell, approaching 
$200 billion on December 31.  The number of participants also jumped to 102, led 
by money market  funds.   
 
Over recent months, market participants have noted that a shift to a later timing 
of ON RRP operations could encourage greater participation by money funds and other institutions as they gain more certainty about their cash positions  as a 
particular day progresses.  Effective January 15, the Desk moved the time of its 
ON RRP  oper ations 1½ hours later; the operation time is now 12:45 to 1:15 p .m.  At 
least to date, however, this change has not had a discernible effect on 
participation .  
  
                                                 
1 On September 23, 2013, the Desk began conducting daily overnight fixed -rate, capped 
allotment reverse repo exercises.  The daily maximum allotment per counterparty is currently 
$3 billion.  The maximum allotment was initially set at $0.5 billion, rose to $1 billion on 
September 27, 2013, and then to $3 billion on December 23, 2013.

  remained strong , and  CRE loans on banks’ books expanded moderately .  Banks indicated 
in the SLOOS that they had eased standards on, and seen increased demand for, all types 
of CRE loans again in the fourth quarter.  CMBS spreads remained tight despite a high volume of issuance near the end of the year.  Equity REITs issued a record  amount of 
unsecured credit  throughout 2013, reportedly driven by very strong investor demand. 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets generally appeared to remain stable, 
although a few issuers continued to experience substantial strain .  In particular, Puerto 
Rico  was put on watch for a downgrade by the Moody’s Investors Service rating agency 
on December 12 , which spurr ed a further deterioration in the pric e of its debt.  More 
broadly, however, Moody’s revised the credit  outlook for domestic local governments to 
stable from negative , and available data suggest that , for the first time in several years,  
Moody’s made more upgrades than downgrades to municipal debt in the fourth quarter. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Households continued to face mixed credit conditions in the fourth quarter.  
Consumer credit expanded again  in November, driven by further gains in auto and 
student loans, and bank credit data indicate that this expansion likely continued  through 
December .  Auto loans remained  broadly available, including to consumers with 
subprime credit scores .  Banks reported in the SLOOS  that they had eased standards on, 
and seen stronger demand for, auto loans over the fourth quarter, but they also indicated that they expected the performance of their bank’s auto loans, particularly subprime loans, to deteriorate this year .
8  In contrast, c redit card balances were little changed , on 
net, through November, as underwriting has appeared to remain quite tight .  In the 
SLOOS, banks indicated that they expected such loans to continue to perform very  well  
this year . 
Despite tight mortgage availability and subdued borrowing , house prices 
continued to rise in the fall (the latest available data) , although not as quickly as earlier in  
2013.  In particular, house price growth has decelerated in the areas that had exhibited 
especially  strong  increases earlier in the year , with several measures  pointing to a decline 
                                                 
8 According to the Federal Reserve’s FR Y -14 data on capital assessments and stress testing, 
delinquency rates for subprime auto loans at the banks subject to the supervisory stress tests have been 
rising for the past several years.  However, such loans appear to have accounted for only about 12 percent 
of total auto loans on these banks’ books over the past several years.  Moreover , the delinquency rate on 
consumer loans generally has been quite low for some time relative to historical norms.

  in investors’ role in the housing market in recent months.  C onsistent with households’  
improved balance sheet positions brought about by the ris e in house prices, and with 
underwriting standards having remained  relatively tight over the past few years , banks 
indicated in the SLOOS that they expected the performance of all kinds of residential real 
estate loans to improve over 2014.  On net, SLOOS respondents also reported that they had eased standards for prime home- purchase loans  in the fourth quarter.  Meanwhile, the 
volume of mortgage application s for home purchases held about steady since the last 
FOMC meeting , while refinance applications remained at very low levels .  Mortgage 
rates declined slightly  to about 4¼ percent, in line with modestly lower  yields on agency 
MBS.  
Two notable mortgage -related  policy developments occurred over the 
intermeeting period.  First, a large number of mortgage- related  regulations released  by 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau went into effect on January 10, including the 
rules defining a qualified mortgag e; any  effects of these regulations on the mortgage 
market are likely to take some time to emerge.
9  In addition, in early January, the F ederal 
Housing F inance A gency announced that the planned increase in the fees  that the GSEs 
charge to guarantee mortgages would be put on hold. 
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS  
Generally reflecting the positive news about the outlook for economic activity 
over the intermeeting period , the s tock prices of bank  holding companies rose notably 
and CDS spreads for the largest bank holding companies declined a bit.  Meanwhile, the 
earnings of large banks were mixed in the fourth quarter, held down at some institutions 
by litigation expenses, lower revenue from  mortgage banking activities , weak trading 
income, and subdued loan demand.  However, bank profitability was again supported by 
ongoing cost-reduction efforts and further reductions in loan loss reserves , as credit 
quality reportedly continued to improve. 
                                                 
9 A lender that  originates a qualified mortgage ( QM) receives greater protection from lawsuits that 
allege that the borrower did not have the ability to repay the loan at the time the loan was made.  Under the 
new rules, a  QM must have  a back -end debt -to-income (DTI) ratio of 43 percent or less and lack several  
other “risky” features.  Loans that are eligible for GSE purchase or are insured or guaranteed by a federal 
agency such as the FHA and VA may qualify as QMs even without satisfying the DTI requirement.  About 
95 percent of current mortgage originations likely qualify as QMs.

  FOREIGN  DEVELOPMENTS  
Market participants were encouraged by generally impro ving economic 
conditions in foreign economies since the December FOMC meeting.  In most of the 
AFEs, readings on economic activity continued to meet or exceed market participants’ 
expectations, and market sentiment toward some vulnerable EMEs appeared to be stabilizing.  
Reflecting the favorable incoming economic data in the advanced economies and 
the optimistic tone of the Federal Reserve’s communications in December, headline equity indexes in the AFEs increased substantially on net.  Stock prices of euro-area 
banks considerably outperformed and are up about 50 percent since their trough in June.  In addition, U.K. interest rates at maturities of one to three years ended the intermeeting 
period higher, as surprisingly low readings on U.K. unemployment increase d prospects 
for earlier policy tightening.  By contrast, compa rable- maturity interest rates in Canada 
declined —reflecting in part statements from the governor of the Bank of Canada 
emphasizing the risk of deflation in Canada— and short -term interest rates in the other 
AFEs were little changed on net.  Ten -year benchmark sovereign yields in the AFEs 
moved in sync with yields on 10- year Treasury securities  during the intermeeting period, 
with yields in Germany and Canada ending the period down slightly.     
In peripheral Europe, the improvement in market sentiment over the intermeeting 
period was reflected in several  successful issuances of sovereign bonds and bank debt.  In 
particular, Ireland and Portugal  issued sizable amounts of sovereign debt and e xperienced 
broad demand from both domestic and international investors.  Ireland formally 
completed  its IMF –EU support program in mid- December —though loans from that 
program are scheduled  to be repaid  over coming years —and its debt rating was raised to 
investment  grade by Moody’s; Portugal is expected to complete  its program later this 
year.  On net, Portuguese spreads over German bunds dropped about 90 basis points, and 
Spanish, Italian, and Irish spreads declined 10 to 30 basis points. 
Emerging markets  generally took in stride the Federal Reserve’s announcement of 
the reduction in the pace of its asset purchases, although financial pressures generally remained evident in a few EMEs .  The index of the dollar against emerging market 
currencies moved up modestly, ending the pe riod about 1 percent higher.  In addition, 
emerging market bond spreads moved up only slightly, on balance, although they remained  elevated compared with the first half of last year .  EME stock prices showed

  somewhat more reaction, with  the MSCI emerging market equity index down 2 percent  
over the intermeeting period .  In Turkey, where domestic vulnerabilities continued to 
weigh on sentiment, the exchange value of the lira and stock prices moved down 
significantly.    
The broad dollar ind ex rose  about 1½ percent , on net, with the dollar rising more 
against the currencies of other advanced economies  than against those of the EMEs.  
Federal Reserve communications in December and t he improvement in the U.S. economy 
contributed to an increase in the dollar of nearly  3½ percent against the Canadian dollar 
and more moderate gain s against the yen and the euro.  However, the dollar depreciated 
more than  1 percent against the British pound, in part reflecting the sizable shift  in U.K.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.   The first  
scenario considers the possibility that the impr oved economic outlook makes consumers 
more willing to spend .  In the second  scenario, the consumption- led acceleration in 
demand of the first scenario makes businesses more willing to  invest.  In the third , we 
consider the possibility that the slowdown in potential output growth assumed in the 
baseline could be deeper and more persistent.  The fourth  scenario considers the risk that 
the softness in consumer price inflation  seen recentl y proves to be more persistent than 
anticipated .  The final two scenarios consider risks to the U.S. economy from foreign 
economic developments—first, that inflation  expectations in the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) drift persistently lower , and , second, that the pace of economic growth 
in the AFEs could increase more rapidly than assumed in the baseline. 
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and th e last two  
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations , as in the baseline 
forecast,  the federal funds rate follows  an inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
subject  to the FOMC’s thresholds for the  unemployment rate and projected inflation , 
including our interpretation of the FOMC’s forward guidance “ that it likely will be 
appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the 
time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent.”1  For  the SIG MA 
simulations , we use a broadly similar  policy rule, subject to the s ame thresholds  and 
                                                 
1 In the baseline projection, a s noted in “Key Background Factors ” in the Domestic Economic 
Developments and Outlook section,  we assume that the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower 
bound for three quarters after the unemployment rate initially falls below 6½ percent .  From then on, the 
setting of the funds rate is governed by the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.   In the alternative sc enarios, we 
allow changes in the outlook for economic activity and inflation to affect how long the funds rate remains 
at the zero lower bound by adopting the following procedure:  We  assume that the inertial Taylor rule takes 
over in the quarter following  the observation of an unemployment rate of 6 percent, the same as the 
unemployment rate in the baseline forecast in the quarter prior to liftoff, provided that the projected 
inflation threshold is not breached beforehand.

 additional forward guidance, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.2  
In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their 
baseline paths. 
Consumer Confidence 
Over  the past year , real household stock ma rket and residential property wealth 
have increased  around 30 percent and 11 percent , respectively ; payroll employment has 
posted solid gains; and the unemployment rate has fallen almost 1  percentage point.  
These fact ors support the acceleration in consumer spending in the baseline projection.  
However, some of the models we consult call for an even stronger pickup.  In this 
scenario, the increase in wealth combines with better labor market prospects and a 
lessening of financial const raints to raise consumer confidence and make households 
more willing and able  to spend than in the baseline forecast.  As a consequence, 
consumer spending rises more rapidly , foster ing more investment and hiring by  firms and 
contributing to a virtuous circle that boosts incomes and stimulate s consumption further.  
All told,  real GDP rises at an average annual pace of 3¾ percent over the next three 
years, ½ percent age point faster than  in the baseline, and the unemployment rate  falls  to 
4¼ percent by the end of 2016.  Inflation rises toward its target somewhat more quickly  
than in the baseline projection, reaching 2 percent  by 2017.  T he federal funds rate l ifts 
off one quarter earlier than in the baseline and follows a steeper trajectory thereafter ; it 
reaches 5  percent by the end of 2018. 
Consumer and Business Confidence 
Gains in business investment have been modest over the past year or so, likely 
reflecting slow growth in business output.  Here, we consider the possibility that the 
stronger econom y in the first scenario boosts business confidence and enhances firms’ 
willingness  to invest in response to increases in demand .  In the context of healthy credit 
conditions—at least for larger firms —and excess cash on firms ’ balance sheets, this 
channel triggers additional investment in durable equipment and structures as well as 
further hiring relative to the first scenario.  R eal GDP rises at an annual pace of 
4¼ percent over the next three years , 1 percen tage point  faster than in the baseline.  
                                                 
2 The SIGMA policy rule uses a m easure of slack equal to the difference between actual output 
and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence o f slow adjustment of wages 
and prices.

 Stronger labor demand leads the unemployment rate to fall below 4  percent by the middle 
of 2016.  T he federal funds rate rise s even more steeply than in the previous scenario and 
reaches 5¾ percent by the end of 2018.  The investment -driven nature of the additional 
demand  in this scenario proves to be noninflationary compared with the demand in the 
first scenario . 
Supply -Side Damage 
In the last three years, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1 percentage point 
per year despite only moderate increases in real GDP.  In response, the staff has marked 
down its estimate of potential output gains over this period, and in this Tealbook, we have made further changes in this direction.  It is possible, however, that th e damage to 
aggregate supply has been even  greater than in the updated baseline.  In this scenario, we 
assume a slower growth of structural productivity such that potential output has expanded at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent since 2010, ⅓ percentage point lower than in the 
baseline, and continues to rise more slowly through 2018.  As a result, the output gap is currently 1 percentage point narrower.  Real GDP rises at a rate of 3  percent per year  
through 2015, somewhat less than in the baseline  projection, but the unemployment rate 
nonetheless declines  more rapidly, reaching 5 percent by  the end of 2015.  With resource 
slack substantially narrower and productivity gains smaller, inflation rises to 2 percent in 2016 and hovers around 2¼ percent in 2017 and 2018.  Over the next two years, policymakers gradually take on board the evidence of less -favorable supply- side 
conditions, and, in response to reduced  slack and higher inflation, t he federal funds rate 
begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the first quarter of 2015 and t hereafter 
rises more steeply than in the baseline. 
Low Inflation 
In the baseline projection, the surprisingly low inflation this year is assumed to be 
largely transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradually moves up toward 
2 percent as the recovery continues.  This view is premised  on the staff’s assumption that 
longer-run inflation expectations have been firmly anchored and will remain so over the projection period.  In this scenario, we examine the possibility that inflation going 
forward  behaves  according to an accelerationist Phillips curve, which in current 
circumstances keeps inflation persistently low over the forecast horizon.  As a 
consequence, prices rise less than 1  percent this year and i nflation remains below 
1 percent through 2018.  The lower inflation in this scenario causes l iftoff to occur one

 quarter later than in the baseline forecast  and the federal funds rate to rise  more slowly 
thereafter , reaching only 2½ percent by the end of 2018, 150 basis points less than in the 
baseline projection.3  The real federal funds rate is slightly higher  than in the baseline in 
the medium term, and slightly lower later in the decade, with little consequence for real 
activity.    
Lower Inflation in the Advanced Foreign Economies 
As discussed in the box “Inflation Developments in the Advanced Foreign 
Economies” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section, we have attributed the marked decline in inflation in many AFEs over the past two years mainly to temporary factors, and AFE inflation rates are expected to rise gradually toward central 
bank targets as these transient factors wear off and output gaps narrow.   However , it is 
possible that recent low inflation readings in the AFEs presage a more protracted period 
of undesirably low inflation.  In this scenario, households and businesses in the AFEs lower their expectations about long-run inflation by 2 percentage points, phased in over several quarters, causing AFE inflation to dip below zero by the end of 2015.
4  Given that 
many AFEs face constraints on monetary accommodation, lower inflation causes real 
interest rates to rise and AFE currencies to appreciate, which in our simulation reduces 
AFE real GDP growth about 1 percentage point below baseline through the end of 2015.  U.S. real exports weaken in response to lower  foreign activity.  In addition, our scenario 
assumes that U.S. long-run expected inflation declines about ½ percentage point, which, in the SIGMA model, reinforces the decline in activity by boosting real interest rates.   All 
told, U.S. real GDP growth averages only about 3 percent this year and  next, and the U.S. 
core inflation rate falls to 1 percent next year.  With a higher unemployment rate and a lower path for inflation than in the baseline, the federal funds rate lifts off in the third 
                                                 
3 As discussed in an earlier footnote, for the alternative scenarios we have adjusted the baseline 
policy assumption to take account of the Committee’s intention to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, but we have 
not attempted a num erical interpretation of the statement that it would do so “especially if projected 
inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”  Were we to do so, liftoff 
from the zero lower bound in this scenario might be postponed by sev eral years.  
4 In SIGMA, long -run inflation expectations are determined by the public ’s perception of the 
central bank ’s longer -run inflation target .  To implement this scenario, we assume that this inflation target 
falls exogenously.   This approach  differs from the accelerationist Phillips c urve used in the “Low Inflation” 
scenario, in which long -run inflation expectations depend endogenously on realized inflation.  A key 
implication of the latter specification  is that  long- run expected inflation wo uld continue to fall as long as 
the unemployment  rate remained above the natural rate.

 quarter of next year , one quarter later than the baseline, and follows a somewhat flatter 
trajectory thereafter .   
Faster Recovery in the Advanced Foreign Economies  
We are currently projecting a relatively restrained recovery of economic activity 
in the AFEs.  However, with financial str esses in the euro area easing markedly, buoyant 
readings in financial markets throughout the AFEs, and surprisingly strong employment 
growth in the United Kingdom, it is possible that the recovery in the AFEs may be more robust than in our baseline forecast.  Specifically, in this scenario, real GDP in the AFEs expands at an annual pace about 1½ percentage points above the baseline through the end of 2015, as  rapid improvements in AFE financial conditions and sentiment fuel stronger 
growth in business and household spending.  The more rapid removal of monetary accommodation in the AFEs and heightened investor confidence in those economies cause the broad real dollar to depreciate about 3 percent relative to the baseline.  In response to the stronger foreign activity and weaker dollar, U.S. real net exports rise 
relative to the baseline.  All told, U.S. real GDP growth rises ¼ percentage point above the baseline in 2014 and 2015.  Higher import prices and stronger activity boost inflation 
to 2 percent in 2015.  The federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound in the 
second quarter of 2015, as in the baseline, and rises somewhat more quickly thereafter.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
