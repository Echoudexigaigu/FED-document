Domestic Economic Developments  and Outlook  
The incoming data on sp ending and production have been to the soft side of our 
expectations .  Real GDP now appears to have risen  considerably less in the fourth quarter 
than seemed to have been the case at the time of the January Tealbook , and the available 
readings on consumer spending, residential construction , and business investment point 
to less spending growth this quarter than in our previous projection.  In addition, factory 
output has surprised us to the downside in recent months.  We think that unusually severe winter weather  can account for part  of the unanticipated weakness, but not the bulk of it.  
We have let most of the downside surprise show through to the level of real GDP, but in 
the face of real -time indicators that we perceive to be unusually n oisy, we have not taken 
much signal for the growth of demand going forward.  L ater this year —once weather -
related fluctuations are expected to have washed out of the data—our updated forecast 
has the level of real GDP ½ percent below where we had it in the January Tealbook.   
The information from the January and February labor reports was mixed but 
generally suggests that the labor market has been improving at a pace similar to what we 
anticipated in the January Tealbook.  Although payroll gains were lower, on average, than we had written down in the previous Tealbook, we took only a little signal from these data because inclement weat her appears to have held down payroll growth 
noticeably in February and we expect a rebound in March.  Meanwhile, t he 
unemployment rate in both January and February was lower than we had projected.   
In light of the combination of yet another downward surprise  in the 
unemployment rate  and weaker -than-expected news on GDP  growth, we made a further 
adjustment to our supply-side assumptions, reducing the assumed pace of potential output growth  in recent years and  carrying forward some of this s lower  growth int o the forecast 
period.  We lowered  potential output growth a little  further in 2015 and 2016 to reflect  
our revised (but still tentative ) estimate of the labor supply implications of the Affordable 
Care Act . 
Our medium- term forecast for GDP growth is slightly weaker than in the January 
Tealbook, reflecting a higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the downward adjustments we made to our estimates of potential output growth .  That said, 
the basic contour of the projection is very si milar to our previous forecast:  We  continue

Revisions  to the Staff  Projection  since  the Previous  SEP
The  FOMC  last published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP)  following  
the December  2013  FOMC  meeting.  The  table  below  summarizes  revisions  to the 
staff  economic  projection  since  the December  Tealbook.
Real  GDP  in the second  half  of last  year  is now  estimated  to have  been  greater  
than  the  staff  expected  inthe  December  Tealbook,  while  our  current  forecast  for 
real  GDP  growth  in 2014  through  2016  is a little  below  our  December  projection.  
In the background  (that  is, not  visible  among  the  SEP  variables),  we have  
trimmed  our  assumed  rate  of growth  of potential  GDP. The  unemployment  rate  
has  declined  more  than  we expected  in December;  it is now  on track  to average  
6.6 percent  inthe  first  quarter  of this  year,  versus  our  forecast  of 6.9 percent  in 
the December  Tealbook.  We continue  to project  that  the unemployment  rate  
will be around  5% percent  at the end of 2016.
The staff  projection  for both overallandcorePCE  inflation  is little changed  from  
our December  projection.  We continueto  project  that  both core  andheadline  
inflation  will edge  gradually  higher  over  the medium  term.
The unemployment  rate is projected  to fall belowtheCommittee's  6.5percent  
threshold  inthe  middle  of this  year,  but we assume  thatthe  federalfunds  rate  
will notlift  off from  its effective  lowerbounduntil  the second  quarter  of 2015,  
the same  as inthe  December  Tealbook.  The trajectory  of the federalfunds  rate  
after  liftoffis  somewhatsteeperthan  in our December  projection.

 to expect economic activity to  expand more quickly over the next few years than in 2013, 
reflecting the waning of some of the forces —such as restrictive federal fiscal policy  
changes —that have curtailed economic growth in re cent years.  O ur current  forecast has 
real GDP growth stepping up from 2½ percent in 2013 to about 3 percent  per year over 
the next three years.   With growth anticipated to  run above potential over the medium 
term, we project the unemployment rate to decline from about 6½ percent  in the current 
quarter to  just a little above 5 percent  at the end of 2016, slightly below  our assumption 
for the level of the natural rate at that time .   
The data we have received on overall PCE pric es since the January T ealbook have 
been a bit firmer than we had anticipated, reflecting  a January spike in heating costs .  We 
expect th is ener gy-price bulge to be transitory, and , indeed , energy prices flatten out and 
then edg e down over the medium term  in our projection, causing  headline inflation to run 
a bit below core inflation .  Our forecast for core inflation is essentially the same as in 
January, with core PCE inflation expected to rise from about 1¼ percent  in 2013 to 
1¾ percent  in 2016.   
In the Risks and Uncertainty section , we provide our views on the degree of 
uncertainty attending our projections for real GDP growth , the unemployment rate, and 
inflation.    
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are essentially unchanged.  We 
assume that asset purchases will continue to slow at a measured pace and will conclude 
before the end of this year, leaving the cumulative amount of purchases under the program at about $1.5 trillion. 
As in the January Tealbook, we assume the federal funds rate will lift off from its 
zero lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  We construe the two- quarter lag from 
the assumed end in asset purchases to the liftoff of the federal funds rate to be cons istent 
with the Committee’s view, expressed in its January statement, that “a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable 
time after the asset purchase program ends.”  Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises 
at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999)

 policy rule.  This path, little changed from the one in the January  Tealbook, puts the 
federal funds rate at  2½ percent at the end of 2016. 
Other Interest Rates 
The projected  trajectory of the  10-year Treasury yield is slightly lower through  
the end of 2014, reflecting a decline in term premiums since January, but it is little 
revised in 2015 and 2016.  Our projection continues to call for a significant rise in Treas ury yields, primarily because of the movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates as well as a gradual waning 
of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.  
Investment -grade corporate bond and mortgage spreads have changed  relatively 
little since the Jan uary Tealbook.  Consequently, our forecasts for corporate bond yields 
and mortgage rates in the medium term have been revised essentially in line with our revisions to the path for the Treasury yield.  
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
On net since the January Tealbook, equity prices have increased more than we 
had projected .  We have carried the higher level of prices forward, raising the trajectory 
of stock prices this year around 2 percent.  However, with  our view of fundamentals 
unrevised over the medium term, we project stock prices by the end of 2016 to be the same as in  the January Tealbook. 
Our forecast for house prices is little changed since January.  W ith the 
relationship between price s and rents now more consistent with historical norms, we 
continue to expect house price appreciation to slow markedly—from 11 percent in 2013 to an average rate of about 5  percent per year over the next three years —as supply 
gradually expands. 
Fiscal Policy 
Our assumptions for fiscal policy are the same as in the January Tealbook.  The 
federal  debt ceiling was lifted in February as we had anticipated, and , with an agreement 
in place for overall spending levels in fiscal year 2015, the degree of uncertainty about 
fiscal policy now seems less elevated than in recent years.  Despite the expiration of the EUC program, we continue to expect the drag from fiscal policy to ease this year because 
of a diminishing effect of the tax increases put in place last year and a smaller decline in

 real federal purchases.  Consolidating across all levels of government, the restraint on 
real GDP growth from fiscal policy actions (excluding multiplier effects) is projected to 
diminish from about 1 percentage point in 2013 to  ½ percentage point this year, 
¼ percentage point in 2015, and roughly zero in 2016.  
As in the previous projection, the federal unified budget deficit is anticipated to 
narrow from 4  percent  of GDP in fiscal 2013 to about 2 percent of GDP in  fiscal 2016, 
reflecting ongoing budget consolidation efforts and stronger receipts because of  further 
improvements in the economy.  As a result, federal debt held by the public is expected to remain near 70 percent of GDP  for the next few years . 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
We estimate that real GDP growth in the foreign economies slowed slightly to an 
annual rate of 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2013, a pace somewhat lower than we were expecting in the January Tealbook ; surprisingly weak growth in Japan and Me xico 
more than offset upside surprises in a number of other economies .  We expect foreign 
output to grow at roughly the same pace in the first half of this year before growth edges 
up to a little under 3½ percent in  2016, supported by continued gradual recovery in the 
euro area and a return to near -trend growth in the emerging market economies  (EMEs) .  
Relative to the January Tealbook, our outlook for foreign growth is down ½ percentage point in the first quarter and one- tenth  of a percentage point further out, with the revisions 
concentrated in the EMEs. 
The broad nominal index for the dollar has been  about unchanged , on net, since 
the January Tealbook.  We expect the broad real dollar to depreciate at a 1¼ percent average annual pace through the forecast period, with all of the depreciation projected to 
occur against the currencies of emerging Asia.  (See the box “The Path of the Dollar :  
Baseline and Alternatives” f or a detailed discussion of this forecast.)  Relative to the 
January Tealbook, we lessened the pace of dollar depreciation in the forecast about ½ percentage point, in part because financial stresses  in the euro area have eased  to the 
point where we no longer expect further improvements to reverse safe- haven flows and 
depreciate the dollar.  With less of a downward tilt in our forecast, the level of the broad real doll ar is projected to be about 1½ percent higher at the end of the forecast period 
relative to the previous Tealbook.

 Oil and Other Commodity Prices  
The spot price of Brent crude oil is up about $1 per barrel since the time of the 
previous Tealbook, closing at $109 per barrel on March 1 1.  Despite concerns about 
Chinese growth, which have depressed industrial metals prices, global oil prices have 
been supported by forecasts of strong er oil  demand  in the advanced economies, continued 
disruptions in Libya, and  unrest in South Sudan and Venezuela.  Meanwhile, the spot 
price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has risen  almost $6 per barrel since the Jan uary 
Tealbook as improved transportation infrastructure has enabled producers to move significant amounts of crude oil from Cushing, Oklahoma, the pricing hub for WTI, to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Based on futures markets, w e project the price of imported oil to 
average $99 per barrel in the first half of this year and then to decline gradually over the remainder of the forecast period, falling below  $90 per barrel at the end of 2016.  Overall, 
this trajectory is about $ 2 per barrel higher than in the January Tealbook. 
Prices for copper and iron ore moved sharply lower amid continued concerns 
about Chinese demand prospects.  Even so, the broad index of nonfuel commodity prices that we track has risen  about 5 percent since the time of the January Tealbook as pric es of 
foods and beverages moved higher.  In recent weeks, coffee prices soared  nearly  
75 percent  as a severe drought has cut coffee production in Brazil .  Tensions in Ukraine 
(an important wheat and corn exporter) boosted grain prices, although Ukrainian exports to date have not been curtailed.  We continue to expect nonfuel commodity prices to increase only slightly over the forecast period. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  
The information we have received since the January Tealbook has led us to 
reduce our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year to 2¼  percent 
and our forecast for the current quarter to 1½ percent ; both figures are down 1 percentage 
point or a little more relative to the January Tealbook .  Although it is difficult to 
disentangle how much of this unanticipated weakness stems from unfavorable weather 
conditions and how much stems from weaker-than-anticipated underlying activity, w e 
currently  estimate that unseasonably adverse weather had li ttle effect last quarter and will 
hold down real GDP growth in the current quarter by only about ¼ percentage point.  
(The box “Effects of Severe Winter Weather on Economic Activity”  presents some of the 
detailed empirical examination we undertook to arriv e at this conclusion.)  In the second 
quarter, real GDP growth is projected to be boosted by a rebound in production and sales

 The Path of the Dollar:  Baseline and Alternatives  
A key element of the staff forecast for U.S. activity and inflation is our projection of the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar.  In this box, we provide the rationale for our baseline dollar projection and discuss plausible alternatives.   
 Our baseline projection has the broad real dollar depreciating 1¼ percent at an annual rate 
throughout the forecast period, as shown by the black line in the upper- left figure on the 
following page.  This depreciation is expected to come almost wholly against the currencies of our emerging Asian trading partners, the red line, with the real value of the dollar against the 
currencies of advanced foreign economies (AFEs), the blue line, projected to appreciate slightly, 
and the dollar holding roughly flat against the currencies of Latin America (the green line).   
 The appreciation of the dollar against the AFE currencies reflects our projections of monetary policy in the United States and the other advanced economies.  We assume that market 
expectations for the future paths of policy rates in the United States and elsewhere are already 
incorporated into the current value of the dollar.  However, the staff projects that when the FOMC begins to raise its target for the federal funds rate the increase will be more rapid than  
the markets now anticipate.  Therefore, the dollar should appreciate against the AFE currencies as market views on the path of U.S interest rates eventually adjust to match those of the staff.   
 
Surprises in the path of interest rates are not the dominant force behind our forecast for dollar 
depreciation against the emerging Asian currencies.  Instead, we believe that a number of emerging Asian countries have undervalued currencies and a desire to rebalance their economies toward domestic consumption.  Dollar depreciation, then, results from direct policy choices these countries make to continue to move away from export -led growth.  Importantly, 
Chinese authorities have indicated an increased commitment to exchange rate flexibility and to growth led more by private domestic demand.  Although in real effective terms, the Chinese currency has appreciated more than 25 percent since 2007 and the current account surplus has fallen sharply (the red line in the upper- right figure), we estimate that the cyclically adjusted 
current account surplus is still sizable and the Chinese currency is still significantly undervalued, 
leaving room for more adjustment.  By contrast, in Latin America, where countries are running 
current account deficits, on balance (the green line), currencies do not appear to be undervalued.  
 The modest depreciation of the broad real dollar results in a U.S. trade deficit that is little changed as a share of GDP over the forecast period (the black line in the lower- right figure on 
the following page).  This depreciation is reasonable based on the assumptions of our baseline 
forecast, but it is not difficult to imagine alternative scenarios in which the dollar appreciates over the forecast period.   
 First, China and other Asian economies may choose to rebalance their economies less quickly 
than we envisage.  For example, should growth in China threaten to fall below the authorities’ 
target, policymakers there might be tempted to guide the renminbi lower for a time.  Although the renminbi has depreciated about 1½ percent in nominal terms against the dollar since the last Tealbook, we view this decline as a temporary interruption of the appreciation trend rather than a move back to export -led growth.  However, given the importance of China for our ov erall 
forecast of dollar depreciation, if we have overestimated the Chinese authorities’ commitment to rebalancing, it is likely that the value of the dollar will be higher than in our baseline forecast.

Second, the current value of the dollar may not  fully price in the effects of future U.S. policy 
normalization.  In this case, as U.S. yields rise, the dollar could appreciate more against the AFE 
currencies than we currently anticipate, and could rise against the currencies of emerging 
market economies (EMEs) as well.  The implications of such a scenario are explored in the “Stronger Dollar” alternative simulation in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  As shown by the blue line in the lower- left figure, in this scenario, the broad real dollar appreciates somewhat 
over the forecast period, instead of depreciating as in the baseline.  This appreciation weighs on 
the U.S. trade balance, as shown by the blue line in the lower- right figure, and, as described in 
the Risks and Uncertainty section, contributes to a modest decline in U.S. output relative to 
baseline.  
 Third, in our baseline, we do not expect any major or persistent disruptions to global financial markets, although bouts of volatility could recur, such as the financial tension we observed 
recently in some vulnerable EMEs.  However, stresses in the vulnerable economies could erupt 
into a full- fledged EME crisis, a scenario presented in previous Tealbooks and also discussed in 
the Risks and Uncertainty section.  In this case, we expect flight -to-safety flows to push up the 
dollar substantially, as shown by the red line in the lower- left figure, and the trade balance (the 
red line in the lower- right figure) deteriorates more markedly, contributing to sharper declines 
in U.S. output relative to baseline (not shown).

 Effects of Severe Winter Weather on Economic Activity  
According to many reports, economic activity was  slow ed by the  unusually  snowy and cold 
weather this winter.  To gauge the significance of these reports  for January and February, we 
statistically analyzed  the effect of winter w eather on four economic indicators:  single -family 
housing starts, private payroll employment, real PCE-relevant retail sales, and light vehicle 
sales.1  Specifically, w e looked  to see whether unusually cold or snowy weather since the 
1996 –97 winter  season  resulted  in a deviation of each economic indicator from its concurrent  
trend (defined as a centered five -month moving average) .   This analysis informed our 
assessment in the baseline forecast of the extent of weather effects.  
To construct indexes of adverse weather, we develop ed daily county -level measures  of 
atypically heavy snowfalls and cold temperature s from weather- station dat a provided by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administratio n.  We then derived daily aggregate indexes 
for extreme weather events  by weighting  these  weather measures with  county -level 
employment for selected industries  from the Census Bureau’s County Business Patterns  series .  
The industries chosen were tailored to each economic indicator (for example, in our  housing 
starts analysis, county -level construction employment was used to aggregate the county -by-
county weather indexes) .  
We created these highly granular indexes (rather than employing  conventional monthly 
national- level series ) based on two  considerations.  First, what constitutes bad weather is 
local:  Three inches of snow probably has a greater effect on economic activity in Athens, 
Georgia, than in Athens, Ohio.  Thus, we looked at deviations in temperature or snowfall from 
historical norm s for each county.  Second, compared with a late- month weather event, the 
effect of an early -month event is more likely to be reversed before the month ends because 
weather effects, particularly for snow, are short lived.  For example, weekly c hain  store sales 
appear to be negatively correlated with contemporaneous snowfall but positively correlated 
with the previous week’s snowfall —purchases  are only  delayed temporarily.  Similarly , the 
lowest readings this winter  for many  weekly indicators of industrial production occurred 
during  the coldest weeks . 
The table on the next page  reports the results  using  our preferred weather indexes  for each 
indicator.  The middle two  column s show the numb er of months in our 19 97–2013 sample that 
were either snowier or colder than normal by at least one standard deviation, along with the 
number of corresponding months this winter.  The next  column shows the percentage of th e 
cold or snowy months  in our sample that  had economic  indicators below trend .  The final 
column  shows the average deviation from trend for the economic  indicators in those months.      
Single -family housing starts often appeared  to be suppressed by extreme cold or snow :  
Eighty -two  percent of the months in our sample with heavy snows saw single- family housing 
                                                 
1 Real PCE -relevant retail sales comprise the portion of total retail sales used by the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis in estimating PCE.  
Industrial production was also affected by severe winter weather in January; see the discussion in the 
Technical Q&A for the G.17 release at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/g17_technical_qa.htm.

 starts  dip below their recent trend, and the mean  reduction  from  the trend  level of starts 
during  those unusually snowy months was 1.3 percent .  Heavy snows late in a month were 
more likely to be associated with  a weak reading than those early in a month .  Housing starts 
sagged in every extremely cold month, but the  effect  of the cold  seem ed unrelated to when it 
occurred  within the month .  A rough estimate from this analysis suggests that single- family  
housing  starts were curbed  by an annual rate of  25,000 units in  January  this year and 
17,000 units in February.2   
Employment  tend ed to be held down  only  a little when the  Bureau of Labor Statistics  survey 
week  was unusually snowy or cold.3  The snowy survey week in February suggests  a reduction 
of around 30,000 jobs  in that month —with a large portion of that restraint attributable to 
lower construction employment —but the reading for January seems likely to have been 
affected  much less .  
Real PCE-relevant retail sales appeared  to be suppressed by severe winter weather regardless 
of its timing  during the month.  (Similarly, very warm or snowless weather usually led to 
above- trend  consumer sales .)  Based on weighting county -level weather indexes by retail 
employment , January and February of this year were both  colder and snowier than normal, 
with the cold being more extreme.  This analysis suggests that the levels of these retail sales in 
January  and February were held down about  ¼ percent  each month.    
Light vehicle sales  seemed  more affected by heavy snowfall than by cold.  Using weights 
based on employment at auto dealers, neither January nor February  were especially cold , but 
snowfall was relatively high ; sales appeared to have been  depressed by an annual rate of  
roughly  280,000 units in January and 360,000 units in February .

 from the effects of severe weather .  For the first half as a whole, real GDP growth 
averages 2½ percent, about the average p ace last year  and down ¼ percentage point from 
the January projection. 
Household Spending  
Real PCE is now estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the 
fourth quarter of last year, 1½ percentage points less than our projection in the January 
Tealbook.  This updated estimate, which incorporated an unusually large downward 
revision to r etail sales in November and December , puts consumer outlays on a lower 
trajectory  going into this year .  In addition, r etail sales fell sharply in January, and light 
motor vehicle sales through February have been weaker than we had expected ; that said , 
the BEA’s initial estimates of health -care- services consumption rose more in January 
with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act  than we had expected.  On balanc e, we 
now project that real PCE will rise  at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the current quarter, 
down ½ percentage point from the previous Tealbook.  We think that weather had little effect on real PCE last quarter; however, o n the view that adverse weather accounts for a 
portion of the unexpected softness in outlays this quarter, we project that real PCE 
growth will move up to 3¾ percent in the second quarter as the weather  returns to 
seasonal norms.  As before, we estimate that the projected  increase in spending in the 
first half would be larger if not for the termination of the EUC  program.  
The incoming data on housing activity have also been softer than we were 
anticipat ing.  Both s ingle -family  and multifamily housing starts tumbled in January, with 
the weather likely playing a  role.  However, permits , which tend to be less sensitive to 
weather influences and a better indicator of the underlying trajectory of activity, also 
moved down in January and have shown essentially no sign of sustained improvement 
since last spring.  Although we expect a weather -related bounceback in housing activity 
in coming months, we read the recent  data as pointing to a flatter underlying trajectory 
than we had projected  last round.  As a result,  we now forecast  real residential investment 
to increase at an  annual rate of about 6½ percent over the first half of this year, a 
downward revision of 2 percentage points from our previous forecast.   
Business Investment 
We estimate that real private investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) 
increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter.  However, orders and  shipments of 
nondefense capital goods  point to a deceleration in business equipment outlays early this

 year.  Some of the spending slowdown may be due to the exp iration of bonus 
depreciation tax provisions at the end of last year, which we had long since built into our 
forecast .  In addition, some of the weakness in January shipments likely reflected severe 
weather .  We  anticipate that the weather -related weakness  will be made up in February 
and March and project that business purchases of capital goods will rebound in the second quarter , consistent with the generally positive readings from surveys of business 
sentiment and rising earnings expectations.  On balance, real outlays for E&I are now 
projected to increase at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the first half  of this year , a little  
softer than in the previous Tealbook.   
Real investment in nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining edged  
down in late 2013, as high vacancy rates and tight financing conditions for new 
construction continued to restrain  activity in this sector .  Incoming spending data point to 
another decline in outlays on new buildings early this year.  Meanwhile, real investment in drilling and mining structures is projected to post a sizable gain  over the first half of 
this year, supported by high oil prices and new drilling technologies. 
We revised up our projection for nonfarm inventory investment in the current 
quarter , as it seems likely that some producers were left with higher stocks in the wake of 
widespread  downward surprises to final sales .  However, these adjustments were 
relatively small, and , more broadly, inventory- to-sales ratios from book- value data and 
the staff’s flow -of-goods system, as well as gauges of inventory sentiment from regional 
and national manufacturing surveys, do not point to significant inventory imbalances in most industries.  One exception to this pattern is motor vehicles, where days’ supply in 
January  and February was well above the automakers’ target.  
Government 
After falling sharply in the fourth quarter, r eal federal purchases  are projected to 
rise at an annual rate of 1½ percent  in the first quarter , reflecting a reversal of the effects 
of the temporary government shutdown in October.  W e expect federal purchases to fall 
3 percent  in the second quarter, as spending resumes its trend rate of  decline.   
We project  that real  state and local government purchases will edge up over the 
first half  of this year.  Although incoming data point to a further decline in public- sector 
construction spending this quarter, w e attribute some of the weakness to unseasonably 
adverse weather and expect it to be reversed in  the second quarter.   Meanwhile,

 employment by  these governments continued to trend up early in the year at the sa me 
modest pace seen over the second half of last year.   
Foreign Trade  
After surging 9½ percent at an annual rate in the final quarter of 2013, real 
exports of goods and services are expected to be about flat in the current quarter, 
consistent with the softness of the January trade data.  For the second quarter, we project that exports will rise  3¼ percent, a pace more in line with foreign growth .  Meanwhile, 
real imports of goods and services are expected to rise  1½ percent in the first half of the 
year, held back by a net decline in oil imports  and the slow pace of U.S. GDP growth .  
All told, the external sector is projected to subtract ¼ percentage point from real GDP 
growth in the current quarter and then to make a positive ¼ percentage point contribution 
in the second quarter.  On average, this contribution is about the sa me as  in the January 
Tealbook. 
The Industrial Sector 
After rising at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter, manufacturing 
output is projected to be little changed this quarter, held down in part by disruptions from the severe winter weather .  With most of the new orders indexes from the latest 
manufacturing surveys at generally favorable levels and some catch -up anticipated for the 
weather -related losses in output this quarter, we expect  the growth of manufacturing  
output to step up to about 4 percent in the second  quarter .  Even so , the projected average 
rate of increase over th e first half of this year  is 1½ percent age points below our forecast 
in the January  Tealbook.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM  OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We revised down slightly our forecast  for real GDP growth over the medium term 
in light of the drag from the higher path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and the downward adjustments we made to our estimates of potential output growth.  We now forecast r eal GDP growth to edge up f rom 2½ percent in 2013 to 3 percent , on average, 
over the next three years.  The se changes  leave the output gap unrevised at the end of 
2016 and the level of real GDP about ¾ percent lower than in the January Tealbook.   
Our projection that  real GDP growth will step up over the medium term— even as 
interest rates rise —reflect s our expectation that some of the f orces  that have been holding 
back growth in recent years will recede.  In particular, the restraint from changes in

 federal fiscal policy is wan ing and should continue to do so, and we think that mortgage 
credit will gradually become more broadly available.  T hese developments are expected 
to foster  a growing sense among households and firms that the downside risks to the 
recovery have diminished; in turn, the improvement in confidence should provide 
additional support to consumer spending, business investment, and hiring.   
These influences are most apparent in our projection for consumer spending.  In 
particular, we continue to anticipate  that the fading effects of last  year’s tax increases, 
gains in household wealth produced by rising house and equity prices, and improved consumer confidence will lead real PCE growth to move up to 3½ percent this year and 
3¾ percent in 2015 before slowing to about 3 percent in 2016.  This forecast is about ¼ percentage point per year  lower than in the January Tealbook, largely due to the slower 
growth in potential output (and hence in permanent income) in this projection.   
Rising income and confidence also are expected to lead to a higher pace of 
household formation and thereby boost residential construction.  However,  the effect on 
homebuilding will likely be damped by rising mortgage rates  and—at least for some 
time—the limited availability of buildable lots  and other specialized inputs.  We expect 
the growth in residential investment to increase at an annual rate of roughly 15 percent  in 
the second half of 2014 and in 2015 before slowing to 10 percent  in 2016.   
Real outlays for E&I are expected to rise 5 percent per year, on average, over the 
next three years.  Although faster than the pace of growth posted in 2013, our medium-
term projection for E&I growth is modest by historical standards and reflects our 
expectation that business output will increase at o nly a moderate pace over this period.  
Similarly, we continue to expect only subdued growth in  spending on nonresidential 
structures over the medium term.  
The external sector is expected to deduct slightly from the growth of real GDP 
this year and next and then to be about neutral for growth in 2016.  We expect real exports to pick up over the forecast period, supported by firming foreign growth and 
dollar depreciation.  B ut we also project real imports to increase at a solid pace, as the 
boost from U.S. growth more than offsets the drag from both the depreciating dollar and a continued trend decline in oil imports. 
Federal government spending is projected to continue to trend down over the 
forecast period, restrained by ongoing fiscal consolidation and reductions in spending on

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  AND INFLATION  
Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook for the  Labor Market 
The latest readings on the labor market, notably the January and February jobs 
reports, suggest that the labor market has been improving at a pace similar to what we 
anticipated in the January Tealbook.1  Total nonfarm payrolls rose at an average pace of 
150,000 in January and February, about 20,000 less per month than we had expected.  However, we think that adverse weather conditions held down payroll employment in recent months.  In addition, we think that weather accounted for much of the recent 
decline in the workweek, which fell to 34.2 hours in February from an already low level 
in December  and January.   
In the household survey, the unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in February, 
¼ percentage point below its fourth-quarter average and 0.1 percentage point lower than 
we had projected  in the previous Tealbook.  T he labor force participation rate moved up 
0.2 percent age point over the same period, to  63.0 percent , in contra st to our January 
projection of no change.  Other measures of labor utilization were generally upbeat in the 
past two months as well.   We think the key measures from the household survey were 
probably little affected by weather -related d isruptions. 
Looking ahead , we expect nonfarm payrolls to increase 23 0,000 in March, a 
figure that includes a 5 0,000 weather-related bounceback.  In the second quarter, we 
expect payroll gains to average 210,000 per month.  We have carried forward the lower 
level of the unemployment rate  and now project it to edge down to 6.6 percent  in March  
and 6.5 percent  in the second quarter.  Similarly, we have adjusted up the path of the 
labor force participation rate and expect that it  will remain at its current leve l of 
63.0 percent  in coming months. 
                                                 
1 The January report incorporated the annual benchmark revisions, which raised the level of 
payroll employment in December 2013 by about 500,000.  Of this amount, about 350,000 was the direct 
effect of the March 2013 benchmarking, which was more than accoun ted for by the expansion of the 
payroll survey’s scope to include an additional industry that provides home -based social services for the 
elderly and disabled.  The remainder reflected  an upward revision to the estimated pace of payroll gains 
since last Ma rch, some of which may have been due to the expanded scope.

 Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment  
The downward surprise in the unemployment rate so far this year was 
accompanied by disappointing news about the growth of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 
2013 and the first quarter of this year.  To help reconcile these apparently divergent 
signals for resource utilization, we marked down our assumptions for potential output growth from 2011 to 2013 by 0.1 percentage point per year, which reduced the level of 
potential output about ¼ percent at the end of 2013, similar to the downward revision to 
the level of real GDP in that quarter.  In addition, w e carried  forward some of the weaker 
potential output growth in recent years into the forecast period .  Finally, for this 
Tealbook, we reassessed the labor supply implications of the A ffordable C are A ct, which 
led us to lower potential output growth in 2015 and 2016 slightly further .   
Based o n our revised assumptions, we now expect potential output growth to 
increase from  1½ percent in 2013 to  1¾ percent in 2014 and about 2 percent in 2015 and 
2016, leaving the level of potential output ¾ percent lower at the end of 2016 than in the January Tealbook.  We continue to assume  that the natural rate of unemployment will 
edge down f rom 5½ percent in 2013 to 5¼ percent in 2015 and 2016.   
The Medium -Term Outlook for the Labor Market 
Total payroll employment is projected to increase 210,000 per month in 2014 and 
then rise 220,000 per month, on average, in 2015 and 2016.  This trajectory is slightly 
lowe r than in the January T ealbook, in line with the slower projected rate of output 
growth  over the medium term. 
Starting from its slightly lower  level of 6.6 percent in the current quarter, the 
unemployment rate is projected to edge down to 6¼ percent at the end of the year, the 
same level as in the January Tealbook.  Thereafter, the projected path is unrevised, with 
the unemployment rate falling a bout ½ percent age point per year to just above 5 percent  
at the  end of 2016.  The p rojected level of the unemployment rate at the end of 2016 is 
slightly below th e staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment .   
Resource Utilization   
We estimate th e unemployment rate is  about 1¼ percent age points above our 
estimate of the natural rate in the first quarter , and w e put the GDP gap  at about

 3 percent .2  The se gaps are roughly conformable in the first quarter given the staff’s 
preferred Okun’s law coefficient of 0.44.  Over the medium term, these gaps  are 
projected to diminish gradually, and by the end of 2016, both the unemployment gap and 
output gap are  expected to be completely closed.  In the manufacturing sector, capacity 
utilization is currently nearly 2¾ percent age points below its long-run average but is 
projected to rise to its long -run average by early 2016.   
The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
After rising at an annual rate of 1 percent  in the fourth  quarter, total PCE prices 
are pr ojected  to increase at  a 1½ percent  pace in the f irst quarter, reflecting a weather -
induced jump in energy prices.  Core PCE inflation was 1¼ percent  in the fourth quarter 
and appears to be running at a similar rate in this  quarter , in line with our previous 
forecast .  We proje ct that by midyear , both total and core PCE inflation  will be about 
1½ percent, the same as in the January Tealbook .  
We have marked up our near-term projection for consumer energy price inflation.  
In January, consumer price s for heating fuel, natural gas, and electricity came in much 
higher than we predicted in the January  Tealbook, likely reflecting the effect of cold 
weather on heating demand.  Indeed, the path of futures prices for natural gas over the next year has moved up sharply since the time of the January Tealbook, as inventories 
have fallen to their lowest levels in more than a decade.  As a result, o verall consumer 
energy prices are now projected to rise  at an annual rate of about 4 percent  in the current  
quarter  and to hold at that higher level in the second  quarter , rather than edging down 
over the first half as we had anticipated in the previous Tealbook.  Gi ven the downward 
tilt in our medium- term forecasts for crude oil and natural gas prices, we continue to 
project  that PCE energy prices will decline mod estly beyond the near term. 
Consumer food price s are projected to increase at a moderate pace over the first 
half of this year after being about unchanged in the fourth quarter.  Th is projected pickup 
in food price inflation  reflects the pass -through of recent increases in farm commodity 
prices following their sizable declines last year , as well as the effect of drought 
conditions in California on prices of fruits and vegetables.  We continue to project that 
                                                 
2 We assume that the natural rate is on a downward trajectory, reflecting some unwinding of the 
effects of the recession.  We put it at 5.4 percent at present and anticipate that it will decline to 5.2 percent 
in the medium term.

 PCE food prices  will increase at a pace that is slightly below core inflation  over the 
medium term. 
Since the January Tealbook, core PCE inflation was revised up slightly in the 
fourth quarter to 1¼ percent , with  the changes concentrated in  the nonmarket component.  
However, the core inflation reading in January was close to what we were expecting , and 
we continue to predict that core inflation will be about 1¼ percent in the current quarter, 
will edge up to 1½ percent in the second quarter, and will remai n there over the second 
half of the year .   
Much  of th e projected pickup in core PCE inflation this year reflects a projected 
acceleration in import prices.  After falling throughout most of last year, p rices of 
imported core goods are expected to increase at an annual rate of  ¾ percent in the first 
half of this year and then to step  up to a 1½ percent pace in the second half, as the 
restraining effect of previous dollar appreciation fades.  Core import price s are projected 
to continue to rise just under 1½ percent per year in 2015 and 2016, a pace that is i n line 
with a modest projected increase in commodity prices and our assumed pace of dollar depreciation .  We estimate that import prices will continue to have a slightly restraining  
effect on U.S. consumer price inflation over the medium term, albeit noticeably less than in the past two years. 
Readings on longer- term inflation expectations have remained stable.  The final 
February  reading on median 5 -to-10-year-ahead inflation expect ations from the Michigan 
survey stood at 2.9 percent, well within the relatively narrow range seen in recent years.  Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by the Survey of Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2  percent  in the f irst quarter.  TIPS- based 
measures of longer- term inflation compensation are just slightly lower than at the time of 
the January T ealbook. 
With stable long-run inflation expectations , a projected pickup in import prices, 
and gradually diminishing margin s of slack, we expect core PCE inflation to increase 
from 1¼ percent  in 2013 to  1½ percent this year and 1¾ percent  in 2016; this forecast is 
essentially the same as in the January T ealbook.  Given the slight downward trajectory 
for energy prices , total PCE inflation is projected  to be a bit below core inflation over 
most of the medium term.  Thus, through 2016, t otal PCE inflation is projected to remain  
below the Committee’s long -run objective of 2 percent .

 The incoming data suggest that labor compensation has continued to rise at a 
modest pace.  We now estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business 
sector will increase at a 2½ percent  annual rate in the current quarter—close to its 
average seen over the previous two years.  W e expect the gradual tightening of the labor 
market over the medium term to push hourly compensation growth up to 3½ percent  by 
2016.  The employment cost index has provided a less volatile  measure of compensation 
pressures i n recent years.  In 2013, it increased 2 percent; over the next few years, as 
labor markets tighten, we expect this index to accelerate to about a 3¼ percent pace.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using th e FRB/US 
model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and 
other factors.  The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
• The federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescrip tions of an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule. 
• The Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer- term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The 
process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal s ize is expected to be 
completed by 2021. 
• Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds continue to decrease, on balance, toward their longer- run normal levels, and financial institutions 
further ease their lending standards. 
• The federal budget deficit (measured on a NIPA basis) is 3½ percent of GDP 
in 2017 and widens thereafter, primarily reflecting fast- rising transfer 
payments for retirement and health -care programs.  The ratio of f ederal debt 
to GDP remains at about 70 percent in 2017 but edge s up therea fter.  
• The real foreign exchange value of the dollar stays constant from 2017 
onward.  The price of crude oil holds steady in real terms.  Foreign real GDP 
rises at an annual rate of about 3 percent from 2017 to 2020. 
• The natural rate of unemployment is 5¼ percent, and potential GDP rises around 2¼ percent per year from 2017 to 2020.

 With the federal funds rate and longer- term interest rates continuing to rise, real 
GDP growth slows to 2½  percent in 2017.  The unemploy ment rate edges down further 
and is almost ¼ percentage point below its natural rate at the end of 2017.  The opening 
of a modest positive output gap helps return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective by 2018.  As monetary policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn, gains in real GDP slow to below their potential pace so that the output gap narrows and the unemployment rate moves back toward its natural rate.  The nominal 
federal funds rate rises to just over 4 percent in 2019 and 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign real GDP growth edged down to a 2¾ percent pace in the fourth quarter 
of 2013.  This outcome was somewhat weaker than we projected  in January, as growth in 
Japan and Mexico was much lower than we had anticipated, overwhelming upside 
surprises in many other economies.  We expect foreign growth in the first half of this year to continue at a similar rate and then to move up to almost 3½ percent by 2016.  Much of this pickup in growth comes from a strengthening of the recovery in the euro area and a firming of conditions in emerging markets, especially in Latin America, after particularly poor performance last year.  
The trajectory of foreign economic growth is somewhat lower than we wrote 
down in the previous Tealbook, particularly in the current quarter, owing to severe winter weather in Canada and relatively subdued recent indicators in EMEs.  The rest of the forecast also has been revised down a bit.  This revision is partly in response to the slightly weaker path for U.S. growth, but it owes more importantly to our reassessment of 
the underlying strength of economic activity in a number of countries.  We now see 
China’s economy deceler ating a touch faster over the next few years than we previously 
assumed, which will weigh on other EMEs, particularly in emerging Asia, and we are somewhat more pessimistic about prospects in Latin America as well.   
Although we believe that foreign growth will pick up over the forecast, we are 
attentive to several risks to our outlook.  The financial stresses that intensified in many EMEs around the time of the January FOMC meeting have eased, but these could well return, perhaps as monetary policy in the advanced economies normalizes.  A possible scenario along these lines is discussed in the “Stronger Dollar” simulation in the Risks and Uncertainty (R&U) section of the Tealbook.  In the extreme, such stresses could 
snowball into a broad- based EME crisis, which is also discussed in R&U.  Finally, we are 
watching recent developments in Ukraine carefully.  Although the response of global 
financial markets to the Ukrainian crisis has been minimal, were this crisis to intensify, it could have deeper effects on global markets and growth. 
Foreign inflation is estimated to have fallen slightly in the current quarter, as a 
welcome rise in inflation in the advanced foreign economies was more than offset by an equally welcome decline in some EMEs.  The rise in AFE inf lation has been concentrated

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
March 12, 2014

in the euro area and Canada, where inflation had fallen to very low levels late last year.  
Although the risk of AFE deflation has receded somewhat, substantial resource slack and 
below- target inflation will keep monetary polic y in the AFEs highly accommodative for 
some time.  Meanwhile, a number of the more vulnerable EMEs continued to tighten monetary policy during the intermeeting period, and financial stress in some of these economies appears to have become less acute in recent weeks.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Real GDP growth in the AFEs remained near a 2 percent pace in the fourth 
quarter of 2013.  Economic activity expanded for the third consecutive quarter in the euro area, and growth was particularly solid in Canada and the United Kingdom.  In contrast, the pace of activity in Japan failed to pick up from its modest third -quarter rate.  We see 
AFE growth continuing at about 2 percent in the first quarter, before dipping to 1¾ percent in the second quarter as Japanese out put contracts in response to a 
consumption tax hike.  Thereafter, as the Japanese economy resumes growth and the recovery in the euro area continues to firm, AFE growth moves back up, averaging 2¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, somewhat above our estimate of potential growth.  Relative to the January Tealbook, our outlook for the AFEs is down a touch, largely reflecting the markdowns to U.S. and EME growth.  
Recent data suggest that quarterly inflation in the AFEs will pick up to 1¼ perc ent 
in the first quarter from 0.7 percent at the end of 2013.  With output gaps projected to narrow and inflation expectations relatively well anchored, AFE inflation should rise to 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, still a bit below the 2 perc ent targets in most 
of these economies.  Given our outlook of moderate growth and subdued inflation, we expect monetary policy in the major AFEs to remain highly accommodative through 2016.  That said, we do have policy rates moving up in all of the major advanced economies by the end of 2016 as slack is substantially eroded. 
Japan 
Japanese real GDP rose just 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, 3 percentage points 
less than estimated in the previous Tealbook.  Much of the surprise reflected a large negative contribution from the external sector, as imports rose sharply, while export growth was muted.  In addition, household spending picked up less than we had thought 
given our expectation that purchases will be pulled forward ahead of April’s consumption 
tax hike.  Our sense is that the fourth-quarter weakness will prove transitory, as a surge in

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

industrial production in January, as well as relatively strong car registrations and elevated 
PMI readings through February, point to a substantial strengthening of a ctivity.  Despite 
the recent weakness of exports, we continue to expect that last year’s large yen 
depreciation will provide a noticeable boost to external demand this year.  Accordingly, we project that real GDP will expand 4¼ percent in the first quarter  before contracting 
3¾ percent in the next as the consumption tax rate jumps from 5 percent to 8 percent.  Thereafter, growth should rebound to a 2 percent pace in the second half of the year, 
partly boosted by fiscal stimulus measures, and average 1¼ percent over the remainder of 
the forecast period. 
Quarterly inflation was 2 percent (annual rate) at the end of 2013 but should fall 
back to 1 percent in the current quarter, as energy and food prices stabilize after being elevated by the pass -through of previous yen depreciation.  Excluding the direct effect of 
two planned tax hikes, we see inflation remaining near 1 percent in 2014 and then rising to 1¾ percent by late 2016 as additional monetary easing promotes a further narrowing of the output gap and an increase in inflation expectations.  Indeed, we continue to assume that the Bank of Japan will extend and expand its asset purchase program next quarter as it aims to raise inflation to 2 percent.  
Euro Area 
Euro -area GDP expanded 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, with activity 
strengthening in both core and peripheral economies.  Recent data, including a pickup in 
retail sales in January, and further gains in the composite PMI and economic sentiment 
through February, suggest that the pace of expansion is firming.  In addition, bank lending standards for mortgages in the fourth quarter eased for the first time since 2007.  All told, we revised up slightly our projection for euro- area growth in the near term.  We 
now think that GDP growth will average 1¼ percent in the first half of this year before rising to 2 percent in 2016.  This projection reflects a gradual pickup in domestic demand as fiscal consolidation diminishes, financial and credit conditions normalize, and 
monetary policy remains accommodative.  I t also assumes that European authorities will 
make continued progress with fiscal and structural reforms, including the review of the 
banking system and establishment of a single European supervisor.  
Data through February suggest that inflation will rise to a ¾ percent annual rate 
this quarter from 0.1 percent in the previous quarter, as a further decline in retail energy prices is more than offset by a firming of core prices.  The recovery in output and

stabilization of energy prices should gradually push inflation to 1½ percent by the end of 
2016.  Amid signs of improvement in inflation and activity, the European Central Bank 
(ECB) left its benchmark policy rate at 0.25 percent in March, reiterating its readiness to act if conditions deteriorated.  We continue to expect the ECB to raise its main policy rate in the first half of 2016.  
United Kingdom 
The final release of national accounts data confirmed that the U.K. economy 
expanded at an annual rate of near ly 3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, similar to 
the average pace for the first three quarters and up sharply from a stagnant 2012.  Last year’s acceleration in growth was accompanied by a surprisingly strong performance of 
the labor market, with the unemployment rate falling from 7 .8 percent in mid -2013 to 
7.2 percent in the fourth quarter.  In addition, investment picked up noticeably during the 
course of 2013.  Given the momentum in investment, and taking into account robust 
PMIs in recent months, we believe output growth will remain at a so lid 3 percent in 2014 
before easing back to 2½ percent in 2015 and 2016.  
Consumer prices fell slightly in January, leading us to lower our forecast of 
current -quarter inflation to 1¼ percent.  Thereafter, with the output gap projected to 
close, inflation should gradually pick up to nearly 2 percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  On February 12, the Bank of England updated its guidance on monetary  
policy following a decline in the unemployment rate to near its previously announced 
threshold of 7 percent , as discussed in the box “The Bank of England’s Next Phase of  
Forward Guidance.”  The guidance was consistent with our prior expectation of a rate 
hike in early 2015, followed by gradual increases thereafter .  
Canada 
Canadian real GDP rose 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, ¾ percentage point 
more than estimated in the January Tealbook, driven by solid gains in consumption and exports.  However , data through February show that employment growth slowed sharply 
and that the  manufacturing PMI fell we ll below its fourth -quarter level.  We judge that 
these readings owe their weakness largely to severe winter weather in Canada and lower 
growth in the United States , and we have first -quarter growth slowing  to 1¾  percent, 
¾ percentage point less  than in the January Tealbook.  Looking ahead, we expect  real 
GDP growth to  bounce back to 3 percent in the second quarter, before  settling  near  
2½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period .  This outlook is down a touch since

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
March 12, 2014
Page 38 of 96
Authorized for Public Release
   
the previous Tealbook, reflecting a downbeat annual survey of Canadian investment 
intentions and the more moderate path for U.S. growth. 
In January, core inflation firmed and headline inflation rose to 1.5 percent on a 
12-month basis, from 1.3 percent in December.  Accounting for recent currency 
depreciation and higher projected energy prices, we now expect consumer prices to rise at 
an ann ual rate of 2 percent in the first half of this year, up from 0.5 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2013.  Inflation should then moderate to 1½ percent in the second half of 2014 
before slowly edging back up to 2 percent by late 2016 as the output gap is el iminated.  
Against the backdrop of slightly slower growth and still- moderate inflation, we expect 
the Bank of Canada to keep its policy rate at 1 percent until the third quarter of 2015, one quarter longer than in the previous Tealbook. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
Real GDP growth in the EMEs slowed to an annual rate of 3½ percent in the 
fourth quarter from 4¼ percent the previous quarter, as a surprising step-down in Mexico’s growth and moderating activity in China more than offset a step- up in Brazil 
and much of emerging Asia.  Recent indicators suggest that EME growth will remain at a 
3½ percent pace in the current quarter before strengthening to a near -trend pace of 
4½ percent by next year.  This pickup is concentrated in Latin America. In particular, we 
expect the Mexican economy, which has a large weight in U.S. trade, to exit its recent 
soft patch and be boosted by the implementation of structural reforms.   
Relative to the January Tealbook, we have marked down our forecast for the 
EMEs.  This downshift is particularly evident in China, where we see a sharper reining -in 
of credit than previously anticipated, and in Brazil, where elevated inflation in the face of 
unaddressed structural problems will weigh on activity. 
 Taking a longer view, we see EME growth settling at a pace that, at 4½ percent, 
is considerably below that observed in the several years prior to the global financial crisis.  The slowdown is greater in emerging Asia, particularly China, where the aging of the population and the lessening of opportunities for technological catch- up as these 
economies mature should lower potential growth.  Our path for economic activity in the EMEs is also predicated on the assumption that monetary policy normalization in the 
advanced economies does not severely disrupt financial or economic conditions in the 
EMEs.  Under this assumption, the situation improves for vulnerable EMEs and the

 The Bank of England’s Next Phase of Forward Guidance  
Following a much more rapid drop in the unemployment rate than was anticipated when the 
Bank of England (BOE) introduced its forward guidance last August, the BOE’s Monetary Policy 
Committee (MPC) provided new guidance in  February on how it will set monetary policy once 
the unemployment rate has crossed the policy threshold.    The BOE’s August announcement of forward guidance focused on reassuring  the public that  it 
would not consider raising its policy rate at least until the unemployment rate fell below a 
threshold of 7  percent  or one of three “knockouts” materialized.  The knockouts were stated 
as:  (1) the MPC projects CPI inflation 18 to 24 months ahead to be 0.5 percentage point or more 
above the 2  percent target, (2) “medium -term inflation expectations no longer remain 
sufficiently well anchored,” and  (3) “ The Financial Policy Committee judges that the stance of 
monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability . . .”   At the time of the August 
announcement, the MPC projected that the unemployment rate (shown in the upper- left figure 
on the following page) would remain above th e threshold until late 2016.  Since then , however, 
U.K. employment has grown rapidly  and the unemployment rate has fallen surprisingly quickly  
to 7.2 percent  by De cember.   
 The BOE’s new guidance, published in its February Inflation Report, provides little concrete 
information about the likely timing of liftoff of the policy rate, aside from the assertion that  the 
MPC  sees further scope to reduce spare capacity before raising the Bank R ate from its present 
level of 0 .5 percent.  Instead, the guidance aims to inform the public about the factors likely to 
be most influential in determining the pace at which policy accommodation is removed over the next couple of years as well as the factors likely to affect policy in the medium  run after inflation 
and resource gaps have closed.   
 
More specifically, there are four key facets of the new guidance.  First, it ties policy rat e 
adjustment not only to keeping inflation near the BOE’s 2 percent target but also to “avoiding 
wasteful spare capacity” in the U.K. economy.  At the moment, the MPC judges that spare capacity is equivalent to 1  to 1½ percent of GDP  and is concentrated in  the labor market.  This 
estimate reflects the gap between the unemployment rate and its estimated medium -term 
equilibrium rate of 6 to 6½ percent as well as the shortfall of average hours worked relative to employees’ desired hours (illustrated in the upp er-right figure by the rise in those working part 
time because they could not find a full- time job).  
 Second, as t he new  guidance does not contain a threshold once the unemployment rate falls 
below 7  percent , the inflation and financial stability knockouts  will not continue.  The inflation 
knockouts will be replaced by the normal discussion of the inflation forecast , and t he financial 
stability knockout will be replaced by a statement that monetary policy is a last line of defense 
in mitigating financial st ability risks, suggesting a clear division of labor between monetary 
policy and macroprudential policy.  
 Third , the MPC projects that the eventual increase in its  policy rate will be gradual, based on its 
assessment that the recovery will continue to be restrained by several headwinds, including restrictive fiscal policy, elevated interest rate spreads, and subdued global demand.  Moreover, the MPC thinks that productivity growth, which plunged during the recession and has 
disappointed during the recovery, will gradually increase.  In the MPC’s view, faster productivity 
growth would slow employment growth, allowing  output to expand briskly while limiting wage

 and price pressures  (shown in the lower- left figure) .  (Given the U.K.’s strong job growth in 
recent  months, this part of the MPC’s outlook seems especially subject to risks.)  Finally, 
inflation is expected to remain at, or a little below, target in the next three years.  
 
Fourth, the MPC indicated that, even when the economy will be operating at normal levels of 
capacity with inflation close to target,  its policy rate in the medium term likely will be materially 
lower than its pre- crisis average of 5 percent, reflecting the persistent economic headwinds 
listed above.  The MPC signaled that the lower rate in the medium term is also consistent with 
the global downward trend in real interest rates that  started before the financial crisis.  
Governor Carney suggested that one possible path of the Bank Rate is that implied by market expectations, which puts  the Bank Rate at the end of 2016 at around 2 percent.  
 Market reaction to the new  guidance was quite muted, with little change to policy expectations 
(shown in the lower- right figure).  In our view, the new  guidance is likely to play a constructive 
role in reassuring markets that liftoff  is probably a ways off and that future rate increases likely 
will be gradual.  Moreover, we find it useful that the guidance is linked to the degree of overall 
spare capacity in the U.K. economy, which the B OE has attempted to measure and forecast.  
However, the new guidance does not communicate how the MPC would respond to shocks, beyond noting that the Bank Rate would rise more slowly if the recovery falters or more quickly  
if inflation picks up.  Thus, it remains to be seen whether this guidance will prove to be useful in shaping future market expectations as the recovery progresses.

malaise recently seen in Latin America gradually lifts.  However, as discussed earlier, we 
continue to view a broad EME financial crisis as a notable downside risk to the outlook.   
We estimate that quarterly inflation in the EMEs fell to 2¾ percent in the current 
quarter, primarily reflecting a dip in Asian inflation.  We expect EME inflation to rise 
again as a rebound of inflation in emerging Asia more than offsets a moderation in Latin 
America.  Central banks in Argentina, Brazil, India, South Africa, and Turkey tightened 
policy during the intermeeting period to contain inflation and support their currencies, while those in Chile, Israel, and Thailand cut rates, citing growth concerns. 
China  
Chinese economic indicators are difficult to interpret this time of year due to the 
irregular timing of the Chinese New Year holiday but, on balance, appear consistent with moderation from the robust pace of growth in the second half of last year.  Of note, the official PMI moved down in January and February and currently stands at around 50, a level we judge to be consistent with growth of 7 to 8 percent.  Although credit growth 
remains relatively strong, our sense is that rising interest rates, amid a steady rollout of 
new regulations aimed at reining in the shadow banking sector, will curb  investment 
more than we previously anticipated.  As a result , we now expect growth to fall to 
7¼ percent this year —½ percentage point below what we wrote down in the January 
Tealbook—from 7½ percent last year.  We expect growth to remain a little above 
7 percent in 2015 and 2016.  Although we see a risk that the combination of slowing 
growth and tightenin g credit could trigger a financial crisis, we do not view this scenario 
as very likely.  
We estimate that consumer price inflation fell to 1 percent at an annual rate in the 
current quarter, reflecting both a decline in pork prices and a pronounced easing of core 
inflation .  Inflation should rise to 3¼ percent next quarter as some of the decline in pork 
prices is reversed and core inflation firms, before stabilizing at about 3 percent for the 
remainder of the forecast period.   
As noted in the Financial Developments section, Chinese authorities engineered a 
notable 1½ percent depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar during the 
intermeeting period , likely in order to flush out speculative positions betting on continued 
appreciation of the currency.  At this point, we do not believe this move is the start of a

sustained depreciation to support growth, as this would undermine the authorities’ stated 
intention to liberalize the exchange rate and rebalance the economy . 
Other Emerging Asia 
Growth in the other emerging Asian economies picked up to a brisk 5¼ percent 
annual pace in the fourth quarter, nearly a percentage point stronger than we were 
expecting.  Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Taiwan all registered very strong growth of 6 per cent or more.  The region’s growth was boosted by a pickup 
in exports at the end of last year, reflecting in part strong shipments of high- tech 
products.  However, available indicators for the current quarter, including PMIs, industrial production, and exports, suggest that growth slowed from the above- trend pace 
of the fourth quarter.  We expect growth to dip to 3¾ percent this quarter, before rising gradually to 4½ percent by early next year.   
We estimate that consumer price inflation fell to an annual r ate of 2½ percent in 
the current quarter from higher- than-usual rates in the previous several quarters.  This dip 
was largely driven by a sharp decline in food price inflation in India.  We expect inflation to rise again going forward, stabilizing at about 3½ percent by the end of this year. 
Latin America 
Mexico’s economy stalled unexpectedly in the fourth quarter, with real GDP 
growing at just ¾ percent, as auto plants closed for retooling and consumer confidence fell.  A subsequent bounceback in auto production in the first two months of the year provides comfort that some of the fourth-quarter weakness was transitory.  However, the significant downward revision in the outlook for U.S. manufacturing production led us to mark down our forecast for Mexican growth in the first half of this year.  We now see 
growth rising to only 2½ percent in the current quarter, before picking up to 3½ percent 
by the end of the year as U.S. manufacturing output firms.   
We estimate that consumer price inflation in Mexico spik ed to 5½ percent in the 
current quarter, on the back of hikes in VAT rates and administered prices for gasoline 
and public transport.  The effects of these increases should be temporary, and we expect 
inflation to decline to about 3½ percent by the second half of this year, within the central bank’s target band of 2 to 4 percent.  
After contracting in the third quarter, Brazil’s real GDP grew at a stronger -than-
expected 2¾ percent rate in the fourth quarter.  However, recent weakness in industrial

production, exports, PMI, and consumer confidence caused us to revise down growth in 
the current quarter by 2 percentage points to a mere ½  percent.  We have also grown 
gloomier about Brazil’s economic prospects as fiscal and monetary tightening, as well as 
slower g rowth in key trading partners, including China, Argentina, and Venezuela, are 
expected to weigh on growth.  Our downward revision also reflects a reassessment of Brazil’s potential growth in light of continued elevated inflation despite weak activity.  We now see growth picking up to about 2½ percent by the end of this year and edging up 
only slightly thereafter.  Beyond the current quarter, our outlook is about ¾ percentage 
point lower throughout the forecast period than in the January Tealbook. 
Inflation continues to hover around 6 percent in Brazil, a reflection of tight labor 
market conditions, pass-through from the depreciation of the real in recent months, and persistently high inflation expectations.  Citing concerns over inflationary pressures, 
Brazi l’s central bank raised its main policy rate a further 25 basis points in February, 
bringing the cumulative increase during the current tightening cycle to 350 basis points.  
We expect inflation to fall gradually as this tightening takes effect, reaching  about 
5½ percent by the end of this year.  Inflation has risen sharply elsewhere in South America, notably in Argentina and Venezuela, whose currencies have depreciated sharply.  In February, Argentina, which has long been suspected of underreporting 
inflation, introduced a long- awaited new consumer price index.   The index showed a 
3.7 percent increase (not at an annual rate) in January, consistent with private estimates.  
Other Emerging Market Economies 
Ukraine is on the verge of economic collapse.  During the intermeeting period, 
pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovich was ousted after months of political protests.  
Accelerating capital outflows as the political crisis deepened forced Ukrainian authorities 
to abandon the currency peg and expand capital controls.  Russia’s subsequent decision to deploy armed soldiers to Crimea led to a sharp escalation in geopolitical tensions with brief but unsettling reverberations throughout global financial markets.   
Although markets rebounded, the risk of further turmoil remains significant, 
especially given the lack of a clear way forward.  The United States has responded by imposing sanctions on certain Russian individuals linked with the invasion of Crimea.  It remains uncertain how Europe, which depends heavily on Rus sia for its oil and gas, will 
respond.  Ukraine’s transitional government is now in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Western governments to secure external financing, although

negotiations are expected to be challenging given the unstab le political situation and 
Ukraine’s checkered history with IMF adjustment programs.  Should the crisis intensify, 
and especially if geopolitical tensions flare up again, there could be significant effects on world commodity and financial markets and, at a n extreme, adverse consequences for the 
global economic outlook.

Financial Developments  
Market participants appeared to discount the generally weaker -than-expected 
U.S. economic data released over the intermeeting period in light of the possible 
temporary effects of unusually cold weather.  In addition, investors appeared to become 
broadly more willing to take riskier positions, likely due in part to an easing of concerns about financial stresses in the emerging market economies (EMEs) early in the intermeeting period.   On balance, the path of the federal funds rate was little changed, as 
were longer -term Treasury yield s; however, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads 
narrowed —particularly for speculative- grade issues —and the dollar depreciated  slightly . 
• FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were about in line  
with market expectations .  The Open Market Desk’s March Survey of 
Primary Dealers suggests that most dealers expect the Committee to change its  forward -guidance language at the upcoming meeting , with 
many anticipating a shift toward  qualitative guidance .  
• Credit flows to nonfinancial corporations remained robust.  F inancing 
conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets continued  to improve 
gradually .    
• Cred it conditions in r esidential mortgage markets remained tight, even as 
further incremental signs  of easing  emerged .  Access to credit card s 
continued to be tight for borrowers with low credit scores, while auto and student loans stay ed widely available. 
• Asset price movements in foreign financial markets were broadly similar 
to those in the United S tates.  Global financial market volatility increased 
only temporarily with the turmoil in Ukraine.  Notably, the Bank of 
England updated  its forward guidance, s tating that there remains scope to 
absorb spare capacity further before raising its policy rate.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS  AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Market reactions to FOMC communications were muted over the intermeeting 
period.  The January FOMC decision and stateme nt were largely anticipated  by market 
participants .  The  Monetary P olicy R eport  and Chair Yellen’s congressional testimon y 
were viewed as emphasizing continuity in the approach to monetary policy, solidifying 
expectations that  the pace of the FOMC’s asset purchases would be reduced by a further 
$10 billion at each upcoming meeting absent  a material  change in the economic outlook.  
Following the release of the January FOMC minutes on February 19, market commentary 
noted that mee ting participants seemed to attribute the soft economic data , at least in part , 
to adverse winter  weather.  
Policy expectations moved little, on net, over the intermeeting period.  The path 
of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes was little changed , and t he 
Desk’s  March Survey of Primary Dealers indicates that dealers’ expectations about 
monetary policy—including the projected path of the federal funds rate and SOMA holdings—have held steady since January.
1  However, most dealers now expect the 
Committee to modify its  forward rate guidance at the March meeting , and dealers appear 
to see substantial odds that the  threshold- based guidance will be de -emphasized or 
dropped and replaced with qualitative guidance.  
Treasury yields  were little changed , on net, over the intermeeting period, as 
waning flight -to-quality demands  early in the period a ppeared to  offset generally  weaker -
than-expected economic data releases .  Investors reportedly attributed the softer data, to 
some extent , to adverse weather  conditions.  On net , 5-year Treasury yields edged up 
4 basis points since the January FOMC meeting,  10-year Treasury yields were 
unchanged, a gency MBS yields ticked  up 4 basis points, and option-adjusted spreads on 
production-coupon MBS we re about  unchanged.  TIPS -based measures of inflation 
compensation were also little changed . 
                                                 
1 According to the results from the Desk’s pilot survey of market participants, which was  
conducted for the second time in March with a modestly expanded panel of respondents, expectations of 
active investors are broadly in line with those of the primary dealers.

  TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Since the January FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department auctioned 
$230 billion of nominal fixed -rate coupon securities and $9 billion of TIPS.  In addition, 
the Treasury’s first -ever auction of a floating- rate note (FRN) on January 29 was well  
received,  as was the subsequent reopening, with a broad set of investors (including 
foreign central banks, hedge funds, and corporate cash managers ) reportedly participating  
in the auctions.  In total, the Treasury has  issued $28 billion of two- year FRNs.   The 
February Quarterly Refunding Statement noted that the Treasury expects to auction 
additional FRNs quarterly ( each with two monthly reopenings).  
Federal Reserve purchase operations did not appear to have any material adverse 
effect on  the functioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets.2  As in the fourth quarter 
of 2013, the size of SOMA settlements roughly equaled  the gross issuance of agency 
MBS in January and February.  D ollar-roll-implied financing rates for production-coupon 
MBS moved lower, although they remained in recent ranges.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS   
Conditions in unsecured short- term dollar fu nding markets remained stable over 
the intermeeting period .3  In mid -February, the Congress passed legislation suspending 
the debt ceiling  until March 2015.  In response to news of the pending legislation , yields 
on Treasury bills maturing between late February and mid -March  of this year —those that 
could have been affected by delayed payments if a debt ceiling agreement had not been reached —declin ed to more typical levels . 
Market participants continued to focus on the Federal Reserve’s fixed -rate 
overnight reverse  repurchase agreement (ON RRP) exercise.  Four separate changes to 
the operations were announced over the period:  The bid limit was raised from $3 billion to $5 billion, the fixed rate was raised from 3 basis points to 4 basis points, the bid limit was increased  again to $7 billion, and the fixed rate was increased again to 5 basis 
points.  The second fixed -rate increase appeared to boost market repurchase rates for a 
                                                 
2 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $ 53 billion of Treasury secur ities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program and $66 billion of agency MBS under the flow -based MBS 
program and the reinvestment program.   The Desk conducted $2 billion of dollar rolls.   
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 7 basis points ov er the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

  time, both at overnight and term maturities.   Early in the period, m arket repurchase rates 
were low and even dipped below the fixed rate, prompting high tak e-up in the 
operations.  Later on, repurchase rates moved higher, apparently in response to a rise in 
Treasury bill issuance, and operation volumes moderated.  
Responses to the March 2014 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer 
Financing Terms suggested little change over the past three months both in conditions in securities financing and OTC derivatives markets and in credit terms applicable to most classes of counterparties covered by the survey.  However, nearly one- half of the dealers 
surveyed reported an increase in demand for funding of non- agency RMBS.  Also of note 
was the result that  roughly two- fifths of the dealers indicated some decline over the past 
three months in the use of financial leverage at  trading real estate investment trusts . 
EQUITY VALUATIONS AND BOND SPREADS  
Broad stock  price indexes  ended the intermeeting period up about 4 percent, 
despite generally weaker -than-expected economic data.  Investors attributed the 
weakness , to some extent, to  the temporary effects of unusually harsh winter weather.  
Share prices also appeared to be boosted by a solid finish to the corporate earnings 
season, as well as by a broad increase in investor s’ willingness to take riskier positions, 
likely reflecting, in part, an easing of concerns about EMEs early in the period.4  The 
VIX, an index of option- implied volatility for one -month returns on the S&P 500 index, 
returned to very low levels after reaching a 52 -week high around the time of the January 
FOMC meeting, when concerns about EMEs peaked.   Investment- and speculative- grade 
corporate bond spreads spiked in early February but narrowed , on net, over the period, 
with speculative -grade spreads declining to near the bottom of their range over the past 
decade.  
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
The pace of business financing in credit and equity markets continued to be fairly  
strong, on balance, over the f irst two months of the year.  Following a slowdown in 
January, nonfinancial corporate bond issuance rebounded in February , with the majority 
                                                 
4 The stock price gains over the current intermeeting period followed a 3 percent decline in share 
prices between the January Tealbook publication date and the January FOMC meeting, as concerns about 
EMEs increased markedly.

  of proceeds going to investment- grade firms .  In addition, the growth of C&I loans on 
banks’  balance sheets remain ed solid  in January and surged in February .  Institutional 
issuance of leveraged loans has continued to be quite brisk  this year ; strong inflows into 
the asset class by retail and institutional investors have contributed to a further easing of 
lending standards and terms , which, in turn, has spurred  additional refinancing 
activity .  Secondary -market  equity offerings by nonfinancial companies also remained 
robust, but the volume of IPOs was seasonally sluggish .  
While Call Report data suggest tha t banks still have not appreciably  increased 
their lending to small businesses —even as credit supply to established small businesses 
has reportedly eased —preliminary analysis of PayNet data suggests that credit flows 
from nonbank lenders may have increased (see the box “Small Business Financing 
Conditions”). 
Demand for credit by nonfinancial corporations was likely boosted by merger and 
acquisition activity , which increased further in the final quarter of 2013.  The pace of new 
deals was particularly notable for technology and health- care firms .  The recent volume 
of announced and pending deals suggests another step-up in merger acti vity in coming 
months. 
Financing conditions in CRE markets continued to improve gradually.  CRE loans 
on banks’ books increased at a solid pace over the first two months of the year, and, according to the most recent Call Report data, the fourth- quarter increases in banks’ CRE 
loans were widespread across all major categories, including construction and land development loans.  After a slow start in January, CMBS issuance was robust in 
February .  Underwriting standards for commercial mortgages have reportedly continued 
to ease somewhat as competition among lenders has intensified, although banks’ lending standards do not appear to be nearly as loose as those prevail ing in 2006 and 2007. 
Conditions in the municipal bond market remained favorable over the 
intermeeting period .  Municipal bond yield ratios  and the MCDX, an index of CDS  for a 
broad portfolio of municipal bonds, changed relatively little .  That said, t he City of 
Detroit proposed a bankruptcy plan that offers much lower recovery rates for its bondholders than would be suggested by historical benchmarks.  Moreover, Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings downgraded Puerto Rico’s g eneral 
obligation (GO) bonds from investment grade to speculative grade  over the 
period.  However, the prices of Puerto Rico GO bonds held steady through these events,

 Small Business Financing Conditions  
After declining sharply in the wake of the financial crisis, commercial lending by domestic banks 
began to rebound in late 2010.  However, the recovery has not been uniform.  According to Call 
Report data, outstanding  large loans to businesses  (a rough proxy for loans to large businesses) 
have grown rapidly since late 2010, while outstanding  small loans to businesses  (a rough proxy 
for loans to small businesses) continued to decline into 2013 and have remained essentially flat 
since then (figure 1).  
This s tagnation in outstanding small loans is a bit puzzling in light of improving credit supply 
conditions for small businesses.  Beginning in mid -2007, respondents to the Federal Reserve 
Board’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported a sustained period of tightening of standards and terms on loans to small businesses.  However, since mid -
2010, banks have generally been reporting a net easing of standards and terms to such firms.  Similarly, small business borrowers reported substantial difficulty obtaining credit during and immediately following the financial crisis, but they have been reporting gradually improving 
access to credit since 2011.  The most recent data from the National Federation of Independent 
Business (NFIB) monthly  member polls indicate that, among firms applying for credit, the 
fraction reporting that their credit needs were satisfied has returned to near pre- crisis levels.  In 
addition, in the January 2014 Wells Fargo Small Business Index (WFSBI) survey, the fract ion of 
respondents reporting that credit was very difficult or somewhat  difficult to obtain in the past 
12 months declined to levels not seen since early  2009 , though it remained elevated relative to 
pre- crisis norms.  
At least part of the explanation  for the low levels of outstanding small loans seems to be 
lackluster demand  by small businesses for new loans.  Only 13 percent of the respondents to the 
January 2014 WFSBI  survey reported that they intended to apply for a new credit product in t he 
next 1 2 months —a share that is essentially unchanged from the previous seven  quarters.  
Among NFIB members, 5 3 percent of respondents  to the February  2014 member poll explicitly 
stated that they were not interested in a loan, suggesting that the share of firms with 
 
Financial Developments

 borrowing needs is well below historical averages.  Weak loan demand from small businesses 
likely reflects, at least in part, their reluctance to expand.  The share of respondents to the 
NFIB’s member poll who view  the next three months as a good time for expansion has  
fluctuated between 5 and 10  percent  since early 2008—a level that is quite low by historical 
standards .   
To gain additional insights into small business es’ access to credit, the Board recently acquired  
more- detailed quarterly data on small business lending from PayNet, a consortium of 
commercial banks, credit unions, captive and noncaptive finance companies, and alternative 
lenders that collects loan -level information on commercial loans and leases from individual 
lenders to small businesses.  PayNet analyzes the data and constructs the Thomson 
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index (SBLI), which aims to track originations of new loans to small businesses.  The index is based on the monthly dollar- weighted percentage 
change in loan originations to small businesses.  The SBLI suggests that loan originations to 
small businesses by lenders of all types have been trending upward since mid -2009 (figure 2).  
At this point, we cannot determine the extent to which the differences in trends between the 
Call Report data and the PayNet data reflect the fact that PayNet measures  loan originations  
while Call Report s measure outstanding loan balances , the fact that the two data sources 
capture the activities of different groups of lenders  and credit products , or something else.  The 
Call Report data are limited to the universe of  U.S. banks .  About 50 percent of loan dollars 
originated in the PayNet  data  are attributed to a subset of participating U.S. banks, about 
30 percent to a number of captive finance companies, and the remaining 20 percent  to some 
noncaptive finance companies, credit unions, and alternative lenders.  The lenders  that do not 
report to PayNet may be  having very different experiences in terms of loan originations to small 
businesses than those that do report.   
To the extent that the increased originations  may be driven in part by alternative lenders, one 
should be cautious about interpreting them too  positively.  Alternative lenders generally make 
small, short -term loans at high  interest  rates, typically with annual percent age rates  greater 
than 30 percent.

  albeit at substantially depressed levels, as the rating changes were largely anticipated.   On 
March 11, 2014, Puerto Rico successfully brought to market a $3.5 billion GO bond 
issue , substantially easing near -term liquidity pressures.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Financing conditions in mortgage markets have remained tight, particularly for 
borrowers with low credit scores.  However, a few signs that mortgage markets may have begun to ease emerged over the intermeeting period.   In particular, the lower end of the 
distribution of credit scores for GSE- backed purchase mortgages shifted down slightly in 
December.   In addition, a major residential mortgage  lender  announced plans to decrease 
its minimum required credit scores on mortgages eligible to be guaranteed by the FHA .  
House prices rose notably further in January, and mortgage interest rates and their 
spreads to Treasury yields were little changed over the intermeeting period.   Applications 
for both purchase mortgages and refinancings stay ed at low levels through e arly March .  
Conditions in consumer credit markets have remain ed mixed.   Credit bureau data 
through the fourth quarter indicate that auto loans continued to be broadly available, 
including to consumers with subprime credit histories.  Meanwhile, credit car d limits for 
borrowers with subprime and prime credit scores—a proxy for supply—remained at very low levels through the fourth quarter.  Partly reflecting the se supply conditions , credit 
card balances  stayed nearly flat , on net, through January, while auto and student loans 
continued  to gr ow briskly.  Consumer loans on banks’ books posted only modest gains in 
February, likely owing to  a weather -related moderation in auto loan growth.  Issuance of 
auto and credit card ABS continued to be robust in January and February , including 
significant issuance of paper backed by subprime auto loans.        
BANK ING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY   
On net, s tock prices for large bank  holding companies (BHCs) increased about in 
line with the broad equity market over the intermeeting period, while CDS spreads for 
such firms remained low .  The profitability of BHCs increased in the fourth quarter of 
2013, supported by further declines in loan loss provisions and a reduction in litigation 
expenses , even as BHCs generally con tinued to report compressed net interest margins, 
weak mortgage revenues, and relatively subdued trading income.  Loan performance improved further across most loan types , and banks’ loan loss reserves relative to net 
charge -offs increased .

  M2 grew briskly, on average, over January and February, owing mainly to gains 
in liquid deposits.  T he monetary base expanded at a slower rate, on average, than in 
2013, as the rate of increase in reserve balances was constrained by the reduced pace of  
asset purchases and the larger sizes of operations in the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP  
exercise.5

Financial market sentiment abroad appeared to improve over the period.  In 
particular, financial stresses in the EMEs, which reached a peak i n the days just prior to 
the January FOMC meeting, appear to have eased, as central banks in some of the most 
vulnerable economies raised policy rates.   
Although global markets fell abruptly on March 3, following the deepening of the 
political crisis in U kraine, most markets quickly retraced these losses.  Both the Russian 
ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia depreciated over the period, and local- currency 
sovereign bond yields rose about 70 basis points and 140 basis points in Russia and Ukraine, respectively.    
The currencies of most EMEs recovered notably with respect to the dollar as 
stresses eased early in the intermeeting period.  Local -currency sovereign bond yields 
declined in most emerging markets , and EMBI spreads narrowed.  In addition, stock 
markets in many EMEs retraced the losses experienced in late January , and the pace of 
outflows from EME-dedicated mutual funds slowed. 
Over the intermeeting period, consistent with improvement in financial market 
sentiment, the currencies of most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) appreciated against the dollar as flight- to-safety flows reversed .  Headline equity indexes in the AFEs 
also increased substantially.  Long-term sovereign bond yields and market- based 
measures of policy expectations were little changed, on  net, over the period.  Peripheral 
euro-area interest rate spreads continued to narrow.  
                                                 
5 During the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve announced that it would conduct a series of 
four seven -day TDF operations in March; on average over the first two operations, tenders totaled 
$14.4  billion , with 28 particip ants.  The last operation in this series will employ a floating -rate format, with 
the rate set equal to the sum of the interest rate paid on excess reserves and a fixed spread of 1 basis point, 
resulting in an effective  rate of 26 basis points.

  The Bank of England updated its forward guidance in February, stating that, even 
with the unemployment rate near its 7  percent threshold, there remains scope to absorb  
spare capacity further before raising its policy rate.   The Bank also stated that future rate 
increases are likely to be gradual and that the eventual level of rates is likely to be below 
the 5  percent pre- crisis average (see the box “The Bank of England’s Next Phase of 
Forward Guidance” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).  Market -based measures of expected policy rates moved up slightly on the release.  The 
Bank of Japan (BOJ) renewed and expanded its funding- for-lending programs, and 
market participants continue to expect the BOJ to implement further easing this year.  The European Central Bank kept its policy rate unchanged. 
The People’s Bank of China pushed the value of the Chinese renminbi down 
about 1½ percent against the dollar over the period.  Market commentary suggested that 
the depreciation may have been engineered to introduce two-way risk in the currency 
market and so reduce speculative capital inflows.  Separately, a Chinese company failed to make a scheduled interest payment on its outstanding bonds, reportedly the first corporate bond default in the People’s Republic of China since 1997.  Observers had long believed that the authorities should allow such a default in order to instill market discipline; in the event , the default did not elicit any substantive market reaction.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the extent of uncertainty around our projections for real 
GDP  growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable 
volatility .1  We see a number of risks  attending our forecast for economic activity , 
including those posed by the possibility  that the recent softer tone in spending and 
production data may signal weaker momentum in aggregate demand than we have projected, that the economy has incurred more supply- side damage since the recession 
than we have assumed,  or that economic and financial stresses in emerging market 
economies (EMEs) will intensify .  Importantly , we see neither  monetary policy  nor fiscal 
policy as being well positioned to help the economy withstand  adverse shocks .  Given 
these considerations, we continue to believe that the risks to our forecast for real GDP growth  are tilted a little  to the downside .  However,  we view the uncertainty around our 
projection for the unemployment rate  as roughly balanced , with the risk of a higher 
unemployment rate from adverse demand -side developments  largely  counter ed by the 
possibility that the  unemployment rate could continue to surprise us to the downside as it 
has in  recent years , despite the further reduction of our estimate of potential GDP growth 
in the current Tealbook.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s ongoing 
quantitative surveillance  (QS) assessment.  Overall, the vulnerabilities of the financial 
system to adverse shocks appear  to remain at moderate levels.  This perspective is 
predicated, in part, on the relatively strong capital positions of large domestic banking firms, the generally low leve rage and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the 
nonfinancial sectors, and the reduced reliance on fragile short-term wholesale funding 
                                                 
1 We have updated our estimates of the average historical forecast errors that are reported in 
table  2 of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projection s, using the experience over the 20 -year period 
from 1994 to 2013.  The root mean squared errors for the unemployment rate and CPI inflation are nearly 
unchanged from the previous estimates.  Those for real GDP growth increased because we assessed our 
forecast performance against the latest available estimates of GDP, adjusted for the effect of major 
methodological revisions, rather than the BEA’s third estimates.

  across the financial sector in recent years.2  That said, short-term funding continues to be 
an important structural vulnerability for the financial system, as do the complexity and 
interconnectedness of the largest financial institutions.  Valuations in major domestic asset markets still appear  to be broadly in line with historical norms, although equit ies in 
a few segments of the stock market , including social media and biotechnology, appear to 
have become increasingly overvalued.  In addition, investor demand for riskier corporate 
credit has continued to be very strong, contributing to rapid credit growth and more -
aggressive underwriting in the leveraged finance sector  and to the lowest levels of risk 
spreads on speculative- grade corporate bonds since 2007, albeit in the context of strong 
corporate balance sheets and cash flows.     
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Long er-run inflation 
expectations appear to  have remained stable in recent years despite  fluctuations in the 
prices of crude oil, other commodit ies, and imports more generally, as well as persistent 
margins of slack in labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as broadly balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility that the soft readings  on inflation seen since the beginning of last year could prove more 
persistent  than we expect, especially if  longer -term inf lation expectations move  down or 
if low levels of resource utilization and  subdued increases in unit labor costs persist 
longer or have larger effects than we currently project .  On the upside, an increase in 
inflation expectations, potentially relate d to concerns about the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could significant unanticipated increases in oil and other commodity prices caused by overseas developments, a stronger- than-expected 
economic recovery, or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than is assumed in the baseline.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario considers the possibility that the recent downside surprises in spending data signal weaker aggregate demand conditions than we have assumed in the ba seline.

  contrast, the second scenario  assumes that  inclement weather may ha ve masked greater 
underlying momentum in household spending than is reflected in the baseline; thus, the 
economic recovery accelerates  at a faster pace than we have projected .  In the third 
scenario , the reduction in potential output growth is eventually realized to be deeper and 
more persistent  than assumed in the baseline.  The fourth scenario considers the risk that 
the softness in consumer price inflation seen over the past y ear could prove to be more 
persistent than anticipated.   The final two scenarios consider risks to the U.S. economy 
from foreign economic developments—first, that the dollar could appreciate rather than depreciate as in the baseline, and,  second, that a dramatic increase in  financial stress  in 
EMEs could have substantial negative spillovers to the U.S. economy. 
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has li fted off from its 
zero lower bound, its movements are governed— as in the baseline forecast —by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  T he date of liftoff i n each scenario takes  into 
account the guidance provided in the Committee’s January statement  indicating  that the 
liftoff date will depend on  when the asset purchase program ends, when the 
unemployment rate threshold is crossed, and how the Committee’s outlook for inflation stands.  In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio 
follow their baseline paths.   
Weaker Household Demand 
In the baseline projection, the unanticipated slowdown in the pace of  consumer 
spending growth  over the past few months is assumed to be transitory, and  continued 
improvements in  consumer sen timent,  households’ financial conditions, and labor market 
prospects lead to  an accelerati on in household spending ; the projected resumption of the 
housing market recovery is expected to reinforce this acceleration.  By contrast, this 
scenario  assumes that  the recent downside surprises in household spending signal greater 
caution on the part of households in the face of continued uncertainty about the pace of the economic recovery and their employment prospects .  These conditions  spawn a cycle 
of restrained  household spending and residential investment that, in turn, leads to a 
slower pace of business investment and hiring .  All told,  real GDP rises at an average 
annual rate of 2 percent over the next three years, 1 percentage point lower than in the 
baseline, and the unemployment rate declines more gradually, falling to only around 6 percent in  2016.  With a wider margin of resource slack than in the baseline, i nflation 
rises somewhat more slowly .  The federal funds rate lifts of f in the first quarter  of 2017

  (seven  quart ers later than in the baseline)  and rises more gradually  thereafter , reaching  
2 percent by the end of 2018.3 
Faster Recovery 
In the staff’s view, the recent softer spending data reflect both the effects of 
adverse weather and a somewhat more subdued state of underlying demand than we had 
previously projected.  However, some outside analysts  have ascribed a considerably 
larger portion of the recent  weakness  in spending to the weather.  In this scenario, we 
assume that adverse weather conditions have been masking, to a greater extent than in the 
baseline, a more robust underlying trajectory  in private -sector demand.  Continued 
improvements in labor market conditions and gen erally positive readings on  consumer 
and business confidence may support this view .  Thus, as the weather returns to normal  
and the labor market continues to improve, the st ronger underlying momentum in 
household spending starts to show through, which in turn leads businesses to  be more 
willin g to invest, fostering  a faster, more broad ly based recovery.   Real GDP rises at an 
average annual rate of 3¾ percent over the next three years , and the unemployment rate 
falls to  5 percent by the end of 2015.  Inflation reaches its 2 percent target level by early 
2018.  The federal funds rate lifts off one quarter earlier  than in the baseline and rises 
more steeply thereafter, reaching 5¼ percent by the end of 2018. 
Supply -Side Damage 
Over  the past  three years, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1  percentage 
point per year despite only moderate increases in real GDP.  T he staff has  therefore 
marked down its estimate  of the pace of potential output growth , and in the current 
forecast , we have lowered the growth rate of potential GDP from  2011 through 2016 
somewhat further.  However, some of the models we consult suggest that the damage to aggregate supply during the past several years may have been even greater than is 
assumed in the current  baseline.  This scenario  assume s a slower pace of structural 
productivity gains such that potential output has expanded at an annual rate of only 
1¼ percent starting in  2011, ¼ percentage p oint lower than in the baseline. As a result, 
the level of potential output is currently ¾ percentage point  lower .  Thereafter, p otential 
                                                 
3 In this scenario and the following two, we assume tha t the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over 
in the quarter following the observation of an unemployment rate of 6 percent, the same as the 
unemployment rate in the baseline forecast in the quarter prior to liftoff.  The differences in inflation 
outcomes relative to the baseline through the first few years of these scenarios are not large enough to 
affect the liftoff date.

  GDP continues to grow at a 1¼ percent pace through 2018; the level of potential output is 
4½ percentage points lower at the end of 2018 than in the baseline.   
Real GDP rises at a rate of 2¾  percent this year  and next , slower than in the 
baseline projection by ¼ percentage point and ½ percentage point, respectively .  
Thereafter, the pace of economic growth gradually slows , and real GDP rises at an annual 
rate of only 1¼ percent in 2017 and 2018.  Nonetheless, t he unemployment rate continues 
to decl ine rapidly, reaching 5 percent in  the middle of 2016.  With resource slack 
substantially narrower and productivity gains smaller, inflation rises to 2 percent in early 
2016 and edges up to nearly 2½ percent in  2018.  Initially, policy makers continue to 
perceive supply-side conditions as  consistent with the staff’s  baseline view.  As evidence 
of the weaker  supply- side conditions mounts, their  perceptions gradually come in line 
with reality  and are assumed to be fully adjusted by 2016.  Given the initial 
misperception of slack and the gradual response of inflation to higher resource utilization, the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, the same quarter as in the baseline, but it thereafter rises mo re steeply as 
policymakers recognize the weaker supply -side conditions . 
Low Inflation 
In the baseline projection, the downside surprise on core inflation over the past 
year is assumed to be largely transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradual ly 
moves up toward 2 percent as the recovery continues.  This forecast is based on the 
staff’s assumption that long-run inflation expectations are firmly anchored at the 
Committee’s longer-run inflation target of 2  percent.  In this scenario, we examine the 
possibility that the extended experience of below-target inflation has led to a reduction in current long-run inflation expectations to about 1½ percent, and that continued low inflation in the coming years  lead s to further erosion in these expectations.  As a 
consequence, prices rise only 1 percent this year and inflation remains below 1  percent 
through 2018.  Persistently low inflation in this scenario causes liftoff to occur in mid -
2018, three years later than in the baseline.   At that time, the unemployment rate has 
declined to 4½ percent, ¾ percentage point below its natural rate.  However, given the

  decline in long-horizon inflation expectations, inflation projected one to two years ahead 
is still well below  the Committee’s target despite this degree of labor market tightness.4   
Stronger Dollar  
As discussed in the box “The Path of the Dollar:  Baseline and Alternatives” in 
the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section, we project that the dollar 
will depreciate gradually over the next few years.  However, it is possible that rising 
interest rates associated with a prospective withdrawal of policy accommodation in the United States and the AFEs may take investors somewhat by surprise, inducing a progressive shift into dollar- denominated asse ts and contributing to somewhat greater 
financial stresses in the EMEs.
5  In this scenario, the broad real dollar appreciates  about 
1 percent by the end of 2016—rather than depreciating  3 percent, as in the baseline—
largely because of foreign exchange risk  premium shocks.  We also assume modest 
negative shocks to confidence and credit conditions in the EMEs.  The stronger exchange value of the dollar and weaker foreign activity reduce U.S. real net exports.  All told, U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate o f about 2¾ percent, on average, in 2014 and 2015—
¼ percentage point below the baseline.  The weaker U.S. activity and lower import price 
inflation cause core inflation to run about 0.1 percentage point below baseline throughout 
the forecast horizon and induce a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate.
6   
Financial Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies  
We expect financial market stresses in the EMEs to remain generally manageable.  
However, with investors focused on both EME vulnerabilities and the prospective effects of policy normalization in advanced economies, the risk of a substantial ratcheting up of financial stress in the EMEs remains  significant .  Any number of events could trigger 
such a development, including an intensification of the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine.  In 
this scenario, we consider the effects of a financial crisis that engulfs many EMEs.  
Sovereign and private borrowing costs in these countries soar, and the confidence of their 
households and businesses weakens significantl y.  These events cause EME currencies to 
                                                 
4 The choice of liftoff date is meant to capture the Committee’s intention to maintain the current 
target for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½  percent, 
“especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”   
5 An alternative possibility for a stronger dollar path that is discussed in the bo x is that China and 
other EMEs might allow their currencies to appreciate less quickly than assumed in our baseline.  
6 In this scenario and the next, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the one used in the first 
three domestic scenarios.  One key d ifference relative to the FRB/US simulations  is that the policy rule in 
SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of 
the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

  depreciate roughly  8 percent, on average, against the dollar relative to the baseline, even 
though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates to attenuate capital outflows.  
These factors lead real GDP in t he EMEs to decline 4½ percent relative to the baseline by 
early 2015.7  
The stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to the rest of 
the world.  In the United States, corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight- to-safety flows push down term premiums on 
government bond yields.  In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  As a result, U.S. real GDP growth is around 2 percent in 2014, about 1 percentage point below baseline, and remains subdued for another year.  The unemployment rate hovers around 6½ percent through mid-2015.  With substantially greater resource slack and lower import prices, core U.S. 
PCE inflation  dips to nearly 1 percent in 2014.  Under these conditions, the federal funds 
rate remains at its effective lower bound five quarters longer than in the baseline. 
                                                 
7 In the 2013 QS background report on EME vulnerabilities, the staff considered a variant of this 
scenario in which the EME financial crisis was even deeper and more broadly based.  That alternative 
scenario assumed more adverse financial spillover effects to the United States and the AFEs and, hence, 
implied larger declines in U.S. and AFE GDP than the scenario examined here.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained
(2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.
Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
