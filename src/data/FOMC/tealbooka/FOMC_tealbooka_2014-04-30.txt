Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data on spending and production we have received since the March Tealbook 
appear consistent, on balance, with our view th at the weakness in economic activity in the 
first quarter of 2014 will prove to be transito ry.  The effects of the unusually cold and 
snowy winter weather seem to be abating, as  consumer spending and factory output have 
turned up since earlier in the year.  And while  we have lowered our estimate of real GDP 
growth in the first quarter to an annual ra te of only ¾ percent, this downward revision 
primarily reflects an unexpected decline in e xports, which we expect to be temporary.  
One lingering concern is reside ntial construction, for which the data continue to be softer 
than we had anticipated; even  for this sector, though, we see the fundamentals as being 
supportive of a higher level of ac tivity.  All told, we continue to project real GDP growth 
to step up to a 3½ percent pace in the current  quarter, unchanged from our forecast in the 
March Tealbook.   
The March employment report suggests that  labor market conditions have been 
improving about as we had anticipated in th e previous Tealbook.  Payroll gains in the 
first quarter were little di fferent than we had written down, and, while the unemployment 
rate in March was a touch higher than we had projected, the workweek and the labor 
force participation rate were  both a bit higher as well. 
The key background factors underlying the fo recast are also little revised.  
Accordingly, beyond the near term we expect  economic growth to increase at a pace 
essentially unchanged from the March Tealbook.  We project that real GDP growth will 
move up from 2½ percent in 2013 to 2¾ percent this year and a littl e above 3 percent per 
year in 2015 and 2016, reflecting the waning of some of the forces—such as restrictive 
federal fiscal policy changes—that have restrained economic growth in recent years.  
This projected pace is, on average, roughly 1 percentage point above our estimate of 
potential growth over the medium term.  As a result, the unemployment rate declines 
from around 6½ percent in the current quarter  to about 5 percent at the end of 2016, 
slightly below our estimate of its natural rate.   
Recent readings on consumer prices have  been largely as anticipated, and our 
inflation forecast over the next couple of y ears is also little changed.  As before, we 
expect core PCE inflation to increase from 1¼ percent in 2013 to 1½ percent this year, 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

then rise to 1¾ percent in 2015 and 2016—refle cting a projected pickup in core import 
price inflation this year, diminishing margins of slack in labor and product markets over 
the medium term, and stable longer-run infl ation expectations.  While we now expect 
consumer energy prices to increase somewhat faster than core prices this year, we continue to expect energy pr ices to edge down thereafter, with the result that headline 
inflation is projected to run a touc h below core inflation in 2015 and 2016. 
As always, numerous risks surround our outlook.  As in the March Tealbook, we 
view the uncertainty around our projection for real GDP growth, inflation, and the 
unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years, a period that 
includes considerable volatility.  While we still see the risks to GDP  growth as tilted a 
little to the downside, largely because neither  monetary policy nor fiscal policy appear 
well positioned to offset any future adverse shocks to the economy, we continue to see 
the risks around our outlook for the unemplo yment rate and for inflation as roughly 
balanced.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are essentially unchanged.  
We assume that asset purchases will c ontinue to slow at a relatively steady 
pace and will conclude before the end of this year, leaving the cumulative amount of purchases under the current program at close to $1.5 trillion. 
 The path of the federal funds rate is also  about unchanged.  In particular, as in 
the March Tealbook, we assume that the fede ral funds rate will lift off from its 
effective lower bound in the second quart er of 2015, two quarters after the end 
of asset purchases.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions 
of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The projected path for the 10-year Treas ury yield is modestly lower in 2014, 
reflecting a slight decline in rates sin ce March, but is thereafter projected to 
follow about the same path as in the previous Tealbook.  Our forecast 
continues to call for a significant rise in Treasury yields, primarily because of 
the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook   
   
 
 
 
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

extremely low short-term interest rates,  as well as a gradual waning of the 
effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies. 
 Spreads for investment-grade corporat e bonds and for mortgages have been 
relatively stable.  Consequently, our forecasts for corporate bond yields and 
mortgage rates in the medium term have  been revised essentially in line with 
our revisions to the path  for Treasury yields.  
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have fallen slightl y, on net, since March, undershooting our 
forecast for modest gains.  However, our view of fundamentals is unrevised, 
and we project that stock ma rket prices by the end of th is year will be at about 
the same level as in the March Tealbook.  Our trajectory implies an average 
annual growth rate of roughly 6 pe rcent over the pr ojection period. 
 Recent readings on house prices have b een somewhat above our expectations, 
leading us to revise up slightly the le vel of prices through the medium term.  
Nevertheless, we continue to expect hous e price appreciation to gradually step 
down from 11 percent in 2013 to  about 3 percent in 2016. 
Fiscal Policy 
 Our assumptions for fiscal policy ar e unrevised from the March Tealbook.  
Despite the expiration of the EUC program , we continue to expect the drag on 
economic growth from fiscal policy changes to ease this y ear as the pace of 
decline in real federal pu rchases slows and the effect of the tax increases put 
in place last year wanes.  The re straint on real GDP growth (excluding 
multiplier effects) from fiscal policy ac tions at all levels of government is 
projected to diminish from about 1 pe rcentage point in 2013 to ½ percentage 
point this year, ¼ percentage poi nt in 2015, and roughly zero in 2016.  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that the pace of real GDP growth in the foreign economies 
slackened from nearly 3 per cent at an annual rate in th e second half of 2013 to 
2¼ percent in the first qu arter, almost ½ percentage point below our March 
Tealbook forecast.  Growth slowed most markedly in emerging Asia, affected 
by Chinese authorities’ attempts to rein  in domestic credit growth and by a

reduction in exports of high-tech goods, pa rticularly to the United States.  As 
U.S. demand strengthens and policy in  China becomes more supportive, we 
expect foreign economic growth to step  back up to an average rate of 
3¼ percent over the medium term. 
 The broad nominal index for the dollar is little changed on net since the 
previous Tealbook.  Going forward, we c ontinue to expect the broad real 
dollar to depreciate at an annual rate of about 1¼ percent, with the decline 
occurring entirely against the currencies of the em erging market economies. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 The trajectory for the price of crude oil is roughly unchanged from the March 
Tealbook.  Escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine, as well as the 
prospect of disruptions to Russia’s energy exports, have put some upward 
pressure on prices, but slowing grow th in China and the prospective 
resumption of oil exports from Libya have weighed on prices.  On net, these 
developments left the spot price of Br ent crude oil up just over $1 per barrel 
since the time of the prev ious Tealbook.  We project the price of imported oil 
to average $100 per barrel in the current quarter and then to decline gradually, 
reaching $88 per barrel at the end of 2016.   
 The broad index of nonfuel commodity prices that we follow has increased about 3 percent since the previous Tealbook, in part reflecting higher 
agricultural prices.  As in the Marc h Tealbook, we expect our overall nonfuel 
commodity price index to increase only slightly further over the medium term. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We now estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of only ¾ percent in 
the first quarter, ¾ percentage point less th an we had projected in the March Tealbook.1 
We continue to estimate that adverse winter  weather held down first-quarter GDP growth 
about ¼ percentage point; howev er, there is substantial uncer tainty around that figure, 
and, indeed, some outside analysts put the effect at more than 1 percentage point.  We 
1 According to the BEA’s third estimate, real GDP rose at a 2½ percent rate in the fourth quarter, 
¼ percentage point faster than previously estimated.  The BEA will release its advance estimate of real 
GDP growth for 2014:Q1 on April 30, the second day of the FOMC meeting.

also see other factors, including the sharp decline in exports and surprisingly soft 
readings on residential construction, as tempor arily holding down the first-quarter growth 
rate.  As these influences fade, we expect r eal GDP to rise at a 3½ percent rate in the 
current quarter—unchanged from our previous projection.   
 On net, the incoming consumption data have been in line with our March 
Tealbook projection.  In particular, the strong pickup in retail sales and motor 
vehicle sales in March are consistent w ith our projection for a faster rate of 
consumer spending growth in the second quarter than in the first.   
 In contrast, the news on housing acti vity has been disappointing.  Single-
family and multifamily housing starts and existing home sales all remained muted in February and March after tu mbling in January.  In addition, new 
home sales dropped back in March.  Wh ile inclement weat her likely played 
some role in the first quarter weakness for starts and sales, the latest readings on building permit issuance—which is more forward looking than starts and tends to be less sensitive to weather—suggest that underlying activity has 
remained lackluster so far this year.  Nevertheless, we continue to expect 
housing activity to strengthen over th e next several months, supported by 
some payback of weather effects, the still-favorable affordability of housing, 
and continued jobs gains.   
 Incoming data on nonresidential private fi xed investment have been mixed:  
Although readings for nonres idential structures have  been relatively strong, 
data on orders and shipments of capital goods point to weaker-than-expected spending on business equipment over the first half of 2014.  On net, we have 
kept our projection for nonresidential pr ivate fixed investment over this period 
essentially unchanged at a modest  3½ percent rate of increase.  
 Incoming data suggest inventory investment is roughly in line with our March Tealbook projection.  Changes in inventor ies are projected to subtract about 
¼ percentage point from GDP growth in  both the first and second quarters.  
 Real federal purchases are estimated to  have risen at an annual rate of 
3¼ percent in the first quarter, refl ecting the rebound from the government 
shutdown in the fourth quarter, but then are expected to fall 2½ percent in the 
second quarter as purchases revert to their downward trend.  State and local

government purchases are projected to be  about flat, on balance, in the first 
half of this year.   
 After adding 1 percentage poi nt to real GDP growth at the end of last year, we 
estimate that net exports subtracted 1 per centage point from growth in the first 
quarter of this year.  This estimate is ¾ percentage point more negative than in 
our previous forecast, as real exports declined markedly, reversing a large part 
of the sharp increase in the fourth quarter  of last year.  In  the current quarter, 
net exports are expected to turn up sligh tly, as exports rise more in line with 
the projected pace of foreign economic growth and import growth remains subdued. 
 Following a sharp decline in January that was largely weather induced, 
manufacturing production re bounded sharply in February  and rose further in 
March.  We expect factory output to expand at a modera te pace, on balance, in 
the near term, in line with the posi tive readings on new orders from the 
national and regional manufacturing survey s.  (See the box “The Effects of the 
Energy Boom on Industrial Production”  for additional information on the 
industrial sector.) 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We project real GDP to grow 2¾ percent for 2014 as a whole and to rise a little 
more than 3 percent per year in 2015  and 2016—about unchanged from the March 
Tealbook.  
 Our projection for faster real GDP grow th over the medium term relative to 
last year—even as interest rates rise further—refl ects our expectation that 
some of the forces that have been holding back growth in recent years will recede.  In particular, the restraint from changes in fiscal policy is expected to 
wane, and we think that mortgage cred it will gradually beco me more broadly 
available.  We also expect that a growing sense among households and firms 
of diminishing downside risks to the recovery will improve confidence and 
provide additional support to consumer spending, business investment, and 
hiring.

 The small changes in our financial assu mptions have essentially no net effect 
on our real GDP projection over the medium term. 
 We have made no changes to our supp ly-side assumptions this round.  Thus, 
with the GDP forecast little changed, we  continue to project the GDP gap to 
narrow from about 3 percent current ly to zero by the middle of 2016 and 
actual GDP to be ½ percent above potential GDP by the end of that year.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
Incoming data on the labor market have  been roughly in line with our 
expectations and suggest continuing gradual improvement in labor market conditions.   
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 192,000 in March, and although this reading was 
a little weaker than we had expect ed, upward revisions to January and 
February left the level of payrolls in  March in line with our prior forecast.2 
Accordingly, we left our projection fo r total payroll gains in the current 
quarter unrevised from the March Tealbook assumption of 210,000 per month.  
 The unemployment rate held steady at 6.7 percent in March; we had expected 
it to tick down to 6.6 percent.  The pa rticipation rate, however, unexpectedly 
rose 0.2 percentage point.   
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, which summarizes the movements 
in 19 labor market indicators, moved up slightly in March.  
As in our previous projection, slack in th e labor market is an ticipated to decline 
slowly over the medium term, in line w ith the pace of overall economic growth. 
 The unemployment rate is projected  to decrease, on average, roughly 
½ percentage point per year over the me dium term, reaching 5 percent at the 
end of 2016, a little below our estimate of th e natural rate.  This projection is 
unchanged from the previous Tealbook.   
2 Weather appears to have had only a small effect on payroll employment in the first quarter.  In 
contrast, the workweek appears to have been more affected by bad weather in January and February; in 
March, it returned to a level roughly in line with its average over the past year.

The Effects of the Energy Boom on Industrial Production 
The increasing use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling techniques has pushed 
up domestic production of oil and gas nearly 50 percent since 2007 .  Yet t his output is only part of 
the overall effect of the energy boom on industrial production (IP), which comprises 
manufacturing, mining, and utilities.  We broadly estimate that total p roduction gains related t o 
the energy boom , described in more detail below, make up a significant share of the gain in IP 
(the black line in figure 1) since its trough during the recent recession . Indeed, although IP 
currently stands 2½ percent above its pre-recession level, excluding the output of industries 
related to the energy boom, IP remains about 1½ percent below its previous peak (the blue line) .  
Output gains in industries closely associated with the energy boom have contributed 27 percent 
of the growth in IP since its trough (right hand column of table 1) , and t hese gains have operated 
through three channels.  First, the direct effect comprises the contribution to IP of the increases 
in oil and gas extraction and in drilling; it also account s for the production declines of other 
energy sources that these new supplies have displaced (for example, the reduction in coal mining 
as electric utilities shift away from coal in favor of natural gas ). As shown in table 1, this effect 
accounts for 18 percent of the recovery in IP since its trough . 
Second , the build- out e ffect measures output gains for products that support oil and gas 
infrastructure and exploration, including steel (for pipelines), railcars and barges (for transporting 
oil from areas without pipelines), and new drilling -related machines.  To calculate this effect, we 
weighted IP for the industries related to the oil and gas sector by an estimate of how much of 
each industry’s output is used by oil and gas producers.  For instance, we estimate that all of the 
production of oil and gas machinery is used by the oil and gas sector, and that roughly 25 percent 
of the production of construction supplies is used by that sector (based, in part, on the drilling 
and mining share of overall nonresidential investment) . The resulting build -out effect accounts 
for about 6 percent of the growth in IP since mid- 2009. This estimate is likely conservative, as 
many industries have contributed to the energy boom in ways that are hard to observe.

Finally, the downstream effects of the energy boom measure the contributions from the output of 
industries that most heavily rely on oil and gas as direct inputs (for example, some chemicals and 
refined petroleum products) . Although these industries account for only 3 percent of total IP 
growth since the trough, the energy boom has been transformative for some downstream 
industries —particularly petrochemicals and fertilizers, for which natural gas is an important 
input .1 Prior to the energy boom, many facilities in these industries had been slated for closure.  
However, the surge in natural gas production led to remarkable declines in prices, providing a 
notable cost advantage for U.S. producers relative to their international competitors. As the 
lower prices persisted, not only were scheduled capacity reductions canceled, but expansions 
were planned.  In contrast, downstream effects related to oil have likely been minimal, as prices, 
which are set globally, have not been materially affected by the in creased supplies of oil. 
Looking ahead, the output of industries related to the energy boom should continue to support 
the industrial sector.  The Department of Energy (DOE) project s further gains in oil and gas 
extraction in coming years, and we estimate that the resulting direct effects will boost the level 
of IP about 2½ percent by the end of 2016 (figure 2) .  DOE projections have regularly been revised 
upward in recent years , so future direct effects could be even larger.  The contribution of future 
build -out effects is harder to quantify, but the new extraction techniques require more frequent 
drilling , which in turn requires more new machinery, pipelines, and transportation infrastructure; 
furthermore, continued exploration will likely lead to the d evelopment of new oil and gas fields . 
Although downstream industries have contribut ed only modestly to IP growth to date, significant 
ongoing investments for new plants and the expansion of existing plants will likely increase the 
downstream effects in coming years.  For example, as seen in figure 3 , industry capacity for 
nitrogenous fertilizers , which use natural gas as a feedstock , and for ethylene, which is a 
fundamental petrochemical , is expected to increase about 15 percent by 2016 as existing facilities 
expand and new one s come online.

 We expect total payrolls to incr ease 210,000 per month, on average, in 2014 
and then to rise at an average monthly pace of 220,000 in 2015 and 2016— 
also unchanged from the previous Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Incoming data for core inflation have b een about in line with our March Tealbook 
projection, while food and energy prices have co me in a little higher.  Over the medium 
term, our forecast for inflation is essen tially unchanged from the March Tealbook.   
 With the March PPI and CPI data in ha nd, we estimate that total PCE prices 
increased at an annual rate of 1½ percen t in the first quart er and that core 
consumer prices rose 1¼ percent.  For the current quarter, we expect both total and core PCE inflation of 1½ percent.  
 Prices for natural gas moved up notably in  March as the extremely cold winter 
drove natural gas inventories to their lowe st levels in more than 10 years.  As 
a result, energy prices are likely to incr ease a bit more than core prices this 
year.  In 2015 and 2016, we expect consum er energy prices to drift gradually 
downward, in line with the projected path for crude oil prices. 
 Food prices have risen more than expect ed in the past couple of months in 
response to drought conditions in some parts of the country and the outbreak 
of a severe virus that has reduced swin e stocks.  As a result, we expect food 
prices to increase at about a 2 percent p ace over the first half of this year but 
then to moderate to a pace just below co re as the effects of these transitory 
influences wane. 
 Core import prices are estimated to have  risen at a 1¼ percent pace in the first 
quarter after having declined in 2013.  With the dollar depreciating modestly 
in our projection and commodity prices  edging up, we expect import price 
inflation to remain around the first-qu arter pace through the medium term.   
 Core PCE inflation is anticipated to gradually edge up from 1¼ percent in 
2013 to 1½ percent this year and 1¾ pe rcent in 2015 and 2016.  This contour 
reflects the rise in core import price inflation this year, the diminishing 
resource slack throughout the forecast, and longer-run inflation expectations 
that remain well anchored.  Reflecting the small projected declines in

consumer energy prices, total PCE infla tion is expected to run a touch below 
core price inflation in 2015 and 2016, l eaving inflation at the end of the 
medium-term projection somewhat below the FOMC’s long-run target. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 Beyond 2016, the federal funds rate conti nues to be set according to the 
prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1 999) rule.  (This policy rule assumes a 
long-run equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 4 percent.  For 
a different perspective, see the box “Alternative View:  A Lower Long-Run 
Natural Rate of Interest.”)   
 The federal funds rate gradually rises fr om 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 
2016 to a little above 4 percent in 2019 and 2020.  The Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of securities continue to  put downward pressure on longer-term 
interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent, and the process of returning the 
SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by 2021. 
 Real GDP growth slows to 2½ percent in 2017 but remains above our estimate 
of potential growth.  The unemployment ra te edges down further and is almost 
½ percentage point below its natural rate at the end of 2017.  As monetary 
policy accommodation continues to be gradually withdraw n, gains in real 
GDP slow to below their potential pace,  causing the unemployment rate to 
move back toward its natural rate.   
 Consumer price inflation remains below the long-run objective of the 
Committee in early 2017.  However, with  longer-run inflation expectations 
assumed to remain well anchored and the unemployment rate below the natural rate, consumer price infl ation moves up to 2 percent by 2018.

Alternative View: A Lower Long -Run Natural Rate of Interest 
This box proposes that the natural rate of interest —the risk-free real rate consistent with 
inflation at target and a closed output gap —will remain at a low level for many years to come.1 
It provides an alternative view to the staff’s assumption that the nominal federal funds rate will 
return to 4 percent as the equilibrium real interest rate returns to 2 percent in the longer run . 
The natural rate of interest is the real rate at which the demand and supply of loanable funds 
are equal in an economy in which prices increase at the desired rate. The demand for loanable 
funds rises with the rate of return on investment. In the steady state of a standard growth 
model, optimal investment decisions imply that the real interest rate falls as growth rates of 
productivity and the population decline. As shown in the figure below, t he staff estimate s that 
recent slow growth in these factors has pushed potential output growth well below its 
historical mean and projects that potential output growth will remain low in the medium and 
longer term . This projection is supported by research showing that recent structural 
productivity growth is considerably below rates in the late 1990s and early 2000s and is likely to 
remain at this lower pace.2 Moreover, other research suggests that the contribution to 
productivity growth from increases in human capital is likely to slow substantially and that 
growth in the labor force will be well below historical norms .3 With weaker potential output 
growth , we should expect a natural real rate well below the average of about 2 percent over 
the 15 years prior to the Great Recession. 
Turning to the supply of loanable funds , over the past decades there has been a trend inflow of 
capital to the United States from abroad as a result of the global savings glut.  G oing forward, 
the strong global appetite for safe U.S. asset s will likely continue to put downward pressure on

the natural rate, as the current account surpluses in East Asia and in Middle Eastern oil-
producing countries continue to be channeled to the U nited States . 
In addition, the financial crisis likely led households, investors , and regulators to raise their 
subjective estimates of the likelihood of future large adverse macroeconomic shocks .  Such a 
reassessment depresses the risk -free natural rate for two reasons. First, it increase s 
precautionary savings , leading to a persistent increase in the supply of funds .  Thus, w hile 
household debt -to-income ratios have fallen roughly 20 percentage points since the crisis, 
deleveraging may not yet be fully complete. Indeed, in the aftermath of Sweden’s banking 
crisis in the early 1990s , debt-to-income ratios fell about 40 percentage points. Second, a rise in 
perceptions of risk leads to tighte r lending standards, reduces aggregate demand , and calls for 
a lower risk -free rate to counteract the downward pressure on inflation and real activity . 
Bond market participants seem to concur with the view that the long-run natural rate has fallen. 
The figure below shows the average yield on Treasury inflation -protected securities , or TIPS, 
with maturit ies of more than 10 years . Although the yield has recovered from the especially low 
levels prevailing in the aftermath of the financial crisis, it remains quite low at about 1 percent. 
This low yield suggests an average short -run real rate of interest at long horizons that is below 
the pre-crisis average of about 2 percent .4 
Monetary policy typically aims to close the output gap and keep inflation near its target ed level 
by setting the real federal funds rate equal to the natural rate of interest. Consequently, a 
lower trend path for the natural rate over the longer term implies a lower average policy rate. 
This may give rise to two policy challenges. First, a lower average policy rate implies a greater 
probability that the zero lower bound will be binding o ver the next decade or so. Second, if low 
risk-free rates interact with other distortions in the financial system to generate search -for-yield 
behavior, risks to financial stability may be exacerbated . 
4 The staff view could be consistent with these data if the term premium were currently extremely low. 
However, standard estimates of the term premium are based on forecasts of future short rates that revert to 
the historical mean very quickly. These estimates tend to overemphasize the role of the term premium for 
movements of long yields.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
We estimate that real GDP growth in the foreign economies slowed from a nearly 
3 percent pace in the second half of 2013 to 2¼ percent in the first quarter of 2014, 
½ percentage point below  our March Tealbook forecast.  The deceleration  was 
concentrated in the emerging market economies (EMEs).  Growth declined markedly in 
China, reflecting  falling exports  as well as  domestic policies  to cur b excessive credit and 
investment growth .  Weak demand in China, along with sluggish  U.S. imports, appears to 
have weighed on growth in other foreign economies, especially in emerging Asia .  
Meanwhile, recent indicators suggest that growth remained subdued in Latin America.    
We do not expect the first-quarter slump to persist .  We project growth to step up 
in the United States , and forward -looking indicators for several  EMEs have strengthened.  
In addition, domestic demand should gradually pick up in the euro area , thanks to waning 
financial and fiscal headwinds.  Thus, we have foreign growth r ising  to 2¾ percent this 
quarter and to 3¼ percent in the second half of this year, about where it remains  through 
2016.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), s till-substantial output gaps are 
expected to close gradually as growth remain s slightly above potential.  In the EMEs, 
growth is projected to  settle at near -potential rates , supported by stronger exports to the 
advanced economies.  This  outlook is little c hanged from  the March Tealbook.     
During the intermeeting period , financial market sentiment toward EMEs 
improved noticeably .  However, we see some risk that  the first -quarter sl ump may not be 
temporary but instead may reflect deeper underlying weakness in EMEs .  Additionally, in 
China the pronounced slowdown in growth could exacerbate vulnerabilities and lead to severe financial  disruptions.  Finally, despite the recent Geneva agreement to reduce 
tensions in Ukraine, the situation remains volatile.  Although the dispute has had limited 
financial and economic spillovers thus far, an escalation could trigger a significant shock 
to world energy and financial markets .  We explore this scenario in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section .  
We estimate that E ME inflation fell in the first quarter, largely because of lower 
food prices in China and India.  We expect EME inflation to rebound in the current quarter and then settle just above 3¼ percent in 2015 and 2016.  In the AFEs , where low 
inflation has been a concern, developments were mixed.  Inflation rebounded in Canada

  but remained very low in the euro area, fueling fears about a prolonged period of low 
inflation.   Nevertheless, we continue to see AFE deflation risks as contained and project 
that inflation will pick up over the forecast period to 1¾ percent by late 2016.   
Below -target inflation and s ubstantial resource slack will keep monetary policy in 
the AFEs highly accommodative for some time.  W e also expect monetary pol icy to be 
accommodative in most EMEs .  In the mo st vulnerable EMEs, where monetary policy 
has been tightening  significantly to contain inflation and financial pressures, such 
tightening  is projected to end by the second half of this year.     
ADVANCED FORE IGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro area.  T he recovery in the euro area appears to be gaining momentum.  
Industrial production and consumption indicators through February were 
above their fourth-quarter averages, and PMIs through April pointed to further 
expansion.  We expect GDP growth to increase from 1 ½ percent  this year to 
2 percent in 2016, as fiscal drag diminishes, financial and credit conditions ease, and monetary policy remains accommodative.      
• Inflation  registered  a lower -than-expected 0.2 percent (quarte rly change at an 
annual rate ) in the first quarter, just a hair above the fourth quarter’s 
0.1 percent pace, as a surprisingly sharp decline in  retail energy prices  partly 
offset an increase in core inflation.  Amid stable inflation expectations, a projected leveling -off of energy prices , and a narrowing output gap, inflation 
should rise to 1½ percent by late 2016.  Nevertheless, concerns over a 
prolonged period of very  low inflation prompt ed the European Central Bank 
to more openly discuss contingency plans for a dditional stimulus  in the event 
of shortfalls in growth or inflation, including rate cuts or, in extremis , asset 
purchases  (possibly asset- backed securities) .  
• United Kingdom .  Firming industrial production and retail sales i n February 
and robust PMI readings through March point to strong growth momentum.  Accordingly, we project that GDP will grow  3 percent this year before 
normaliz ing to a still-solid 2½ percent  pace thereafter .  Amid decelerating  
energy prices and  falling transport prices, headline inflation dipped to just 
1 percent in the first quarter,  but we expect it to rebound to 1½ percent in the 
current quarter.   As the output gap closes, inflation should rise further to

  nearly 2  percent by 20 15.  The unemployment ra te fell to 6.9  percent in the 
three months t hrough February —just below the 7 percent threshold from the 
Bank of England’s (BOE) original forward guidance.  This movement ushered 
in the new phase of forward guidance  (announced in February), which focuses  
on broader measures of economic slack .  We still expect the BOE’s first rate 
hike to  occur in early 2015. 
• Japan .  As households pull ed forward spending ahead of a consumption tax 
hike on April  1, GDP gr ew an estimated 3 percent in the first quarter.  This 
figure  is roughly 1 percentage point lower than previously projected due to 
disappointing data on international trade.  As household spending falls back , 
GDP is likely to contract 3½ percent  this quarter .  GDP is then expected to  
rise at a 1¾  percent pace in the second half of the year, as consumption 
normalizes , the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) asset purchases continue, and the fiscal  
stimulus  plan announced last December is implemented .  That said, a more 
hawkish tone in the communications of BOJ  officials  leads us to anticipate 
less monetary accommodation than in the March  Tealbook.  Accordingly, w e 
now expect growth to average only 1 percent over the remainder of the forecast period.   
• After running at a 2½ percent pace in the second half of last year, consumer 
price inflation appears to have fallen to ¾  percent in the f irst quarter as  retail 
energy prices  stabilized .  We see inflation (excluding the direct effect of the 
tax hike) remaining  slightly below 1 percent through late 2014 and rising to 
only 1½ percent  by late 2016, ½ percentage point less than previously 
forecast .   
• Canada.  Growth appears to have stepped down from 3 percent in the fourth quarter to 1½ percent in the first quarter, partly owing to the effect of slower 
U.S. growth  on exports, which were weak through February.  However, other 
data point to underlying resilience.  Employment continued to grow at a moderate rate, and the manufacturing PMI remained squarely in expansionary territory .  Thus, we project that GDP growth will rebound to 3¼ percent  in the 
current quarter  and then average just over 2½ percent for the remainder of the 
forecast period .  Consumer price inflation stepped up to 2¾ percent  in the first 
quarter, as core inflation firmed and the falling Canadian dollar pushed up energy prices .  We project inflation will slow later in the year, given expected

  currency appreciation  and a decline in oil prices, before increasing gradually 
to 2 percent in 2016 as the output gap closes.  W e continue to expect t he Bank 
of Canada to raise its  policy rate starting in the second half of 2015.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China . We estimate that China’s GDP grew at an annual rate of only 
5½ percent in the first quarter, down from 8 percent in the previous quarter 
and 2 percentage points below our March projection.  The step-down was broad based and reflected a sharp fall in exports, as well as tighter financial 
conditions and government efforts to rein in investment.  Looking ahead, we 
expect GDP to grow 6¼ percent this quarter and  then  7½ percent in the 
second half of 2014, as we project  export growth  to recover and the authorities 
to implement policies to support growth if needed.  Thus far, the government has announced only some modest stimulus measures  and has indicated that no 
major  stimulus program is planned.  However, we believe that i f growth were 
to continue to underperform the authorities’  7½ percent target , the stimulus 
would be ramped  up.  The decline in the renminbi engineered by the 
government this year should also provide some economic support.  Further out, we see growth edging down to just above 7 percent by 2016, as potential growth declines and the economy gradually rebalances.  
• Inflation slowed from 3 percent in the previous quarter to only ¾ percent in 
the first quarte r, primarily reflecting a drop in food prices.  We expect 
inflation to return to 3 percent by the second half of the year and remain at that level over the forecast period. 
• Other Emerging Asia .  We estimate that growth slowed  from a rapid 
5¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter to 3 percent in the first quarter, a 
somewhat sharper slowdown than anticipated in the March Tealbook.  Growth 
was held down by falling exports to China and the United States, in part reflect ing payback from a n earlier surge in electronics shipments.  Indicators 
for new export orders moved up recently, suggesting an incipient pickup in the region’s exports.  By year -end, stronger demand in China and the United 
States should help boost growth close to our estimate of tren d growth of 
4½ percent.

  • Latin America .  We estimate that GDP growth in Mexico  rose from ¾ percent 
in the fourth quarter to a still-subdued 2 percent last  quarter .  We expect GDP  
growth  to rise to 3½ percent by late 2014, supported by expansionary fiscal 
policy, a rebound in U.S. manufacturing output, and fading drag from the 
ailing housing sector.  Thereafter, we have growth edg ing up to 3¾ percent by 
2016, as previously announced structural reforms take effect .   
• Brazil ’s economy faces significant headwi nds, including a reduction in fiscal 
stimulus, tighter monetary policies, more restrictive financial conditions, and structural bottlenecks.  R ecent indicators  suggest that GDP grew a mere 
½ percent in the first quarter .  As external demand strengthens, growth should 
rise to 2¾ percent by the end of 2015.  Despite the recent weak ness in  growth, 
12-month headline inflation remained  above 6 percent in March, reflecting 
tight labor market conditions, earlier depreciation of the real , and persistently 
high inflation expectations .  In April , the central bank raised its policy rate 
25 basis points to 11 percent, bringing the total increase since last April to 375 basis points.  The cumulative effects of this tightening should gradually 
bring inflation down to 5¼ percent by 2016.  
• Other Emerging Economies .  Following Russia’s annexation of Crimea last 
month, tensions among Russia , Ukraine, and Western nations remain elevated , 
notwithstanding the April 17 announcement of a plan to deescalate the crisis .  
To date, the crisis  has not noticeabl y affected  the global economy.  However, 
Russia and Ukraine have experienced  large capital outflows , which prompted 
their central banks to raise policy rates by 150 basis points and 300 basis points, respectively , since March .  As a result of higher interest rates and 
falling confidence, output likely contracted in both countries during the first 
quarter  and will remain weak throughout 2014. 
Facing capital flight, critically low foreign exchange reserves, and significant 
pressure on domestic banks, Ukraine requested financial assistance from the 
International Monetary Fund ( IMF).  In response, in late March , the IMF 
announced preliminary  agreement on a $14 billion  to $18 billion two- year 
program, which should unlock additional official assistance.  The resulting 
total official sector support, which could come to about $27 billion over the next two years , should substantially mitigate Ukraine’s balance of payments

Executive Board is expected to approve the package in the coming weeks.

Financial Developments  
Financial market developments over the intermeeting period  were driven in part 
by incoming economic data releases  that were, on balance, somewhat stronger than 
expected.  Federal Reserve communications also garnered significant atten tion from 
market participants ; those communications, however, appeared to result  only in a modest 
tightening , on net, in the outlook for monetary policy.   
• On balance, t he anticipated path of the federal funds rate steepened , and 
intermediate -dated Treasur y yields rose notably over the intermeeting period . 
• The Open Market Desk’s April Survey of Primary Dealers indicated that 
dealers’ expectations about the most likely timing of the first rate increase  
moved in somewhat relative to the survey conducted prior to the March 
FOMC meeting.  However, the median dealer’s expectations for the path of the federal funds rate after liftoff and for SOMA holdings changed little .   
• The S&P 500 index was little changed , on net, despite a sharp selloff in social 
media and biotechnology stocks.  Corporate bond spreads narrowed some.   
• Financial flows to large nonfinancial businesses remained generally strong.  
Corporate debt issuance continued to be robust, and equity issuance was 
strong overall even though some IPOs were repo rtedly put on hold amid 
declines  in the prices of small- capitalization stocks.  
• Banks generally eased  standards on most major categories of loans again in 
the first quarter .
1 
• The foreign exchange value of the dollar was about unchanged.  Investor 
sentiment toward emerging market economies (EMEs) improved further 
despite incoming economic data that were somewhat weaker than expected.  
Spreads on peripheral sovereign bonds in the euro area continued to narrow.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Policy expectations and interest rates responded noticeably to Federal Reserve 
communications over the intermeeting period.  On balance, the communications 
surrounding the conclusion of the March FOMC meeting were interpreted as somewhat less accommodative than expected.  Money market futures rates and near- and 
intermediate -term yields rose significantly  in response; option- implied volatility on short -
term rates also increased.  However,  subsequent Federal Reserve communications —
including the Chair’s speech on March 31 and the minutes of the March FOMC 
meeting —appeared to mostly reverse the earlier change in expectations for the stance of 
policy.  
Economic data releases d uring the intermeeting  period were, on balance, 
somewhat better than market participants had expected .  Interest rates increased 
following several data releases —most notably, the ADP March employment report, the 
March retail sales release , and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia ’s April  Busin ess 
Outlook Survey.  By contrast, although the March payroll employment report  was about 
in line with reported market expectations, interest rate s declined markedly following its 
release, as some investors apparent ly had placed substantial odds on there being a larger 
rebound in employment  after weather -related disruptions earlier in the year . 
All told, the path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes 
steepened, on net, over the intermeeting per iod.  Yields on short- and medium- term 
nominal Treasu ry securities rose, while yields at the very long end of the curve declined.  
The 5-year yield rose 20 basis points, while the 10- year yield was little changed .  The  
30-year yield moved down 12 basis points over the period, continuing a trend that has 
been evident for a few months.  Market participants have pointed to several factors that 
might explain this  trend , including a decline in uncertainty about long -term rates, perhaps 
related to reduced uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve ’s purchases; a reallocation 
by pension funds from equities to bonds following last year’s stock market rally ; and a 
reassessment of the economy’s long -run potential growth rate.  During the intermeeting 
period, option- implied volatility on long- term interest rates declined further on net.  In a 
response to a special question in the Desk’s April Survey of Primary Dealers, the notable decline this year in the 5- year forward rate 5 years ahead was attributed by dealers to

  changes in term premiums and, to a lesser extent, in the expected average real policy 
rate.2   
Agency MBS yields were little changed , roughly in line with those on 
comparable -duration Treasury securities,  while option-adjusted spreads on production-
coupon MBS ticked up.  TIPS -based measures of five-year inflation compensation and 
the five- year measure five years ahead  were about unchanged. 
According to the Desk’s April Survey of Primary Dealers , the distribution across 
respondents of the modal timing of the fi rst rate increase narrowed somewhat, with nearly 
half of the dealers now anticipating the liftoff to occur in the second quarter of 2015.  T he 
median dealer’s projected federal funds rate at the end of 2016 was unchanged at  
2 percent.  Regarding asset purc hases, dealers anticipated another $10 billon cut at the 
upcoming meeting and continued to expect the purchase program to end in October.  In 
addition, for both Treasury securities and agency MBS, dealers were about evenly split 
regarding whether reinvestment would end prior to liftoff, as opposed to at or after 
liftoff .3   
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
The Treasury Department  auctioned $192 billion of nominal fixed -coupon 
securities and $31 billion of TIPS over the intermeeting  period, with bid- to-cover ratios 
roughly in line with recent averages.  The Treasury’s $13 billion reopening of the two-year Floating  Rate N ote on March 26 was broadly characterized as well received  (see the 
box “ Treasury Floating  Rate Notes” ). 
The further reduction in the pace of Federal Reserve purchases did not appear to 
have adverse effect s on the functioning of Treasury or agency MBS markets.

2 Dealers highlighted market -related factors  (such as portfoli o reallocation , trading dynamics, and 
safe-haven flows ) as the most important factor behind the decline in the term premium component .  With 
respect to the decline in the expected average real policy rate, dealers pointed to changes in the outlook for 
econ omic growth and in the perception of the future FOMC reaction function.   
3 In the survey of market participants, a small majority of respondents anticipated reinvestment of 
both Treasury securities and agency MBS to end prior to liftoff.  
4 Over the inter meeting period, the Desk purchased $ 36 billion of Treasury securities under the 
flow-based Treasury purchase program and $50 billion  of agency MBS under the flow -based MBS 
purchase program and the reinvestment program.   The Desk conducted $2.5 billion of dollar rolls.  On 
April 9, the D esk conducted its first agency MBS purchase operation over FedTrade, the Desk’s proprietary 
trading system, with the D esk purchasing $312 million  of 30-year Fannie Mae 4  percent  coupon  securities

 Treasury Floating Rate Notes 
On January 29, t he U.S. Treasury conducted its inaugural two -year Floating Rate Note 
(FRN) auction.  This auction marked  the introduction of the first new security by the 
Treasury since Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities , or TIPS , in 1997.  By introducing 
FRNs, the Treasury intends to further diversif y its current offerings , lower the 
government’s borrowing cost s, and support its debt management goal of extending 
the average maturity of Treasury debt.1 
Under the current program, n ew FRN issues  will be offered quarterly with two 
subsequent monthly reopenings.  The FRN has a two -year maturity with interest paid  
at the end of the final month of each quarter.2  Daily interest accrual is based on the 
index rate , which is the 13 -week Treasury bill rate from the most recent auction , plus a 
constant spread  determined at the time of the FRN auction.  The index rate eff ectively 
resets weekly and the amount of daily interest accrued has a floor at zero to prevent 
investors from having to make a reverse interest payment to the Treasury .  Prices and 
auction results are quoted in terms of the discount margin, the margin over the index 
rate at which the present value of future cash flows (at the current level of the index 
rate) is equated to the price of the FRN , a convention similar to those used in other 
floating -rate securities .  At issuance, the FRN’s discount margin is equal to its spread.  
FRNs  have a short duration relative to their maturity because of  the weekly index rate 
reset , a feature which potentially makes them particularly attractive to short -term 
investors such as money market fun ds.3 
The first  FRN auction was broadly characterized as very well received  with a bid -to-
cover ratio of 5.7, which was at the high  end of bid -to-cover ratios seen in recent 
comparable Treasury bill auctions.  The auction reportedly  attracted  a relatively w ide 
variety of participants despite initial expectations that demand would mainly come 
from primary dealers and Treasury -only money market funds.  The two reopenings 
(conducted on February 26 and March 26) were characterized as well received.  
The FRN marke t is still small compared with  those for other short -dated Treasury 
securities, with total FRN issuance equal to about 2 percent  of total bills outstanding.  
Thus far , there have been no discernable shifts in investors’ portfolio allocation s away 
from Treasury bills or short -term notes  as a result of the issuance of FRNs, and it is 
hard to forecast how different investor types will rebalance their portfolios  over time. 
                                                 
1 The average maturity of Treasury debt was 67 months as of March 2014, up from 49 months in 
late 2008.  The Treasury intends to replace some bill issuance with FRNs, which would  further 
increase the average maturity.  
2 The Treasury has stated that it anticipates eventually issuing longer -maturity floating -rate 
securities.  Under current rules, it has the option to issue FRNs with maturities between 1 and  
10 years.  
3 Despite their short duration, FRNs will be reported in the “Notes and bonds, nominal” section 
of the H.4.1 statistical release .

 Daily trading volume and price action in the secondary FRN market reportedly remain 
limited compared with  other short -dated Treasury securities.  The majority of current 
FRN investors are believed to be “ buy and hold” investors, which may limit trading 
activity  in FRNs relative to bills and nominal coupon  securities  of similar maturity.  T hat 
said, market participants  generally expect trading activity in FRNs to increase 
gradually as the overall amount outstanding in the asset type increases and market 
participants gain  further experience in  trading the security.4 
The figure below plots  daily quotes of secondary market FRN discount margins  since 
the first auction .  To help gauge whether the margins are consistent with prices of 
financial claims that have similar cash flow characteristics, we can compare the 
discount margins to theoretical margins of synthetic constant -maturity securities that 
approximately replicate the cash flows of FRNs .5  The FRN discount margin in the 
secondary market started out relatively low compared with  these synthetics, but the 
gap has gradually narrowed to a few  basis points  (not shown) .  One takeaway from 
this comparison is that the pricing of FRNs  does not seem to be affected by 
substantial liquidity premiums .6  
Market participant s note that a consensus fair-value pricing model for FRNs has not 
yet emerged.  However, given  the opportunity cost of holding FRNs versus bills, m any 
money  market funds reportedly consider FRNs attractive at a discount margin of 
around 7 to 8 basis points . 
 
                                                 
4 Because  money market funds are subject to a limit on the weighted average life, or WAL, of 
their portfolio under SEC rule 2a -7, a wider range of remaining times to maturity of FRNs may also 
broaden the investor base over time.  
5 The synthetic securities are constructed by combining  a fixed -coupon two -year Treasury note 
with a “ plain vanilla ” two -year interest rate swap and a three-month LIBOR –Treasury bill basis swap  
with a two -year tenor .  Note that the synthetic FRN may be affected by liquidity and counterparty 
risk premiums.  
6 Several dealers reportedly expressed some reluctance to build up FRN positions, however, 
because of a lack of liquidity compared with the incremental profit. 
The FRN discount margin is also lik ely subject to a duration effect ; although the FRN is indexed 
to the three -mon th Treasury bill rate, it resets weekly, further reducing its risk exposure to changes 
in the level of interest rates.  We estimate the average magnitude of this effect to be sma ll.  Secondary Market Discount Margins on U.S. Treasury Floating Rate Notes

  been true for some time, despite recent reductions in the pace of purchases, the Federal 
Reserve’s MB S settlements nearly equaled gross MBS issuance in March , reflecting the 
continued decline in gross issuance of these securities  amid tepid mortgage originations .  
Liquidity conditions in agency MBS markets were generally stable over the intermeeting 
perio d, though there were some signs of scarcity of certain production-coupon TBA 
securities .  In particular, the dollar- roll-implied financing rates for 30 -year Fannie Mae 
3.5 percent coupon securities declined somewhat.   
Conditions in short- term funding marke ts generally remained stable over the 
intermeeting period.5  Take- up at the Federal Reserve’s fixed -rate overnight reverse 
repurchase agreement (ON RRP) exercise continued to be sensitive to the spread between market rates and the rate offered in the exercise  (see the box “ Assessing the Effects of the 
Overnight Reverse Repurchase Exercise on Short -Term Interest Rates”) .  At quarter -end, 
take-up reached a record level of about $240 billion .  As has been the case since the ON 
RRP  exercise was  established,  money market funds increased their usage of the ON RPPs  
at quarter -end, as foreign banking organizations shrank their balance sheets by  pulling 
back significantly from borrowing in dollar funding markets.  Part of the increase in ON RRP  usage  on this quarter-end relative to the previous one likely reflected higher  
counterparty allotment limits, which were raised from $3 billion to $7 billion during the 
first quarter. 
EQUITY VALUATIONS AND BOND SPREADS  
During the intermeeting period, the S &P 500 index changed l ittle on net.  
However, investors pulled back sharply from social media and biotechnology stocks amid concern about valuations of these shares , which had risen substantially over the past year.  
The Russell 2000, an index of small- capitalization stocks, de clined 4 percent , the N asdaq  
biotech nology index dropped 11 percent , and the N asdaq  Internet index declined   
9 percent .  By contrast , income-oriented stocks, such as those of utility  and 
                                                                                                                                                 
out of $4.2 billion in offers .  No significant price action  was associated with the operation.  Subsequently, 
the Desk conducted five additional purchase operations using FedTrade; all went smoothly.  
5 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting peri od, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.  Over the period, the Federal Reserve began 
using form FR 2420 (Report of Selected Money Market Rates) to collect transactions data on federal funds, 
Eurodollar time deposit, and CD r ates from about 150 large institutions.   The weighted average federal 
funds rate calculated from this data collection is in line with the rate derived from the brokered federal funds data.

  telecommunications  companies , rallied.  Meanwhile,  the VIX, an index of option- implied 
volatility for one -month returns on the S&P 500 index, ticked down.   
The spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds to 
those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity narrowed  some, broadly consistent 
with the strength in  income -oriented stocks and the modest ly better -than-expected 
economic data.  The narrowing of credit spreads appeared to be driven largely by a 
decrease in near -term spreads, perhaps reflecting a bit more confidence on the part of 
investors that credit conditions would remain benign.   
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
The pace of financing by nonfinancial businesses was generally strong in both 
credit and equity markets during the intermeeting period.   In credit markets, b ond 
issuance by and c ommercial paper outstandings of domestic nonfinancial corporations 
increased  in March ; however, bond issuance in April has been subdued due to seasonal 
weakness  attributed to the earnings -season blackout on issuance.  Growth in C&I loans 
on banks’ books was robust in the first quarter, consistent with the increase in loan demand by large and middle- market firms reported in the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  (SLOOS) .  Issuance of leveraged loans, 
particularly institutional loans, remained brisk in March amid a continued gradual 
deterioration of credit terms and deal structures.  A significant share of issuance has 
continued to be attributed to  refinancing s of existing debt.
6  CLO issuance has picked up 
in the past few  months, as new CLO deals reportedly have been structured to address 
certain restrictions in the Volcker rule.7  Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial 
companies remained robust in March and April and was roughly in line with last year’s average, even though some  IPOs were reportedly put on hold amid declines in the prices 
of small- capitalization stocks.  
Financing conditions in commercial real estate ( CRE ) markets  have improved 
further.  Commercial mortgage loans held on banks’ books continued to grow solidly in 
                                                 
6 See the memo “Effects of Supervisory Guidance on the Leveraged Lo an Market,” distributed in 
the April QS report, for additional discussion of conditions in the leveraged loan market.   
7 Of note, during the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve Board announced that bank holding 
companies have until July 21, 2017, to disinvest from non -Volcker -compliant CLOs originated prior to the 
end of 2013.  The extension for complying with the requirement reportedly alleviated the risk of forced 
liquidation s of such instruments in the near  term.

 Assessing the Effects of the Overnight Reverse Repurchase  
Exercise on Short -Term Interest Rates 
Since the start of the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) 
exercise on September 23, 2013, the fixed rate offered in this exercise has moved 
between 1 and 5 basis points and the maximum institution -level allotment cap 
has been  gradually  increased to its current , generally nonbinding, level of 
$10 billion .  This box  explores the ability of the ON RRP exercise to influence 
short -term market interest rates.  
Overnight Treasury repo rates have generally been close to the ON RRP rate.  In 
addition, some indicators suggest that the volatility of Treasury repo rat es may 
have diminished, particularly since December 23, 2013, when the maximum 
allotment cap was first raised above $1 billion .  As shown in the top -left figure on 
the next page , the volume- weighted mean rate on overnight triparty general 
collateral Treasury repo transactions has generally moved in a narrow range 
around the ON RRP rate.1  Of course, the ON RRP rate was moved at times to 
align more closely with market rates, so caution with regard to causality is warranted.  Furthermore, t he spread between the 90 th and 10 th percentile of 
rates narrowed from an average level of 4 basis points over the nine months 
leading up to the initiation of the exercise to the current average of 2 basis 
points .  Consistent with this observation, the top-right figure shows  that after the 
exercise began the distribution of triparty repo rates narrowed to some degree 
and most private- sector trades have been executed at or above the daily mean 
rate on transactions.  
Beyond the overnight secured market , the bottom -left figure sh ows  that the  
1-month  Treasury bill rate has generally been below the ON RRP rate ( except 
during the federal budget impasse in October 2013) while the federal funds rate has consistently been above it.  Both rates have generally varied broadly in line 
with  the posted exercise rate; however, the two rates also moved together 
before the inception of the exercise.  
The bottom -right figure shows the relationship between Treasury bill supply and 
the DTCC Treasury GCF Repo Index after the inception of the ON RRP exercise.  
Usually, repo rates rise when bill supply increases and fall when supply declines.  
The GCF rate has fallen only moderately in recent days despite significantly 
declining bill supply.  The s taff will monitor this relationship to see the extent t o 
which the ON RRP exercise is providing a floor for repo rates.

  the first quarter of 2014.  According to the April SLOOS, banks again  eased standards on 
CRE loans during the first quarter, and they reportedly experienced an increase in loan 
demand, especially for construction and land development loans.  CRE prices increased further in February across different geographic markets and property types.  In contrast, 
CMBS issuance in 2014 has been a bit slower than last year ’s pace, although market 
participants reportedly anticipate  that issuance will ramp up in coming months.    
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight over the intermeeting period, 
though signs of easing continued to emerge amid further gains in house prices.  In 
particular, the April SLOOS indicated a net easing of banks’ credit standards for home-purchase loans to prime customers in the first quarter.  However, there was a significant 
increase in banks’ reports of tightened standards on nontraditional mortgage loans, which 
several respondents attributed to the new qualified mortgage rules.
8  Mortgage rates were 
about unchanged, on net, and applications for refinancing and purchase mortgages remained tepid .  Since last summer , the application indexes have decreased 50 percent for 
refinancings and 10 percent for purchase mortgages, in part because of  the rise in  
mortgage rates over that period.   
Conditions in consumer credit markets remained mixed , as student and auto loans 
continued to expand at a robust pace in February but credit card debt outstanding was again roughly unchanged.  Data on loan balances at commercial banks suggest that these trends continued through March .  According to  the April SLOOS, banks experienced an 
increase in demand for auto loans during the first quarter and eased  their  spreads on such 
loans on net.  In the same survey, bank issuers of credit cards pointed to consumers’ preference for lower debt levels and the restrictions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 ( or Credit C ard Act) as the two most 
important factors tha t held back credit card loan growth in 2013.
9  Nonetheless, many 
                                                 
8 The qualified mortgage rules incl ude, among several other provisions, limits on risky features 
such as negative amortization, interest -only payments, long durations, and  high fees.  The limits on risky 
features are more likely to put constraints on the types of nontraditional residential mortgage loans included 
in the SLOOS.  
9 Banks cited a number of provisions of the  Credit Card  Act, which mostly went into effect in 
August 2010,  as having constrained loan growth:  the prohibition on raising interest rates on existing 
balances; restriction s on credit card fees; and  requirement s that card payments be applied first to the debt 
with the highest interest rate , that borrowers under the age of 21 have adult cosigners , and that a 
consumer’s ability to make the required payments on the account be considered .

  respondents anticipate a pickup in growth  of their consumer credit card loans this year, 
particularly to prime borrowers.  In addition, although credit conditions overall appear to 
have remai ned tight,  a few of the very largest credit card issuers in the SLOOS panel 
reported an easing of standards for approving applications for credit cards , and an 
increase in credit limits on credit cards , during the first quarter.  Financing conditions in 
the consumer ABS market remained favorable in recent months , and issuance continued 
to be solid.  
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
Amid mixed first -quarter earnings reports for large banks, s tock prices of large 
domestic banks generally  underperformed the broad equity market .  Banks reported that 
mortgage and trading revenues declined, and that net interest margins continued to trend 
lower .  However, a  rise in investment banking revenues, as well as o ngoing cost-
reduction efforts and declines in loan loss provisions , support ed profitability.  Banks 
generally reported that their r isk-based capital ratios continued to increase.  A majority of 
the eight domestic systemically important banking institu tions reported Basel III leverage 
ratios above the 5 percent  minimum that will be required under the enhanced 
supplementary leverage ratio rule announced during the intermeeting period.10  CDS 
spreads for the largest bank holding companies remained low.   
M2 growth slowed in March from its robust February  pace, driven by a 
deceleration in the growth of liquid deposits.  In contrast, currency rose rapidly.  Commercial bank shipments of currency to Russia were notable in March, and anecdotal reports suggested  that Russian financial institutions increased their demand for do llars as 
a precaution against possible financial sanctions.  The pace of g rowth of the monetary 
base declined in March , as the increase in currency was partially offset by a decline in the 
Treasury’s balances held at the Federal Reserve.

10 On April 8, U.S. regulators proposed changes to the s upplementary leverage ratio (SLR) to more 
closely match the final Basel III leverage ratio  framework approved by the Basel Committee on Banking 
Supervision early last year .  Regulators also finalized an “enhanced SLR” rule establishing stricter 
requirements for the eight U.S. systemically important bank holding companies ( BHCs) .  Specifically, 
those BHCs must maintain a leverage ratio above 5  percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and 
discretionary bonus payments.  
11 In addition, Term Deposit Facility  operations also slightly damped growth in the base over this 
period.   The Federal Reserve conducted a series of four seven -day operations in March, including one that

  FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Intermeeting data releases for the advanced foreign economies pointed to further 
expansion in economic activity, largely as expected, and asset prices in those economies 
were generally little changed on net.  By contrast, incoming data for EMEs, part icularly 
China, were somewhat weaker than had been expected.  Even so, investor sentiment toward the EMEs continued to improve.  Moreover, financial markets outside of those in Ukraine and Russia appeared to remain largely unfazed by the continuing tensions in that 
region. 
Stock prices were slightly higher in most foreign economies despite the global 
selloff of technology-related stocks.  In Japan, stock prices moved lower following 
comments from Governor Kuroda that were viewed as less accommodative than had been 
expected, but the market subsequently recovered to end the intermeeting period about 
unchanged.  In Brazil and Turkey, share prices rallied substantially from their lows earlier this year, finishing up about 12 percent over the period.  
Benchmark 10-year sovereign bond yields in most of the advanced foreign 
economies were little changed , on net, despite a modest rise in market- based measures of 
policy expectations in Canada and the United Kingdom.  Policy expectations for the euro area were stable o ver the period, with the European Central Bank continuing to hint that 
additional accommodation is possible, perhaps through purchases of asset- backed 
securities.  
Yield spreads on peripheral sovereign bonds in the euro area continued to narrow, 
with spreads of Italian and Spanish sovereign debt to German bunds ending the period at about 150 basis points.  Although these spreads are at the ir lowest levels since 2010, they 
nevertheless imply a cumulative 10 -year default probability of more than 20 percent.  
Taking advantage of the continued improvement in sentiment toward periphery countries, Greece reentered the sovereign debt market after an absence of four years , selling  
€3 billion in five -year bonds at a spread of nearly 450 basis points above the yield on 
five-year German b unds.  The issue was well received, with more than €20 billion in 
bids, mostly from foreign investors.  Sovereign yields also fell in most EMEs , and, in 
early April, there were inflows into both equity and bond EME-dedicated funds. 
                                                                                                                                                 
employed a floating -rate format.   The operations attracted, on average, roughly $15 billion, a modest 
increase from the average level over the past year.

  The staff’s broad nominal index for the dollar was about unchanged, on net, over 
the intermeeting period.  The improvement in sentiment toward EMEs contributed to a 
notable appreciation of the Brazilian real  and the Turkish lira against the dollar .  By 
contras t, the renminbi depreciated against the dollar.  That depreciation, which the PBOC 
has been engineering over the past few months, has reportedly spurred an unwinding of trades predicated on expectations of steady appreciation of the renminbi.  It remains uncertain whether the PBOC was motivated solely by a desire to introduce two -way 
currency risk into its foreign exchange market or whether it was also seeking to provide 
macroeconomic stimulus at a time of flagging growth.  Despite the continuing tensions involving Ukraine and Russia, the ruble appreciated against the dollar during the period and the value of the Ukranian hryvnia rose late in the period, boosted by central bank action in both countries.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  Motiv ated by 
the favorable tone of some recent data, the first scenario presents a more robust recovery 
than envisioned by the staff .  By contrast, the second scenario considers the possibility 
that the projected step -up in housing demand and consumer spending fails to materialize, 
implying  persistently weaker aggregate demand conditions than in the baseline.  In the 
third scenario, term and risk premiums in fixed -income markets jump  early next year in 
anticipation of the federal funds rate rising above its effective lower bound.  The fourth scenario  features  a deeper and more persistent reduction  in potential o utput growth than 
assumed in the baseline.  The fifth  scenario contemplates the risk that the softness in 
consumer price inflation seen over the past year  could prove to be more persistent than 
anticipated.   The final s cenario  displays possible consequences of a major escalation of 
tensions in Ukraine.  
We generate the first five  scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final one 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its effective lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast —by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  T he date of liftoff i n each scenario takes  into 
account the guidance provided in the Committee’s March  statement indicating  that the 
liftoff date w ill depend on labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures, and 
readings on financial conditions, as well as the date the asset purchase program ends .
1  In 
all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.   
                                                 
1 Specifically, in the first four scenarios, we assume that the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over 
in the quarter following the observation of an unemployment rate of 6 percent, the level of unemployment 
prevailing in the baseline one quarter prior to l iftoff.  In the “Low I nflation” scenario, where the path of 
inflation is significantly different from the baseline, the choice of liftoff date is meant to capture the 
Committee’s intention to maintain the current target for the federal funds rate for a con siderable time after 
the asset purchase program ends, “especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”  For the final scenario, “Escalating G eopolitical Tensions,” we assume a 
broadly similar policy rule  to the one used in the first four scenarios.  One key difference relative to the 
FRB/US simulations  is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference 
between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that  would occur in the absence of 
slow adjustment of wages and prices.

  Faster Recovery 
Some recent data—such as those for retail sales, industrial production, and motor 
vehicle sales —have been upbeat, even after our accounting for the rebound from the 
effects of poor weather earlier in the year .  Moreover, labor market conditions have 
continued to improve.  In this scenario, activity accelerates sharply , as the headwinds 
restraining the recovery diminish more quickly than in the baseline projection and 
business and consumer confidence picks up substantially.  R eal GDP  growth reaches an 
annual rate of 4½  percent in  second half of this year and averages 4 percent over 2015; 
the unemployment rate falls below 4½ percent by the end of 2016.  I nflation moves up to 
its 2 percent target level by early 2018, three  quarters earlier than in the baseline .  The 
federal funds rate lifts off one quarter earlier than in the baseline and rises more steeply 
thereafter, reaching 5 ½ percent by the end of 2018. 
Weaker Household Demand 
In the baseline projection , consumer spending accelerates noticeably over the next 
several quarters , supported by continued improvements in labor market prospects, 
households’ net worth, and consumer sentiment ; the projected resumption of the housing 
market recovery is expected to reinforce this acceleration.  By contrast, in this scenario , 
the softness of household spending during the winter is assumed to persist as household confidence in the recovery falters , while the rebound in the housing market proves 
lackluster .  These conditions, in turn, lead to a slower pace of business investment and 
hiring .  All told,  real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 2 p ercent over the next two 
years, 1  percentage point lower than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate declines 
more gradually, edgin g down to 6 percent in  late 2016.  With a wider margin of resource 
slack than in the baseline, i nflation rises somewhat more slowly.  The federal funds rate 
lifts off in the first quarter of 2017, almost two years  later than in the baseline , and rises 
more  gradually  thereafter, reaching  2 percent by the end of 2018.  
Liftoff Tantrum 
In the baseline projection, term premiums rise gradually, contributing to the 
sizable increase in long -term interest rates.   However, the surprisingly large movements 
in yields in the summer of 2013 highlight the possibility that term and risk premiums may 
be more sensitive to the withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation than we have 
assumed .  In particular, these premiums may rise sha rply if the anticipation of 
conventional policy tightening triggers large outflows from fixed-income funds.  In this scenario, the approach of the federal funds rate’s departure from its  effective lower bound

  triggers just such a surge , with term premiums rising  120 basis points above the baseline 
by mid -2015, roughly double the increase in the 10- year term premium that we estimate 
occurred last summer .  The premium on corporate debt over comparable Treasur y 
securities also rise s, peaking in 2015:Q2 at around 70 basis points above the baseline.  
The resulting volatility drives the stock market down more than 10 percent relative to the 
baseline over the first half of 2015.  Even though t he market turmoil proves transient, 
premiums  remain elevated for some time and converge from above to their long-run 
values .  Nonetheless , the real economy suffers only modest damage, as households 
anticipate that a short, albeit intense, period of market turbulence will have only small effects on permanent income.  The endogenous decline in the expected federal funds rate path also offset s a small part of the rise in premiums.
2  All told, GDP growth is around 
½ percentage point lower in 2015, while unemployment is about ¼ percentage point higher in 2016 relative to the baseline.
3    
Supply -Side Damage 
Over  the past  three years, the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1  percentage 
point per year despite only moderate increases in real GDP , which led the staff to  mark 
down its estimate  of the pace of potential output growth in past Tealbooks.  However, 
some of the models we consult suggest that the damage to aggregate supply during the past several years may have been even greater than is assumed in the baseline projection.  In this scenario , structural productivity gains are assumed to have been  slower than in the 
baseline projection such that potential output has expanded at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent since 2011, ¼ percentage p oint per year lower than in the baseline.  As a 
result, the level of potential output in the second quarter of 2014 is almost 1  percent  
lower .  Going forward , potential GDP continues to grow at a 1¼ percent pace through 
2018, leaving the  level of potential output 4½ percent lower at the end of 2018 than in the 
baseline.   
Under these assumptions, r eal GDP rises at a rate of 2¾  percent this year  and 
next.  Thereafter, the pace of economic growth gradually slows , and real GDP rises at an 
                                                 
2 Most alternative scenarios using FRB/US assume that households, firms, and investors form 
expectations on the basis of reduced -form statistical relations typical of the last few decades of data.  In this 
scenario, given the central role of forward -looking financial variables, we assume instead that, once the 
first movements in premiums are realized in the first quarter of 2015, all agents perfectly anticipate the 
aggregate effects of thes e and all future movements in premiums.  
3 The abrupt increase in premiums shown in this scenario could result in a more severe drag on the 
real economy if the resulting deep capital losses lead to concerns about the solvency of leveraged financial 
institutions, amplifying the initial shock.

  annual rate of only 1¼ percent in 2017 and 2018.  Nonetheless, t he unemployment rate 
continues to decline rapidly, reaching 5 percent in  the middle of 2016.  With resource 
slack substantially narrower and productivity gains smaller, inflation rises to 2 percent in 
2016 and to nearly 2½ percent in  2018.  Initially, policy makers continue to perceive 
supply- side conditions  as consistent with the staff’s  baseline view .  However, a s evidence 
of the weaker  supply- side conditions mounts, their  perceptions gradually come into  line 
with reality  and are assumed to be fully adjusted by 2016.  Given the initial 
misperception of slack and the gradual response of inflation to higher resource utilization, the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, the same quarter as in the baseline, but it thereaf ter rises more steeply as 
policymakers recognize the weaker supply -side conditions . 
Low Inflation 
In the baseline projection, the recent low readings on inflation prove to be largely 
transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradually moves up tow ard 2  percent as 
the recovery continues.  This forecast is based on the staff’s assumption that long-run inflation expectations are firmly anchored at the Committee’s longer-run target of 
2 percent.  In this scenario, we assume  that the extended experience of below- target 
inflation has resulted in  a reduction of current long-run inflation expectations to about 
1½ percent  and that continued low inflation in the coming years lead s to further erosion 
of these expectations.   As a consequence, inflation is close  to 1 percent through 2018.  
Persistently low inflation in this scenario causes liftoff to occur in late 2018, more than 
three years later than in the baseline.   At that time, the unemployment rate has declined to 
4½ percent, ¾ percentage point below its natural rate.  However, despite this degree of 
labor market tightness, inflation projected one to two years ahead is still well below  the 
Committee’s  target as a result of the decline in long -horizon inflation expectations. 
Escalating Geopolitical Tensions 
In the staff’s baseline projection, tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain 
sufficiently contained so that they do not exert substantial effects on global markets.  In 
this scenario, we consider a major and sustained escalation in tensions, involving rising stresses between Russia and Ukraine and the West, the imposition of additional sanctions on Russia, and Russian counter actions, all of which severely affect global energy and 
financial markets and weaken confidence.  We assume t hat these geopolitical tensions 
remain highly elevated for about a year before gradually easing.

  These geopolitical developments affect the global economy through a number of 
channels.  First, our scenario assumes a deep curtailment of Russian oil export s, causing 
global oil prices to jump more than $40 per barrel and to remain high for the next year.  
Second, we have Russia cutting off natural gas exports to Europe.  Finally, in this unsettled environment, consumer and investor confidence falls and finan cial market 
stresses intensify, with corporate and household borrowing spreads rising and flight- to-
safety flows boosting the dollar. 
The combination of higher energy prices, falling confidence, and financial market 
stresses causes sharp contractions in real activity globally.  Real GDP in the AFEs falls about 3½ percent relative to the baseline by the end of next year, with Europe suffering disproportionately because of its dependence on Russian natural gas and its closer financial and economic ties to Rus sia.  Real GDP in the EMEs falls about 4  percent 
relative to the baseline by the end of next year —notwithstanding a sizable depreciation of 
EME currencies driven by flight -to-safety flows —as corporate and household borrowing 
costs rise substantially.  
U.S. real activity is depressed as higher oil prices lower real disposable income 
and reduce the return to investment.  Real net exports decline markedly in response to weaker foreign activity and a 5 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar.  These adverse effects are reinforced by a modest rise in corporate borrowing costs and a decline in confidence.  All told, U.S. real GDP growth is less than 2 percent in both 2014 and 2015, and the unemployment rate hovers around 6½ percent through the end of next yea r.  
Core PCE inflation is nearly unchanged from the baseline through the end of next year, as 
the upward impetus from higher oil prices is offset by weaker activity and a stronger 
dollar.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until early 2017.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget 
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
