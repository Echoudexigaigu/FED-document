Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received since the April T ealbook suggests that 
aggregate spending was even weaker early in th e year than we had anticipated.  However, 
given the ongoing improvement in other indi cators, we judge that the fundamental 
recovery dynamic remains in place, and that the first-quarter declines in GDP and GDI 
partly reflect a combination of statistical noise and transitory dow ndraft that will be 
halted or reversed.  Accordingly, we have marked up modestly our expectation for the 
growth of real GDP over the remainder of this year.  Still, for the year as a whole, our 
forecast now stands at an annual rate of just under 2½ percent, nearly ½ percentage point 
lower than in the previous Tealbook. 
One set of indicators that have gene rally continued to improve are those 
pertaining to the labor market.  In particular, the employme nt reports for April and May 
showed a slightly faster average pace of pa yroll employment gains and a notably larger 
decline in the unemployment rate in those m onths than we had projected.  Even after 
making allowance for the lower-than-anticipat ed labor force participation rate, labor 
market conditions appear to be somewhat be tter than we had expected in the April 
Tealbook.   
To help reconcile the divergent signals in the recent data about the labor and 
product markets, we have once again adjust ed our supply-side assumptions, marking 
down our outlook for potential output growth  and nudging down our estimate of the 
natural rate of unemployment in late 2013 a nd in 2014.  These adjustments are explained 
in greater detail in our discu ssion of the labor market outlook. 
We have also marked down our expectat ions for both real GDP growth and the 
federal funds rate in the longer term.  (T hese adjustments can be seen in the box 
“Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP” and are discussed in more 
detail later in this document.)  The lower equi librium level of the fede ral funds rate led us 
to revise down our forecast trajectory of borrowing rates.  However, our projection 
proceeds from the assumption that these lower borrowing rates will not provide 
additional support for aggregate demand afte r households and businesses take into 
account the less optimistic outlook for ec onomic growth in the longer run.

Revisions  to the Staff  Projection  since  the Previous  SEP
The  FOMC  last published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP)  following  the March  
2014  FOMC  meeting.  The  table  below  summarizes  revisions  to the staff  economic  projection  
since  the March  Tealbook.  Reflecting  incoming  data,  GDP  growth  in the first  half of this  year  
is now  estimated  to have  been  somewhat  weaker  than  the staff  expected  in the March  
Tealbook,  while  the unemployment  rate  has declined  by more  than  we had  projected.  In 
2015  and  2016,  the staff  projection  for GDP  growth  has  not  changed  much  from  our March  
projection,  but  the unemployment  rate  remains  on a lower  path.
As discussed  in the box  “Changes  to the Longer-Run  Outlook ” in this  section,  we also  made  
some  downward  adjustments  to estimates  of GDP  growth  and  interest  rates  in the longer  
run. We now  see longer-run  GDP growth  as 2 percent  (rather  than  2% percent)  and we have 
similarly  taken  down  our estimate  of the long-run  nominal  federal  funds  rate  to 3% percent.  
The lower  long-run  interest  rate implies  a lower  intercept  for our policy  rule that,  when  
combined  with  the lower  level of slack  in this projection,  prescribes  a path of the federal  
funds  rate that  is little  changed  after  liftoff. 1 The liftoff  date itself  (the second  quarter  of 
2015)  has not changed  from  March.
The staff  projection  for both  overall  and core PCE inflation  is a bit lower  than in the March  
projection,  largely  reflecting  the small  adjustments  we made  to our inflation  projection  this 
round.  We continue  to project  that  both  core  and headline  inflation  will remain  below  the 
Committee's  2 percent  objective  through  2016.

All told, our forecast for the level of r eal GDP at the end of 2016 is somewhat 
below that in the April Tealbook, with this revision reflecting both the weaker incoming 
data on spending and, after this year, our m odestly more pessimistic assumptions about 
potential output growth over the medium term.  Even with these changes, we still expect 
economic activity to expand more rapidly over th e medium term than in recent years, and 
fast enough to complete the job of eliminating economic slack duri ng the first half of 
2016, somewhat earlier than in the previous pr ojection.  Our current forecast anticipates 
that real GDP growth will average 2½ percent this year and then rise around 3 percent per 
year in 2015 and 2016.  Meanwhile, we anticipat e that the unemployment rate will fall 
from 6¼ percent in the current quarter to 6 percent by the end of 2014 and then gradually 
move down to 5 percent by the end of 2016 (nearly ¼ percentage point below the 
assumed level of the natural rate at that time). 
With regard to inflation, the incoming data indicate somewhat faster increases in 
both overall and core PCE prices in the curren t quarter than we had anticipated in the 
April Tealbook, but this upside surprise wa s concentrated in a handful of volatile 
categories and otherwise had litt le effect on our inflation fo recast.  Indeed, our medium-
term projection for inflation is slightly lower than in the Ap ril Tealbook, reflecting a 
reassessment of where the inflation rate would settle in the absence of economic slack if 
the current level of long-run inflation expect ations were maintained.  We now put this 
level of inflation about ¼ pe rcentage point below the FO MC’s longer-run objective of 
2 percent.  In light of this adjustment, we  have trimmed our forecasts for both core and 
topline PCE price inflation ove r the medium term by about one-tenth of a percentage 
point.  With these revisions, core PCE inflation creeps up to 1¾ percent by 2016 and 
overall PCE price inflation r uns at about 1½ percent.  
In the Risks and Uncertainty section, we  provide our views on the degree of 
uncertainty attending our projections for r eal GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and 
inflation.  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
Our assumptions about the current LSAP program are unchanged.  We assume 
that asset purchases will continue to slow at  a measured pace and will conclude before 
the end of this year, leavi ng the cumulative amount of purchases under the current 
program at close to $1.5 trillion.

As in the April Tealbook, we assume that the federal funds rate  will lift off from 
its effective lower bound two quarters after the e nd of asset purchases.  We construe the 
two-quarter lag to be consistent with the Committee’s view, expressed in its March and 
April statements, that “it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate for a considerable time  after the asset purchase program ends.”  
Following liftoff, the federal funds rate is assumed to follow the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Tayl or (1999) policy rule.  Th e downward revision to the 
equilibrium federal funds rate amounts to a ¼ percentage point reduc tion in the intercept 
of the rule.  Given this adjustment and the narrower anticipated output gap, the rule puts 
the average federal funds rate at about 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, roughly 
unchanged from its projected le vel in the April Tealbook.   
Other Interest Rates 
The projected path for the 10-year Treas ury yield has been marked down notably, 
reflecting our downward revisions to the trajectory of the fede ral funds rate in the longer 
run.  Even so, we continue to anticipate a si gnificant increase in Tr easury yields over the 
projection period, primarily because of the movement of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short-term  interest rates as well as the gradual 
waning of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.  All told, the Treasury yield 
is projected to rise to slightly  above 4 percent by the end of 2016. 
Investment-grade corporate bond and mort gage spreads are little changed since 
the April Tealbook.  Consequently, our forecas ts for corporate bond yields and mortgage 
rates over the medium term have been revised essentially in line with our revisions to the 
path of the Treasury yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
Equity prices have increased at a somewh at faster pace than we had projected in 
April.  As a result, the trajec tory of stock prices is a bit higher in 2014.  Over the medium 
term, our view about projected stock prices  is roughly unchanged and implies an average 
annual rate of increase in thes e prices of around 6 percent.  
Our forecast for house prices is little ch anged since April.  In recent months, 
house prices have continued to post robust increases, but at a slower pace than a year 
earlier.  Overall, we continue to expect hous e price appreciation to slow from 11 percent 
in 2013 to an average of roughly 5 percent per year from 2014 to 2016.

Fiscal Policy 
Our assumptions for fiscal policy are th e same as in the April Tealbook.  Even 
with the extended unemployment compensati on (EUC) program having expired at the 
beginning of this year, the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy changes should 
diminish this year relative to last, as the ra te of decline in real federal purchases slows 
and the effects of various tax increases put in place last year wane.  We expect the 
restraint on real GDP growth from fiscal policy actions (excluding multiplier effects) by 
all levels of government to diminish fr om about 1 percentage point in 2013 to 
½ percentage point this year, ¼ percenta ge point in 2015, and roughly zero in 2016.   
As in the previous projection, we expect  the federal budget deficit to narrow from 
4 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2013 to around 2½ percent of GDP by fiscal 2016, 
reflecting continued spending re straint and a strengthening of tax receipts in line with 
anticipated increases in overall economic activ ity.  As a result, fede ral debt held by the 
public is expected to remain roughly stable at a little more than 70 percent of GDP over 
the medium term. 
Foreign Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP growth slowed in the fi rst quarter to an an nual rate of just 
2 percent, ¼ percentage point lower than an ticipated in the April Tealbook, as a marked 
reduction in growth in emerging Asia and in Ca nada more than offset faster growth in 
Japan.  In part, the deceleration of foreign activity reflected a widespread weakening of 
trade flows, but country-specific factors al so played a role, including severe winter 
weather in Canada and the lagged effect of measures taken late last year by Chinese 
authorities to curb excessive credit and investment growth.  As Canada’s economy 
bounces back, policy in China becomes more  supportive, and U.S. economic activity 
rebounds, foreign growth is expected to step up to an annual rate of 2½ percent in the 
current quarter and then rise  further to about 3¼ percent over the remainder of the 
medium term, close to our assumption for th e growth of foreign potential output.  Apart 
from our downward revisions to the current quarter, this projection is little changed 
relative to the pr evious Tealbook. 
The broad nominal index for the dollar is little changed on net since the previous 
Tealbook, as an appreciation of the dollar against the currenci es of the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs), particularly the euro, was balanced by depreciation against the 
currencies of the emerging market economies (EMEs).  Going forward, the broad real

dollar depreciates about 1¼ percent per year, ro ughly in line with our projection in the 
previous Tealbook, as China and other emergi ng Asian economies allow their currencies 
to strengthen.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
The spot price of Brent crude  oil is little changed from  the time of the previous 
Tealbook, closing near $110 per barrel on June 10.  Developments in Russia and Ukraine 
have continued to have only modest effects on oil prices, and upwar d pressure on prices 
from the continued disruption of Libyan e xports has been counterbalanced by increased 
production elsewhere, including in the United States.  We project that the price of 
imported oil will average a bit more than $100 pe r barrel in the current quarter and then 
decline gradually over th e remainder of the forecast peri od, reaching $89 per barrel at the 
end of 2016.  This trajectory is lit tle changed from the April Tealbook. 
On balance, nonfuel commodity prices have  moved lower in recent weeks.  After 
large increases earlier this year, prices of several crops (parti cularly corn and coffee) have 
retreated in the face of improved supply condi tions.  Iron ore prices fell sharply, likely on 
account of idiosyncratic supply developments , while copper prices edged down a bit on 
net.  Over the forecast period, as in the previous Tealbook, we expect our overall 
commodity price index to remain about flat. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The BEA’s latest estimate put the decline in real GDP in the first quarter at an 
annual rate of 1 percent, and source data that have become available since that release 
point to an even larger declin e in the neighborhood of 1½ percent.1  We are suspicious 
that aggregate demand weakened as much as this GDP estimate suggests, and the 
reported decline in real GDI is also puzzling to us in some re spects.  This view, which is 
corroborated by a range of indicators, incl uding most measures of labor market 
conditions, leads us to expect th at some of the large downside surprise in real GDP in the 
first quarter will be reversed.  Accordingl y, and consistent with available monthly 
spending estimates, we are penciling in that real GDP will increase at an outsized annual 
rate of 4¼ percent in the current quarter, ¾ pe rcentage point faster than the increase we 
                                                 
1 We received the first-quarter estimates from the Quarterly Service Survey too late to process 
their implications for the GDP projection.

anticipated in the April Tealbook.  We still expect real GDP to  increase at an annual rate 
of 3½ percent in the second half of the year. 
Household Spending 
Available data and indicators suggest th at real personal consumption expenditures 
(PCE) are on track to increase at an annual rate of 3 percent ove r the first half of the year, 
roughly in line with our exp ectations in the April Tealbook.  In our assessment, PCE has 
been influenced on the upside by this year’s  reported step-up in consumption of health-
care services associated with the Affordable Care Act, but on the downside by the loss of 
income from the expiration of the EUC progr am at the beginning of this year; taken 
together, these programmatic changes roughly counterbalance in this forecast.  
Meanwhile, light vehicle sales climbed to  a post-recession high in May after having 
slipped earlier in the year.  More broadly, after having moved up at an average annual 
rate of just 2 percent over much of the rec overy, real PCE seems to have accelerated in 
recent quarters, consistent with increase s in household wealth and the step-up in 
disposable personal income over the past year or  so.  In the second half  of this year, real 
PCE growth is projected to move up to an annua l rate of nearly 4 percent, much the same 
as in the April Tealbook. 
Meanwhile, incoming data on housing construction have again proved 
disappointing.  In April, single-family housi ng starts were little changed, and permit 
issuance—which is measured more accurately than starts and tends to be less sensitive to weather fluctuations—continued to track side ways, suggesting that the weakness earlier 
in the year was due less to a dverse weather, and more to a lackluster underlying trend of 
activity, than we had thought.  At the same time, activity in the multifamily sector has 
continued to be relatively strong, on balance, in recent months, while the latest readings 
on pending and existing home sale s suggest that activity in the resale market is leveling 
out after having moved down steadily since la st summer.  All told, we responded to the 
news about single-family construction by ma rking down our forecast for housing activity 
in the near term, and we now anticipate a noticeably less pronounced acceleration in real 
residential investment in the s econd half of this year.   
Business Investment 
Incoming data on nonresidential construction also have been weaker than we had 
anticipated.  After folding in  the latest monthly estimates  of construction spending, we 
now estimate that real expe nditures on nonresiden tial structures ex cluding drilling and

mining fell at a double-digit annual rate in th e first quarter, with part of the decline 
attributable to an expiring tax incentive for renewable energy that pulled forward some 
outlays on windpower structures into 2013.  Howe ver, we also took some signal from the 
incoming data and marked down the projected rate of increase in  nonresidential building 
outlays, on net, over the next few quarters.  M eanwhile, we still expect real investment in 
drilling and mining structures to  post a moderate net gain in the first half of this year, 
supported by high oil prices and the ongoi ng boost from new drilling technologies. 
Real spending on equipment and intangibles (E&I) seems poised for a rebound in 
the second quarter following a first-quarter lu ll.  In recent months, both orders and 
shipments of nondefense capital goods have ac celerated a fair bit, and, with orders 
continuing to run well above shipments, we anticipate further moderate increases in 
shipments in the next few months.  In a ddition, indicators of business spending on motor 
vehicles have strengthened of late.  More broadly, we still view the trajectory of business 
output growth and forward-looking indicators as  being consistent with moderate spending 
increases in this sector.  Accordingly, E&I spending grow th is expected to rebound to 
10 percent in the second quarter and then ri se to an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the 
second half of the year.  This near-term gr owth outlook is up a touch, on balance, from 
April.  
Incoming data now show inventory investment as having subtracted about 
1½ percentage points (annua l rate) from the percentage chan ge in real GDP in the first 
quarter after having boosted GDP growth by around ¾ percentage point in the second 
half of 2013.  This drop-off, which pushed inventory investment well below its average 
level over the past few years, appears to have been amplified by a sizable drawdown of 
heating fuels (such as natural gas, coal, and fuel oil) during the co ld winter.  Estimates 
from the staff’s flow-of-goods system sugge st that inventory investment in these 
categories rebounded somewhat in April.  Outside of the energy sector, available 
indicators do not point to  significant inventory imbalan ces in most industries.  
Consequently, we expect the pace of stockbuild ing to gradually rec over over the course 
of the year to levels in line w ith our April Tealbook projection.  
Government 
Real federal purchases rose at an annual  rate of ¾ percent in the first quarter, 
partly reflecting a reversal of the effects of last Oct ober’s government shutdown.  We 
expect federal purchases to fall at an annual rate of roughly 3 percent over the rest of the

year, in line with its downward trend, reflecting ongoing fiscal consolidation and 
reductions in spending on overseas military operations.   
We estimate that real state and local purch ases registered a moderate decrease in 
the first quarter because of a sharp decline in  construction outlays a pparently associated 
with the inclement winter w eather.  We expect real purchases by state and local 
governments to increase at a modest annual rate of just above 1 pe rcent over the current 
and next quarter as the weat her-related drag on constructi on unwinds and as employment 
by these governments continues its slow expansion.   
Foreign Trade  
Exports have been volatile in recent qua rters, plunging at an annual rate of 
8¾ percent in the first quarter following a 9½ percent surge in  the fourth quarter of 2013.  
This swing in part reflects sharp movements in a few idiosyncratic categories such as 
petroleum and agricultural goods.  In the curren t quarter, we expect e xports to rise at a 
6¼ percent pace and then decelerate only a bit to a 4¼ percent pace in the third quarter, 
supported by the anticipated rebound of forei gn demand.  Real imports are projected to 
rise 3½ percent on average in the second and th ird quarters, boosted by the solid increase 
in U.S. GDP during these quarters but held dow n a bit by the continued decline in real oil 
imports.  Altogether, the external  sector is expected to be a slight positive for real GDP 
growth in the second and third quarters. 
The Industrial Sector 
Manufacturing output rose at a modest annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, 
with the monthly pattern refl ecting weather-related disruptio ns early in the quarter.  
Available data suggest a solid gain in factory activity in May, and we expect output to 
expand at a moderate pace over the near term , consistent with positive readings on new 
orders from the national and regional surv eys and with automakers’ assembly plans. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Beyond the near term, our real GDP growth outlook is about unchanged from the 
April Tealbook.  Longer-term borrowing rates fo llow a lower trajectory in this Tealbook 
than in the April iteration, re flecting our assumption of a lo wer equilibrium real federal 
funds rate.  However, these lower borrowing rates do not boost spe nding in our forecast 
because households and businesses are assu med to also take into account the less 
optimistic outlook for real GDP growth in the lo nger term.  All told, we now forecast that

real GDP growth will rise from 2½ percent in 2014 to an average of around 3 percent in 
2015 and 2016. 
Our projection that real GDP growth will step up over the medium term—even as 
interest rates rise—reflects our expectation that some of the forces that have been holding 
back growth in recent years will recede furthe r.  In particular, the restraint from changes 
in fiscal policy has waned this year and should continue to fade  as federal purchases 
decline less sharply, state and local purchases rise modestly, and the drag from earlier tax 
increases diminishes.  In addition, we look for mortgage credit to gradually become more 
broadly available, thereby providing some boost to demand.  These developments, along 
with improving labor market c onditions, are expected to foster a growing sense among 
households and firms that the downside risks to the recovery have less ened; in turn, this 
growing confidence should provide additional support to household spending, business 
investment, and hiring.   
These influences are most apparent in our projection for consumer spending.  In 
particular, we anticipate that the fading eff ects of last year’s tax increases, gains in 
household wealth resulting from rising hous e and equity prices, and anticipated 
improvements in consumer confidence will boos t real PCE growth from 2¼ percent in 
2013 to 3½ percent in 2014 and in  2015.  We look for spending growth to then slow to 
3 percent in 2016 as the boost to growth from these influences wanes.  These projected 
rates of increase are a little  slower than in the April Tealbook, largely due to our 
downward revisions to potentia l output (and, hence, perman ent income) in the medium 
term. 
As in the April Tealbook, rising inco me and confidence are expected to 
eventually fuel a pickup in household forma tion that will feed through to increases in 
residential construction.  The step-up in hom ebuilding would be more pronounced if not 
for rising mortgage rates and the limited ava ilability of buildable lots and specialized 
inputs.  All told, we expect gains in residen tial investment to increase from 4 percent in 
2014 to an average of 14 percent in 2015 and 2016.  The pace of recovery this year is 
noticeably more restrained than in the April Tealbook but is essentially unchanged 
thereafter.   
Real outlays on E&I are expected to in crease 4½ percent in 2014 and 5½ percent 
in 2015 and in 2016.  This lackluster outlook re flects our projection th at business output 
will rise at only a moderate pace over the medium term.  For the same reason, we

continue to expect expenditures on nonresidenti al structures to rise at only a subdued 
pace over the forecast period. 
The external sector is expected to have a neutral influence on the growth rate of 
real GDP going forward.  The projected st rengthening of foreign growth and the 
anticipated depreciation  of the dollar should support solid increases in real  exports, which 
rise 4½ percent in the sec ond half of 2014 before picking up to an average pace of 
5¼ percent in 2015 and 2016.  (Also see the box “Natural Gas Exports and 
Manufacturing Competitiveness.”)  Real imports are expected to rise at an average rate of 
4½ percent per year in 2015 and 2016, buoyed by strengthening U.S. activity but held 
back by the depreciation of the do llar and by falling real oil imports. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION  
Recent Developments and Near-Term  Outlook for the Labor Market 
The latest data on the labor market suggest that conditions have been improving at 
a slightly faster pace than we  anticipated in the April Tealbook.  Total nonfarm payrolls 
rose at an average pace of 250,000 in April and May, about 40,000 more per month than 
we had expected.  In the household survey, the unemployment rate fell 0.4 percentage 
point in April to 6.3 percent and then held at that level in May, about ¼ percentage point 
below our projections in the previous Tealbook.  However, th e labor force participation 
rate also fell 0.4 percentage poi nt in April, whereas we ha d expected relatively little 
change.  This weakness of participati on likely implies that the recent fall in 
unemployment overstates somewhat the im provement in labor market conditions; 
nevertheless, other indicators of labor unde rutilization, such as U-5 (which includes 
marginally attached workers) and the percenta ge of the labor force working part time for 
economic reasons, also declined  in the past two months.  
During the next few months, nonfarm pa yrolls are forecast to increase 230,000 
per month, a slightly faster pace of increase than we had anticipated.  We project the 
unemployment rate to remain at  6.3 percent in June and then  to drift down to 6.1 percent 
by September, while the labor force particip ation rate is expected to edge up from 
62.8 percent in May to 62.9 percent in June and then to remain flat at that level. 
Potential GDP and the Natu ral Rate of Unemployment  
As described earlier, data received sin ce the April Tealbook point to a noticeably 
lower level of real GDP and a significantly  lower unemployment rate in the current

 Natural Gas Exports  and Manufacturing Competitiveness  
Over the past decade, U.S. natural gas production (the black line in figure 1 on the following 
page) has increased sharply as new methods, including hydraulic fracturing and horizontal 
drilling, have been applied to previously undeveloped shale gas formations.  Without  
infrastructure to export this gas, the gains in U.S. production have pushed down natural gas 
prices in the United States relative to those in Europe and Asia ( see figure 2).  Commentators 
have suggested t hat the  low price of natural gas in the United States  compared with  prices 
prevailing abroad  could provide an important boost to the competitiveness of  U.S.  
manufacturing .  However, the low domestic price of gas  has also led to a flurry of  projects and 
proposals to build the n ecessary infrastructure to support  gas exports, thereby allowing gas 
producers to benefit from higher global prices but potentially eroding the cos t advantage of 
domestic industry.  This  tradeoff has stoked controversy over whether policymakers should 
encourage or discourage the development  of export facilities .1     
Notwithstanding this controversy , the United States is already set to become a net exporter of 
liquefied natural gas (LNG), although the full extent of the increase in exports remains uncertain.  
Table 1 reviews prospective  additions to LNG export capacity around the world over the coming  
years .  In the United States, almost 20 billion cubic meters (bcm) of export capacity is presently  
under construction, representing 3 percent of current U.S. production.  Planned or  proposed  
export terminals  in the United States account for almost  half of the slated expansion of global 
capacity.  C onstructing export terminals is expensive and it is unlikely that all proposed U.S. 
export terminals will be completed.  Nonetheless, U.S. completions will likely be sizable, and the 
Department of Energy project s U.S. net exports of natural gas (the red line in figure 1)  to rise 
over the next decade.2      
Overall, we do not see increased natural gas exports having much negative effect on the 
comp etitiveness of domestic manufacturing  as a whole.  First, empirical evidence suggests that 
low prices  relative to those prevailing abroad are providing a significant  competitive boost to only  
the most intensive users of natural gas, which are  listed  at the top of t able 2 .  Staff estimates, 
based on the historical relationship between relative natural gas prices and industrial production 
across industries, suggest that, all else being equal, lower natural gas prices could eventually 
boost output and employment in  industries that use natural gas most intensively , by as mu ch as 
40 percent.  However, as table 1 makes clear, these  users account for only a small share of 
industrial production, suggesting  that the effects  on the U.S. manufacturing sector as a whole of 
an export -led increase in natural gas prices are likely to be small.3   
                                                 
1 Unlike crude oil, there is no legal ban on exporting natural gas.  However, exporting natural gas requires 
authorization from both the Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
2 Recent tensions between Ukraine an d Russia has rai sed interest in the possibility of U.S. exports lessening 
European dependence on Russian natural gas.  However, the near -term prospects for U.S. gas exports amount to 
only 15 percent of Russia’s exports to Euro pe, making it unlikely that the United States  will provide much of a 
substitute anytime soon.    
3 Our discussion is limited to the effect of natural gas prices on downstream industries that use natural gas as 
an input.  The recent energy boom has raised production in industries closely related to the extraction of oil and 
natural gas, a development which has provided a substantial boost to overall industrial production as discussed in 
the April Tealbook box “The Effects of the Energy Boom on Industrial Production.”

Second, the effect of increased exports on the relative price of natural gas could be fairly modest.  
In part this reflects the flatness of the U.S. natural gas supply curve, with a small increase in price 
likely to elicit a large increase in supply.  Recent studies suggest that an increase in exports of the 
size shown in figure 1, relative to a baseline of no exports, will likely be associated with an 
increase in natural gas prices of only about  10 percent. 4  Consistent with this assessment, and as 
shown in figure 2, the nat ural gas futures market is pricing in only a moderate increase in 
domestic prices over the next decade.  Additionally , U.S. gas prices are unlikely to fully converge 
to European or Asian levels as transporting LNG remains costly, adding $6 to $7 per million British 
thermal units to cover the costs of liquefying and cooling the natural gas to minus 260 degrees 
Fahrenheit during transit.  Thus, the most  intensive users of natural gas  among U.S. 
manufacturers are likely to continue to enjoy a cost advantage over foreign competitors even as 
the United States becomes a sizable exporter of LNG.

quarter than we had projected in the April Tealbook.  Absent adjustments to our supply-
side assumptions, these data would have implied a 0.3 percentage point wider GDP gap 
and a 0.3 percentage point narrower  unemployment rate gap in th e current quarter than in 
the previous Tealbook.  To help  resolve some of the tensi on between these apparently 
divergent signals for resour ce utilization, we adjusted our assumptions about both 
potential output growth and th e natural rate of unemployment.   We now assume that the 
natural rate declined slightly faster last year and r eached its assumed long-run level of 
5¼ percent this quarter, whereas we previously assumed that it would not attain that level 
until mid-2015.  Taken together, the lower unemp loyment rate and the lower natural rate 
leave us with an unemployment rate gap in th e current quarter that is only 0.1 percentage 
point narrower than we had anticipated in April.  Mo reover, we marked down our 
estimate of potential output growth by ½ percentage point in 2014 and by ¼ percentage 
point in 2015; our revision in 2014 leaves the output gap in the curr ent quarter unrevised 
from the April Tealbook.  With these revise d assumptions, potential output growth steps 
up from 1¼ percent in 2014 to  1¾ percent in 2015 and to nearly 2 percent in 2016. 
The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market 
With GDP projected to rise at an abov e-trend pace throughout the medium term, 
total payroll employment is  projected to increase at an average of 210,000 per month 
throughout this period, nearly unre vised from the April Tealbook. 
Starting from its somewhat lower value of  6¼ percent in the current quarter, the 
unemployment rate is projected to fall to 6 pe rcent by the fourth quarter of this year and 
then to decline about ½ percentage point per year, ending 2016 at 5 percent—nearly 
¼ percentage point below the staff’s assumpti on for the natural rate of unemployment at 
that time and a little below our e xpectation in the April Tealbook.   
Resource Utilization   
We anticipate that the unemployment rate  will be about 1 percentage point above 
our revised estimate of the natural rate in the second quarter; on our revised assumptions 
for potential GDP, we put th e corresponding GDP gap at 2¾ percent.  Going forward, 
resource slack is expected to diminish  gradually, and by the middle of 2016, the 
unemployment rate gap and the output gap are essentially closed.  In the manufacturing 
sector, the current level of capacity utilizati on is nearly 2¼ percenta ge points below its 
long-run average and is projected to rise to its long-run average by the end of 2016.

 The Outlook for Prices and Compensation 
After rising at an annual rate of 1½ percen t in the first quarter, total PCE prices 
are expected to increase 2 percent in the cu rrent quarter.  Similarly, core PCE price 
inflation is expected to rise from 1¼ percen t last quarter to 1¾ percent in the second 
quarter.  These second-quarter forecasts are about ¼ percentage point higher than in the 
April Tealbook, with the small revision reflecting data surprises in categories from which 
we tend to take little signal, including an outsized March increase in nonmarket prices 
and an April jump in airfares and motor vehicl e prices.  In the sec ond half of this year, 
both total and core PCE price in flation are anticipated to step  down to an annual rate of 
1½ percent, with part of the sl owing attributable to residual seasonality in the latter half 
of the year.2 
Movements in retail energy prices have b een subdued of late.  Electricity prices 
retreated in April after ha ving been boosted, on net, by strong demand stemming from 
unseasonably cold weather in preceding months; other energy prices have been fairly 
quiescent.  Much as in the April Tealbook, we  project that consumer energy prices will 
increase at an average annual rate of nearly  2 percent in the second and third quarters, 
down from an increase of 4 percent in the fi rst quarter.  We continue to expect modest 
declines in PCE energy prices in 2015 a nd 2016, reflecting the downward trajectory of 
futures prices for crude oil and natural gas. 
By contrast, retail food prices moved up at a brisk pace over the three-month 
period ending in April, partly reflecting lo wer pork supplies that ha ve been constrained 
by a virus that has afflicted many herds.  Howe ver, recent readings on spot prices suggest 
that upward pressure on farm prices has begun to wane.  Accordingly, we look for PCE 
food price inflation to step down from an annual rate of 2½ percen t in the first half of this 
year to 1½ percent in the second half.  In  2015 and 2016, we project that PCE food prices 
will rise at a pace slightly below core inflation.  
Core import prices have turned upward in recent quarters after having fallen 
through much of 2013.  In the first half of this  year, core import pr ice inflation is now 
projected to come in at an annual rate of 1¾ percent; it is then expected to step down to 
                                                 
2 As Ekaterina Peneva showed in her nonfinancial  briefing on June 2, over the past decade PCE 
price inflation has tended to slow somewhat over the second half of the year—a pattern that we think arises, 
in part, because the BEA computes the PCE price aggregate using highly disaggregated price series that are 
often not seasonally adjusted.

1 percent in the second half, held back by lagged effects from previous declines in 
commodity prices.  In 2015 and 2016, we projec t that core import prices will rise only 
about 1¼ percent per year, a pace that is in  line with flat commodity prices and our 
assumed pace of dollar depreciation.  This proj ection implies that import prices will have 
little effect on PCE price infla tion throughout the medium term. 
Readings on longer-term infl ation expectations have remained stable.  The final 
May reading on median 5-to-10-year-ahead in flation expectations from the Michigan 
survey stood at 2.8 percent, within the rela tively narrow range seen in recent years.  
Expectations for PCE price inflation over the ne xt 10 years, as measured by the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2 percent in the second quarter.  Similarly, 
TIPS-based measures of longer-term infla tion compensation were little changed, on 
balance, since the April Tealbook.  
Based on a reassessment of several of our empirical models, we have nudged 
down our estimate of where PCE price inflati on would settle in the absence of economic 
slack and if the current level of longer-run inflation expectat ions were maintained.  On 
current evidence, we put that level at around 1¾ per cent rather than th e 1.9 percent that 
was implicit in our previous projection.3  
Amid stable long-run inflation expecta tions and with gradually diminishing 
margins of slack, core PCE inflation is expect ed to edge upward at a slightly slower pace 
than we anticipated in the April Tealbook, from 1½ percent in 2014 to 1¾ percent in 
2016.  Given the slight downward trajectory for energy prices, total PCE inflation is 
projected to run at 1½ percent, a bit below co re inflation, over most of the medium term.  
Therefore, even though we expect the output ga p to be closed one qua rter earlier in 2016 
than we had previously thought, total PCE infl ation at the end of the medium term is 
expected to remain ½ percentage point be low the Committee’s longe r-run objective of 
2 percent.  
The incoming data suggest that labor co mpensation has continued to rise at a 
modest pace.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have 
risen at an annual rate of 2½ pe rcent in the first quarter of th e year—a bit softer than we 
had anticipated in April.  Other measures of compensation have shown somewhat slower 
                                                 
3 This reassessment was discussed by Deb Lindner in a memo sent to the FOMC on June 4 titled 
“Why Is Inflation Persistently Low in the Judgmental Forecast?”

increases of late:  The employ ment cost index (ECI) for private-industry workers rose at 
an annual rate of only 1 per cent in the first quarter of the year, and average hourly 
earnings has continued to post moderate in creases through May after increasing at an 
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter .  We expect the tightening of the labor 
market over the medium term to gradually pus h up the rate of increase in compensation 
per hour to 3¼ percent in 2016.  These projected increases are a little slower than we had 
anticipated in April, reflecting th e lower trend in price inflation. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We have extended the staff’s forecast beyond the medium term using the 
FRB/US model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side  conditions, fiscal policy, 
and other factors.  The c ontour of the long-term outl ook depends on the following key 
assumptions: 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) rule.  This policy rule now assumes a 
long-run equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3¾ percent, 
revised down from 4 percent as of the previous Tealbook.  (See the box “Changes to the Longer-Run Outlook” for th e rationale for this change.)   
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by 2021.  
 Risk premiums on corporate equities continue to decrease, on balance, toward 
their longer-run levels, wh ile those on corporate bonds are slightly below their 
longer-run levels at the start of the extended outlook.   
 The federal budget deficit begins to widen after 2017, primarily reflecting 
fast-rising transfer paymen ts for retirement and health-care programs.  The 
ratio of federal debt to GDP is above 70 percent in 2017 and edges up 
thereafter.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar moves down about 1¼ percent 
in 2017—the same pace as in 2016—and stays constant thereafter.  The price of crude oil holds steady in  real terms.  Foreign real GDP rises at an annual 
rate of about 3 percent from 2017 to 2020. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is 5¼ percent, and potential GDP rises 
around 2 percent per year on average from 2017 to 2020.

 Changes to the Longer -Run Outlook  
In this Tealbook, w e have lowered our assumption for the annual rate  of real GDP 
growth in the longer run from 2¼  percent to 2  percent.1  We have also lowered  our 
assumptions for the longer- run values of interest rates, reducing the nominal federal 
funds rate from 4  percent to 3¾  percent and the nominal  10-year Treasury yield from 
4¾ percent to 4½  percent.  Because we continue to assume that inflation will be 
2 percent  in the longer run, in line with the Committee’s stated objective, these 
changes in nominal interest rates reflect  a reduction in equilibrium real rates.  
Our downward revision to longer- run potential output growth is largely the result of  
revisions to expected  labor productivity  growth .  One key factor motivating the 
revision is  a reassessment of the likely role of improvements in labor quality in future 
years .  We now expect labor quality to flatten out  in the longer run  (rather than 
continuing  to edge higher) because cohorts  entering the labor force have essentially 
the same educational attainment as those retiring , and because the retirement  of the 
baby- boom  generation  reduces the share of workers in their most -productive years.2   
The table below compares our longer- term  outlook for  real GDP with those of some 
outside forecasters .  Our outlook is  somewhat below  that of  private forecasters but  is 
in line with the CBO’s projection . 
Our decision to reduce the assumed values for real interest rates  in the longer run  
reflects our assessment of the n et effects of a number of factors.  Looking over a 
broad span of time, our assumption for longer- run potential GDP reflects a judgment 
that potential growth in the years ahead will be lower than it was in the past .  For 
example, according to the staff’s  estimates, potential GDP rose 3  percent per year 
from 199 7 to 2005—a period chosen because the unemployment rate is near staff 
estimates of its natural rate at both ends.  Over that period, the real federal funds rate

economic conditions are assumed to have returned to their long -run equilibrium.

 averaged 2  percent.  On our analysis, most of the  slowdown in potential GDP growth  
relative to that  earlier period reflects demographic factors, including lower population 
growth and declines in labor force participation associated with baby -boomer 
retirements.  Standard models predict that  lower potential output growth will lead to 
lower real interest rates, mostly  because, other factors held constant, less investment 
is required when the workforce is growing less rapidly.   
We also give some weight to the possibility that households ’ desired  rate of  saving 
may be higher than in the past .  It is possible, for example, that the financial crisis has 
left a lasting impression on households, raising risk aversion  and thus leading to an 
increased desire to save and less of a desire to  spend, which w ould put downward 
pressure on interest rates.  Rising income inequality may also work to boost  the 
aggregate saving  rate of the economy  if high -income households have greater saving 
rates  than lower-income households . 
International considerations may mitigate the effects of these domestic 
developments .  In a recent study, the IMF presents evidence that over the past 
15 years  long -term interest rates in advanced economies have moved together  to a 
much greater degree than in earlier periods, suggesting that the integration of global 
financial markets  may be more important than in the past  and that U.S. interest rates 
may depend more on global GDP growth than domestic GDP growth .3  Our forecast  is 
that longer -run world output growth will be about the same as in the pre- crisis period, 
reflecting the balancing of some offsetting factors:  While the growth rates of the 
United States, other advanced economies, and China are expected to slow, that 
slowing is about offset by the increasing importance of China and other fast -growing 
economies.  Perhaps even more important , if high -export countries such as China 
succeed in rebalancing  their economies toward more domestic consumption, there 
could be some upward pressure on world interest rates. 
On balance, we conclude that real interest rates are likely to be somewhat lower in 
the longer run than we had previously judged, with the slower expected pace of  U.S. 
potential GDP growth playing the most significant  role in our reassessment .     
Finally, we should emphasize the  high degree of uncertainty around these estimates.  
One study  report s a standard error around a real- time estimate of the long -run real 
federal funds rate of around  2½ percent age points , so that a 70 percent confidence 
interval around our estimate of 1¾  percent would run from negative ¾ percent to 
4¼ percent.4  That study  suggests trend output growth can be estimated somewhat 
more precisely, with a standard error of just over ½  percentage point.  Uncertainty 
about trend outp ut growth and equilibrium interest rates 10 years ahead  would be 
greater than suggested by these point -in-time estimates .

With the federal funds rate gradually risi ng, real GDP growth sl ows to 2½ percent 
in 2017.  The unemployment rate moves down fu rther and is ½ per centage point below 
its natural rate at the end of 2017.  As monetary policy a ccommodation continues to be 
gradually withdrawn, gains in real GDP slow  to below their potential pace, causing the 
unemployment rate to move back toward its natural rate.  As disc ussed earlier in the 
Outlook for Prices and Compensation section, inflation is projected to still run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2016.  With resource utili zation projected to remain 
high for several years, longer-run inflation expectations edge higher and PCE price 
inflation reaches the FOMC’s longer-run infl ation objective of 2 pe rcent late in the 
decade.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign real GDP growth slowed  from an annual rate of  2½ percent in the fourth 
quarter of last year to just 2 percent in the first quarter .  This deceleration  of activity  
reflected several factors :  surprisingly weak exports by  many economies ; slow domestic 
demand growth in China, which spilled over to other economies, particularly in emerging 
Asia; severe winter weather in Canada; an d continued poor economic performance in  
Latin America . 
We see foreign growth coming out of its first -quarter pothole, rising to 2½ percent 
in the current quarter and further to nearly 3¼ percent in the second half of this year, a s 
Canada’s economy bounces back, policy in China becomes more supportive, and U.S. economic activity rebounds.  The overall tone of recent indicators is broadly consistent with this outlook.  In particular, exports appear to be rebounding in many countries, suggesting a pickup in global activity.  In 2015 and 2016, foreign GDP growth is 
projected to remain at 3¼  percent , a bit above its trend pace, underpinned by 
strengthening U.S. growth, continued accommodative monetary policies , and diminished 
drag from fiscal consolidation in Europe.  We marked  down foreign growth ¼ percentage 
point in the current quarter , but the forecast is little changed thereafter.  
We are attentive to several  risks to our outlook.  On the downside, growth in 
China could slow further and perhaps quite abrupt ly, possibly in response to either a bust 
in the country’s property sector , where signs of strains  are emerging , or a run on the 
shadow banking sector .  Such a slowdown could have damaging spillovers to  other 
economies .  Additionally, notwithstanding recent encouraging indicators, the surprisingly 
widespread slump in exports and activity in the first quarter  may prove more persistent  
than we current ly anticipate .  On the upside, it is also  possible that the factors that 
depressed activity earlier this year , including weak global trade, might reverse more 
vigorously than we anticipate, paving the way for a stronger rebound of economic 
activity , particularly in the e merging m arket e conomies (EMEs) .  We explore the 
implications of a stronger EME growth path in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
Encouragingly, inflation appears to have edged up in the current quarter in most 
advanced foreign e conomies (AFEs) from earlier low readings, partly reflecting the 
fading eff ect of falling energy prices  in some countries.  In the euro area, however,

  inflation has remained  surprisingly weak, prompting the European Central Bank (ECB) to 
announce additional stimulus.  In the E MEs , we estimate that inflation has remained 
subdued on average .  EME monetary policies were generally on hold; a major exception 
is Mexico , where the central bank  cut its policy rate to support growth . 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Real GDP in the AFEs rose 2 percent in the first quarter , the same as in the 
previous quarter, with a pickup in growth in Japan and the United Kingdom largely 
offsetting a marked  slowdown in Canada .  We see AFE GDP growth at 1¾ percent in the 
current quarter, restrained by a large contraction in Japan  following the recent 
consumption tax hike .  As Japan ’s economy bounc es back , we project AFE growth to ri se 
to about 2¼ percent in the second half of this year and to remain near this rate through 
2016.  This projection is little changed relative to the April Tealbook. 
Recent data suggest that underlying AFE inflation (excluding the effects of 
Japan’s consumption tax increase) remained  just above 1 percent in the current quarter.  
We expect  AFE inflation to rise to nearly 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, as 
output gaps narrow .  With growth projected to be moderate and inflation subdued, 
monetary policy in the AFEs is expected to remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period .  Disappointing euro- area inflation readings and recent policy actions by  
the ECB , including a decrease in its policy rate, prompted us to postpone liftoff of the 
ECB’s main policy rate beyond the forecast horizon.  In contrast, given relatively 
hawkish signals from Bank of Japan (BOJ) officials, we now expect the B OJ to wait until 
early 2015 before further easing policy .  Our monetary policy assumptions for the other 
AFEs are unchanged.  
Euro Area 
Euro -area real GDP expanded 0. 7 percent in the first quarter, half the rate 
estimated in the April Tealbook, as exports were surprisingly weak.  We expect expor ts 
to improve and domestic demand to strengthen as well, supporting a step -up in growth to 
1½ percent this quarter.  In April, industrial production rose in a number of countries, and retail sales for the region picked up .  Additionally, both the euro -area composite PMI and 
economic sentiment through May were above their first -quarter averages.   Looking 
ahead, we pro ject that GDP growth will remain at 1½  percent over the second half of this 
year and then ris e to 2 percent by the end of 2016, as the pace of fiscal consolidation

  diminishes, financial and credit conditions normalize further, and monetary policy 
remains accommodative.  
Euro-area inflation remained weak as core inflation was subdued and consumer 
energy prices continued to fall, and we mark ed down our estimate this quarter to just 
½ percent.  As energy prices bottom out and as the output gap narrows, inflation should 
rise, but to a still-subdued 1½ percent rate by late 2015 and in 2016. 
At its June meeting, the ECB lowered its main refinancing rate 10 basis points to 
0.15 percent, cut the rate on its deposit facility to negative 0.10 percent, and announced 
additional credit-easing measures that are detailed in the box “ECB Policy Actions and 
Options.”  With the E CB acting somewhat more decisively  than anticipated to ease 
policy , we now expect the first policy rate hike in 2017 instead of mid -2016.  Relat ive to 
the April Tealbook, the policy rate at the end of the forecast period is 60 basis points 
lower.   Our projections incorporate a slight boost to inflation and growth in 2015 as a 
result of the ECB’s looser policy stance. 
United Kingdom 
Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded at a robust 3.3 percent rate in the first 
quarter,  as strength in domestic demand more than offset a contraction in exports.  
Indicators for the second quarter, including industrial production in April and PMI 
readings through May, point to continued solid growth.  Accordingly, w e project  that 
GDP will rise 3 percent this year befo re normaliz ing to a still-solid 2½ percent pace in 
2015 and 2016.  We estimate that inflation step ped up to 1½ percent this quarter  and 
should rise a bit more  as the output gap closes , with inflation settling at nearly 2  percent 
in 2015 and 2016. 
The unempl oyment rate fell to 6. 6 percent in the three months through April, 
taking it further below the 7  percent threshold announced in the initial forward guidance 
issued by the Bank of England (BOE) last year .  Nonetheless,  the BOE has been 
signaling that slack remains sufficient to keep its policy rate low for some time, 
consistent with the updated guidance issued in February that it will base its  policy 
decision s on broader measures of economic slack.  Accordingly, w e still expect  its first 
rate hike to occur in early 2015.  With  the ongoing surge in house prices, the BO E is 
considering additional macroprudential measures to contain financial stability risks.

  ECB Policy Actions and Options  
Amid concerns about low inflation and weak bank lending in the euro area, the Governing Council of the 
European Central Bank (ECB) decided to lower its policy rates at its meeting on June 5 and introduced 
measures to stimulate lending by banks.  Overall, these measures  appear to have been a bit more 
accommodative than markets had been anticipating but are likely to have only a modest impact on t he 
economy.  
 
As shown in figure 1 , the ECB cut by 10  basis points the rates on its main refinancing operations  (MRO s), to 
0.15  percent , and on its deposit facility , to negative 0.10 percent, while lowering the rate on its marginal 
lending facility 35 basis  points to 0.40  percent.  The rate cuts were modest , but pushing  the deposit rate 
negative penalize s bank s for  parking  liquidity at the ECB and may be viewed by the markets as a signal of the 
ECB’s commitment to encourage banks to lend.   
 
To spur bank lending to nonfinancial corporations  and households, t he ECB also announced  Targeted Longer -
Term Refinancing Operations (TLTROs).  All TLTROs  will mature in September 2018, with banks  paying an 
interest rate that is  fixed at the MRO rate at the time of take- up plus 10 b asis points .  In the first two  TLTROs , 
scheduled for September and December 2014 , banks  can borrow up to 7 percent of their total eligible loans 
outstanding on April 30, 2014 .1  In addition, in a series of quarterly TLTROs  from March 2015 to June 2016, 
banks  will be able to borrow amounts that can cumulate to three times the increase in their net lending.   The 
TLTRO  program is similar to the Bank of England’s funding- for-lending scheme, which is  thought to have had 
only a limited  effect on U.K. bank lending.  However, the TLTROs’ fixed rate over a four- year term is seen as 
reinforcing  the ECB’s forward guidance that its policy rates will remain low  for an extended period of time. 
 
To provide further short -term liquidity , the ECB also announced that its weekly MROs  and three -month 
Longer- Term Refinancing Operations ( LTROs ) will continue as fixed -rate tender procedures with full allotment 
until at least  December 201 6.  T he ECB also suspended  sterilization of  outstanding liquidity, currently about 
€165 billion , injected through purchases of peripheral sovereign bonds under the Securities Market s 
Programme (SMP).  T he liquidity  measures may reverse part of the decline in the ECB’s balance sheet (the blue 
line in figure 2 ) that has occurred as banks repaid funds from previous LTROs, but we believe the economic 
effects will be modest.   
 
                                                 
1 Eligible loans are loans to the euro -area nonfinancial sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase, and 
amount to about  €400 billion .

  Although  markets had come to anticipate that the ECB would increase accommodation  in June, the extent  of 
the polic y changes  was likely on  the higher side of expectations.  Eu ro-area bond yields fell, especially for 
bonds from peripheral countries ; the euro depreciated initially but ended the day a bit higher.  Relative to the 
April Tealbook, we now assume the path of the MRO rate to be 10 basis points lower in the near term and 60 
basis points lower at the end of 2016.  With the boost from that  stimulus partly offset by weaker economic and 
price data, we revised up our GDP growth forecast about 0.1  percentage point, with a smaller boost to our 
inflation forecast.   
 
In addition to the announced changes, the ECB decided to intensify preparatory work for outright purchases of asset -backed securities (ABS) .  The European ABS market currently is very small, with only about €650  billion  
outstanding , mostly issued in the Netherlands, Spain, and Italy.  Of that total, about half have  been retained on 
the balance sheets of euro- area banks and already used to obtain liquidity from the ECB.  Thus, we would 
expect any ABS purchases to be modes t in scale.  For the ECB to provide significant further stimulus through 
asset purchases , it would need to also buy sovereign bonds.  Some ECB officials have questioned whether such 
purchases would violate the prohibition against “monetary financing,” and previous ECB programs to buy 
sovereign bonds (SMP and Outright Monetary Transactions) were controversial.   Still, President Draghi has 
said in the past that sovereign purchases in the secondary market could be consistent with the ECB’s mandate , 
and we believe the ECB might undertake such purchases in extremis.   
 
To evaluate the effects of asset purchases  by the ECB, we ran an alternative simulation that assumes:  (1) a 
balance sheet expansion of about €1 trillion, which , based on our analysis of the effect s of the Fed’s large- scale 
asset purchases  in the United States, we assume should  reduce the term premium in euro- area long -term 
interest rates 40 basis points ; (2) a  2 percent  fall in the real effective exchange value of the euro; and (3) an 
intention  by the ECB , understood by markets, to keep its policy rates near zero through the end  of 2016, as 
assumed in the baseline.  As shown in the figures below, the net effect is to boost euro-area GDP growth more 
than  1 percentage point over the baseline for some time; the effect on inflation is more limited, at just over 
¼ percentage point.   
 
These results suggest that the ECB could provide significant further stimulus to the euro- area economy and a 
modest boost to euro- area inflation by undertaking asset purchases on a significant scale.  However, because 
of political difficulties  surrounding purchases of sovereign bonds, it is more likely that the next step for the 
ECB will be to explore modest ABS purchases along with regulatory changes to  help encourage expansion of 
the ABS  market and bank lending.

  Japan 
In Japan, real GDP growth increased sharply to 6.7 percent in the first quarter, 
more than double the pace estimated in the April Tealbook, as exports soared and  as 
private consumption and residential investment surged ahead of April’s consumption tax 
hike.  We project that t he reversal of spending associated with the tax hike will result in a 
4½ percent GDP contraction this quarter.  In April, retail sales plunged and the composite 
PMI fell into contractionary territory for the first time since late 2012.  As the effect of 
the tax hike dissipates and previously announced fiscal stimulus measures are 
implemented, real GDP should begin expanding again, rising  nearly 2 percent in the 
second half of the year.  Subsequently, we expect growth to slow to 1 percent over the remainder of the forecast  period, partly reflecting drag from another tax increase 
scheduled for October 2015. 
Inflation is estimated to have jumped to an 8½ percent annual rate in the current 
quarter , although, excluding the direct effect of th e consumption tax hike, the rate likely 
remained near the ½ percent pace recorded in the first quarter.  Going forward, as the output gap narrows and inflation expectations increase further, we see inflation rising to 
1½ percent by the end of 2016.  Many analysts, including ourselves, had expected the 
BOJ to step up its pace of asset purchases this year to push inflation toward its 2 percent target.  However, with t he BOJ reiterat ing that it sees inflation on track to reach its target 
next year , we now think that it will increase its purchases  only in early 2015.  Consist ent 
with this less accommodative monetary policy stance, we marked down slightly our forecast for growth and inflation in 2015. 
Canada 
Canadian real GDP growth dropped from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 
to 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 2014, a bit below our previous estimate.  Exports fell 
and fixed investment, notably residential construction, continued to contract, reflecting 
severe winter weather as well as weak U.S. growth.  As the se restraints fade, we expect 
growth to step up to 3 percent  in the current quarter, consistent with recent indicators :  
Exports were above the first -quarter level in April, and the manufacturing PMI remained 
solid through May.  Looking ahead, we expect growth to average almost 2¾ percent over 
the remainder of the forecast period .   
Surprisingly strong April data on Canadian consumer prices , especially for 
energy , led us to mark up our forecast of second- quarter inflation by ½ percentage point

  to 2¼ percent.  As the boost from energy prices subsides, inflation should moderate to 
1¾ percent in the second half of 2014 before edging up toward 2 percent over the 
forecast period  as the output gap closes .  Against the backdrop of still- moderate growth 
and inflation, we continue to expect the Bank of Canada to  keep its policy rate at 
1 percent until the third quarter of 2015. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES   
Real GDP growth in the EMEs slowed from an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2013 to 2¼ percent in the first quarter , ½ percentage point below our 
April Tealbook estimate .  We judge the factors that held down EME growth to be largely 
transitory and expect  growth to ris e to a still-subdued 3¼ percent rate this quarter and 
more robustly to a near -trend 4¼ percent by the end of this year , as current and 
prospective policies in China provide more support and activity in the United States  
rebounds.  EME growth edges up to 4½ percent  over the remainder of the forecast period .  
Relative to the previous Tealbook, this forecast is  ¼ percentage point lower in the current 
quarter , reflecting our response to downside surprises in the first quarter, and unchanged 
further out. 
Inflation in the EMEs likely remained at 2¾ percent in the second quarter but is 
expect ed to rise to 3½ percent later this year and settle at just below this rate  thereafter .  
The Bank of  Mexico cut its policy rate to support growth.  Despite continued high 
inflation, the Central Bank of Turkey also cut its policy rate, citing improved global risk sentiment; the cut partly unwinds the large rate increase it implemented in January to contain financial pressures .  In contrast, policy was tightened in Colombia and the 
Philippines to contain inflation . 
China  
After slowing to a 5½ percent pace last quarter, economic activity  in China is 
estimated to have accelerated  modestly in the second quarter.  A first-quarter drop in 
exports, which was a major factor behind the step-down in GDP growth, was largely reversed in April and May .  Other activity indicators were more subdued—industrial 
production accelerated only a little from its first- quarter pace, while growth of retail sales 
and investment fell slightly.  A notable rise in the official PMI in May, however, suggests that the pace of manufacturing activity picked up more recently.  On balance, we project 
growth to rise to a still-subdued 6¼ percent rate in the current quarter.

  Chinese authorities have thus far refrained from  announcing a large -scale 
economic stimulus  program.  Instead, they have introduced a steady stream of modest, 
targeted measures , including lower reserve requirement ratios for some banks, 
accelerated fiscal spending, increased investment in certain infrastructure projects, tax 
rebates to exporters , and easier borrowing terms  for first -time homebuyer s.  The 
cumulative effect of these measures  should help push growth up to 7½ percent in the 
second half of the year.  Rising exports, supported in part by the depreciation of the 
renminbi since the beginning of the year, should also boost growth.  For the year as a 
whole, however, we expect growth to be 7 percent —short of the authorities’ 7½ percent 
target —and to remain near that level throughout the forecast period. 
Given the pronounced slowing of the Chinese economy in recent years, coupled 
with worrisome indications of strains in lending and property markets, the uncertainties 
around this outlook are wide.  In particular, property price increases have been 
moderating in recent months, while real estate tr ansactions have fallen sharply and 
inventor ies of vacancies and unfinished construction projects have risen, creating the 
potential for a sharp near -term correction.  That said, we continue to believe that a 
collapse in the property market, though a significant risk , is not the most likely outcome.  
In our view, the property market is supported by healthy household balance sheets, the 
continuing importance of real estate as an investment vehicle, and underlying demand 
from ongoing urbanization.  Moreover, we believe that the authorities have both the means and the incentive to mitigate  the effect of a downturn of the property market on the 
financial sector and the economy more broadly.  
Inflation has been subdued in recent months, pushed down by falling food and 
fuel prices.  However, May data showed some increase in both of these categories and , as 
these prices continue to normalize, we forecast inflation to rise from a ¾ percent pace in 
the first quarter to 3½ percent in the third quarter and to remain near that pace. 
Other Emerging Asia 
Real GDP growth in emerging Asia excluding China tumbled to 2½ percent in the 
first quarter from an  above- trend rate of 4¾ percent the quarter before, as exports 
slumped.  The decline in growth was particularly severe i n Thailand , where several 
months of political unrest, cu lminating in a military coup  late last month , led output to 
contract more than  8 percent .  In contrast, in India, election -related spending boosted 
growth to 6 percent.

  The region’s growth is projected to r ecover  to 3½ percent  this quarter and to 
4½ percent  thereafter , supported by rising  export demand as the U.S. and Chinese 
economies strengthen .  Indeed, there are already some signs of recovery :  Exports in 
several countries moved above first- quarter averages in April, and f orward -looking 
indicators for the high-tech sector, which is important for manufacturing and export 
activity in the region, have gained of late.  Additionally, w e marked up India’s medium-
term growth path slightly on greater confidence that the newly elected  government will 
address much -needed structural economic reforms.  
We estimate that the region’s inflation rose  to 3½ percent in the current quarter, 
partly because of the reversal  of previous food price declines in India , and we expect it to 
remain  at that rate. 
Latin America 
Mexico’s economy remained in the doldrums in the first quarter, with real GDP 
expanding only 1 percent, half the pace estimated in the April Tealbook .  Available data 
sugg est that the weakness was broad  based.  Exports were about flat, held back by weak 
U.S. demand.  Hikes in tax rates and administered fuels prices in January caused a plunge in consumer sentiment and retail sales.  A slide in construction since mid -2012 has 
weighed on Mexican growth , and the sector  remained weak  in the first quarter .  Amid 
subdued activity, the Bank of Mexico, in a surprise move, cut its policy rate by 50 basis points to 3 percent. 
Recent activity indicators suggest that Mexican growth is strengthening.  
Industrial production and exports, particularly of manufactured goods, rose in April; the manufacturing PMI and other indicators of business sentiment climbed in May; and consumer sentiment has retraced some of its first- quarter  decline.  Additionally, U.S. 
manufacturing output is projected to rebound.  Accordingly, we  estimate that growth has 
risen to 2½ percent in the current quarter, although it is ¾ percentage point lower than in the April Tealbook.  We continue to expect growth to rise further to 3¾ percent by  2016, 
supported by the more accommodative monetary policy stance, solid U.S. manufacturing growth , recovery in the construction sector, and less fiscal drag.  Moreover, we anticipate 
that, by 2015, the r eform process now under way will begin to boost growth. 
We estimate that Mexican consumer price inflation will step down to 3 percent in 
the current quarter from 5¼ percent in the first, as the effects of earlier tax and fuel price

  hikes wane and as food prices decline from earlier weather -related surges.   Thereafter , we 
see inflation edging up to 3¼ percent  and settl ing at about this rate through 2016. 
Brazil ’s economic performance continues to be dismal.  Real  GDP rose only 
¾ percent in the first quarter, with the weakness spread across most sectors .  Moreover, 
recent indicator s of activity  have generally been lackluster , prompting us to mark down 
Brazil’s growth path through 2015.  We now expect growth of just 1½ percent this year 
as the economy struggles to overcome its structural problems.  Next year and in 2016, we 
see growth averaging  a trend -like rate of 2½ percent, supported in part by stronger 
external demand.   Despite weak economic growth, Brazilian inflation has been rising and 
is set to reach almost 8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, reflecting  tight 
labor market conditions and persistently high inflation expectations.  On a 12-month basis , inflation rose to 6½ percent  in May , hitting the upper limit of the inflation target 
range .  Even so, the central bank ceased its policy tightening  in May, keeping the S elic  
rate at 11 percent. 
Other Emerging Market Economies 
In late April, the International Monetary Fund approved a $17 billion financial 
support package for Ukraine, which , along with other official assistance , should help 
meet the country’s financing needs.  Last month , Petro Poroshenko won Ukraine’s 
presidential election  and, in a surprising shift in posture, Russia accepted the results of 
the elections , helping to de- escalate tensions.  Partly i n response to these developments , 
sentiment and financial markets improved markedly in the region.  Nonetheless, armed 
conflict continues in the east ern part of the country. 
In part reflecting the onset of the crisis, real GDP in Ukraine and Russia 
contracted substantially in the first quarter.   However, fluctuations in the tensions 
between the two countries have had little noticeable effect on global markets.

Financial Developments  
Investors read central bank communications in the U nited States  and the euro area 
over the intermeeting period  as suggesting that  monetary polic ies would be more 
accommodative than had been expected , contributing to a broad -based ris e in bond and 
stock prices in global financial markets.  While U.S. economic news, on balance, was  
seen as  somewhat more favorable than expected, economic news in foreign economies 
was mixed.   
• The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by derivatives prices was 
little changed on net.  Primary dealers continue to see the third quarter of 2015 
as the most likely time of liftoff, but their median forecast for the longer -run 
level of the federal funds rate dropped to 3.5 percent.  
• Intermediate - and long- term Treasury yields  declined notably in May but 
subsequently retraced to end the period only modestly lower .  
• The ECB announced a number of measures to provide additional monetary 
accommodation.  In particular, the ECB lowered its main lending rate and 
moved its deposit rate into negative territory.   
• Investors appeared to become more willing to hold risky positions, as equity 
prices continued to advance and bond risk spreads narrowed both in the United States  and abroad; measures of actual and  implied volatility continued 
to ebb, nearing historical lows for U.S. equit ies.   
• Credit flows to domestic nonfinancial corporations continued to be strong.  Consumer credit expanded at a robust pace, including a pickup in credit card 
borrowing from a very subdued pace.  Home mortgage lending remained 
tepid . 
• Repo rates firmed over recent weeks, likely reflecting  a rise in Treasury 
issuance.  Against that backdrop, t ake-up in ON RRP operations declined .

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
On net over the intermeeting period, yields on Treasury coupon securities were 
little changed  at shorter maturities  and edged lower  at longer maturities  after reversing 
notable early -period declines.  In May, m arket participants puzzled over the significant 
declines in long forward rates since the beginning of the year and point ed to a variety of 
domestic and global factors possibly driving this trend, including lower expectations for 
long-run potential growth, lower inflation risk premiums, purchases of longer- term 
securities by  price -insensitive investors, unwinding of short Treasury positions, and 
declining interest rate uncertainty  (see the box “What Explains the Recent Decline in 
Long -Term Forward Rates?”) .  Communications by the ECB, particularly those leading 
up to the announcement of new policy- easing measures, were also seen as  contributing to 
the decline in yields.   The TIPS -based measure of five-year inflation compensation ticked 
up amid stronger- than-expected data for April core CPI, while the five- year measure five 
years ahead was unchanged . 
Although the April FOMC statement and minutes were generally in line with 
expectations and elicited little reaction in financial markets, the Chair’s congressional 
testimony before the Joint Economic Committee and the subsequent Q&A  session w ere 
viewed as suggesting marginally more accommodative policy than expected .       
U.S. economic data releases during the intermeeting period were seen by market 
participants  as modestly favorable on balance.  W eaker -than-expected reports on Apri l 
retail sales and industrial production were counterbalanced by stronger- than-expected 
business surveys indicating a possible pickup in the pace of activity , while job growth 
over April and May came in a touch above expect ations.  Increasingly over the period, 
market participants appeared to interpret data, on the whole, as supporting the 
anticipation  of a sizable bounce back in activity from the first- quarter weakness .   
All told, the expected path of the federal funds rate changed little  over the 
intermee ting period.  The end-of-2016 federal funds rate imp lied by OIS quotes is about 
1.7 percent, down about 10 basis points since the April FOMC meeting .1  The median 
dealer’s response from the Open Market Desk ’s June s urvey put the end -of-2016 federal 
funds r ate at 2.1  percent,  slightly higher than in the April survey.  The survey indicate d 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

 What Explains the Recent Decline in Long -Term Forward Rates?  
After rising steadily over the second half of last year, long -term nominal forward rates across most of the 
advanced economies have declined s ubstantially since year- end.  As noted in the chart to the right, this 
behavior is consistent with the pattern of strong c o-movement in global long -term rates across advanced 
economies over the last 25 years  despite the substantial differences across countries over time in 
monetary policy and economic outlook .   
 
Market participants have pointed to a number of factors as contributing to the recent decline in long -
term forward rates, including a lower equilibrium real rate associated with reduced expectations of long -
run economic growth, as well as factors that might have reduced the term premium, such as reduced 
uncertainty about future interest rates, increased demand for longer-duration assets by some price-
insensitive investors, and the unwinding  of short  Treasury  position s that some investors reportedly had 
established early in the year in anticipation of rising interest rates.  
To examine these factors, we follow a two- step procedure.  First, we use Blue Chip long -run forecasts to 
decompose the 5- to-10-year nominal forward rate into four components:  the expected future real short  
rate (Blue Chip long -run forecast of the 3 -month T -bill rate minus that of consumer price index inflation) , 
expected future inflation, the inflation risk premium (Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities ( TIPS ) 5-to-
10-year breakeven rate minus expected future inflation), and the real term premium (TIPS 5- to-10-year 
forward rate minus the expected future real short rate) .  The results, shown in the top panel of the table 
on the next page, suggest that out of a total reduction in the 5- to-10 year forward rate over the first four 
months of this year of about 65 basis points , about a quarter can be attributed to  a reduction in the 
forward inflation risk premium, while most of the rest can be attributed to a reduction in the real forward 
term premium.   
To better understand the change in the estimated real forward term premium, our second step is to 
regress the survey -based measure of the real term premium on variables  intended  to capture 
uncertainties  about future interest rates and growth , as well as market -related demand and supply 
variations.  We then use t he model estimates to decompose the change in the real forward term premium  
between December 2013 and April 2014 .  On balance, the results, shown in the bottom panel of the table, 
sugges t that out of a total decrease of about 50  basis points in the real term premium  over this period , 1.522.533.544.55Percent  5-to-10-Year Nominal Forward

 about 20 basis points can be attributed to reduced interest rate uncertainty.  Other variables in the 
regression are found to contribute little to the move in the term premium, and a large portion of the 
decline remains unexplained. 1    
These results depend, of course, on the data used in the decomposition.  In particular, the Blue C hip 
surveys have  not indicate d any significant  decline in  long -run expectations of the real short  rate or real 
economic growth since December; as a result, our analysis  show s no contribution from a lower 
equilibrium real rate. 2   In contrast , results from the Open Market Desk’s June survey  show that the 
median  (average)  estimate  of dealers’  longer-run federal funds rate forecast s has declined about  
50 (15) basis points since December, and b oth dealers and buy-side investors cited  a reduction in the 
expected long -run real policy rate as one of the most important factors driving the recent decline in long -
term forward rates .3  While all surveys are imperfect measures of market expectations, the Open Market 
Desk survey results  suggest that the Blue Chip surveys may understate the decline in the expected real 
interest rate this year and, by implication, overstate the decline in the real term premium.

1 The list of independent variables includes long -run economic  uncertainty (as measured by the difference between the 
averages of the top 10 and of the bottom 10  long -run real GDP  forecasts from the Blue Chip survey ), interest rate 
uncertainty (as measured by the first principal component of swaption implied volatilities), and capacity utilization (to 
capture the cyclicality of the term premium).  To capture the effects of demand and supply of Treasury securiti es, we 
include net long speculative positions in 10 -year Treasury futures, holdings of longer -term Treasury security by foreign 
official institutions (normalized by GDP), and the amount of nominal Treasury notes and bonds  outstanding that are not 
held by the System Open Market Account  (normalized by GDP).  Finally, the VIX is included to capture the safe- haven 
demand for Treasury securities resulting from domestic equity market volatility.  We estimate the model using monthly 
data from January 1999 to April 2014, the latest month for which data is available.   
2 The Consensus Economics  surveys also show no significant declines in long -run real GDP growth forecasts for the 
United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, or Canada in recent months.   
3 Two other f actors listed as the most important in driving the recent decline in long -term forward rates were c hange s 
in economic and/or policy outlook in other advanced foreign economies and market- related factors .

  no change in the dealers’ consensus for the most likely timing of liftoff, pegged in  the 
third quarter of 2015.  The median dealer forecast for the longer -run level of the federal 
funds rate dropped to 3.5 percent, a decline of 25 basis points from the April survey and a 
decline of 50 basis points from the January  survey .   
Over the intermeeting period, MBS current -coupon yields dec reased 6 basis 
points, in line with the movement in the 10-year Treasury yield, while option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon MBS tightened about 7 basis points.  Much of the narrowing in MBS spreads follow ed a speech by President Dudley of the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York in which he expr essed a preference for continuing the reinvestment  of 
principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s securities  holdings past the liftoff of the 
federal funds rate from its effective lower bound.  Responses to the Desk’s June survey indicate that the median d ealer has pushed back the expected timing of the end of 
reinvestments for both Treasur y securities  and MBS by about three quarters and revised 
up the expected size of the SOMA portfolio at the end of 2017 by about $170 billion.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Expect ations for the path of policy rates in the euro area fell steadily over the 
period, as market participants placed increasing odds on the ECB eas ing policy at its 
June 5 meeting.  In the event, the ECB cut its policy rates largely as expected, lowering its main lending rate to 15 basis points and its deposit rate to negative 10 basis points.  The ECB also announced other measures, including new targeted longer- term refinancing 
operations.  (See the box “ECB Policy Actions and Options” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  All told, market participants judged the 
package to be a bit more accommodative than they had been anticipating and now expect policy rates to remain unchanged until at least the second half of 2016.  Conversely, analysts lowered their expectations of asset purchases by the Bank of Japan, which reiterated that it believes Japanese inflation is on track to reach its 2 percent target  
next year.   
Yields on 10-year sovereign bonds in Germany and Canada fell about 10 basis 
points over the intermeeting period.  Since January 1, 10-year benchmark bond yields are down throughout the advanced foreign economies, especially in Germany, where the decline exceeds  50 basis points.  The German yield decline is due, in part, to mounting 
concerns about the strength of the economic recovery and prospects for inflation in the

  euro area.  (See the box “Divergence in Sovereign Bond Yields in Advanced 
Economies.”) 
Yields  on sovereign debt issued by peripheral European countries continued to  
decline relative to yields on German bunds, with spreads falling ¼ to ½ percentage point 
and reaching their lowest levels since the start of the European debt crisis in 2010.  In 
addition, emerging market sovereign and foreign corporate bond spreads na rrowed , 
reflecting in part the generally upbeat tone of financial markets over the period.  
Most foreign equity indexes have increased since the April FOMC  meeting .  
Euro -area equities generally rose following the ECB’s announcement.  In Japan, stock 
prices jumped following the release of first -quarter GDP , which showed a larger- than-
expected surge in consumer spending ahead of an April tax increase.  Emerging market equity indexes added to their gains so far this year .  Both bond and equity e merging 
market  mutual funds saw net inflows over the period.   
The foreign exchange value of the dollar wa s little changed , on net, over the 
period.  The dollar appreciated about 2 percent against the euro in response to weak incoming data for the euro area and actual and expect ed easing in the ECB ’s policy 
stance.  By contrast, the dollar declined against most emerging market currencies as investor sentiment toward EMEs continued to improve.  The People’s Bank of China guided the dollar value of the renminbi up about ½ percent , on net , over the period, 
reversing a small part of its decline since earlier this year.   Despite ongoing conflict in 
eastern Ukraine, the ruble appreciated  further against the dollar , as Ukrainian elections 
seemed to help ease tensions with Russia.  A military coup in Thailand pushed up sovereign bond yields and led to a modest depreciation of the baht, but it had little effect outside of these markets.   
EQUITY VALUATIONS AND BOND SPREADS  
Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose about 4 percent over the intermeeting period 
to new record highs on a more optimistic assessment of  near -term economic prospects 
and were likely supported by continued low interest rates.  While many backward-looking measures of economic activity were disappointing, forward-looking indicators such as business surveys were viewed as upbeat .  Moreover, despite disappointing new s 
on first -quarter earnings, corporate guidance for profits in coming quarters was

  apparently favorable enough to prompt the first notable upward revision i n several 
months to analysts’ forecasts of year-ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms.    
Yields on investment-grade bonds moved down about 10 basis points, a bit more 
than comparable Treasury yields, while yields on high-yield bonds posted a larger 
decline, pushing down their spreads to comparable Treasury yields to the lowest levels 
since 2007.  Reflecting the improved market sentiment, the VIX , an index of option-
implied volatility for one -month returns on the S&P 500 index, continued to decline and 
ended the period near  its historical lows.      
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Financing conditions for domestic nonfinancial corporations remained favorable.  
Amid low yields and reduced market volatility, gross issuance of investment- and 
speculative-grade bonds rebounded to a very robust pace in May.   An increased  portion—
about one- half—of speculative- grade issuances  were tagged for purposes other than the 
refinancing of existing debt, including investment and mergers and acquisitions.  Funds raised through new equity issues remained robust ; the pace of gross equity issuance was 
slightly higher than in the same period last year.   
Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to expand at a strong pace over 
the intermeeting period .  In addition, spreads of loan rates  over market interest rates for 
newly originated C&I loans declined in the May Survey of Terms of Business Lending.  Issuance of leveraged loans, particularly institutional loans, remained strong  in April and 
May, driven primarily by  sturdy demand from ins titutional investors , including 
collateralized loan obligations ( CLOs ).  Responses to the June Senior Credit Officer 
Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms indicate that demand on the part of levered investors to obtain financing to fund purchases of senior and mezzanine CLO tranches has increased somewhat since the beginning of the year.
2  
Commercial real estate (CRE) lending has continued to expand  amid some further 
easing of  underwriting standards for commercial mortgages.  While CMBS issuance has 
slowed a bit since the beginning of the year, bank and insurance company originations of commercial mortgages increased robustly  in the first quarter .  Moreover, weekly bank

Divergence in Sovereign Bond Yields in Advanced Economies  
Although medium - to long -term rates in the advanced economies generally move 
closely together, since the middle of 2012 a gap has developed between rates in 
Germany and those in other advanced economies.  As shown in the upper panel 
on the next page, the gap between German rates and U.S., U.K., and Canadian 
rates is currently about 1¼ percentage points  at the five-year maturity .  Although 
not unprecedented, this gap is significant given the low level of rates in advanced economies.  
 In our view, the current wedge in rates reflects, at least in part, two closely 
related factors:  a divergence in policy expectations and a divergence in inflation 
expectations.  The middle panel shows policy expectations, derived from 
overnight index swap rates (OIS), at the three- year horizon.  Starting in mid -2013, 
even as U.S. and U.K. policy expectations have trended up in anticipation of policy normalization, euro- area policy expectations have declined amid prospects 
of a weak recovery and subdued inflation.  Indeed, since then, the European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered its main refinancing rate a cumulative 60  basis 
points, announcing a negative deposit rate this month.  Markets expect the ECB to keep its policy rate near zero until 2017.   
 Market expectations of near- to medium -term inflation in the euro area have 
declined substantially in recent years.  The bottom panel depicts five- year 
breakeven inflation rates derived from inflation swaps.  By this measure, inflation 
expectations for the United States have been stable.  In contrast, euro-area 
inflation expectations have declined as actual inflation has continued to 
disappoint.  Of note, long -term inflation expectations (beyond five years) in both 
economies have remained relatively steady (not shown).   
Declining inflation expectations also contribute to the fall in policy expectations , 
and both inflation and policy expectations are putting downward pressure on 
German rates.  Of course, the gap between German and U.S. yields could close rapidly if euro- area inflation and inflation expectations pick up in response to a 
sustained recovery.  However, the divergence bears monitoring.  In Japan, for example, a sustained divergence between domestic and foreign interest rates in 
the early 1990s presaged many years of subpar growth and deflation.

  credit data available for April and May indicate that growth in  CRE loans on banks ’ 
books remained strong. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Mortgage rates have declined about 15 basis point s since the April FOMC  
meeting , somewhat more than  long-term Treasury yields, and  (seasonally  adjusted) 
applications for purchase mortgages and refinances ticked up but remain quite low .  
Mortgage lending standards remain tight, but there are signs of improving accessibility. 
The distribution of credit scores for GSE-backed purchase mortgages during the first few months of 2014 edged lower relative to the fourth quarter, and a major lender cut its 
minimum credit score for GSE -backed loans.  
 Despite tight mortgage financing conditions, house prices continued to rise fairly 
robustly in March and April but at a slower pace than during the same period last year.  
House price growth remains strong in many areas of the country, owing in part to the 
sharp decline in distressed sales as a share of total sales in recent months and to tight inventories of homes available for sale.   
Consumer credit continued to expand through April at a robust pace.  While still 
quite strong, growth in student loans moderate d further and  outstanding auto loans 
continued to grow.   Credit card loan balances surged in April, and weekly bank  balance 
sheet  data suggest a further gain in May ; still, on a year-on-year basis , the growth rate 
remained moderate at about 2½ percent.   The largest increases  have come at banks that 
reported having eased standards and  increased borrowing limits on such loans in the 
April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices .     
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
The stock prices of large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) generally kept 
pace with the broad equity market over the intermeeting period, and CDS spreads for large BHCs have narrowed a bit further.  The profitability of BHCs decreased in the first 
quarter , mainly because of declines in mortgage revenues and trading income as well as a 
significant increase in litigation expenses at one large BHC.
3  In addition, large banks 
                                                 
 3 Bank of America reported a $6  billion litigation expense in the first quarter of 2014; abo ut 
$3.6 billion reflected a settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, with the remainder earmarked 
as additional reserves for legacy -mortgage -related matters.

  continued to report compresse d net interest margins in the first quarter.  Banks’ holdings 
of U.S. Treasury securities  rose substantially over the past three months, reportedly in 
part reflecting banks’  efforts to meet proposed liquidity regulations. 
M2 expanded at a 7 percent average annual rate over April and May, likely 
boosted a bit by the accumulation of tax refunds and a buildup in deposit balances in 
advance of tax payments beyond what is captured in seasonal factors.  C urrency gr owth 
slowed over the two -month period as international demand for U.S. notes appeared to 
diminish , following rapid growth in March.    
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Rates in short- term funding markets generally remained stable over the 
intermeeting period , although there was some modest upward pressure on T reasury repo 
rates associated with a pickup in Treasury debt issuance.  The uptick in Treasury repo 
rates reportedly contributed to the decline in t ake-up in  the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP 
operations in recent weeks ; money market funds continue to account fo r the largest share 
of ON RRP participation.4  
In May, the Federal Reserve began an eight- week series of expanded seven -day 
TDF test operations.  T he first four of these operations offered term deposits at 26 basis 
points while gradually raising the maximu m award for individual bidder s from 
$1.25 billion  to $10 billion.5  Participation in the first four of these operations increased  
from an average of  27 depository institutions in the TDF operations conducted in March 
to about 36 in the current series , with  a total amount awarded r ising f rom an average of 
$14.6 billion in the March operations to $77.8 billion  for the most recent operation.6   
                                                 
4 In response to special questions in the June policy survey, the median dealer expects  that, 
immediately following the liftoff in the federal funds rate, both the target federal funds rate and the IOER 
rate will be about 10 basis points higher than the ON RRP rate.  U sage of ON RRP at that time was 
estimat ed to be roughly $400 billion. More than half of the dealers also indicated that they expected the 
Term Deposit Facility and term Treasury RRP to be used during policy normalization.  
5 Over the second set of four operations,  the interest rate offered on the term deposits will be 
increased gradually to a level that does not exceed 30 basis points.  
6  A wide range of institutions reported that their demand for TDF deposits is limited as a result of 
Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio requirements , as discussed in the June 11, 2014, memo  “Result s of 
Recent Term Deposit Facility Test Operations and Summary of Staff Outreach Findings,” by Marnie Gillis 
DeBoer, Courtney Demartini, and Laura Lipscomb .

  TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Liquidity conditions in Treasury and MBS markets remained stable amid ongoing 
reductions in the pace of asset purchases.7  Still, there seemed to be some signs of 
specialness , especially in the 30 -year Fannie Mae 3.5 percent coupon TBA market, as 
eviden ced by low levels of dollar- roll-implied financing rates.   In response, the Desk 
rolled about 11 percent of its total agency MBS purchases for Ma y settlement to June and 
about 3 percent of its total agency MBS purchases for June settlement to July.  Compared 
with the beginning of the year, the Desk’s MBS settlements in the  intermeeting period 
represented a somewhat smaller fraction of gross MBS issuance, as gross issuance edged 
up while SOMA settlements declined modestly .    
 
                                                 
 7 The Desk conducted outright purchases of $ 34 billion in Treasury securities and $ 36 billion in 
agency MBS securities.  Over the intermeeting period, MBS purchases were fully transitioned to FedTrade, 
the Desk ’s proprietary trading system.   The Desk typically now conducts two operations per day in a 
multiple -price format.   No significant pricing change s were associated with the transition .  Dollar roll 
transactions continue to be conducted on TradeWeb, the existing commercial trading system.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the extent of uncertainty around our projections for real 
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable 
volatility .1  As always, a number of upside and downside risks  attend our forecast for 
economic activity; importantly, however, we see neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  Consequently, w e continue to believe that  the risks to our forecast for real GDP growth 
are tilted a little  to the downside.  By contrast, we view the uncertainty around our 
projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse demand -side developments largely countered by the 
possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to surprise us to the downside, despite the further reduction of our estimate of potential GDP growth in the current Tealbook.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s ongoing 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which views the vulnerability of th e financial 
system to adverse shocks as moderate overall.  This assessment reflects the relatively strong capital positions of large domestic banking firms, the generally low levels and moderate growth of aggregate credit in the nonfinancial sectors, and t he reduced reliance 
on fragile short- term wholesale funding across the financial sector in recent years.  That 
said, pockets of vulnerabilities are evident:  Valuation pressures have continued in corporate debt markets and in certain segments of the equity market, low levels of implied volatility may indicate that investors have become complacent, and term 
                                                 
1 The benchmark estimates of uncertainty about real activity increased sharply after the end of the 
Great Moderation.  As the fixed 20 -year window used to assess the size of typical  forecast errors has 
moved forward to include the experience of the past six years, the estimated standard errors for out -year 
projections of the unemployment rate and real GDP growth increased between 2008 and 2011 —almost 
doubling for the unemployment rat e and increasing by about 50 percent for GDP growth—and have 
remained at those higher levels with the current 20 -year sample.  As a result, the benchmark estimates of 
uncertainty about economic activity are no longer dominated by the experience of the Grea t Moderation.  In 
contrast, benchmark estimates of uncertainty about inflation are essentially unchanged relative to earlier 
sample periods.

  premiums on long- term Treasury securities are compressed by historical standards, 
suggesting the risk of a sharp increase.  In addition, the largest fina ncial institutions 
remain complex and interconnected, and money market mutual funds continue to be 
susceptible to investor runs.    
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Long er-run inflation 
expectations appear to  have remained stable in recent years despite fluctuations in the 
prices of crude oil, other commodit ies, and imports more generally, and also despite the 
deep recession and subsequent slack in labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we view the risks to our inflation forecast as balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility that the soft  readings  on inflation that have been seen, on net, since the beginning of last 
year could prove more persistent than we expect, especially if longer -term inflation 
expectations move down or if low levels of resource utilization persist longer or have larger effects than we currently project .  On the upside, an increase in inflation 
expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could significant unanticipated increases in the prices of oil and other commodities caused by overseas developments, a stronger- than-expected 
economic recovery, or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than is assumed in the baseline.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario contemplates the risk that the generally low readings for consumer price inflation seen over the past year could prove to be more persistent than anticipated.  The second scenario features a deeper and more protracted reduction in potential output growth than assumed in the baseline.  In the third scenario, the recent incre ases in 
employment and auto sales herald a more robust expansion than the staff expects.  By 
contrast, the fourth scenario considers the possibility that the projected step-up in housing 
demand and consumer spending fails to materialize, implying persisten tly weaker 
aggregate demand.  In the final scenario, growth in emerging market economies is considerably more robust than in the baseline.

  We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final one 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  On ce the federal funds rate has lifted off from its 
effective lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast —by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  T he date of liftoff i n each scenario is set using 
a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in 
the Committee’s recent  statement s.2  In all cases, we assume that the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.  
Low Inflation 
A premise of the baseline projection  is that, given the level of longer- term 
inflation expectations,  if slack in resource utilization were to be closed promptly but 
without overshooting, the inflation rate would settle at 1¾ percent —down from just 
under 2 percent in the April Tealbook.  As disc ussed in the recent memorandum to the 
FOMC on persistently low inflation in the judgmental forecast, some models point to even lower estimates .
3  In this scenario, we assume that the extended experience of 
below- target inflation has resulted in a reduction of current longer-run inflation 
expectations to about 1½ percent , and that continued low inflation in the coming years 
leads to further erosion in these expectations .  As a consequence, inflation in this scenario 
is close to 1  percent through 2018.  In turn, p ersistently low inflation causes liftoff to 
occur in the second half of 2018, more than three years later than in the baseline.  At that time, the unemployment rate has declined to 4 ½ percent, ¾ percentage point below its 
natural rate.
4  However, gi ven the decline in long-horizon inflation expectations, inflation 
                                                 
2 Specifically, in the second, third, and fourth scenarios, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over 
in the quarter following the observation of an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent, the level of unemployment 
prevailing in the baseline one quarter prior to liftoff.  In the “Low Inflation” scenario, where the path of 
inflation is significantly different from the baseline, the choice of liftoff date is meant to capture the 
Committee’s intention, per its March and April statements, “to maintain the current target range for the 
federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected 
inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer -run goal.”  For the final scenario, 
“Stronger Growth in Emerging Market Economies,” we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the one used in the first four scenarios.  One key di fference relative to the FRB/US simulations  is that the policy 
rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s 
estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.  
3 See Deb Lindner (2014), “Why Is Inflation Persistently Low in the Judgmental Forecast?” 
memorandum to the FOMC, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and 
Statistics, June 4.  
4 Lower inflation expectations, all else equal, imply a higher path for real interest rates, which 
would contract aggregate demand.  However, in this scenario the federal funds rate lifts off later than in the baseline, which more than offsets these contractionary forces, and the unemploymen t rate is lower than in 
the baseline in 2018.

  projected one to two years ahead is still below the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
despite this degree of labor market tightness . 
No Room to Grow 
In the June Tealbook, the level of potential has been revised down further, but 
some of the models we consult suggest that potential output may be even lower  than is 
assumed  in the baseline projection and may grow more slowly in the future.  In this 
scenario, we assume that structural productivity gains in recent years have been slower 
than the staff currently estimates and continue to be weaker over the projection period, 
and that the natural rate of unemployment has remained constant at 6¼  percent since 
early 2011, as labor market efficiency is as sumed to have been substantially impaired.  
With these assumptions, potential output has expanded at an annual rate of only ¾ percent since 2011; looking ahead, it rises at only a 1 percent pace through 2018.  As a consequence of the historical revision to potential output, the output gap is estimated to be closed by the current quarter.   
Compared with the baseline, r eal GDP growth is substantially lower as 
households and firms base their spending on lower levels of permanent income and potential output.  Initially, policymakers incorrectly perceive supply-side conditions as consistent with the staff’s baseline view.  However, as evidence of the weaker supply-side conditions mounts, their perceptions gradually come into line with reality and are assumed to be fully adjusted by 2016.  As a consequence, monetary policy eventually 
tightens considerably and real GDP growth slows well below even the sluggish pace of 
potential output growth assumed in this scenario.
5  Inflation is higher than in the baseline , 
reflecting the effects of both tighter resource utilization and smaller productivity gains, 
which contribute to greater cost pressures.  By 2018, the federal funds rate is nearly 6 percent, and real GDP rises slightly more than ¼ percent over the year.  The unemployment rate begins to move up by the end of 2017 but has still not risen to the assumed natural rate of 6¼  percent by the end of 2018.  Inflation is about 2½ percent in 
that year.  Given enough time, the Taylor rule governing the setting of the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate above its assumed natural rate, bringing inflation back down to 2 percent. 
                                                 
5 If policymakers were to recognize immediately the change in supply -side conditions, the funds 
rate path would be ½ percentage point higher in 2015 and ¼ percentage point higher in 2016 than in this 
scenario.   This tighter policy would aggravate the slowing of the economy and slightly damp the increase in 
inflation.

  Faster Expansion 
Some recent indicators —including motor vehicle sales, payroll employment, and 
business surveys—have been encouraging and raise the possibility that underlying 
aggregate demand conditions may be stronger than assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, we assume that recent labor market improvements boost the confidence of households and businesses in the durability of the expansion and spark a virtuous circle.  
Real GDP  growth reaches an annual rate of 4½ percent in the second half of this year and 
averages 4 percent over 2015; the unemployment rate falls below 4¼ percent by the end 
of 2016.  Inflation is only slightly higher than in the baseline as the effects of tighter resource utilization are partially offset by higher investment, which boosts productivity and thus helps hold down increases in costs.  The federal funds rate lifts off one quarter earlier than in the baseline and rises more steeply thereafter, moving above 5 percent by 
the end of 2018. 
Weaker Household Demand 
In this scenario, the first- quarter declines in GDP and GDI prove to be more 
indicative of the underlying momentum in aggregate demand than the staff currently 
assumes.  The strengthening in housing activity projected in the baseline does not materialize; instead, residential investment rises , on average, only 2 percent per year.  
Reduced consumer confidence spawn s a vicious circle  of restrained household spending 
and a slower pace of business investment and hiring, contributing further to a slower recovery.  All told, real GDP rises at an average annual rate of 2 percent over the next 
two years , and the unemployment rate hovers above 6 percent through mid-2017.  With a 
wider margin of resource slack than in the baseline, i nflation rises somewhat more 
slowly .  The federal funds rate does not lift off until the second quarter of 2018. 
Stronger Growth in Emerging Market Economies 
Most emerging market economies have experienced subpar growth since early 
last year, and their growth took an especially large dip in the first quarter of this year.  Our baseline forecast envisions that GDP growth in those economies will move up to its potenti al pace over the next couple of quarters and remain there subsequently .  In light of 
the pickup in advanced economies and the relatively modest level of EME financial 
stresses at present, this scenario considers the possibility of a much faster snapback in 
EME growth than the staff currently assumes.  It also assumes a more pronounced rebalancing toward domestic demand than we are currently anticipating, especially in emerging Asia.

  Specifically, real GDP in the EMEs expands at an annual pace about 2 percen tage 
points above the baseline over the next two years, as sharply improving household and 
business confidence within the EMEs fuels a robust expansion in spending.  Monetary policy tightens in response to faster growth, and the authorities allow EME curre ncies to 
appreciate relative to the baseline, resulting in a 3 percent depreciation of the broad real dollar relative to its baseline path.  The EMEs’ current accounts surpluses shrink in response to stronger domestic demand and appreciated currencies, and they are assumed 
to reduce their purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, which causes term premiums on 
longer-term Treasury securities to rise by roughly 15 basis points.  Finally, oil prices rise around $20 per barrel above their baseline path in response to higher global demand.  
The stronger foreign activity and weaker dollar boost U.S. real net exports.  U.S. 
real GDP expands nearly 3½ percent in 2015 as the positive impetus from net exports 
more than offsets the contractionary effects of increased oil prices and higher term 
premiums .  Higher import prices and stronger activity boost core PCE inflation to about 
2 percent in 2015.  The federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, as in the baseline, but rises somewhat more quickly thereafter 
and averages about ½ percentage point above its baseline level through the end of the decade.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
