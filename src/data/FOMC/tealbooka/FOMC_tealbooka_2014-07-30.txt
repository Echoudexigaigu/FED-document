Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook  
The information we have received since the June Tealbook suggests to us that 
slack in the economy is being taken up somewhat more quickly than we anticipated  in 
our previous projection.  On its face, this assertion may seem  difficult to square with the 
growth of real GDP over the first half of the year , which has been even more feeble than 
we expected in the June Tealbook.  However, a range of o ther indicators portray a 
stronger profile of economic activity:  Payrolls have risen faster than we had projected , 
the unemployment rate declined another 0.2 percentage point in June, industrial 
production has posted steady gains in recent months, and  the readings from business 
surveys have been quite strong.  Given these considerations, together with our skepticism about the level of health -care spending shown in the national income and product 
accounts thus far this year, we judge that the weakness in real GDP in the first half of the year largely reflect s a combination of statistical noise and transitory influences that will 
not persist into the second half.  
We continue to expect a stronger pace of economic growth over the medium term, 
as some of the forces that have restrained the expansion in recent years recede.  Our current forecast anticipates that real GDP will in crease at a 3 ½ percent annual rate over 
the second half of this year and then rise 3 percent in 2015 and in 2016.  The average 
pace of growth over the next two and a half years is just a little lower than in the June Tealbook.   
We have taken some signal from the fact that the unemployment rate once again 
surprised us to the downside—continuing a string of forecast errors  in that direction —and 
we have lowered our unemployment forecast over the projection period.
1  We now 
project that the unemployment rate will move down from 6 percent in the current quarter 
to 4¾ percent by the end of 2016—the latter value being about ½ pe rcent age point below 
our estimate of the natural rate .  To bring the GDP gap into closer alignment with the 
unemployment gap, we cut our assumption for potential output this  year.  We now have 
resource utilization in both product and labor markets reaching  normal levels next 
summer, three quarters earlier than in the June Tealbook.

  Recent data point to somewhat faster -than-expected increases in both overall and 
core personal consumption expenditures ( PCE) prices in the second quarter .  In response , 
we marked up the core PCE inflation projection for the second half  of the year.  In the 
medium term, we revised up our forecast for core inflation 0.1 percentage point in 2015 
and in 2016 as a result of the tighter margins of slack in this projection.  As  a result, core 
PCE inflation is projected to gradually rise from 1.6 percent this year to 1.8 percent in 2016.  Our forecast for o verall PCE inflation is also revised up a little, although we 
continue to anticipate that it will run slightly  below  core inf lation in both 2015 and 2016. 
As always, numerous risks surround our outlook.  As in the June Tealbook, we 
view the uncertainty around our projection for real GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility.  While we still see the risks to GDP growth as tilted a 
little to the downside  (largely because neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appear 
well positioned to offset substantial adverse shocks to the economy ), we consider  these 
risks  to be more nearly balanced  than in the June projection.  We continue to see the risks 
around our outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced.  The 
exhibit “Forecast Confidence Intervals and Alternative Scenarios” in the Risks and Uncertainty section presents FRB/US-generated confidence intervals in graphical form 
around the baseline forecast. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
• Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are unchanged  from the 
previous projection.  We assume that asset purchases will continue to slow, 
concluding in October of this year . 
• We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its zero 
lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  We construe the roughly two -
quarter lag between  the assumed end in asset purchases and  the liftoff of the 
federal funds rate to be consistent with the Committee’s view, expressed i n its 
June statement, that “it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time  after the asset purchase 
program ends.”

  • Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises at a pace determined by the 
prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.  The mechanical implementation of this rule  puts the federal funds rate at an 
average level of  2.8 percent in the final quarter of 2016, about 50 basis points 
higher than in the June Tealbook, mainly reflecting  the higher level  of 
resource utilization in this forecast . 
Other Interest Rates  
• The trajectory of the 10- year Treasury yield is generally higher over the 
medium term, reflecting the upward adjustment to the assumed  path of the 
federal funds rate.  Our projection continues to call for a significant rise in 
Treasury yields primarily because of the movement of the 10 -year valuation 
window through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates as well 
as a gradual waning of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies . 
• Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium 
term have been revised essentially in line with our revisions to the path for the 
Treasury yield .  
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
• Since the June Tealbook, equity prices have come in about in line with our 
projection.  Our forecast has stock prices rising at an average annual rate of 
about 5 percent through 2016, similar to the average pace of nominal GDP growth . 
• We have marked down our forecast for house prices a bit since June, as recent 
data have come in on the soft side of our expectations.  Overall , we continue 
to expect house price appreciation to slow markedly, from nearly 12  percent 
last year  to 6 percent this year  and to about 3½ percent per year in 2015 and  
2016. 
Fiscal Policy 
• Our assumptions for fiscal policy are the same as in the June Tealbook.  We expect the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy changes to shrink from 
about 1 percentage point last year to ¼ percentage point this year and to 
essentially  zero over 2015 and 2016.

  Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
• Foreign real GDP growth is estimated to have risen to an annual rate of about 
2½ percent in the second quarter from  a 2 percent increase in the first quarter .  
We project foreign growth to improve further, settling at about 3¼ percent 
over the rest of the forecast period, in line with stronger U.S. growth and as 
foreign  monetary policy remains supportive. 
• The broad nominal index for the dollar has declined almost ½  percent since 
the previous Tealbook.  O ver the forecast period , the broad real dollar is 
forecast to depreciate at an annual rate of about 1 percent , ¼ percentage point 
less than projected in the previous Tealbook, reflecting the  steeper rise in the 
federal  funds rate in this projection.   
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has  fallen about $3 per barrel since the time 
of the previous Tealbook, closing near $107 per barrel on July 22.  Renewed conflict in Iraq  has left no lasting imprint o n spot prices, as current Iraqi 
production remains unaffected.  However, concerns about the longer- term 
outlook for the Iraqi oil supply have pushed up futures prices.  Consequently , 
our forecast for the price of imported oil has been marked up about $3 pe r 
barrel by  the end of the forecast  period.  We project that the price of imported 
oil will decline gradually from  around $102 per barrel in the current quarter to  
$92 per barrel at the end of 2016, a path consistent with futures markets.   
• Nonfuel commodi ty prices are little changed , on net, relative to the June 
Tealbook, as a decline in food prices was largely offset by  higher prices for 
metals.  Over the forecast period, we project our overall commodity price index to remain about flat. 
RECENT DEVELOPMEN TS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  
The BEA  currently  estimate s that real GDP fell at an annual rate of nearly 
3 percent  in the first quarter , a decline 1½ percentage point s larger than expected  in the 
June Tealbook.2  Given the data in hand, we now estimate that real GDP rose 3½ percent 
                                                 
2 On the second day of the upcoming FOMC meeting, the BEA will publish its first estimate of 
real GDP growth in the second quarter of 2014 as well as revised estimates for earlier periods.  We are not

  in the second quarter, ¾ percentage point less than in the previous forecast.  Much of the 
downward revision in the first quarter was concentrated in consumer spending for health 
services ; the BEA has extended  the weaker profile of such spending into the second 
quarter .  These estimates  are surprising , especially as they seem at odds with the 
expansion of health insurance coverage resulting from the Affordable Care Act .3   
More broadly, the weakness in GDP —and GDI —early in the year seems  out of 
step with other indicators of economic activity.  A s a result, we are treating much of the 
reported weakness in GDP  as statistical noise that may or may not be revise d away in the 
future, and, consequently, we have not si gnificantly  altered our forecast for GDP growth 
over the rest of the year  relative to the June projection.  W e now anticipate increases 
averaging 3½ percent in the second half of the year.  
• Available data indicate  that real PCE  rose  at an annual rate of about 
1½ percent  in the first half of 2014—about half the pace expected in the June 
Tealbook, reflecting the  lower-than-expected trajectory for health -related 
spending.  As a result , the projection for real PCE growth in the second half of 
the year continues to call for  solid gains that are consistent with the sector’s  
fundamentals , which have come in close to  our expectation s since the June 
Tealbook. 
• We continue to be puzzled by the degree of weakness in housing activity over 
the past year.  However, t he latest housing data have been  a bit more upbeat 
and seem  broadly in line with our expectation that activity in this sector will 
gradually begin to trend up again.4   
• Real spending on equipment and intangibles (E&I) appears to have rebounded 
in the second quarter , and orders data point to a moderate further increase this 
quarter.  O il and natural gas drilling  looks to have surged in the second 
                                                                                                                                                 
expecting these revisions to resolve the conundrum impli cit in the BEA’s current estimate of GDP growth 
for the first quarter of 2014.  
3 Although the BEA has not built any rebound in health expenditures into their current estimates of 
spending in April and May, we see a good possibility that the second- quarter Quarterly Services Survey, 
which will be available the day  after the September Tealbook is published , will reflect such a rebound.  I f 
so, GDP growth in the second quarter would be revised significantly h igher than our current estimate, and 
we would likely  revise up potential GDP commensurately.

Outlook for the Housing Sector,” by Raven Molloy and Kamila Sommer.

  quarter ; given the volatility and revision properties of these data, however, our 
projection for nonresidential buil ding activity is little revised for the near 
term.  
• The data we have received for inventory investment through May were close 
to our assumptions in the June Tealbook and point to a n appreciably faster  
pace of stockbuilding in the second quarter than in the first quarter.   
• The external sector subtracted  1½ percentage points from real GDP growth in 
the first quarter because of  a sharp decline in exports .  Both exports and 
especially imports appear to have increased vigorously in the second quarter, 
and we now estimate that net exports subtract ed ⅓ percentage point from real 
GDP growth, compared with our estimate of a roughly neutral contribution in the previous Tealbook.  In the third quarter, the contribution of net exports is expected to  turn pos itive, as import growth drops back to a rate more in line 
with the pace of U.S. demand growth. 
• Factory output has been a relatively  bright spot recently.  After having  
decelerated in the first quarter, manufacturing production moved up 6¾ percent (annual rate)  in the second quarter, about 2½ percentage points 
faster than projected in the June Tealbook.  Surveys of manufacturers have been upbeat, on balance, in recent months and are consistent with our projection for factory output to incre ase 3½ percent this quarter, about the 
same as  in the June Tealbook. 
POTENTIAL GDP  AND THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT  
Absent any adjustments to our supply- side assumptions  relative to their settings in 
the June Tealbook, our updated estimates of real GDP growth during the first half of this year would have implied a ½ percentage point wider GDP gap in the second quarter, even as the unemployment rate gap was 0.1 percentage point narrower than projected.  Given the stronger tenor of a range of other indicators and our doubts about the measurement of real PCE , we judged the revisions to first -half GDP growth to be uninformative about the 
current degree of product- market slack.  To show greater consistency in our different 
measures of  resource utilizatio n, we lower ed our estimate of potential GDP  in 2014.

  • In particular, we lowered potential GDP in 2014 by enough to absorb the 
revision to GDP growth in  the first half of the year —which we are treating as 
being tantamount to m easurement error —and  to make  the output gap a little 
narrower  than in the June Tealbook, in line with our assessment that labor 
market conditions are better than we had expected.  This adjustment leaves 
our estimate of potential GDP growth in 2014 at zero. 
• On its face, this estimate may seem surprising.  We do not believe that the 
sustainable productive capacity of the economy actually fell in the first half of 
this year or that it will be flat for 2014 as a whole.  But confronted with the choice of letting  measurement error either contaminate the GDP gap or the 
growth of potential GDP, we chose the latter, as we view it as mo st important 
to provide our best calibration of the degree of slack in the economy.  We project that potential GDP will rise 1 ¾ percent in 2015 and 2 percent in 2016, 
the same as in the June Tealbook . 
• We made no adjustments to the natural rate of unemployment this forecast 
round; in particular, we continue to assume that the natural rate moved down 
to its  long-run level of 5¼ percent in the second quarter of this year. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Beyond the near term, our real GDP growth outlook has been revised down a 
little.   
• After rising  at an annual rate of 3½ percent over the second half of 2014, real 
GDP is expected  to increase at a 3 percent pace in 2015 and in 2016.  The 
small downward revision to 2016, about ¼ percentage point, is a consequence of the higher interest rates , the modestly lower house prices, and the slightly 
higher path for the dollar in this projec tion. 
• Real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 is supported by a further waning of 
restraint from changes in fiscal policy and a gradual expansion in the availability of mortgage credit.  Moreover, we expect that , over time, 
households and firms will apprehend that  the downside risks to the recovery 
are diminishing, leading to improved consumer and business confidence and 
providing additional support to consumer spending, business investment, and

  hiring.  ( For a different perspective, see the box “ Alternative View:  An 
Expectations Trap .”)   
• The magnitude of the projected step-up in real GDP growth in 2015 relative to 
2014 is exaggerated , in our assessment, by the experience of the first half, 
which we regard as anomalously low.   
• We project the GDP gap will be eliminated in the third quarter of 2015, three 
calendar quarters earlier than in the June Tealbook, and  that actual GDP will 
be 1¼ percent above potential GDP by the end of 2016, compared with 
¾ percent in the previous projection.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
In contrast to the negative surprise to GDP growth, the incoming data suggest that 
the labor market has been improving at a somewhat faster pace than anticipated in the June Tealbook. 
• Total nonfarm payrolls rose about 290,000 in June , and , with positive 
revisions to April and May, the level of total payrolls in June was 90,000 
above our previous Tealbook projection.  In response to  the stronger- than-
anticipated June employment report , we nudged up our forecast for average 
monthly job gains in  the third quarter  by 25,000, to 250,000.  
• The unemployment rate moved down 0.2 percentage point in June, to 
6.1 percent ; we had expected it to hold steady at 6.3 percent .  The 
participation rate , which we expected to ti ck up in June, remained at 
62.8 percent for a third consecutive month.   
• The staff’s labor m arket conditions index (LMCI) , which summarizes the 
movements in 19 labor market indicators, continued to move up in June .  That 
said, it points to somewhat less improvement in labor market conditions over the past year than would be indicated by the unemployment rate  taken alone .

  Taking all of this information on board, we now anticipate slack in the labor 
market to be eliminated  somewhat sooner than in our previous projection. 
• The unemployment rate in the second quarter, at 6¼ percent, was 1 percentage 
point above our estimate of its natural rate .  The jobless rate is expected to 
decline to the natural rate by the third quarter of 2015 (three calendar quarters 
earlier than in the previous projection) and to end 2016 at 4¾ percent , 
½ percentage point below our es timate of the natural rate .   
• We expect private nonfarm payrolls to increase 240 ,000 per month, on 
average,  in the second half of 2014—a touch  faster than in the June 
projection—and then to settle in a t an average monthly pace of a bit over 
200,000 in 2015 and in 2016, figures that are little changed from the previous 
Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Prices have risen  by a bit more than we anticipated  at the time of the June 
Tealbook.  We view some of these higher readings as likely transitory, but we have also taken a little signal from these surprises for inflation in the coming months.  O ver the 
medium term, our forecast  for inflation  is slightly higher in 2015 and 2016 than in the 
June Tealbook, reflecting the reduced resource slack in this projection.   
• With the June producer price index ( PPI) and consumer price index ( CPI) data 
in hand, w e estimate that total PCE p rices increased at an annual rate of 
2.3 percent in the second  quarter  (0.3 percentage point higher than our June 
Tealbook forecast) and that core PCE  prices rose  1.9 percent  (0.1 percentage 
point higher than the previous forecast).
5  In response, we marked up our 
inflation  projections for the second half of the year.  Nevert heless , we still 
expect core inflation to step down from the pace of recent readings, in part 
reflecting the residual seasonality that we think tends to raise PCE price 
inflation slightly in the first half of the year and suppress it in the second half.  
For 2014 as a whole, the projection for total PCE inflation revised up 
                                                 
5 We estimate that the four -quarter change in total PCE prices in the second quarter was 
1.7 percent, and the four -quarter change in core PCE prices was 1.4 percent.

 Alternative View:  An Expectations Trap  
Here we present the view that pessimistic expectations about the economic outlook, along with 
downbeat assessments of economic policy, are restraining the pace of economic growth.1  As 
long as households ’ and firms ’ expectations remain mired in a pessimistic and self -fulfilling 
“expectations trap,” economic growth will continue to be modest, rather than stepping up markedly and almost immediately as in the baseline Tealbook forecast.  If the economy is indeed mired in such a trap, a fundamental change in the framework for monetary  or fiscal policy might 
be required to move  the economy  to a high -growth equilibrium . 
Households’ expectations  about their economic prospects, particularly regarding future increases 
in their real incomes, are a fundamental factor determining the pace of consumer spending  
growth , and (as shown in the left -hand  panel  on this page) expectations for real income gain s 
remain considerably  lower than before the recession.  These pessimistic expectations could be 
reinforced by households’ assessments of whether the government’s economic policies have 
been good, which (as ind icated in the right -hand  panel on this page) have trended down, on 
balance, since the end of the recession and are quite low.  Consistent with this view, real PCE growth has averaged only about 2  percent over the past several years despite substantial gains in  
aggregate household wealth and steady incre ases in employment .  In contrast to the marked 
acceleration in the baseline Tealbook forecast, this modest pace of consumer spending could 
persist as long as households’ expectations and assessments  of economic policies remain 
downbeat.  
With firms having seen only modest increases in  demand for their output in recent years, some  
available measures suggest that companies’ expectations about general economic prospects 
have remained subdued.   For example, as shown in the left -hand panel on  the facing page, the 
share of firms in the NFIB survey  that think now is a good time to expand their business remain s 
well below its  pre- recession levels.   Moreover, as shown in the right -hand panel  on the facing 
page, a significant fraction of  respondents  to the survey currently view economic policies —either 
regulations or taxes —as the major problem they face.   Possibly reflecting these expectations , 
and reinforced by these policy assessm ents, business investment  has failed to sustain a material 
acceleration in recent years , and slow investment growth could continue.

 Labor market  conditions, while improving, remain disappointing and  may be fully consistent with 
pessimistic business and household expectations.  Th e pace of gains in private- sector 
employment has been roughly 200,00 0 jobs per month over the course of the recovery , but 
businesses  continue to  have an unusually large fraction of workers with only part -time schedules .  
And the marked decline in the unemployment rate in recent years has c oincided with a significant 
decline in the rate of labor force participation.  The outsized share of the population currently out 
of the labor force —even relative to the effects of demographic trends —could  be a nother  
manifestation of  both  households’   and businesses’ pessimism  about the economic outlook . 
Thus, economic activity could well be evolving in a manner more consistent with an expectations -based model with multiple equilibriums , rather than exhibiting the more 
conventional macroeconomic dynamics governed by movement back to a unique steady -state 
equilibrium.  Models with multiple equilibriums  have had a place in macroeconomics research for 
many years .
2  In these models , household and business pessimism can be self-fulfilling, with 
economic activity persistently mired in a low -expectations trap.  In this scenario, economic 
growth would be expected to remain stubbornly slower than in the baseline Tealbook projection  
and current approaches to monetary policy might prove incapable of gene rating an acceleration 
in economic activity.   
Nevertheless, if something were to change that caused expectations to shift considerably —
possibly the  result of breakthrough changes in government economic p olicies —then the pace of 
economic activity could rise significantly faster than in the baseline projection as the economy 
jumps from a low -growth to a high -growth equilibrium.  In this regard , it is interesting to note 
that, while not necessarily framing their arguments in terms of jolting the economy from one equilibrium to another, some observers have argued for a sharp break in the monetary policy 
framework.

 Has the Fall in Unemployment Overstated the Improvement in Labor Market 
Conditions?  A View from the Labor Market Conditions Index  
The unemployment rate has declined nearly 1½ percentage points over the past year.  However, partly 
because of factors such as the decline in the labor force participation rate and a stubbornly high share of involuntary part -time workers , many believe that the drop in unemployment has overstated the 
improvement in labor market conditions.  Here we use the staff’s l abor market conditions i ndex 
(LMCI), a summary measure of a broad array of labor market data derived from a factor model, to 
address this question.
1  
First , we compare the baseline LMCI with an alternative that has been computed without the last year 
of unemployment rate data.  Without the benefit of these data, the model must rely on internal predictions of the unemployment rate based on the historical relationship  of that series with other 
labor market indicators.  As shown in the panel on  the left, increases in the baseline LMCI (the solid 
line) have been substantially larger, on average, during the past year than those for the alternative index (the dashed line) computed without the unemployment rate data.    Next, we examine what the baseline LMCI (including all of its  19 indicators) would have predicted for 
the decline in the unemployment rate over the past year; this is  shown by the  black line in the panel on 
the right .  Notably, even though the baseline LMCI incorporates the signal from recent unemployment 
rate dat a, the actual unemployment rate (the red line) fell about ½ percentage point  more sharply 
than the model-based prediction.  Thus, unemployment has improved by more than the LMCI can 
explain based on its  best estimate of improvement in labor market conditions.  
 
                                                 
1 The LMCI summarizes variation from 19 labor market indicators including those for  unemployment  and 
underemployment, employment, vacancies, workweeks, wages, hiring, layoffs, quits, and survey measures of firms and 
workers.   For more on the LMCI, se e Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick, Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014),

  0.2 percent age point to 1.7 percent  and core PCE inflation revised up 
0.1 percentage point to 1.6 percent. 
• We now estimate that e nergy price s moved up noticeably  faster in the second 
quarter than projected in the June Tealbook, to an annual rate of 5¼ percent, 
reflecting  both an upside surprise to consumer electricity prices in May and a 
jump in gasoline prices in the June CPI that we expect to be largely reversed in the next couple of months.  W e expect  consumer energy prices to  decline 
slightly in the second half of this year and to drift gradually downward in 
2015 and 2016, though that downward drift is a little  milder than in the June 
Tealbook, reflecting the small upw ard revision to the projected path for crude 
oil prices .  
• Food prices also  have risen more than expected , boosted by drought 
conditions in some parts of the country.  In 2015 and 2016, food price increases are projected to slow to a pace just below core as the imprint of 
these transitory influences fades . 
• Core import prices are estimated to have risen at an annual rate of  just 
½ percent in the second quarter, somewhat less  than expected, reflecting in 
part falling prices of  imported foods.  Going forward, the projection is little 
changed  from the June Tealbook, with price increases  pick ing up to a 
1¼ percent pace in the third quarter and  remaining at that pace over the 
medium term, consistent with the moderate depreciation of the dollar in our projection .   
• We have revised up the core inflation project ion over the medium term by 
0.1 percentage point per year in response to the narrower margin of slack.  W e 
project core PCE inflation  to average 1.6 percent this year  and then to edge up 
to 1.7 percent  in 2015 and 1.8 percent in 2016.  Total PCE inflation is revised 
up by a similar amount, but—as before —the projected declines in consumer 
energy prices  and relatively slow increases in food and beverage prices  leave 
total PCE inflation a touch below core price inflation in 2015 and 2016.

6 Over the past 25 years, CPI inflation  (on a methodologically consistent basis ) has averaged about 
0.4 percentage point higher than PCE infla tion.  The gap varies over time in our projection because

  • We have raised the projection slightly for compensation gains.  A verage 
hourly earnings increased more than expected in June and were revised up in 
May, boost ing our near -term projection.  A s with  price inflation, the narrower 
margin of labor market slack suggest s faster wage gains  over the medium term 
as well .7  We now have the employment cost index increasing a little more 
than 3 percent, on average, in 2015 and 2016, up ¼ percentage point from the 
June Tealbook. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK   
• Beyond 2016, the federal funds rate continues to be set according to the 
prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.   
• The federal funds rate rises gradually from 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2016 to a little  above 4 percent by the end of 2018.  The Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of securities continue to put downward pressure on longer- term 
interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent, and the process of returning the 
SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected  to be completed by 2021. 
• Real GDP growth slows to 2¼ percent in 2017.  The unemployment rate 
edges down further in 2017 and is ¾ percentage point below its natural rate at 
the end of the year.  After 2017, real GDP rises more slowly than our estimate 
of potential growth as monetary policy works to offset the tight resource 
utilization .  The unemployment rate rises gradually back toward its natural 
rate.   
• With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to rise  gradually to the 
Committee’s target and the unemployment rate below the natural rate, PCE  
price inflation  moves up to 2 percent by 2018. 
                                                                                                                                                 
different components of inflation have different weights in the two indexes; for example, the CPI has 
relatively large weights for housing services and energy and a relatively low weight for medical  services.  
The gap is projected to be 0.5  percentage point this year, as a step -up in housing services price inflation has 
a relatively large effect on the CPI and low medical price inflation holds down the PCE price index, but only 0.3 percentage point i n 2015 and 2016, as projected declines in energy prices hold down the CPI more 
than the PCE price index.  
7 Our wage equations are more responsive to movements in slack than are our price equations, so 
the tighter slack in this forecast raised projected wag e inflation by more than PCE inflation.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign eco nomic activity  appears to be climbing out of its first-quarter pothole.  
Real GDP growth increas ed from 2.1 percent in the first quarter to an estimated rate of 
2½ percent in the second and is expected to rise to just over 3 percent in the second half 
of the year.  However, conditions continue to differ widely across countries .  Activity 
picked up shar ply in the second quarter in the emerging market econom ies (EMEs) , as 
second -quarter Chinese GDP data showed a substantial rebound and the Mexican 
economy appears to have sh aken  off the torpor of recent  quarters.   In contrast, growth in 
the advanced foreig n economies  (AFEs) slowed , as the Japanese economy contracted 
following the April 1 tax  increase, although more recent indicators suggest that Japanese 
spending has already begun to rebound.  Our  top-line estimate of second -quarter GDP  is 
close to that shown in the June Tealbook, with stronger- than-expected growth in EMEs 
offset by s lower -than-anticipated  growth in the AFEs.     
The projected second -half pickup in foreign GDP growth is linked to ongoing 
fiscal stimulus measures in China , the beneficial effect of stronger U.S. growth  on the 
Mexican economy, and a bounceback in Japan.  W e expect foreign growth to  improve a 
little more, to 3¼ percent, in 2015 and 2016 amid  continued supportive monetary polic ies 
in the AFEs.  F irming activit y in the advanced eco nomies, including the United States,  
also should have positive spillover effects to external demand for EMEs.  This projection is little changed from the previous Tealbook. 
We expect a gradual reduction in excess capacity to  push inflation up toward AFE 
central bank targets over the forecast period , although inflation rates in both the euro area 
and Japan are likely  to remain below the 2 percent  targets through 2016.  D iffering 
outlooks for growth and inflation suggest that the exit from accom moda tive monetary 
policy will vary across the AFEs .  We now expect  the Bank of England (BOE) to lift off 
at the end of this year, a quarter earlier than we had previously assumed.  The Bank of Canada (BOC) is sti ll expected to go next, wi th a rate hike by the middle of next year .  
As in previous forecasts, we do not expect the European Central Bank (E CB) or the Bank  
of Japan (BOJ) to raise rates during the forecast period .   
Monetary policy actions continue to vary  across EMEs .  Central banks in 
Colombia and Malaysia have tightened monetary policy since the June FOMC  meeting  to

  contain inflationary pressures.  In contrast, Chile cut its discount rate  to support growth.  
Turkey recently reduced its overnight borrowing rate by 175 basis points, citing the 
recent improvement in global liquidity conditions.  The recent rate cut partly rever ses the 
effective increase of 300 basis  points that occurred in January when the lira was falling 
sharply.  Nevertheless, the move came as someth ing of a surprise, given that inflation 
remains high. 
Several risks to the outlook are worth noting.  Financial market volatility has 
fallen to a remarkable extent, providing welcome breathing room for some of the more 
vulnerable EMEs but at the same time raising concerns that markets may have become complacent.   Consequently, once normalization of monetary policy in advanced 
economies starts in earnest, it may have unusually disruptive spillover effects.  EMEs may also be vulnerable to a financial crisis and economic slowdown in China, a scenario 
explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  Another scenario looks at the effect of a 
sharp increase in oil prices should the crises in the Middle East and Ukraine continue to worsen .      
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Japan.  Household spending data suggest that the April consumption tax hike 
contributed to an estimated 5¼ percent decline in  real GDP in the second 
quarter .  Although the drop in GDP now appears to be steeper than previously 
expected, it did not fully reverse the first -quarter gain of 6.7 percent, when 
spending surged in anticipation of the tax hike.  More recent indicators, 
including June consumer sentiment and manufacturing PMI, point to a rebound in economic activity.  Factoring in  previously announced fiscal 
stimulus measures and ongoing monetary easing, we expect  GDP growth to 
average a little more than 2 percent in the second half of this year before dropping to less than 1 percent , on average , in 2015 and 2016, partly 
reflecting drag from another tax hike.  The April tax increase is estimated to have pushed inflation to an annual rate of 9¼ percent  in the second quarter; 
inflation excluding the tax hike was likely around 1 percent.  We see inflation  
just below 1 percent in the second half of the year before picking up to 1½ percent by the end of 2016 along with  the slow erosion of excess capacity.   
With inflation below target, we still expect  the BOJ  to step  up the pace of 
asset purchases somewhat in early 2015.

  • Euro area.  We estimate that euro -area GDP growth picked up to nearly 
1½ percent in the second quarter from 0.8 percent in the first.  Recent 
indicators are mixed but, on balance, suggest a continuing slow recovery.  
Composite PMI and consumer confidence rose, on net, in the second quarter, and indicators of household spending continued to increase, but industrial production was down slightly .  We expect GDP growth to remain a little 
below 1½ percent in the second half of this year before gradually increasing  to 
nearly  2 percent in 2016 as fiscal drag diminishes, credit conditions ease, and 
monetary policy remains accommodative.  The projected pace of GDP growth is sufficient to narrow the output gap from about 4 percent of potential GDP currently to 2½ percent at the end of 2016, which should support an increase in inflation.   Inflation  edged up from ¼ pe rcent in the first quarter to 
½ percent in the second as energy prices turned up, and it is projected to rise to 1½ percent by the end of 2016.  We  continue to expect  the ECB  to keep its 
benchmark  policy rate at 0. 15 percent through the end of 2016 and  to consider 
significant further stimulus through large -scale asset purchases only if risks of 
prolonged low inflation appear to increase.   
• United Kingdom.  The U.K. recovery remains brisk .  Although industrial 
production and retail sales dipped in May, this softness followed several months of solid  gains  and PMI readings through June show strong 
momentum.  We forecast GDP to rise 3 percent this year and 2½ percent in 2015 and 2016.  June inflation data were higher than expected, pushing our 
forecast for inflation in the second half of the year to nearly 2½ percent.  
However, the uptick was largely due to temporary factors, and we project inflation to be around 2 percent in the next two years.  In dications by BOE 
officials, including Governor Carney’s June 12 Mansion House speech suggest ing that U.K. policy rates could rise sooner than markets expected, 
caused  us to bring forward our projection of the first BOE rate hike t o late 
2014.  In response to rising house prices and household indebtedness, the 
BOE’s Financial Policy Committee made two recommendations:  first, that 
lenders l imit, to  a share of 15 percent , their mortgage lending for new 
mortgages whose size exceeds  4.5 times the borrower ’s income, and secondly, 
that lenders assess whether borrowers could still afford their mortgages if the policy rate rose 3 percentage points in the first five years of the loan.  The issuance of these recommendations is c onsistent with  the BOE’s preference

  for using macroprudential tools rather than monetary policy to manage 
financial stability risks .   
• Canada.  R ecent data suggest that GDP growth picked up to 2¼ percent in the 
second quarter, after having been held to just 1.2 percent in the first quarter by 
severe winter weather  and weak U.S. demand.  Although monthly GDP data 
for April were somewhat disappointing, leading us to mark down our second-
quarter estimate a bit, manufacturing shipments posted a solid gain in May, and the manufacturing PMI rose further in June.  We expect growth to average  
around 2½ percent  over the forecast period, a touch above its trend pace, as 
Canada’s small output gap closes.  Second- quarter inflation , at 3.7 percent, 
was higher than our June estimate .  The surprise was partly due to increases in 
retail energy prices  that we view as temporary, but core inflation also  firm ed.  
As energy prices  drop back, inflation is projected to return to near  2 percent 
over the forecast period.  We continue to  project that the BOC  will begin 
raising its target for the overnight interest rate  in the second half of 2015.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China .  Recently  released GDP data suggest that economic growth in China 
rose to 7¾ percent in the second quarter from 5½ percent in the first.  The second -quarter growth rate is 1½ percentage points higher than our previous 
forecast .  The rebound appears to reflect both a reversal of the first -quarter 
plunge in exports as well as a boost to domestic demand from fiscal and monetary stimulus.  Retail sales, which include government purchases, 
accelerated during the quarter, partly as a result of  the steady stream of 
targeted stimulus measures implemented  since March.  In contrast, fi xed-asset 
investment growth continued to moderate, led by sharply slowing real estate 
investment in  a cooling property market.  W e expect the effects from more 
accommodative fiscal and monetary policies to  further bolster domestic 
spending during the secon d half, which should also help stabilize the property 
sector.  As a result, we forecast that economic activity will expand at a 
7½ percent pace in the second half of the year before moderat ing to just above 
7 percent in 2016, in line with declining potenti al growth.  Inflation picked up 
to a still-subdued 1¾ percent in the second quarter from ¾ percent in the first.  We expect inflation to rise further to about 3 percent as earlier food and fuel price declines are reversed.

  • Other Emerging Asia .  We estimate that GDP growth in the rest of emerging 
Asia improved to a 3½ percent annual pace in the second quarter from 
2½ percent in the first.  Th e gain  was due primarily to a pickup in the 
economies that saw the largest first -quarter slump s in trade.  In Hong Kong, 
Malaysia, and Taiwan, industrial production and exports revers ed earlier 
declines, while PMIs improved late in the second quarter.  In addition, output 
in Thailand appears to have stabilized after a sharp first -quarter contraction 
linked to political unrest.  In contrast, growth likely moderated in Singapore 
and in Korea, where April’s ferry disaster weighed on consumer sentiment.  Improvement in the advanced economies and solid growth in China should help growth in the region rise to a trend- like pace of 4¼  percent by next year.  
Inflation is expected to pick up to 3¾ percent toward year-end, largely in response to mounting food price pressures in India after a dry monsoon 
season, and then settle at 3½ percent over the rest of the forecast period. 
• Latin America .  After a prolonged period of weakness, Mexican  GDP  is 
estimated to have grown at a 3 percent  annual rate in the second quarter, about 
½ percentage point higher than we had projected in June.  Manufacturing output rebounded, especially in the motor vehicle sector, supported by a strengthening of U.S. manufacturing and a concurrent increase in exports.  
Moreover, indicators point to a recovery in private consumption following a first-quarter slump related to hikes in tax rates and administered fuel prices.  
Construction activity also edged up after having declined  since mid -2012.  W e 
project  Mexican growth to pick up a little further to 3¾ percent by the end of 
2015 and to stay at that rate in 2016.  Inflation was boosted to over 5 percent in the first quarter by the tax increases, but it is expected to drop back to an average of 3¼ percent over the forecast period.     
• GDP growth in Brazil  is estimated to have stalled  in the second quarter.  The 
weakness in activity was broadly  based:  Industrial production, PMIs, and 
consumer confidence deteriorated  further, while exports expanded only 
moderately.  G rowth is expected to  pick up somewhat over the forecast 
period, as improving global conditions contribute to higher exports, yet 
remain fairly sluggish, averaging a little less than 2 ½ percent.  Inflation 
increased  to an annual rate of 8¼ percent in the second quarter but is expected  
to moderate to 5½ percent by next year, as World Cup pressures on service

  prices dissipate and tight monetary policy continues to constrain economic 
growth .     
• In Argentina , the already  gloomy economic outlook is clouded further by 
downside risks from a possible default on sovereign debt.  The government 
faces a July 30 deadline to either pay holdout creditors in full or reach an 
agreement with them before servicing its restructured debt.  (See the discussion of foreign developments in the Financial Developments section for details.)  
• Tensions over the situation in Ukr aine and Russia have escalated further .  
Even before the downing of a Malaysia Airlines aircraft  last week , the United 
States announced new sanctions against a number of large Russian firms in the financial, energy , and defense sectors.   In the wake of the airline tragedy, a 
number of European countries also have indicated that they may adopt additional sanctions.  Russia’s stock market declined in response to the se 
developments.  Ukraine signed a long- awaited  trade deal with  the European  
Union on June 24.  An IMF team was sent to Ukraine in June to assess the 
status  of the conditions for the second tranche of a $17 billion bailout, and a 
decision on the tranche is expected in the next several weeks.

Financial Developments  
Financial conditions eased somewhat, on balance, over the intermeeting period, 
although geopolitical risks  weighed on investor sentiment at times .  Investors appeared to 
interpret FOMC communications as suggesting that policy would remain highly 
accommodative for a substantial time despite an uptick in inflation and incoming data on labor market conditions that w ere somewhat stronger  than  expected.  
• Market -based  measures of near -term policy expectations edged down.  
Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s primary dealer survey  continued to 
see the first increase in the federal funds rate as most likely  coming in the 
third quarter of 2015, though the distribution of the expected time moved in slightly . 
• Yields on longer- dated nominal Treasury securities  declined over the 
intermeeting period, as did similar yields in advanced foreign economies, continuing the trend observed since the start of the  year. 
• Amid a solid  start to the corporate earnings season, most broad equit y price 
indexes  rose 1 to 2 percent .  Risk spreads on high-grade corporate bonds wer e 
little changed , but spreads on speculative-grade bonds widened somewhat.  
• Banks reported a further easing of lending standards and stronger demand for 
most loan types in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) .  Borrowing costs for most households and 
businesses stayed low by historical standards. 
• The foreign exchange value o f the dollar edged lower on net.  Concerns about 
a large Portug uese bank, and the risk of further litigation against European 
financial institutions , weighed on European equity indexes.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
The implied path of the federal funds rate over the near term , based on a direct 
read of financial market quotes, edged down over the intermeeting period.1  Monetary 
policy communications were characterized  by market participants as signaling a slightly 
more accommodative stance than had been expected .  Investors were apparently relieved 
that the FOMC did not signal a shift toward tighter policy despite strong payroll growth, 
the recent u ptick in inflation, and some indications of complacency in financial markets .  
Market participants also took note of the discussion of monetary policy normalization  in 
the minutes of the June FOMC meeting  and, particularly , the discussion of the likely 
spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate.   
Consistent with the small moves in the path of the implied federal funds rate over 
the intermeeting period, responses to the Desk surveys indicate that market participants’ expectations of the timing  of the federal funds liftoff and the subsequent policy path we re 
largely  unchanged from the June survey.  Both buy- side and sell-side market participants 
continue to see the third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the liftoff of the federal funds rate, although, relative to the June survey, some respondents put some what  
higher odds on an earlier liftoff date.   In apparent response to the discussion in the June FOMC minutes, the median expected spread between the ON RRP and IOER rates 
following liftoff increased from 10 basis points in  the June survey to 20 basis points in 
July.  
Yields  on 10- and 30- year nominal Treasury securities  fell 18 basis points and 
17 basis points, respectively , over the intermeeting period, while shorter- term Treasury 
yields were little changed .  On net, economic data left little imprint on longe r-dated 
yields, as increases associated with the strong labor repor t were offset by declines  
stemming from the weaker first- quarter GDP report .  (See the box “Are Investors 
Insensitiv e to Economic News?” )  Yields also fell on the release of the June minutes and 
reportedly on concerns about worrisome  geopolitical events .  The decline in l onger- term 
yields likely  also reflect ed a continuation of the factors , such as dec reases in interest rate 
                                                 
1 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9  basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

 Are Investor s Insensitiv e to Economic News?  
 
One particular concern for monetary policymakers is that market participants 
have not been appropriately adjusting their positions in markets in response to 
economic developments, perhaps because they anticipate continued monetary 
accommodation for a long period of time.  Such a view would likely be reflected 
in low responsiveness of market interest rates to incoming economic data.      
 
The f igure on the facing page shows estimates of time -varying sensitivities of 
forward yields on Treasury securities —at near- and longer-term horizons —to 
data surprises in nonfarm payrolls (top panel) and a  broader set  of 
macroeconomic indicators (bottom panel) .  The estimates are calculated by 
regressing daily changes in forward rates on the surprise component of the news 
releases  over one -year rolling samples ending in the period specified on the 
x-axis.1  
 
As shown in both  panels, none of the measures indicate unusually low levels of 
data  sensitivity compared with their historical ranges.2  Even so, t he sensitivities 
of long -term forward rates  (the solid blue lines)  moved down in late 2013 and 
early 2014, consistent with investors coming to  view the path of the Federal 
Reserve’s large-s cale a sset purchase p rogram as relatively insensitive to 
economic developments  following the introduction of the “measured steps” 
language in the post -meeting statement  last December.  T he sensitivities of near-
term forward rates (the dashed black lines) have shown smaller, mixed changes , 
on balance, since late 2013.   
  
  
                                                 
1 The surprise component of a release is measured as the difference between the released 
indicator and its expectation based on the Action Economics  Weekly Survey .  For the broader 
set of macroeconomic indicators , the estimates from the second step  of the following two -
stage procedure are plotted.  First, daily changes in forward rates are regressed on release 
surprises for 13 economic indicators, scaled by the standard deviations of the surprises, in the 
sample spanning the period from January 1, 1990, through July 18, 2014.  Then, a linear 
combination of economic surpri ses, weighted by their estimated coefficients, is used as a 
regressor in one-year rolling sample regressions to capture time variation in the overall 
sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news.   
2 The statistical significance of the sensitivities varies over time, but in recent months, the 
estimated sensitivities of the forward rates to payroll employment and the aggregate measure 
have generally been significantly different fr om zero at the 5 percent level.  We also 
considered  the sensitivity of the forward rates to CPI releases, but the estimates  were rarely 
significant.

  uncertainty and perhaps also a reduct ion in investors ’ expectations for  long er-run growth, 
that have been pressuring rates lower since the start of the year .2   
Other fixed -income market indicators were about unchanged over the 
intermeeting period.  U ncertainty about longer -term interest rates implied by swaptions 
remained l ow.  TIPS -based five -year i nflation compensation was little changed, while 
five-year inflation compensation five  years ahead edged up.  The current -coupon agency 
MBS yield decreased 13 basis points, about in line with longer- term Treasury yields.  
EQUITY PRICES AND BOND SPREADS  
The S&P 500 index rose 2 percent over the intermeeting period , as a solid  start to 
the earnings season offset some concerns about the geopolitical events.  With about  
one-fourth  of S&P 500 companies having report ed, profits in the second quarter appear to 
have grown modestly relative to the first quarter, and a slightly higher-than- typical 
fraction of firms b eat Wall Street estimates for earnings and revenue.  Banks  have 
reported mixed  earning results , with the largest banks indica ting better -than-expected 
results while regional bank results were generally in line with estimates .3  After a 
commercial aircraft was shot down in Ukraine, equity market implied volatility  as 
measured by the VIX rose sharply .  However, the VIX subsequently declined and is 
unchanged , on net, over the intermeeting period at a low level .  (See the box 
“Perspectives on Low E quity M arket V olatility. ”)  Small-cap stocks underperformed over 
the period, with the Russell 2000 down nearly 2 percent.   
The spread s between yields on investment-grade bonds and those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities w ere about unchanged, but those for speculative- grade  bonds 
widened somewhat.   Corporate bond spreads remain near or slightly higher than the low 
levels reached during previous expansionary periods. 
                                                 
2 The box “What Explains the Recent Decline in Long -Term Forward Rates?” in the June 2014 
Tealbook, Book A, explores possible explanations for the decline in yields.  
3 Profits  at large domestic banks  generally beat expectations because of strong investment banking 
fees and smaller -than- expected declines in revenue from mortgage s and trading .  Net interest margins  
inched lower.  Banks continued to  report an increase in risk -based capital ratios under Basel III rules and 
improvements in meeting the proposed liquidity coverage ratio rule.   All but three  systemically important 
institutions met the proposed enhanced supplementary leverage ratio minimum .

 Perspective s on Low Equity Market Volatility  
Many broad measures of financial market volatility have fallen in recent months to low levels 
not seen in several years.  Here, we characterize current levels of equity market volatility from a 
longer- term perspective and consider, along a couple of dimensions, what today’s low levels of 
volatility might mean for financial market conditions  going forward . 
Figure 1 shows the realized volatility of daily returns for the S&P 500 equity index back to 1962 
and one- month -ahead options -implied volatility for the index back to 1990 (when  those 
volatilities  became available).  While the current level of options -implied volatility is very near 
the bottom of its historical range, that range is relatively short.  R ealized volatility, which 
implied volatility  tends to tr ack quite closely, currently stands at about the 15th percentile of its 
longer historical range.  A n important  characteristic of realized volatility is that it has tended to 
remain at low levels for protracted periods of time, particularly dur ing economic expansions.   
Broadly similar long -term patterns are evident for the realized volatility of returns on long -term 
Treasury notes, invest ment -grade corporate bonds, and foreign exchange rates (not shown).  
One question is whether low levels of volatility tend to be associated with adverse outcomes in 
financial markets or for the macro economy , perhaps because the low volatility reflects 
imprudent risk -taking that eventually leads to elevated losses.  Figure s 2A and 2 B show  that 
periods of low equity market volatility do not tend to be followed by sharply negative equity 
returns  or steep  increases in volatility, at least not at the one -year horizon .  However, moderate 
increases in volatility are more likely when current volatility is low.  Similar analyses  fail to 
support the notion that low current volatility tends to predict other adverse events such as contractions in real GDP.  
Of course, this  simple analysis does not test whether other factors such as buildups in financial 
leverage or risk -taking t hrough other means interact substantially with low volatility to create 
important vulnerabilities in the financial system that imply elevated risks of adverse events , 
perhaps several years in the future.

 In particular, the current  low interest rate environment has generated a “reach for yield” 
motive among some investors, which has  been  manifested,  for instance, in a number of 
investment firms across asset classes selling volatility—that is , providing  others with insurance 
against large moves in asset  prices.  Such a trading strategy will tend to generate income so 
long as volatility remains low.  Market participants note that asset managers have been  the 
main sellers of volatility  recently , while the demand for volatility from traditional buyers such as 
pension funds, levered funds , and insurance companies has been relatively subdued, reflecting 
limited hedging  demand in an environment of low volatility.  
Consistent with their traditional market -making role, dealers are the primary intermediaries of 
volatility -sensitive options and related products in the market. Because of the increased supply 
of and subdued demand for volatility products, dealers appear to have increased their holdings 
of these instruments.  In figure 3, we plot aggregate measures of “vega” and “gamma” for 
some broker-dealers supervised by the Federal Reserve.  These measures capture the dealers’ 
profit and loss exposure to increases in the implied volatility of U.S. equities and increases in the size of movements of equity prices, respectively.  These measures  indicate that dealers would 
profit from a rise in volatility, and that the downside risks of  an increase in volatility may be 
concentrated outside of the broker- dealer sector.  Of course, we are able to observe these 
exposures only imperfectly, and we cannot rule out that broker- dealers might suffer losses as a 
result  of a sudden reversal of volatility, particularly sin ce that event would likely be 
accompanied by a downturn in the prices of many risky assets.

  FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Long -term yields in advanced economies continued the downward trend observed 
since the start of the year, with rising geopolitical tensions —in the Middle East and 
Ukraine—constitut ing an additional factor this intermeeting period.  Ten -year sovereign 
yields fell  substantially in a number of countries, including 20 to 25 basis points in the 
United Kingdom and German y, while two -year yields declined  only slightly.  Concerns 
about one of Portugal’s largest banks and about litigation risks f acing  European banks 
weighed on European markets.  Mixed news from emerging market economies (EMEs), 
including better- than-expected  Chinese growth and concerns about Argentina’s upcoming 
scheduled debt payments, generally had modest market effects.  The broad trade-weighted dollar declined about ½ percent over the intermeeting period.  Bilateral exchange rate movements were also gener ally modest.  
Shortly after the close of the June Tealbook, policy expectations for the United 
Kingdom moved sharply higher following Governor Carney’s Mansion House speech, in which he stated that the first increase in policy rates “could happen sooner tha n markets 
currently expect.”
4  Market participants now anticipate that the first rate hike will come 
in the fourth quarter of 2014, one quarter earlier than just before the speech.  In contrast, expectations for the path of policy rates in the euro area co ntinued to decline, as inflation 
readings remained low and as industrial production data in the euro area came in below market expect ations.  Sweden’s Riksbank, reacting to very low inflation, reduced its 
policy rate 50 basis points, to 25 basis points, a surprisingly large move, and the central bank of Norway adopted an easing bias. 
In Europe, headline equity price indexes declined over the period, dragged down 
by a sharp fall in the price of banking- sector  shares, which ended the period lower by 
9 percent  in the euro area and 4 percent in the United Kingdom.  The drop in banking 
shares was attributed both to fears  that additional U.S. litigation against European 
financial institutions could be forthcoming after the imposition of record fines on BNP Paribas and to financial difficulties involving Banco Espírito Santo (BES), one of 
Portugal’s largest ban ks.  Earlier this month , BES stock declined precipitously following

  missed debt payments and alleged accounting irregularities at BES’s parent firm, 
Luxembourg-based holding company Esp írito Santo International . 
Despite rising geopolitical tensions,  most e merging market equity indexes and 
bond yields  ended the period little changed on net.  The United States announced 
additional sanct ions that place restrictions on U.S. long- term financing to large Russian 
banks and energy companies, and that freeze the assets of a number of Russian defense 
companies.   The sanctions, along with the subsequent downing of a commercial aircraft 
in Ukraine , weighed on Russian share prices, which declined 5 percent over the period, 
though the ruble was little changed on net.   
Developments in the ongoing litigation by holders of Argentina debt who refused 
to participate in the country’s most recent  restructu rings raised the prospect that 
Argentina may once again default.  By allowing a lower -court ruling to stand, the U.S. 
Supreme Court , in effect,  order ed Argentina to pay the bondholders who had refused to 
accept Argentina’s earlier restructuring s before making its regular payment to those who 
did participate in the restructurings.   These payments must be made by July 30.  Market 
participants interpreted the ruling as sufficiently broad that it may constrain the ability of 
other sovereigns to restr ucture debt.  EME bond yields, however, showed little reaction to 
the ruling. 
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL  FINANCE  
The pace of borrowing by nonfinancial businesses remained strong in June.  
Gross issuance of bonds by domestic nonfinancial corporations stayed bri sk for both 
investm ent- and speculative- grade firms .  About half of the speculative- grade issuance 
was for purposes other than the refinancing of existing debt, though much of this issuance 
appeared to be for mergers and leveraged buyouts rather than incremental capital 
investment.   
Commercial and industrial loans at banks rose  robustly in the second quarter, 
consistent with banks’ reports of stronger loan demand from large and middle- market 
firms in the July SLOOS.5  Explanations for the step -up in loan demand w ere wide  
ranging,  with banks putting significantly more weight than in the previous survey on

  increased financing needs associated with M&A  activity .  Concurrently, strong issuance 
of leveraged loans was supported by continued robust demand from institutional 
investors.  In particular, issuance of collateralized loan obligation s is on pace to reach a 
record high this year, with terms and standards in the underlying loans continuing to 
weaken .  Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was roughly unchanged over the 
intermeeting period.       
Credit conditions in the commercial real  estate (CRE) market improve d further in 
the second quarter.  According to the July SLOOS, banks continued to ease their 
standards and report stronger demand.  In addition, significantly more banks said they eased their lending standards for CRE loans over the past year than was the case for  other 
major loan categories .  Issuance of commercial mortgage -backed securities  in June was 
strong, and the number of deals reportedly in the pipeline suggests that issuance will pick 
up further in the third quarter.  
Financial conditions in the municipal bond market overall were stable despite 
volatility in Puerto Rican bond prices after the passage of a law in Puerto Rico that 
allowed  public corporations to restructure their debt.  In response to the legislation , the 
credit rating  agencies downgraded the bonds of Puerto Rican public corporations by up to 
five notches and its general obligation bonds by up to three notches. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Consumer credit  continued to expand  robustly in May , largely on the strength of 
auto and student loans, though credit card debt has begun to pick up as well .  
Respondents to the July SLOOS indicated that  demand  for auto loans from banks 
strengthened in the second quarter.  In addition, banks reported that the level of their 
lending standards for subprime auto loans w as easier than the midpoint of their ranges 
since 2005.  Delinquencies on auto loans continued to move sideways around post- crisis 
lows , although repossession rates at finance companies that specialize in lending to 
subprime borrowers have risen over the past year . 
Credit card debt outstanding at commercial banks rose in the second quarter at a 
pace that was  the strongest since mid -2008.  According to the July SLOOS, demand for 
credit card loans increased , banks raised credit limits for the fifth  consecutive survey, and 
a few banks reported that the level of their lending standards for credit card loans had eased relative to a year ago .  Consistent with that assessment, supervisory data on new

  credit card accounts at the largest bank holding companies suggested an increase over the 
past year in the share of new accounts originated to borrowers with lowe r credit scores.  
However, banks reported in the SLOOS that the level of their standards remained tighter 
than the midpoint of their longer- term ranges, and, overall,  the amount of credit that has 
been extended to borrowers with relatively low credit  scores is still small.    
Credit c onditions in mortgage markets were largely unchanged  over the 
intermeeting period , with mortgage rates holding steady around 4 percen t and origination 
volumes remain ing low.  The share of mortgages becoming newly  delinquent slowed to 
record lows ; the share of delinquent mortgages overall continued to decline as well .  
According to the SLOOS, a few large banks have reportedly eased their  under writing 
standards on prime home-purchase loans over the past year, but, on net, the level  of 
banks’ standards on all types of residential real estate loans reportedly remained tighter 
than the midpoints of their longer- term ranges.   Only a few banks  indicated in the 
SLOOS that the C onsum er Financial Protection B ureau ’s ability -to-repay and qualified 
mortgage rules were reducing  approval rates for prime conforming home- purchase 
loans.6  In contrast, the approval rates for prime jumbo and nontraditional mortgage loans 
were reportedly somewh at lower as a result of the new rules.  Respondents pointed to the 
increased documentation requirements for assets and income and the 43 percent back-end debt- to-income ratio requirement for the qualified mortgage status as the most significant 
reasons for  the tightening .     
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Testing of t he Federal Reserve’s overnight r everse r epurchase a greement  
(ON RRP ) operations and Term Deposit Facility (TDF) continued over the intermeeting 
period.  A s a result of somewhat higher market repo rates, ON RRP take- up, on average, 
was a little lower than in the prior period.  In TDF testing that ran from mid -May to early 
July, g radual increases in offer rates and in the maximum individual award amounts 
generally resulted in higher participation.    
                                                 
6 The Ability -to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards under the Trut h in Lending Act requires 
creditors to determine that a borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the mortgage.  Lenders face 
lower litigation risk under the rule if they originate mortgages that satisfy the qualified mortgage standards.  
The rules took effect in January 2014.

  Participation in the ON RRP exercise jumped to a record high  on the June 30 
quarter -end.  The record take-up reportedly reflected efforts by foreign banking 
organizations (FBO s) and other financial intermedia ries to limit the size of their balance 
sheets on financial reporting dates and, as a result, le ft money market cash investors in 
need of alternative overnight investments such as  the ON RRP operation.  FBO s, in 
particular,  have reduced the size of their balance sheets significantly on recent reporting 
dates, apparently in response to new regulatory requirements.7   
In permanent open market operations, the Federal Reserve purchase d $23 billion 
in Treasury securities and committed to purchase $34 billion in MBS  over the period, 
pushing the total size of the balance sheet to $ 4.4 trillion as of July 2 1, 2014.8  The 
monetary base rose about 11½ percent at annualized rate in June, primarily reflecting the 
higher reserve balances  resulting from the continued asset purchases .   
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury market were largely unchanged over the 
intermeeting period, although fails -to-deliver were elevated at times in June, a 
development market participants attributed partially to a contraction in dealer balance sheets leading up to quarter-end.  Liquidity conditions in  the MBS market remained 
stable.   The ratio of the Desk’s MBS settlements to gross issuance decreased to 
44 percent  in June from a high of 95 percent in March .  The decline was the  result of both 
decreased purchases and a seasonal increase in  MBS issuance .  These factors likely also 
reduced  settlement pressures in the MBS  market , and t he Desk executed no dollar rolls 
on its agency MBS purchases  over the period.   
                                                 
7 The shrinkage of FBO balance sheets has also been associated with lower trading volumes in the 
federal funds and Eurodollar markets  on reporting dates .  
8 Treasury net issuance of coupon securities was $46 billion over the intermeeting period, and 
gross issuance of agency MBS in June was $ 67 billion .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.   The first  
scenario considers the possibility that recent upsid e surprises  in various indicators of 
labor market  conditions and business confidence are the harbinger of a more rapid take -
up of slack, which leads to a noticeable increase in inflation .  By contrast, in the second 
scenario, we assume that the first -quarter declines in GDP and GDI are more indicative 
of the underlying momentum of the economy than assumed in the baseline.  In particular, 
weak housing activity as well as adverse feedback between household spending, business 
investment, and hiring combine to reduce the pace of the expansion.  The third scenario  
outlines the effects of a financial crisis in China that has strong spillover effects to other EMEs  and to the United States .  In the final scenario, geopolitical tensions intensify , 
causing oil prices to rise markedly.  Separately, we report our analysis of a scenario in 
which risk premiums jump as part of a sudden reversal of current low  levels of risk 
premi ums in bond markets .  (See the box “ Credit  Market Turbulence in Two Models.”)  
We generate the fi rst two  scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two  
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its effective lower bound, its movements are governed—as in the baseline forecast —by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the Committee’s recent statements.
1  In all cases, we assume that the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
                                                 
1 Specifically, in the first and second scenarios, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in the 
quarter following the observation of an unemployment rate of 5.6 percent, the level of unemployment 
prevailing in the baseline one quarter prior to liftoff .  For the last two scenarios, we assume a broadly 
similar policy rule to the one used in the first two scenarios.  One key difference relative to the FRB/US 
simulations  is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual 
output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

 Credit Market Turbulence  in Two Models 
As noted in this month’s  “QS Assessment of Financial Stability ,” investors in 
certain asset classes may have become complacent, contributing  to low 
expected volatility  and high asset valuations:  T erm premiums  on Treasury 
securities remain modest , and credit spreads on corporate bonds have also 
reached low levels.  In addition , lending standards in certain market segments 
have eased substantially.  These situations could rever se quite suddenly.  We 
explore the effects of such a reversal in two models, FRB/US and a DSGE  model.1  
We assume that the key effects can be captured  in each of the two models by an 
increase in interest rate premiums  that raise private- sector borrowing costs .  
FRB/US and the DSGE  model differ in many ways .  In the DSGE model, aggregate 
spending is considerably more interest  sensitive than in FRB/US.  In addition, the 
risk premium within the DSGE model is a spread of the short -term private 
borrowing rate over the federal funds rate, whereas in FRB/US, the risk premium 
drives a wedge between longer- term borrowing rates and the expected path of 
the federal funds rate.  Finally , the DSGE model includes an explicit model of 
finan cial frictions that generates a feedback loop between falling asset values, 
rising risk premiums , depressed investment , and even lower asset values.  I n 
FRB/US, the risk premium is also sensitive to economic conditions, but rather 
than being based on a structural model, this sensitivity is a function of expected 
future output gaps.   
The scenario involves an exogenous shock to risk premiums  of 90 basis points .  In 
FRB/US, this shock directly raises a wide spectrum of longer- term private- sector 
interest rates , including mortgage and corporate bond rates, as well as the equity 
premium .  The counterpart in the DSGE model is a jump in the premium on short -
term borrowing (and saving) by firms and households  that  gradually decays ; this 
sequence of premiums is chosen to average 90 basis points  over 10 years .  As a 
result, the effect of the shock on long -term interest rates is similar in both 
models, but the DSGE model also features a sharp rise in short -term borrowing 
rates .  In both cases, t he premium increase  occurs at the end of this year; the 
premium then slowly  reverts to its normal value thereafter.  
The following figure s present the effect  of this shock in the two models.  In the 
DSGE model (as shown by the d otted blue lines) , the rise in interest rates 
depresses consumer spending and leads to a 2 percentage point widening in the 
output gap  relative to baseline.  Inflation falls  only a little, both because the 
model’s Phillips curve is flat and because, in this model, high borrowing costs  
                                                 
1 The DSGE model is a variant of the model in Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and 
Frank Schorfheide (2013), “Inflation in the Great Recession and New Keynesian Models,” 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 618 (New York:  FRBNY, May (revised April 
2014)), www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr618.html .

push up firms ’ marginal cost s.  With a weaker economic outlook, liftoff for the 
federal funds rate is delayed by a full year relative to the baseline.2   
By contrast, the increase in premiums in FRB/US results in a smaller deterioration 
of the economy, which delays lif toff by only two quarters .  In FRB/US, t he output 
gap falls by 1 percentage point  relative to baseline at the trough .  
The much larger drop in  output in the DSGE model than in FRB/US  occurs 
primarily because spending (especially consumer spending) is  much more 
sensitive to interest rate changes in the DSGE model, as noted earlier.  This may 
result, in part, from the fact that an increase in risk premiums within the DSGE 
model affects all short - and long -term borrowing costs.  Indeed, some research 
suggests  that the effects of increases in borrowing costs that only affect long -
term interest rates have more muted effects on output  than the type of risk 
premium shock in this DSGE model, but such alternative models remain largely at the development stage.

2 Monetary policy in the DSGE model is set using the same policy rule as in FRB/US, 
discussed in the  main text of the Risks and Uncertainty section.  While the DSGE model lacks an 
unemployment variable, an implicit threshold is set using the output gap.

 Stronger Activity with Higher Inflation  
Some recent data have surprised us on the upside and may indicate that 
underlying aggregate demand conditions are stronger than assumed in the baseline.  At 
the same time, we currently estimate that overall PCE inflation was 2¼ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, at the high end of its range in the past few years, and we also estimate that core PCE inflation register ed its highest quarterly readings  in more 
than two years.  In this scenario, we assume that recent labor market improvements boost 
the confidence of households and businesses in the durability of the expansion and spark a virtuous cy cle marked by more rapid output growth than in the baseline.  W e also  
assume that, going forward, inflation will be  considerably more sensitive to resource 
slack than is implicit in the FRB/US model, more in line with estimates in some other models.  
  All told, r eal GDP growth reaches an annual rate of 4½ percent in the second 
half of this year and averages 4 percent over 2015; the unemployment rate falls slightly below 4 percent by the end of 2016.  With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises notably higher than in the baseline.  The federal funds rate lifts  off one quarter 
earlier and rises more steeply thereafter, moving above 4 percent in  2016 and reaching  
above 6 percent in 2018.  Nevertheless, inflation rises substantially above target to  3 percent at the end of 2018.
2  Thus, in this scenario, the economy moves in fairly short 
order from missing on the weak side of both legs of the dual mandate to missing on the strong side.   
Weaker Household Demand 
In the staff’s baseline analysis, the first -quarter declines in GDP and GDI are  
assumed  to reflect , to a large degree, what amounts to statistical noise .  In this scenario, 
the recent aggregate output readings prove to be more indicative of aggregate demand 
going forward than the staff currently assumes.  Consumer spending is restrained, and 
housing activity does not mount the recovery that is anticipated in the baseline.  Instead, residential investment rises , on average, only 2½ percent per year , in line with longer-run 
trend growth.  These factors spawn a vicious cycle  of lower  household spending gains, 
reduced output growth, and a slower pace of business investment and hiring.  As a result, 
                                                 
2 The surge in inflation shown in this scenario stems from the substantially steeper Phillips curves. 
Had we used our s tandard coefficients in the wage and price Phillips curves in FRB/US, inflation and the 
federal funds rate would have peaked at 2.2 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively.

5½ percent by the end of 2018.  With resource uti lization  rising much more gradually 
than in the baseline, inflation also rises more gradually  and the federal funds rate does not 
lift off until the fourth  quarter of 2017.  
China -Driven EME Crisis  
Our baselin e forecast assumes that output growth in China remains relatively 
robust and that the Chinese authorities are able to largely contain China’s growing 
financial vulnerabilities.  However, a number of developments could possibly trigger a severe financial cr isis, including a bust in the property sector or a run on China’s rapidly 
expanding shadow banking system.  In this scenario, we assume that China experiences a financial meltdown that also precipitates financial crises in other major EMEs.  (This scenario  was featured in a memo accompanying the July 2014 “ QS Assessment of 
Financial Stability. ”)
3 
For this exercise, we assume EME borrowing costs soar and the confidence of 
EME households and businesses weakens substantially.  EME currencies depreciate against  the advanced economy currencies about 20 percent, on average, relative to the 
baseline, even though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates in order to attenuate capital outflows.  All told, real GDP in both China and other EMEs declines 7 per cent relative to the baseline by the end of 2015.  
The stress in the EMEs is assumed to have financial spillovers to the rest of the 
world.  In the United States and other advanced economies, corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline relative t o the baseline, while flight- to-safety flows push down 
term premiums on government bond yields.  In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  As a 
                                                 
3 The design of this scenario, including the size and persistence of shocks, is ident ical to the 
“Broader EME Crisis” scenario described in the memo titled “China’s Financial System Risks and 
Potential Spillovers to the United States from a Chinese Financial Crisis,”  which accompanies the QS 
report.  However, the effects on U.S. GDP and unemployment reported in this scenario, which are based on the July Tealbook baseline, are noticeably smaller in absolute terms than the effects reported in the memo, 
which were based on the June Tealbook baseline.  The smaller effects reflect that monetary policy has more scope to offset adverse shocks, given that the path of the federal funds rate is steeper after liftoff in the July 
Tealbook baseline (although the liftoff date remains unchanged); moreover, monetary policy is now 
assumed to keep the policy rate at its effective lower bound until the unemployment rate falls below  
5.6 percent, compared with 5.8 percent in June.

 result, U.S. real GDP growth is only 1 percent in 2015 and the unemployment rate hovers 
around 6 percent through 2016.  With substantially greater resource slack and lower 
import prices, U.S. core PCE inflation dips to around ½ percent in 2015.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rat e remains at its effective lower bound for almost three 
years longer than in the baseline.   
Higher Oil Prices  
Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and between Russia and the West could 
intensify in coming months, reducing global oil supplies and caus ing oil prices to rise 
markedly.  In this scenario, oil prices increase $30 per barrel above the baseline by the end of this year before partially receding.
4  Higher oil prices dampen consumer spending 
and business investment.  All told, U.S. real GDP rise s at an annual rate of only  
2¾ percent in 2015 and 2016, and the unemployment rate is 5 percent at the end of 2016, about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  The higher energy costs cause the total PCE inflation rate to jump to 4¼ percent in the second half of this year, and put more persistent —albeit modest—upward pressure on core inflation.  The liftoff date of 
the effective federal funds rate is delayed one quarter relative to the baseline, and the path 
is slightly flatter thereafter.  
                                                 
4 Based on options on oil futures, f inancial markets appear to assign a less than 5 percent chance 
that the price of crude oil will r ise more than $30 relative to the Tealbook baseline by the end of this year.

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained(2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus.Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
