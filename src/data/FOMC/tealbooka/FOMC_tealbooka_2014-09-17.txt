Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that we have receiv ed since the July Tealbook suggests a 
somewhat weaker pace of economic recovery th an we had previously projected.  The two 
latest monthly employment reports showed  somewhat less improvement in the labor 
market than we had expected.  In respons e, we have nudged down our forecast of job 
gains—and nudged up our forecast of the une mployment rate—through the end of the 
year.  And overall consumer spending has been disappointing, despite strong motor 
vehicle sales.1  On the brighter side, industrial pr oduction has continue d to advance, and 
forward-looking indicators from the manufactur ing surveys have been quite strong.  All 
told, we now expect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of a little le ss than 3 percent in 
the second half of this year, ½ per centage point below the July Tealbook. 
Our medium-term projection for economic activ ity is also a little weaker than in 
the July Tealbook, mainly reflecting a higher proj ected path for the exchange value of the 
dollar as well as a modestly lower projected  path for house prices.  Even so, we still 
expect output growth to pick up over the next two years as factors that have been 
restraining the economic recovery continue to ease and confidence in the underpinnings 
of the economic situation improves further.  Our current forecast anticipates that real 
GDP will increase 2.7 percent next year and 2.9 percent in 2016, ¼ percentage point lower, on average, than our forecast in the July Tealbook.  With monetary policy 
accommodation being withdrawn, GDP growth is  anticipated to slow to 2¼ percent 
in 2017.  
The projected path of the unemployment rate is higher in this projection, and 
entails less undershooting of the natural rate, than in the Ju ly Tealbook.  Nevertheless, the 
unemployment rate still is pr ojected to edge down graduall y over the next several years 
and bottoms out at just a little below 5 pe rcent in 2017, roughly ¼ pe rcentage point below 
our estimate of the natural rate.   
                                                 
1 This assessment may need to be revised.  On Thursday, September 11, after Book A of the 
Tealbook closes, we are scheduled to receive second-q uarter data from the Quar terly Services Survey.  
On Friday, September 12, we are scheduled to receive the retail sales report for August along with revised 
estimates for June and July.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following 
the June 2014 FOMC meeting.  The table below compares the staff ’s current  
economic projection to the one we presented in the June Tealbook.  Relative to 
the June Tealbook, we have marked down somewhat our projection for real GDP 
growth in the second half of this year and over the next three years.  The 
unemployment rate is expected to be slightly lower at the end of this year than it 
was in the June Tealbook, but our projection over the subsequent three years is a 
bit higher than it was in our June forecast .  By the end of the medium-ter m 
projection, the output gap comes into line with the signal from the 
unemployment rate gap.  
The staff’s projections for both overall and core PCE inflation are little changed, 
on balance, from those in the June forecast.  We continue to project that both 
core and headline inflation will remain below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective through 2017.  With our forecasts for inflation and resource utilization 
similar to what they were in the June Tealbook, and our assumption that the 
federal funds rate will lift off in the second quarter of 2015 unchanged, the 
projected path for the federal funds rate is about the same as it was in our 
June forecast.

  The recent price data have come in softer than we expected.  We continue to think 
that core inflation will slow from the s econd-quarter pace of 2 percent, and we now 
project core PCE price inflati on of 1½ percent in both the thir d and fourth quarters.  Over 
the medium term, we still expect core infl ation to step up gradua lly as resource slack 
diminishes, reaching 1.8 percent in 2017; the path is a bit lower than in July, mainly 
reflecting the weaker outlook for real activity.  Over the medium term, consumer energy 
prices are expected to be fairly flat, caus ing headline inflation to run a little below 
core inflation.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are unchanged from the previous projection.  We assume that asset purchases will conclude by the end of October, leaving the cumulative am ount of purchases under the current 
program at close to $1.5 trillion. 
 We continue to assume the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  We construe the two-quarter lag 
from the assumed end in asset purchases to the liftoff of the federal funds rate 
to be consistent with the “consider able time” language in the Committee’s 
recent statements. 
 Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.  The rule 
puts the federal funds rate at about 2. 3 percent at the end of 2016 (60 basis 
points lower than in the July Tealbook)  and at 3.2 percent at the end of 2017 
(70 basis points lower than in the Ju ly Tealbook).  Both figures are little 
changed relative to the June Tealbook. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The anticipated trajectory for the 10-year Treasury yield averages about 15 basis points lower over the medium  term than in the July Tealbook, 
reflecting the downward adjustment to th e projected path of the federal funds 
rate.  Our projection continue s to call for a significant  rise in Treasury yields, 
primarily because of the movement of  the 10-year valuation window through

  the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well as a gradual 
waning of the effects of the FO MC’s balance sheet policies. 
 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium 
term have revised essentially in line with our revisions to the path for the Treasury yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 The current level of equity prices is in line with our July Tealbook projection.  Our forecast has stock prices rising at an average annual growth rate of 5½ 
percent in the pr ojection period. 
 Compared with the July Tealbook projection, the incoming house price data 
have been weaker than expected, on balance, and we have extrapolated 
forward some of that weakness.  As a result, house prices, which are currently 
slightly above their historical relationship with rents, return to our rough 
benchmark of fair valuation a bit more quickly in this projection than in the 
July Tealbook.  We expect house price appreciation to continue to slow—
from 12 percent in 2013 to 5 percent th is year and about 3 percent per year 
from 2015 to 2017. 
Fiscal Policy 
 Our assumptions for fiscal policy are essentially unchanged from the July 
Tealbook.  The box “Fiscal Policy Re straint and Government Budget 
Conditions” reviews the prof ile of fiscal impetus over the projection period. 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that real GDP in the forei gn economies rose at an annual rate of 
nearly 3 percent in the third quarter, up from a 2¼ percent pace in the first half.  We expect foreign growth to pi ck up a bit further to around 3¼ percent 
over the rest of the forecast period.  This forecast is little changed from that in 
the previous Tealbook.  
 The broad nominal index for the dollar has appreciated about 1¾ percent since 
the previous Tealbook, with the dollar rising 4 to 5 percent ag ainst the euro, 
yen, and pound.  Going forward, we expect the broad real dollar to depreciate 
at a 1 percent pace, with all the deprec iation coming against the currencies of

 Fiscal Policy Restraint and Government Budget Conditions 
Over the past several years, fiscal policymakers at all levels of government have enacted 
spending reductions and tax increases as a reaction to the deterioration in budget 
conditions after the most recent recession.    In response , discretionary fis cal policy actions , 
on balance, have been a drag on economic growth in recent years.  Government budget 
conditions have improved, however, and pressures for additional fiscal restraint are 
expected to diminish substantially this year and over the medium term.   
The left-hand panel at the bottom of this page shows the staff’s measure of  fiscal impetus 
(FI), which is our estimate of the contribution to real GDP growth from discretionary 
changes in fiscal policy (excluding multiplier effects).  We estimate that the drag on real GDP 
growth from fiscal policy actions at all levels of government was 1 percentage point in 2013, 
but that it is narrowing to only ¼ percentage point in 2014 (the black line).  As shown by the 
blue portion of the bars, decreases in real federal purchases were an important factor in the 
restraint estimated for last year, but they are making a much smaller negative contribution 
this year .  Since 2011, federal purchases have contracted because of the Budget Control Act’s 
discretionary spending caps and the reductions in overseas military operations.  But federal 
purchases declined more precipitously in 2013, reflecting the onset of the federal spending 
sequestration as well the government shutdown that temporarily held down purchases in 
the fourth quarter of that year.   The contribution to fiscal restraint from changes in tax es 
and transfers (the green portion of the bars) was sizable last year, reflecting the expiration 
of the temporary payroll tax cut as well as the implementation of tax increases on high-
income households.  However, these tax changes are estimated to exert a smaller drag on 
consumption spending growth this year than last, and the restraint from the ending of the 
Emergency Unemployment Compensation program at the beginning of this year will be 
about offset, in our estimation, by the boost to consumption that we expect will be induced 
by the expansion of health insurance coverage under the Affordable Care Act.   
Finally, modest increases in state and local purchases (the purple portion of the bars) 
provided a small boost to real GDP growth last year and are expected to do so this year as 
well, largely manifesting as gains in state and local employment .  As shown in the lower-right 
panel, state and local government payrolls have been expanding over the past six quarters.

 Fiscal restraint and the effects of the continuing economic recovery have led to improved 
budget conditions for federal, state, and local governments.  For example, as shown by the 
black line in the left-hand panel at the bottom of this page, the federal budget deficit 
declined from 10 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4 percent last year.  Changes in federal fiscal 
policies have reduc ed the structural deficit (the red portion of the bars), which excludes the 
effects of endogenous movements in tax revenues and spending that result from the 
business cycle (the yellow portion of the bars).   We expect the deficit to remain around 
2½ percent of GDP over the medium term, a level consistent with temporarily stabilizing the 
ratio of federal
 debt to GDP above 70 percent, given our projection for GDP .  Over the 
medium term and beyond, the normalization of interest rates will push up federal debt-
servicing costs as a share of GDP .  In addition, the aging of the population and ongoing 
increases in health-care costs are expected to put more sizable upward pressure on the 
structural deficit over the longer term .   
Similar factors will also restrain state and local budgets over the medium and longer terms , 
including pressures from their underfunded employee pension sytems and from rising costs 
for Medicaid and health-care programs for state and local government retirees .  State and 
local tax receipts, shown in the lower-right panel, have posted moderate gains since the 
second half of 2010 and are projected to continue increasing at a similar pace over the 
medium term .  Initially, these revenue increases were used to improve budget positions and 
shore up depleted rainy day funds, but since last year these greater revenues have 
supported mode st increases in hiring.   Over the medium term, we expect this pace of 
revenue growt
h to allow state and local governments to slowly restore their employment to 
its previous peak , even though long-term rising costs for health and retirement programs 
will weigh heavily on the se governments’ budgets for the foreseeable future.   
All told , recent improvements in government budget conditions have reduced the need for 
further fiscal restraint over the medium term.  However,  the current high level of federal 
debt, along with the longer-term budget pressures facing all governments, allow little room 
for expansionary fiscal policy actions.   Indeed, further budget restraint will likely be needed 
to reduce federal
 debt and provide fiscal policymakers with the capacity to respond to 
unforeseen events.

  the emerging market economies, while the dollar appreciates against the 
currencies of the advanced economies.  The projected pace of dollar 
depreciation is little changed from the previous Tealbook, thereby maintaining 
the higher level of th e dollar throughout th e projection period. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $8 per barrel since the time 
of the previous Tealbook, although conti nued concerns about the longer-term 
outlook for global oil production amid ge opolitical turmoil have led farther-
dated futures prices to fall by less.  Cons equently, we project that the price of 
imported oil will decline less steeply than  in the previous forecast, falling 
from about $92 per barrel at the end of th is year to $89 per barrel at the end of 
2017—a forecast about $7 per barrel and $2 per barrel less, respectively, than 
in the July Tealbook. 
 Nonfuel commodity prices are down s lightly from the July Tealbook.  Among 
the categories with the largest price dec lines are iron ore, owing to continued 
expansions of Australian shipments,  and corn and soybeans, reflecting 
favorable weather conditions.  Over the forecast period, we project nonfuel 
commodity prices to increase only slightly. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The most recent information indicates that a ggregate output in the first half of this 
year was not quite as anemic as earlier estima tes had suggested.  However, the bulk of the 
upward revision was concentrated in inventor y investment, and we unwound some of the 
inventory surprise in the second half.  Moreover, we pushed down our near-term 
projection significantly in reaction to the su rprising softness in consumer spending in 
July.  We now anticipate that real GDP growth will average an annual rate of a little less 
than 3 percent in the second half of the year , about ½ percentage point less than in the 
previous forecast.   
 Overall consumer spending this quarter appears to be on a considerably 
weaker trajectory than we had expect ed despite very strong motor vehicle 
sales in August.  Indeed, we are now fo recasting that real PCE will increase at 
an annual rate of only 2 percent in the third quarter, 1½ percentage points 
below our forecast in the July Tealbo ok.  Some of the downward revision can

  be traced to the effects of unusually cool summer weather on energy demand, 
a pattern that will reverse as temperatur es normalize.  Even after accounting 
for these weather-related swings, however , the data in hand suggest that the 
pace of spending has remained lacklust er.  In light of these data—which 
extend a string of negative PCE surp rises—we trimmed our forecast for 
spending growth in the next several quarters.   
 Incoming data about housing activity have  been encouraging.  Existing home 
sales have moved up at a brisk pace in recent months, and starts and permits 
have improved from the low levels recorded  early in the year.  We continue to 
forecast a modest acceleration in activity  over the remainder of this year, as 
ongoing job gains and diminishing concerns about the economic outlook support the recovery in household formation, boosting the demand for new 
homes and hence construction activity.   
 Investment in equipment and intangibles increased at a moderate pace of 
about 5 percent in the first half of the y ear and is projected to remain close to 
that rate in the second half.  Business  investment in nonres idential structures 
(outside of the drilling sector) rose only  modestly, on average, in the first half 
of the year, and our forecas t for the second half calls for more of the same.  
 Even with a strong rebound in the se cond quarter, real exports only edged 
higher, on net, over the first half of this  year.  In the second half, exports are 
expected to rise at a moderate annual ra te of 4 percent, depressed a bit by the 
drag from past dollar appreciation.  Real imports are expected to rise at a 
moderate pace of 2¼ percent in the s econd half, in part held back by a 
continued decline in imports of oil.  Altogether, the ex ternal sector is expected 
to contribute ¼ percentage poi nt to real GDP growth in  the second half of this 
year after having subtracted a full pe rcentage point in the first half. 
 Smoothing through wide swings in mo tor vehicle production, manufacturing 
output appears to have increased modera tely, on net, in July and August.  
Looking ahead, we project manufacturing production to expand at a moderate 
annual rate of about 3½ percent in the s econd half of the year, broadly similar 
to our forecast in the July Tealbook.  That said, national and regional 
manufacturing surveys have been quite strong and may point to some upside 
risk in this forecast.

  POTENTIAL GDP  AND THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT  
The BEA’s annual revision to real GDP a nd GDI, published at the end of July, did 
not substantially alter the recent relationshi p between the unemployment rate and output.  
In particular, the tensions we perceive betw een product and labor market developments in 
the first half of this year remain unresolved.  We therefore have held  to the strategy, laid 
out in the July Tealbook, of reacting to these tensions by adjusting potential GDP growth 
in 2014 so as to keep the output gap fr om becoming grossly misaligned with our 
assessment of the degree of slack in the labo r market.  We expect potential GDP to rise 
1¾ percent next year and to accelerate gradua lly thereafter, the same as in the July 
Tealbook.2 
The revised NIPA figures and incoming data did lead us to make some 
adjustments to our estim ates of potential output: 
 On net, the level of real GDP in the final quarter of 2013 was reported to be 
¼ percent lower than in the previous vintage of NIPA data, and—consistent 
with our practice in response to prev ious NIPA revisions—we made small 
downward adjustments to our estimates of potential growth over the past 
several years such that the output gap at the end of 2013 was unrevised 
relative to the July Tealbook. 
 In light of the two employment reports  released since the July Tealbook, we 
see current and prospective labor market conditions as a little weaker than we 
previously believed and the unemployment rate gap as a little wider than expected.  In order to preserve the relative positioning of the output and 
unemployment gaps, and with  GDP growth revised up in  the first half of the 
year, we marked up our assumption for the growth of potential GDP this year by ½ percentage point.  This revisi on unwinds part of the downward 
adjustments to potential GDP th at we made in July.   
                                                 
2 We made no adjustments to the natural rate of unemployment this forecast round; thus, we 
continue to assume that the natural rate completed th e decline to its long-run level of 5.2 percent in the 
second quarter of this year.

  THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We continue to project a pickup in the pace of output growth over the next two 
years, but we have tempered the acceleration somewhat in this  projection.  We now 
expect GDP growth to move up from 2 pe rcent in 2014 to 2.7 per cent in 2015 and to 
almost 3 percent in 2016.  In 2017, as monetary policy accommodati on continues to be 
removed, output growth slows, but at 2¼ percent, it remains above potential.   
 The net downward revision to GDP growth  is largely a consequence of the 
higher path for the dollar as well as th e modestly lower path for house prices 
assumed in this projection.   
 Given the persistent weakness in hou sehold spending in recent quarters 
relative to our forecasting models, we ad justed the time profile of real PCE 
growth.  The adjustments included build ing in a little more sluggishness this 
year and next year and then adding a little  more strength thereafter to bring the 
level of spending more nearly back  in line with fundamentals.   
 As in previous Tealbooks, we expect that GDP growth will be supported by a 
further waning of restraint from changes in fiscal policy and a gradual expansion in the availability of mortga ge credit.  Moreover, as activity and 
employment continue to strengthen, consumer and business confidence should 
improve and provide additional support to spending growth.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The incoming data suggest that conditions  in the labor market continue to 
improve, but at a somewhat slower pace than we anticipated in the July Tealbook. 
 Gains in nonfarm payroll employment averaged about 180,000 in July and August—the two reports released si nce the July Tealbook—well below the 
monthly increases of 250,000 that we had been expecting.  Some special factors may have contributed to the shor tfall relative to ou r expectations, but 
we nonetheless nudged down our forecast fo r the average monthly job gain in 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Authorized for Public Release
   
  the final four months of this year, from 240,000 in the previous Tealbook to 
220,000 in the current Tealbook.3   
 The unemployment rate in August stood at 6.1 percent, 0.1 percentage point 
above our forecast in the July Tealbook.  The labor force participation rate 
was 62.8 percent in August, in line with our July expectations.     
 The preliminary reading on the staff’s labor market conditions index (LMCI), which summarizes the movements in 19 labor market indicators, was up 
slightly over the past two months.  Movements in the LMCI continue to 
indicate that labor market conditions  over the past year have improved by 
less than would be inferred from viewing only the decline in the 
unemployment rate.   
Taking all of this information on boar d, as well as the weaker outlook for 
economic activity, we now anticipate that slack  in the labor market will be eliminated 
somewhat later than in our previous projection. 
 We have nudged down our forecast for mont hly job gains, and we now expect 
them to average about 190,000 over 2015 and 2016, compared with the 
average of around 220,000 that we projected in the July Tealbook.  In 2017, 
the pace of job gains is expected  to slow to about 150,000 per month. 
 Over the medium term, the unemploymen t rate is around 0.4 percentage point 
higher than in the previous  projection, and it drifts dow n to 4.9 percent at the 
end of 2017, ¼ percentage point below the natural rate. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
In response to faster-than-expected declin es in oil prices, we have marked down 
our projection for total PCE price inflation in the second half of  this year.  But otherwise, 
the price projection is very similar to the one we presented in the July Tealbook, with 
                                                 
3 Among the special factors, many  employees of the Market Bask et grocery store chain in New 
England were temporarily off payrolls in August due to a labor dispute.  In addition, there is some reason to 
believe that the August payroll gain was understated.  On average over the past decade, August payroll gains have been revised up by about 60,000 jobs between the first and third readings.  (There were 
unusually few auto layoffs in July and therefore fewer r ecalls in August, but this f actor washes out over the 
two months.)

  core PCE price inflation expected to step up gradually over the medium term as resource 
slack is eliminated.   
 The July reading on core PCE prices supported our view that some of the 
large price increases in the second quarte r would prove to be transitory.  In 
fact, that reading was even a little lower than we expected, leading to a 
downward revision of ¼ percentage point to our forecast for core inflation in 
the current quarter.  We took little sign al from the July surprise beyond this 
quarter.  All told, we now expect core PCE prices to rise at a rate of 1½ 
percent in both the third and fourth qua rters—held down slightly by the traces 
of residual seasonality th at we find in these data and by lower core import 
price inflation. 
 With the recent drop in crude oil pric es, which has already started to feed 
through to lower gasoline prices, we now expect PCE energy prices to 
decrease at an annual rate of about 6 pe rcent in the second ha lf of this year, a 
larger decline than we had projected in the July Tealbook.  Energy prices are 
projected to be relatively flat ove r the remainder of the projection.  
 Food price inflation has begun to ease,  as favorable crop conditions have 
contributed to a marked decline in farm  prices.  Accordingly, we project PCE 
food price inflation to slow to an annua l rate of 1½ percent in the second half 
of the year from 3 percent in the first half. 
 After rising at an annual ra te of only ¼ percent in th e second quarter, prices of 
core imported goods are expected to in crease at a still- subdued pace of 
½ percent in the second half of 2014, restrained  by the ongoing drag from 
dollar appreciation.  Core import price in flation is then expected to average 
around 1¼ percent per year, consistent w ith moderate foreign inflation and 
our projection for only slight dollar deprec iation.   
 In the medium term, we have revise d down slightly the core inflation 
projection in response to the wider margin  of resource slack.  We forecast that 
core PCE inflation will edge up 0.1 percentage point per year over the 
medium term, reaching 1.8 percent in 2017.  Total PCE inflation follows a 
similar contour to core inflation, but th e fairly flat path of consumer energy

  prices leaves total PCE inflation a touch below core price inflation in each of 
the next three years.    
 Compensation per hour in the business sector is now estimated to have 
increased at a pace of 4½ percent in the first half of this year, 3 percentage 
points faster than in the July Tealbook.  But in light of the extreme volatility 
of these estimates and the relatively moderate increases of average hourly 
earnings and the employment cost i ndex over the same period, we have 
interpreted the first-half strength in compensation per hour as broadly 
consistent with our forecast of a ge neral acceleration as  resources become 
more fully utilized.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK   
 Beyond 2017, the federal funds rate conti nues to be set according to the 
prescriptions of an inertial version of th e Taylor (1999) rule.  This policy rule 
assumes a long-run equilibrium level of  the nominal federal funds rate of 
3¾ percent.   
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be 
completed by 2021.  Risk premiums on corporate equities an d corporate bonds 
edge down toward thei r longer-run levels.   
 The federal budget deficit conti nues to widen beyond 2017, primarily 
reflecting fast-rising tran sfer payments for retirement and health-care 
programs.  The ratio of federal debt to GDP is about 73 percent in 2018 and 
edges up thereafter.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar moves down about 1¼ percent 
in 2018 and stays constant after that.  The price of crude oil holds steady in 
real terms.  Foreign real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 3 percent from 
2018 to 2020. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is 5.2 percent, and potential GDP rises 
around 2 percent per year on average from 2018 to 2020.

   With the output above its potential level,  the federal funds rate is slightly 
above its longer-run value in 2019. 
 As monetary policy accommodation is be ing withdrawn, real GDP slows to a 
touch below 2 percent in 2018 and then c ontinues to run for a while slightly 
below the assumed growth rate of potential output.  The unemployment rate 
stays flat at just under 5 percent in 2018 before gradually edging up toward its 
natural rate.  
 Consumer price inflation remains a b it below the long-term objective of the 
Committee at the end of 2017.  However,  with the unemployment rate below 
the natural rate, longer-run inflation expectations gradually move up to the 
Committee’s target, and consumer pri ce inflation reaches 2 percent by 2019.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Real GDP growth in the foreign economies edged up from 2 percent in the first 
quarter to 2¼ percent in the second.  Growth rebounded strongly in Canada, China, and 
Mexico, supported by a reversal of the first-quarter weakness in exports.  In contrast, the 
Japanese economy contracted sharply following the April 1 tax increase, activity 
stagnated in the euro area, and the Brazilian economy fell into recession.  Although the 
euro-area economy was significantly weaker than expected, upward surprises in some 
other countries, including Canada and Mexico, left total foreign growth in the second 
quarter only slightly below our July estimate. 
We continue to expect foreign growth to rise to a 3 percent pace in the second half 
of this year.  Along with the recovery of the Japanese economy from its tax-induced 
slump, we expect some firming of growth in the euro area and emerging Asia and a 
modest resumption of growth in Brazil.  Foreign growth should then settle around 
3¼ percent over the next three years as monetary policies in the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) remain supportive. 
Inflation has stayed very low in the euro area and inflation expectations have 
declined, leading the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut interest rates and announce 
plans to purchase private assets.  With euro-area inflation expected to remain 
significantly below the 2 percent target, the ECB is projected to keep its policy rate near 
zero through 2017.  (See the box “Euro Area:  Inflation Developments and Outlook. ”)  
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) also is likely to keep it s policy rate near zero as inflation 
remains below target.  In contrast, in o ther major AFEs, with inflation approaching 
2 percent and economic slack diminishing, policy stimulus is likely to be gradually 
withdrawn:  We assume that tightening will begin early next year in the United Kingdom 
and around the middle of the year in Canada.   
We are attentive to several risks to the foreign outlook.  In the euro area, 
disappointing growth and persistently low inflation raise the possibility that the recover y 
will stagnate, which could prompt the ECB to respond with a full-blown asset purchase 
program that includes government bonds.  Another downside risk is the possibility that 
geopolitical tensions, especially an escalation of the crisis in Ukraine, will disrupt world 
energy and financial markets.  (These two scenarios are explored in the Risks and

 Euro Area:  Inflation Developments and Outlook  
Twelve-month headline inflation in the euro area has declined further this year, falling 
to 0.3 percent in August (see the upper-left figure on the following page).   In 
peripheral Eur
ope, inflation rates have fallen into negative territory, posing concerns 
that a debt-deflation spiral could derail the fragile recovery .  Market measures of 
inflation expectations have moved down as well.  As shown in the upper-right figure 
on the following page , five-year inflation expectations had been declining for some 
time, and they fell dramatically in August.  Similarly, inflation expectations between  
5 and 10 years ahead —the ECB’ s preferred measure of inflation expectations —
drifted lower this year before dropping to below 2 percent in August (a development 
seen only twice before).  Thus, financial markets appear to be giving greater weight 
to the possibility that inflation will remain persistently below the ECB’s objective  and, 
more generally, to the risks of deflation, which ha ve pushed down euro-area bond 
yields (not shown).  This pessimism has been reinforced by the slackening of the 
already anemic pace of the economic recovery, reflected in the se cond quarter’s flat 
GDP and the weakness of more recent indicators .  
To address these mounting concerns, in June the ECB cut its policy rates, announced 
targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and said it would explore purchases of 
asset-backed securities (ABS).  With the outlook continuing to flag, the ECB surprised 
markets at its September 4 meeting by again cutting interest rates and pledging to 
begin purchasing ABS and covered bonds in October.1  We expect that these actions 
will suppor
t the euro-area recovery and thereby contribute to a reduction in slack 
and a firming of core and headline inflation rates (lower-left figure on the following 
page). 
Given the steady deterioration of the inflation outlook in the past few years, our 
projection that this trend will reverse might seem optimistic.  However, a simple 
accounting decomposition of quarterly headline inflation into energy, food, and core 
inflation (shown in the lower-right figure on the following page) suggests that much 
of the weakness since the third quarter of last year can be explained by a sharp fall in 
food and energy prices (particularly of natural gas), as the supply outlook for crops 
improved and unusually warm winter weather depressed energy consumption.   
Going forward, with food and energy prices bottoming out, headline inflation should 
rise toward core, which has held much steadier in recent quarters.  Moreover, it bears 
noting that the declines in inflation that have occurred this year are evident only 
when inflation is measured on a 12-month basis.  When measured on a quarterly 
basis, inflation has been moving up since it had fallen to near zero in late 2013 ; data 
through August suggest that quarterly headline inflation should rise to about 
¾ percent in the current quarter.   
                                                 
1 The ECB will announce details of this asset purchase program at its October policy 
meeting.

 Our expectations-augmented Phillips curve models, which explicitly consider the role 
of other factors such as economic slack and inflation expectations, support the 
importance of supply shocks (proxied by changes in oil and import prices) in 
restraining euro-area inflation since the end of 2013.2  The disappointing performance 
of the euro-area economy in the first two quarters of this year, which unexpectedly 
widened output gaps, also contributes, albeit modestly, to lower inflation than our 
model predicted earl ier in the year.   With growth projected to pick up, output gaps 
should narrow, which should also lend some slight impetus to inflation.  
 
However, uncertainty about the outlook for the euro area remains significant, as still-
elevated debt levels and high unemployment rates continue to weigh on the fragile 
recovery .  Accordingly, there is some risk that the euro- area economy could 
experience a prolonged period of disappointing growth and low inflation, 
necessitating further monetary policy stimulus.  This scenario is explored in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section. 
 
                                                 
2 As discussed in the January 2014 Tealbook box “Inflation Developments in the Advanced 
Foreign Economies,” our inflation models relate  quarterly headline inflation to a measure of longer-
term inflation expectations, the staff’s estimate of the output gap, changes in consumption taxes, a 
set of supply shocks (changes in oil and import prices), and a residual that captures sources of 
variation in inflation not accounted for by the model.

 Euro area.   Euro -area GDP was flat in the second quarter, a substantially 
weaker outcome than estimated in the July Tealbook, as output contracted in 
Germany and Italy.  Although the negative surprise is partly explained by 
transitory factors, more recent data also point to somewhat less underlying 
strength, with retail sales in July below their second-quarter level and the 
composite PMI softening through August.  Accordingly, we expect GDP to 
grow at only a 1 percent pace in the second half of this year before firming to 
a still-subdued 2 percent rate in 2016 and 2017, supported by accommodative 
monetary policy. 
With data through August in hand, we estimate that inflation will move up 
from 0.4  percent in the second quarter to ¾ percent in the current quarter, and 
we project an increase to 1½ percent by the end of 2016 as the output gap 
narrows.  Nevertheless, market-based inflation expectations have fallen as 
economic data have been disappointing.  In response to these developments, 
the ECB surprised markets by cutting its key policy rates 10 basis points at its 
September meeting, reducing its main refinancing rate to 0.05 percent and the 
rate on its deposit facility to negative 0.2 percent.  The ECB also announced 
that, starting in October, it will purchase asset-backed securities and covered 
bonds ; our working assumption is that purchases will total about €300  billion.  
We estimate that these measures will add ¼ percent to GDP after two years 
and nearly 0.1 percentage point to inflation.  We assume that the ECB will 
keep its main refinancing rate unchanged through the end of 2017.   
 United Kingdom.   The U.K. economy continues to grow at a solid rate, 
although recent manufacturing PMI and retail sales data suggest some 
moderation from the robust 3¼ percent pace of the first half of the year.  We 
see growth averaging 2¾ percent in the second half before stabilizing at a 
near-trend pace of 2½ percent thereafter.  We expect U.K. inflation to remain 
around 2 percent over the forecast period.  With the output gap narrowing and 
inflation near target, we still see the Bank of England (BOE) hiking rates 
fairly soon.  However, we have pushed back our assumption for when liftoff

 will occur by one quarter to the first quarter of 2015, largely in response to the 
dovish tone of the August Inflation Report , in which the BOE suggested that 
recent subdued wage growth could indicate more slack than previously 
thought.  The possibility that Scotland could choose to be an independent 
country in the September 18 referendum is a risk to the outlook for the U.K. 
economy and for monetary policy. 
 Japan.   We expect GDP to rise at a 2 percent pace in the second half of th is 
year as the economy rebounds from April’s tax hike .  In addition to the 
normalization of private consumption, second-half growth is supported by a 
substantial rise in public spending aimed at partially offsetting the effects of 
the tax increase.  Growth should slow to an average pace of 1 percent over the 
remainder of the forecast period, partly reflecting drag from another tax hike 
planned for October 2015.  Removing the effect of April’s tax hike, inflation 
has been running about 1¼ percent in recent months, and we see it edging up 
to 1½  percent by the end of the forecast period.  With growth slowing and 
inflation well below target, we continue to anticipate that the BOJ will step up 
the pace of asset purchases in early 2015. 
 Canada.  GDP growth rebounded more than we had expected in the second 
quarter, to 3.1 percent, after having been held to just 0.9 percent in the first 
quarter by severe winter weather and weak U.S. demand.  Recent data, 
includ ing exports in July and the manufacturing PMI in August, were also 
stronger than we had expected.  We now see GDP growth in the second half 
of this year at 2¾ percent, a touch above the July Tealbook projection.  
Thereafter, we forecast GDP growth to slow to a near-potential pace of 
2¼ percent by 2017 as monetary stimulus is gradually withdrawn.  July 
inflation data showed an easing of energy prices, supporting our forecast that 
headline inflation will slow to 1½ percent in the second half of this year, after 
which it should move up to average about 2 percent.  We still expect that the 
Bank of Canada will begin raising its target for the overnight interest rate in 
the third quarter of 2015. 
EMERGING M ARKET ECO NOMIES  
 China.  Recent data suggest that Chinese GDP growth has moderated a bit, as 
expec
ted, from 7¾ percent in the second quarter.  Although exports were

 surprisingly strong in July and August, other indicators for July, including 
industrial production, investment,  and retail sales, decelerated more th an 
expe
cted.  Responding to the somewhat weaker momentum in domestic 
demand,  we marked down growth a touch beyond the current quarter.  All 
told, we see GDP growth edging down to 7½ percent in the second half of the 
year and moderating further to just under 7 percent in 2017.  In our baseline 
forecast, the ongoing softening in property prices and credit growth serves to 
reduce financial imbalances and promote longer-term financial stability.  
However, there is some chance that these trends could intensify, leading to 
more severe financial stresses and a much sharper decline in real growth.  
Inflation was very low in the first half of the year, reflecting food and fuel 
price declines.  We expect inflation to pick up to 3½ percent in the current 
quarter as these declines are partly reversed, and then to settle at 3 percent 
over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Other Emerging Asia.   Real GDP growth in the rest of emerging Asia picked 
up to 3¼ percent in the second quarter from 2½ percent in the first, as exports 
generally rebounded from the first-quarter slump and, in some economies, 
domestic demand strengthened.  Notably, in Thailand, an abatement of 
political tensions led to a rebound in GDP after a sharp first-quarter 
contraction, and in India higher government spending supported vigorous 
growth.  In contrast, real GDP fell unexpectedly in Hong Kong, reflecting a 
shortfall in tourism from China and weakness in the construction sector.  
Growth also weakened in Korea as April’s  ferry disaster depressed consumer 
sentiment, prompting the government to unveil a fiscal stimulus package and 
the Bank of Korea to loosen monetary policy.  The overall tone of more recent 
indicators for the region, including exports, PMIs, and industrial production, 
has been positive; we expect growth to rise to 4 percent in the second half of 
the year and to average 4¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast.   
 Latin America.  After a prolonged period of weakness, Mexican  GDP surged 
4¼ percent in the second quarter, 1¼ percentage points faster than forecast in 
the July Tealbook.  The rebound of U.S. activity helped boost Mexican 
exports, the construction sector continued to recover, and the fiscal drag from 
the tax hikes in early 2014 appeared to wane.  We have GDP growth 
averaging a solid 3¾ percent over the forecast period, as U.S. manufacturing

 activity remains robust, the construction sector continues to recover, and 
structural reforms begin to pay off.  Inflation is projected to average a little 
above 3 percent. 
 Brazil ’s economy fell into recession in the first half of the year.  Real GDP 
contracted at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter, and first-
quarter growth was revised down into negative territory.  The second-quarter 
contraction was due primarily to a sharp drop in investment as uncertainty 
about the outcome of next month’s elections low ered confidence and 
exacerbated existing weakness in capital expenditures.  Based on recent 
increases in exports and industrial production, we expect growth to resume in 
the current quarter, but at only a ½ percent pace.  With the economy 
exhibiting weaker momentum than we previously assessed, we lowered the 
growth path going forward.  We estimate that inflation stepped down to 
6 percent in the current quarter as the World Cup pressures on service prices 
dissipated .  We expect inflation to remain high over the remainder of the 
forecast period, averaging 5¼ percent. 
 Other Emerging Market Economies.   The economies of Russia and Ukraine 
appear to be suffering as the result of the conflict in Ukraine.  In recent weeks, 
tensions escalated again:  Russia deployed military troops in eastern Ukraine, 
Western nations increased sanctions on Russia, and Russia retaliated by 
banning imports of some food products from the West.  Ukraine’s government 
signed a cease-fire agreement with the separatists on September 5, but there 
have been reports of sporadic fighting.  We expect the situation to remain 
volatile and the economies of Russia and Ukraine to remain weak over the 
next several quarters.  Late last month, the IMF approved the disbursement of 
$1.4 billion to Ukraine, the second tranche of the Stand-By Arrangement 
approved in April, but warned that the ongoing crisis poses risks for the 
program.

Financial Developments 
Domestic financial market reactions to incoming news on economic activity, 
monetary policy, and geopolitical events were each relatively small and mainly offsetting 
over the intermeeting period.  Broad measures of domestic equity prices edged up over 
the period, as market participants apparently interpreted incoming data on U.S. economic 
activity as, on balance, somewhat better th an expected.  Yields on nominal Treasury 
securities were also up a touch, likely boosted by Federal Reserve communications that 
were seen as pointing to slightly less accomm odation than had been expected.  However, 
disappointing news on economic activity in Euro pe and growing expectations for further 
monetary accommodation from the ECB appear  to have put some downward pressure on 
nominal Treasury yields.  The conflict in Uk raine and other geopolitic al tensions weighed 
on market sentiment at times but appeared to  have only small net effects over the period.  
 The S&P 500 index was up 1 percent ove r the period.  Corporate bond spreads 
were roughly unchanged, on net, as high- yield bonds recovered from a sharp 
selloff early in the intermeeting period.   
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities were up 1 to 7 basis points across the 
yield curve, and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation declined 
amid lower oil prices and lower-than- expected data on CPI inflation.   
 Yields on the sovereign debt of Eur opean economies continued to decline 
over the intermeeting period, as expect ations for euro-area growth and 
inflation fell and as market participan ts increased their expectations for 
monetary accommodation abroad.  The br oad index of the dollar appreciated 
about 1¾ percent over the period, with so lid gains against most currencies.   
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial bus inesses remained quite favorable.  
However, financing conditions for house holds were mixed:  Auto loans were 
widely available, standards and terms fo r credit card lending were tight but 
eased somewhat, and access to residential mortgages remained limited for all but those with excellent  credit histories.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
Yields on nominal Treasury securities e dged higher, on balance, over the period.  
Rates might have been expected to rise a fe w basis points, as the passage of time brought 
the expected date of the first increas e in the federal funds rate closer.1  U.S. economic 
data were, on balance, reportedly seen by Tr easury market participants as about in line 
with expectations.  Some market participants pointed to the declines in yields in other 
advanced economies, especially those in th e euro area, as having put some downward 
pressure on U.S. Treasury yi elds.  In addition, TIPS-base d measures of inflation 
compensation declined over the intermeeting period, particularly in the near term, 
reportedly reflecting the lower-t han-expected inflation readin gs from the July CPI data 
and a decline in oil prices.  Geopolitical ri sk, including the tensions  in Ukraine and the 
Middle East, also appeared to boost demand for Treasury securities and weigh on their 
yields at times, but the net effect appears to have been small.     
Federal Reserve communications were, on balance, interpreted as signaling 
slightly less accommodative monetary policy th an had been expected.  In particular, 
although the July FOMC statement was viewed as  generally in line wi th expectations, the 
July minutes were seen as modestly less acco mmodative.  Market part icipants reportedly 
focused especially on the indication that po licymakers generally agreed that the recent 
improvement in labor market conditions had been greater than  anticipated.  The 
discussion of normalization also garnered a ttention but reportedly did not materially 
affect market pricing.  The Chair’s sp eech at the Jackson Hole economic policy 
symposium was interpreted as consistent  with the message from the minutes. 
The path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market 
quotes was essentially unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period.2  However, half 
of the respondents to the September primary dealer survey pointed to the second quarter 
of 2015 as the most likely date for liftoff, with  the other half pointing to the third quarter 
or later, and the distribution of the modal timing of the first rate increase has shifted 
slightly toward earlier dates.  The median dealer’s projection for the longer-run level of 
                                                 
1 Treasury yields reflect both the expected aver age level of short-term policy rates inside the 
maturity “window” of the Treasury security and a term  premium.  As the expected date of policy liftoff 
approaches, the maturity window move s further into the period during which short-term rates are expected 
to rise.  This movement, by itself, puts upward pressure on Treasury yields.        
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.

  the federal funds rate is 3.5 percent, unchanged from the July survey, while the median 
expected spread between the ON RRP and IOER rates immediately following liftoff 
increased from 20 basis points in the July su rvey to 25 basis points in September, 
consistent with the normalization discussion in the July FOMC minutes. 
EQUITY PRICES AND BOND SPREADS  
Broad measures of domestic equity pri ces were up a bit over the intermeeting 
period, as equity market inve stors appeared to interpret the incoming economic data as 
providing more evidence that the economic recovery is ga ining traction.  Geopolitical 
tensions appeared to be a dr ag on stock prices at times, and market volatility moved up 
notably early in the period.  However, this increase was short lived, and measures of 
realized and implied equity price volatility were little cha nged, on net, over the period. 
The spreads between yields on corporat e bonds and those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities were a bout unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  
High-yield bond mutual funds experienced sharp outflows early in the period, and 
spreads on such bonds widened noticeably.  Howe ver, spreads subsequently reversed, and 
such bond funds have attracted modest inflows in  recent weeks.  Measures of liquidity in 
the corporate bond market remained stable in  the face of these substantial flows, and 
responses to the most recent Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing 
Terms indicated little change in corporate bond market functioning.  Dealers’ inventories of high-yield corporate bonds held fairly st eady amid the large swings in mutual fund 
flows early in the period, consistent with market reports that retail outflows were quickly 
met by purchases from institutional investors.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, market par ticipants shifted attention away from 
geopolitical risks toward weaker -than-expected data releases abroad as well as actual and 
prospective easing in the stance of  monetary policy in the euro area.  Sovereign yields in 
European economies declined, and euro-ar ea peripheral spreads na rrowed substantially 
on net.  Near- to medium-term inflation expect ations in the euro area, which have been 
trending down for some time, declined substa ntially in August.  The shift in monetary 
policy expectations supported equity prices, with broad foreign indexes generally ending 
the period somewhat higher, and contributed to  an appreciation in the broad index of the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar.

  ECB President Mario Draghi’s Jackson Hole remarks were read as more 
accommodative than expected, and the ECB subsequently announced a cut of 10 basis 
points in both its main refinancing rate, to 0.05 percent, and its de posit rate, to negative 
0.2 percent.  In addition, the ECB pledged to  begin purchasing asset-backed securities 
and covered bonds in October.  The euro depreciated more than 1 percent immediately following the ECB announcement.  Over the period, German 2-year government bond 
yields declined about 10 basis points to negative 7 basis points.  German yields are now 
negative out to maturities of 3 years.  M eanwhile, 10-year sovereign bond yields for the 
peripheral European economies moved to reco rd lows, and spreads on those securities 
continued to narrow. 
Following the release of the BOE’s Inflation Report, which highlighted the 
weakness of recent wage growth, near-ter m policy expectations moved lower.  
Government bond yields in the United Kingdo m also fell over the period.  In early 
September, the pound depreciated sharply against the dollar and implied pound–dollar 
volatility spiked after polls on the Scottis h independence referendum to be held on 
September 18 showed an increase in the probability of secession. 
The broad index of the dollar rose ab out 1¾ percent over the period.  Weaker-
than-expected foreign data, more accommodative monetary policy expectations in 
advanced foreign economies, and the Scottish referendum polls contributed to an increase of about 3 percent in the major currency inde x over the period.  In  addition to the large 
appreciations of the dollar ag ainst the euro and the pound, th e dollar rose substantially 
against the yen and strengthened against mo st other currencies, except the renminbi. 
In line with U.S. equities, foreign equity  prices declined early in the period in 
response to geopolitical news and ongoing concerns surrounding the failure and 
restructuring of Banco Espírito Santo in Port ugal.  However, most major foreign equity 
indexes have since retraced their losses a nd are up on net.  Flows into emerging market 
equity and bond funds remained positive over the period.

  rebounded strongly in the first w eek of September.  The leve l of nonfinancial commercial 
paper outstanding rose noticeably over the intermeeting period, while commercial and 
industrial (C&I) loans on banks ’ books continued to grow robustly.  Supervisory data 
suggest that the growth in C&I loans duri ng the second quarter was broad based across 
major industries, including strong growth in loans to core sectors su ch as manufacturing, 
trade, and transportation. 
Issuance of leveraged loans has remained robust in recent months.  Although 
demand for such loans by retail investor s—typically through mutual funds—has been 
slowly declining since the beginning of the y ear, CLO managers conti nue to be a strong 
source of demand for newly issued loans, a nd CLO issuance has stayed quite rapid.  
Standards and terms for leveraged loans have  reportedly stabilized but remain relatively 
loose.  
Despite favorable equity market valuations , gross equity issuance slowed in July 
and continued to be subdued in August, mo stly reflecting summer seasonal patterns.  
However, the number of pending IPOs is larg e, and venture capita l funding in the second 
quarter was at its highe st level since 2001.   
Credit conditions in the commercial real es tate (CRE) sector continued to ease.  
Underwriting standards on CMBS reportedl y eased further amid strong competition 
among lenders, and issuers reportedly ha ve been engaging in increased “rating 
shopping.”  The volume of CMBS issuance remained robust in July and August, and 
unusually strong origination volumes are expect ed over the next few months.  CRE loans 
on banks’ books continued to grow solidly in July and A ugust, and Call Report data 
indicate that the pace of c onstruction lending picked up in the second quarter.    
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Financing conditions for households were  mixed over the intermeeting period:  
Auto loans were widely available, standards and terms for credit card lending were tight 
but eased somewhat, and access to residentia l mortgages remained limited for all but 
those with excellent credit histories. 
Auto loans stayed widely available to  consumers, including to those with 
subprime credit records.  While the credit perf ormance of auto loans, on balance, has held 
up well in recent quarters, it has worsened so mewhat for lenders with more exposure to

  subprime borrowers.  Some of these lenders have  reportedly started to rein in lending to 
individuals with very po or credit histories.   
Standards and terms for credit card lending remained tight, on balance, in recent 
quarters but continued to ease somewhat.  Du ring the second quarter, the median credit 
score of newly opened revolving accounts edge d down further, and spreads of interest 
rates offered in credit card mailings over yields on Treasury securities, though still 
elevated, narrowed somewhat.  Partly reflecting such continuing improvements in 
financing conditions, credit card lending advanc ed further in July, leaving the outstanding 
balance of such loans at its highest level in four years, although it remains about 
14 percent below the peak level seen prior to  the financial crisis.  Delinquency rates on 
credit card debt stayed at  historically low levels. 
Measures of financing conditions for resi dential mortgages were little changed 
over the intermeeting period.  Although condition s remained tight, they have eased some 
over the past year.  Total mortgage balances  on household credit repor ts declined at an 
annual rate of about 3 percent in the sec ond quarter as new mortgage originations 
continued to be subdued; more timely indicato rs of purchase and refinance activity stayed 
at low levels through September 5.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 
little changed at about 4 percen t, approximately 50 basis point s below last fall’s highs.   
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
The stock prices of large U.S. bank hol ding companies (BHCs) changed little, on 
net, over the intermeeting period, while CDS sp reads for large BHCs edged down.  In the 
second quarter, the profitability of BHCs rema ined in line with levels seen over the 
previous two years but was still well below the levels that prevailed in the decade prior to 
the financial crisis.  Net interest margins ch anged little from the previous quarter, with 
compressed margins being driven by continued low interest rates as well as increased 
holdings of high-quality liquid assets, which ba nks are reportedly purchasing in part to 
meet Basel III liquidity requirements.  In part icular, holdings of U.S. Treasury securities 
at commercial banks that are subject to the standard liquidity cove rage ratio requirement 
have risen $100 billion thus far this year.  Through the second quarter (the latest data 
available), the bulk of the increase occurred in medium- and longer-term maturities.  
Loan performance at banks continued to impr ove in the second quarter, as delinquencies 
fell across most loan types.

  M2 expanded at a 5½ percent annual rate over July and August, in line with 
growth during the first half of the year.  The monetary base rose at an annual rate of 
about 20 percent over the intermeeting period, as the end of the most recent tests of the 
Term Deposit Facility led to a sh ift of funds from th e facility back into reserve balances.3 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Unsecured overnight funding markets were stable during the intermeeting period.  
Rates for triparty Treasury repo among counterparties that are eligible  to participate in 
the ON RRP exercise and rates for GCF Tr easury repo declined somewhat over the 
period but, for the most part, remained above the fixed rate offered in the ON RRP 
exercise.   
As a result of somewhat lower market  repo rates, ON RRP take-up, on average, 
was a little higher than in the prior intermeeting period.  Money market funds have 
continued to be major and stable participants  in the ON RRP exercise, with daily average 
usage of $122 billion as of September 9.  Total take-up was significantly higher on the 
last trading day of July and modestly higher on the last trading day of August than it had 
been in the days just prior to those dates.  Prime money funds, in particular, more than 
doubled their take-up on these month-e nds relative to adjacent days.  
In outright open market operations, the Federal Reserve purchased $20 billion in 
Treasury securities and committe d to purchase $41 billion in MBS over the period.  As of 
September 3, the Federal Reserve’s outright  holdings of Treasury securities topped 
$2.4 trillion, and its holdings of mortgage-backed securities were about $1.7 trillion. 
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury and MB S markets remained stable.  The ratio 
of the Open Market Desk’s MBS settlements to gross issuance of these securities further 
decreased in August to about 30 percent fr om a high of about 95 percent in March, 
reflecting a reduction in purchases  and an increase in gross issuance of MBS.  The dollar-
                                                 
3 As part of the continuing program of operational testing of policy tools, the Federal Reserve 
announced, on September 4, plans to conduct a series of eight consecutive seven-day term deposit 
operations through the Term Deposit Facility beginning in October.  The term deposits in these operations will include an early withdrawal feature, subject to a penalty.  Market participants noted that the early withdrawal feature will likely increase demand for term deposits because it will allow banks to count these balances as high-quality liquid assets in the calculation of their liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs).  The LCR 
requirement will be phased in starting early next year, but it has reportedly already begun to affect banks’ behavior.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the extent of uncertainty around our projections for real 
GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable 
volatility.  As always, a number of upside and downside risks attend our forecast for 
economic activity; importantly, however, we see neither monetary policy nor fiscal 
policy as being well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  
Consequently, we continue to believe that the risks to our forecast for real GDP growth 
are tilted a little to the downside.  By contrast, we continue to view the risks around our 
projection for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher 
unemployment rate from adverse demand-side developments largely countered by the 
possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to surprise us to the downside.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment.  The assessment delivered in July saw the 
vulnerability of the financial system to adverse shocks as moderate in general, albeit 
building slightly.  Overall, this assessment reflected the modest use of leverage in most 
parts of the financial sector, low- to-moderate levels of maturity and credit transformation 
in the financial sector, and the lack of acceleration in borrowing by the nonfinancial 
sector as a whole.  That said, the assessment also indicated that the risks to the financial 
system associated with an abrupt market shift had stepped up as a result of unusually 
subdued levels of actual and implied volatilities in a range of markets, the continued 
deterioration of underwriting standards for leveraged loans, and increased asset valuation 
pressures —especially for some fixed-income securities.   
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Measures of long-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable in recent years despit e fluctuations in the 
prices of crude oil, other commodities, and imports more generally, and also despite the 
deep recession and subsequent slack in labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we view 
the risks to our inflation forecast as balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility 
that the lengthy run of inflation below the Committee’s 2  percent objective could prove 
more deeply ingrained and more difficult to correct than we expect, especially if long-

 term inflation expectations move down or if low levels of resource utilization persist 
longer or have larger effects than we currently project.  On the upside, an increase in 
inflation expectations —potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and the ability to  execute a timely exit from the current stance of 
policy —could cause inflation to rise.  Inflation could also move up as a result of 
significant unanticipated increases in the prices of oil and other commodities caused by 
overseas developments, a stronger-than-expected economic recovery, or a larger amount 
of damage to the supply side of the economy than is assumed in the baseline. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first two 
scenarios, the economy is hit by temporary supply shocks that boost inflation.  In the first 
variant, long-term inflation expectations remain on their baseline path; in the second, 
long-term inflation expectations become unanchored and move up, leading to a much 
more persistent increase in inflation.  In the third scenario, slack in labor markets is much 
greater than we have assumed in the baseline, reflecting a stronger trend in labor force 
participation.  The fourth scenario features a deeper and more protracted reduction in 
potential output growth than assumed in the baseline.  In the f ifth scenario, weaker-than-
expected growth in the euro area and very low core inflation prompt the ECB to 
markedly expand its program of asset purchases.  The final scenario assumes that 
geopolitical tensions intensify further, causing oil prices to rise, global financial 
conditions to deteriorate, and household and business confidence to weaken. 
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its 
effective lower bound, its movements are governed —as in the baseline forecast —by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using 
a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in 
the Committee’s recent statements.1  In all cases, we assume that the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
                                                 
1 Specifically, in the first four scenarios, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in the quarter 
following the observation of an unemployment rate below 5.8 percent, the level of unemployment 
prevailing in the baseline one quarter prior to liftoff.  For the last two scenarios, we assume a broadly

 Higher Inflation with Anchored Inflation Expectations  
This scenario and the next compare the effects of a shock to inflation under 
alternative assumptions about inflation expectations.2  In this scenario, long-term 
inflation expectations evolve according to the staff ’s baseline assumption,  whereas in the 
next, they become unanchored and respond to the realizations of higher inflation.3   
In both scenarios, transitory price and wage shocks raise core inflation to  
3¼ percent by the end of next year.  Assuming that long-term inflation expectations 
follow the baseline, as we do in this first scenario, then once the temporary price and 
wage shocks fade, core inflation declines quickly and by 2017  runs slightly below  
2 percent.  The federal funds rate lifts off in the same quarter as in the baseline, and with 
inflation substantially higher, reach es 3 percent by  the end of 201 6, ¾ percentage point 
above the baseline.  The tighter policy restrains real activity somewhat, and by 2017, the 
unemployment rate is about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline projection.   
Higher Inflation with Unanchored Inflation Expectations 
In this scenario, we apply the same wage and price shocks as in the previous one, 
but we allow long-term inflation expectations to become unanchored.  In particular, long-
term inflation expectations are assumed to be adaptive.  Accordingly, in response to the 
shocks that boost wages and prices in the near term, long-term inflation expectations drift 
up.  As in the previous scenario, the federal funds rate lifts off in the same quarter as in 
the baseline.  Under the assumed inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, the federal 
funds rate remains about ½ percentage point above its baseline path late in the decade.  
This response of the federal funds rate, however, raises the unemployment rate only 
marginally compared with the previous scenario, which is not sufficiently aggressive to 
make much progress in returning inflation to the Committee’s objective  over this horizon, 
with actual inflation remaining elevated through 2019.  At that time, the policy rule 
                                                 
similar policy rule to the one used in the first four scenarios.  One key difference relative to the FRB/US 
simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual 
output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment 
of wages and prices. 
2 In the baseline, long-term inflation expectations are assumed to be 1.8 percent through 2017 .  In 
2018, they begin to gradually move up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
3 The memorandum to the FOMC dated September 5, 2014, by Thomas Laubach, John Roberts, 
Jae Sim, and Brad Strum explores the economic consequences of alternative paths for long-term inflation 
expectations.  The simulations in this scenario (anchored inflation expectations) and the next (unanchored 
inflation expectations) start with long-term inflation expectations at 1.8 percent, and differ from the 
simulations in the memo in that we introduce price and wage shocks.  The adaptive expectations 
mechanism adopted in the next scenario is the same as the one used in the memo.

 balances an inflation rate running ½ percentage point above target against an 
unemployment rate that is ¼ percentage point above its natural rate. 
Higher Trend Labor  Force Participation Rate  
The staff baseline assumes that most of the 3 percentage point decline in the labor 
force participation rate since the beginning of the Great Recession reflects structural 
factors, and attributes only about ½ percentage point of the decline to cyclical factors.  It 
is possible, however, that some of the changes that the staff associates with structural 
factors —such as the increase in retirements and school enrollment —may in part be 
related to the recession and subsequent sluggish recovery and may reverse in a strong 
labor market.  Reflecting the wide range of estimates on the cyclical shortfall in the labor 
force participation rate, this scenario assumes that structural factors have been less 
important in accounting for the decline in the labor force participation rate.4  In particular, 
we assume the current level of the labor force participation rate is about 1½ percentage 
points below its trend level, compared with ½ percentage point in the baseline, implying 
more slack in labor and product markets.  
In this reinterpretation of aggregate supply conditions, the unemployment rate 
overstates the overall improvement in the labor market to a much greater extent than in 
the baseline.  As  the labor force participation rate rises toward its higher trend level, the 
unemployment rate moves about ½ percentage point above baseline by 2016.  The 
unemployment rate remains above the assumed threshold for liftoff of the federal funds 
rate for an additional five quarters.  The extended period of monetary policy 
accommodation boosts spending, and real GDP rises 3½ percent in 2016 and 3 percent in 
2017.  By mid-2018, this stronger growth is sufficient to pull the unemployment rate 
slightly below baseline.  Competing forces pull inflation in different directions:  While 
the initially higher unemployment rate tends to hold down inflation, the high degree of 
monetary policy accommodation boosts short-term inflation expectations in the FRB/US 
model.  On net, inflation is a little above the baseline, with core inflation at 1¾ percent in 
2016 and almost 2 percent in 2017. 
                                                 
4 While the path for the labor force participation rate assumed in the baseline is well supported by 
the analysis presented in the 2014 FEDS paper by Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick,  
Felix Galbis- Reig, Christopher L. Smith, and William Wascher, “Labor Force Participation:  Recent 
Developments and Future Prospects” ( www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201464/201464abs.html), 
that paper and the references therein also point to a wide range of estimates of the labor force  
participation gap.

 No Room to Grow 
Some of the models we consult suggest that potential output may be lower than is 
assumed in the base
line projection and may grow more slowly in the future.  In this 
scenario, we assume
 that structural productivity gains in recent years have been slower 
than the staff currently estimates and continue to be so over the projection period, and 
that the natural rate of unemployment has been constant at 6¼ percent since early 2011 
and will remain at that le
vel in the future.  With these assumptions, potential output has 
expanded at an annual rate of only 1 percent since 2011; looking ahead, it rises at only a 
1¼ percent pace through 2019.  As a consequence of th is revision to potential output, the 
output gap is estimated to be closed by the current quarter.  
Compared with the baseline, real GDP growth is substantially slower as 
households and firms base their
 spending on lower levels and rates of growth of 
permanent income and potential output.  Inflation is higher than in the baseline, reflecting 
the effects of both tighter resource utilization and smaller productivity gains, which 
contribute to greater cost pressures.  The unemployment rate begins to move up by  
early 2017 but still has not risen to the higher assumed natural rate of 6¼ percent by the 
end of 2019.  Infla
tion is about 2¼ percent in that year.  Given enough time, the Taylor 
rule governing the sett
ing of the federal funds rate would eventually drive the 
unemployment rate above its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to  
2 percent.  
Weaker Grow
th in the Euro Area 
Although our baseline forecast projects a noticeable pickup in euro-area GDP 
growth relative to its languid pace in the first half of this year, the euro-area economy 
faces substantial downside risks.  This scenario assumes that some of these downside 
risks materialize —with euro-area core inflation drifting lower, confidence weakening, 
and financial conditions tig
htening modestly —and that these developments in turn 
prompt the ECB to implement large-scale purchases of euro-area sovereign bonds.   
These asset purchases are assumed to begin later this year and eventually cumulate to  
€1 trillion.  Notwithstanding this aggressive monetary easing and a 5 percent depreciation

 of the euro against the dollar, real GDP in the euro area still falls about 2 percent below 
baseline by the end of 2016.5 
The weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar in turn cause U.S. real net 
exports to fall relative to the baseline.  Nevertheless, given that financial spillovers to 
economies outside of Europe are quite limited in this scenario, the overall impact on the 
U.S. economy is modest.6  All told, U.S. real GDP expands roughly 2¼ percent in 2015, 
½ percentage point less than in the baseline.  With a higher unemployment rate, the 
federal funds rate lifts off one quarter later than in the baseline.     
Escalating Geopolitical Tensions 
Tensions between Russia and Ukraine thus far have left only a small imprint on 
global markets.   In this scenario, we consider a major and sustained escalation in 
tensions —involving the imposition of additional sanctions on Russia by the West and 
Russian counter actions —which severely affect global energy markets and also have 
sizable spillovers to global financial markets and confidence.  We assume that this crisis 
persists for about a year before gradually easing.   
These developments affect the global economy through a number of channels.  
First, this scenario assumes a deep curtailment of Russian oil exports, causing global oil 
prices to jump more than $40 per barrel and to remain high for the next year.  Second, 
Russia cuts off natural gas exports to Europe.  Finally, consumer and investor confidence 
fall and financial market conditions deteriorate noticeably, with corporate and household 
borrowing spreads rising and flight- to-safety flows boosting the dollar.  In response, real 
GDP in the advanced foreign economies falls about 2½ percent relative to the baseline by 
the end of next year, with Europe suffering disproportionately because of its closer 
financial and economic ties to Russia.  Real GDP in the emerging market economies falls 
about 3½ percent relative to the baseline by the end of next year as declining capital 
inflows contribute to a marked tightening of financial conditions. 
                                                 
5 The specification of the ECB large-scale asset purchase program is similar to the one discussed 
in the June 2014 Tealbook IEDO box titled “ECB Policy Actions and Options .”  In our current scenario, 
the ECB asset purchases attenuate the fall in euro-area GDP by about 1½ percent by the end of 2016 and 
increases core inflation by about ¼ percentage point.    
6 Considered in isolation, the large-scale asset purchases by the ECB are estimated to have a small 
positive effect on U.S. GDP, since the effects of stronger economic activity in the euro area on U.S. real net 
exports slightly outweigh the contractionary effects of dollar appreciation.

 U.S. real activity is depressed as higher oil prices reduce disposable income and 
the return to investment.  Real net exports decline markedly in response to weaker 
foreign activity and an appreciation of the broad real dollar.  These adverse effects are 
reinforced by a rise in corporate borrowing costs and a decline in confidence.  All told, 
U.S. real GDP growth is less than 1½ percent in 2015, and the unemployment rate 
remains above 5¾ percent through mid-2016.  Core inflation falls little relative to the 
baseline, a
s the upward impetus from higher oil prices is offset by weaker activity and a 
stronger dollar.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective 
lower bound until late 2016

    1. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus and the Postal Service surplus are excluded from the on-budget 
surplus and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law.
    2. Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.    3. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.
    4. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  FI is the weighted difference of discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (2009) dollars, scaled by real GDP.  The FI estimates are calendar year contributions to Q4/Q4 real GDP growth.  Also, for FI and the change in HEB, positive values indicate aggregate demand stimulus. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and FI are not at annual rates.
