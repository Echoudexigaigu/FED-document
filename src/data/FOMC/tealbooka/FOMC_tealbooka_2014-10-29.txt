Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The recent deterioration in overall financial market conditions has led us to 
downgrade our medium-term projection; however, the incoming information on 
economic activity to date has generally been close to our expectations in the September 
Tealbook.  In the labor market, payroll employment rose a bit more in September than we 
had anticipated, and the unemployment rate once again surprised us to the downside.  W e 
have responded by slightly raising our outlook for payroll gains and marking down our 
unemployment rate projection over the near term. On the spending side, the data on 
business fixed investment and consumer spending came in about as we had anticipated, 
on net, but the recent news from the housing sector has been somewhat disappointing.  
We now project that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent in the second 
half of the year, little changed from the September Tealbook. 
Amid growing concerns over global economic growth prospects and geopolitical 
issues, we have seen an appreciable rise in the exchange value of the dollar and a 
noticeable decline in the stock market since the time of the September Tealbook.  Given the implications of these developments for resource utilization and inflation, the 
monetary policy rule that we use for our forecast now calls for a lower path for the 
federal funds rate after its liftoff from the effective lower bound.  Even with that assumed 
offset from monetary policy, our key conditioning assumptions are notably weaker, on 
balance, than in the September Tealbook, and we have ther efore marked down our 
forecast for GDP growth over the medium term.  In particular, our current forecast 
anticipates that real GDP will rise 2.4 pe rcent in 2015, 2.6 pe rcent in 2016, a nd 
2.1 percent in 2017 ¼ percentage point lower in each year than in the previous 
Tealbook.  
Although the unemployment rate starts the projection slightly lower than expected 
in the September Tealbook, it also declines by less over the medium term because of the weaker pace of output growth.  All told, the unemployment rate is anticipated to average 
5.2 percent in 2017, 0.3 percentage point higher than in our previous projection and equal to our estimate of its natural rate. 
We have lowered our forecast for consumer price inflation in the current quarter 
and early next year largely in response to the continued slide in oil prices.  Although our

medium-term path for core PCE price inflation is a touch lower than in the previous 
Tealbook, we continue to expect core consumer inflation to step up gradually over the 
projection period as resource slack diminishes, rising from 1.5 percent this year to 
1.8 percent in 2017.  With consumer energy prices anticipated to edge higher over the 
medium term, headline inflation is projected to run close to core inflation. 
As always, numerous risks attend our outlook.  As has been the case for some 
time, we view the uncertainty around our projection for real GDP growth, inflation, and 
the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average of the past 20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility.  We see the risks to both our GDP and inflation 
projections as being tilted to the downside, reflecting the recent financial turbulence and 
heightened concerns over foreign economic growth as well as our assessment that neither 
monetary policy nor fiscal policy appear well positioned to offset substantial adverse 
shocks to the economy.  We continue to see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balan ced, as the downside risks to real activity are about 
offset by the possibility that the unemployment rate could continue to decline more rapidly than we expect.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 Our assumptions for the current LSAP program are unchanged.  We assume 
that asset purc hases will conclude this month. 
 We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  We still construe the 
two-quarter lag from the assumed end in asset purchases to the liftoff of the 
federal funds rate to be consistent with the “considerable time” language in 
the Committee’s recent statement s. 
 Following liftoff, the federal funds rate rises at a pace determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.  
Reflecting the weaker medium-term outlook in this Tealbook, the federal

Uncertainty section presents FRB/US-generated confidence intervals in graphical form around the baseline 
forecast.

funds rate rises to 2.6 percent by the end of 2017, about 55 basis points lower 
than was projected in the September Tealbook. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The yield on 10-year Treasury securities has declined about 30 basis points 
since the time of the September Tealbook.  Our medium-term trajecto ry for 
the Treasury yield has been revised down about 45 basis points, on average, 
mainly reflecting the lower long-run path of the federal funds rate in this 
projection.  Our forecast continues to call for a significant rise in Treasury 
yields over the next three years as the 10-year valuation window moves 
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and the effects of 
the FOMC’s balance sheet policies gradually wane. 
 Our medium-term forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates have 
been re vised essentially in line with our revisions to the path for the Treasury 
yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Since the September Tealbook, e quity prices have declined about 3 percent, 
whereas we had projected a small increase.  We expect this downward 
surprise to be partially retraced, and thus our revised projection has stock 
prices rising over the medium term at a slightly faster average annual pace 
than in the September Tealbook.  (The staff baseline proje ction is predicated 
on the view that equity valuations are roughly in line with historical norms, 
based on levels of price- to-earnings ratios.  For a different perspective, see the 
box “Alternative View:  The U.S. Stock Market Is Overvalued. ”) 
 The latest readings on house prices have been well aligned with our 
September Tealbook forecast.  Thus, we have maintained our projection that 
house price appreciation will continue to slow from nearly 12 pe rcent last 
year to around 5 pe rcent this year and then to an average of about 3 percent 
per year over the medium term. 
Fiscal Policy 
 Our assumptions for fiscal policy are unchanged from the September 
Tealbook.  We estimate that fiscal policy actions at all levels of government

will be a neutral influence on real GDP growth in the second half of this year 
and in 2015 and will boost growth by ¼ percentage point in both 2016 
and 2017. 
Foreign Economic Activity and t he Dollar 
 After increasing at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of this year, 
foreign real GDP is projected to rise 2¾ percent in the second half and to 
increase about 3 percent per year over the medium term.  This forecast is 
revised down a bit, especially in the near term, as recent data on foreign 
economic activity have generally been weaker than expected.  Moreover, our 
concerns about downside risks have increased, especially for the euro area and 
China. 
 The broad nominal index for the dollar has appreciated about 1¾ percent since 
the previous Tealbook. (See the box “The Recent Appreciation of the Dollar” 
in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  Looking 
ahead, we expect the dollar to depreciate about ¾ percent annually in real 
terms, as some further appreciation against the currencies of the advanced 
foreign economies is more than offset by depreciation against the currencies 
of the emerging market economies. This pace of depreciation is a bit slower 
than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting changes in how we forecast 
emerging market currencies.2 All told, given the recent appreciation of the 
dollar and the upward shift in the tilt of our forecast, we expect the broad real dollar to be nearly 2½ percent higher at the end of 2017 relative to the previous Tealbook. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 Continuing a decline that began in June, the spot price of Brent crude oil has 
fallen $13 per barrel since the time of the September Tealbook, reaching 
$86 pe r barrel on October 21, near a four-year low.  The decline reflects a 
combination of strong global oil production, signs of softer global oil demand, 
and the recent appreciation of the dollar.  Concerns about the longer-term prospects for global oil production amid geopolitical turmoil have led farther-
dated futures prices to fall by less than spot prices.  As a result, w e now

In contrast to the staff’s baseline assumption for the path of equity prices, this discussion 
presents the view that the U.S. stock market is substantially overvalued.1 The staff view 
is based on the historically moderate level of the ratio of current prices to 12month
forward earnings (even before the recent selloff), but other indicators, such as the price
tosales ratio, suggest that U.S. stock valuations are stretched. In particular, for equity 
markets to revert to their post1990 average price tosales ratio, aggregate share prices 
would need to decline about 20 percent. 
I measure the price tosales ratio for the U.S. nonfinancial sector as the total market 
capitalization  of the 1,000 largest nonfinancial firms in the United States divided by the 
total revenue of these firms. As shown by the black curve in the figure on the left, over 
the past 50 years, the current level of the price tosales ratio has been surpassed only by 
its temporarily lofty level in the late 1990s. A similar picture emerges from the ratio of 
the market capitalization of U.S. stocks to GDP (not shown). In contrast, the price to
earnings ratio, the dotted red curve, is currently near the 70th percentile of its 
distribution. 
The table on the right shows regression models of the three year ahead stock market 
return. The adjusted Rsquare (which measures the fit of the regression) is higher in the 
model that uses the price tosales ratio (column 1) than in the one that uses the price to
earnings ratio (column 2). In the model that uses both (column 3), the effect of the price
toearnings ratio is not statistically significant. Given the current level of the price to
sales ratio, column 1 suggests that over the next three years, the market return is likely to 
be about 20 percent lower than average.2 
1 Prepared by Nitish Ranjan Sinha. 
2 The price tosales ratio in September was 1.6, 0.4 higher than the post 1990 average level of 1.2. 
Multiplying the difference of 0.4 by the coefficient of 0.56 provides the estimate of a 22.4 percent lower 
return over the next three years.

The equation above decomposes the price tosales ratio into two potentially mean
reverting factors. The first is the ratio of current market value to 12month forward 
corporate earnings, while the second is the ratio of 12month forward corporate earnings 
to current sales—that is, future profit margins. Currently, price toearnings ratios are 
moderately higher than average, but profit margins are near historical highs. 
As the economic recovery advances further and unemployment continues to decline, it is 
possible that wage growth will pick up enough to cause labor’s share of output to rise. 
As a result, profit margins could move down toward historical averages and, in the 
process, disappoint equity investors. 
The macroeconomic implications of a potential market “correction” that brings the price
tosales ratio back near its historical average level are nontrivial. As noted earlier, in a 
scenario where stock prices revert quickly to a price tosales ratio of 1.2—in line with the 
post 1990 average though still somewhat above the long run avera ge—stock prices 
would decrease about 20 percent. Using a rule of thumb from the FRB/US model, such a 
decline in equity prices would, over the next few years, lead to a 1 percent reduction in 
the level of real GDP and about a ½ percentage point increase in the unemployment rate 
relative to the baseline projection. price

project that the price of imported oil will decrease from $100 per barrel in 
August (the most recent available data) to about $79 per barrel by the end of 
this year, as declines in spot prices feed through, and be little changed 
thereafter.  The downward revision to the forecast is about $13 per barrel in the near term but tapers to about $9 pe r barrel by the end of 2017. 
 Nonfuel commodity prices have fallen significantly since the time of the 
September Tealbook.  Metals prices declined about 5 pe rcent, reflecting both 
the recent appreciation of the dollar and concerns about slowing growth in 
China.  Meanwhile, good harvests led to continued declines in corn and 
soybean prices.  Over the forecast period, we project nonfuel commodity 
prices to remain about flat, in line with prices from futures markets. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The incoming data on spending and production appear consistent with our view 
that real GDP growth in the second half of the year will substantially exceed the tepid 
average pace o f economic growth in the first half (which we continue to view as 
anomalously low).  We now project real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in 
the third quarter and 3 percent in the fourth a contour that is little changed from our 
projection in the September Tealbook. 
 On the whole, the recent data for consumer spending have been in line with 
our expectations, and w e still estimate that real PCE rose at a modest annual 
rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, in part because unusually cool summer 
weather held down demand for energy services.3 In the current quarter we 
continue to anticipate that consumer spending wil l increase at a more robust 
3½ pe rcent pace, as the weather returns to seasonal norms, and spending is 
supported by improvements in the job market , households’ real disposable 
incomes, and consumer sentiment.4 
3 The BEA now estimates that real PCE increased at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second 
quarter, close to our September Tealbook projection but lower than our projection at the time of the 
September FOMC meeting. As we expected, the BEA’s estimate included an upward revision to spending 
for medical services that we had incorporated into our forecast for the FOMC meeting after the September 
Tealbook had closed. However, the BEA’s estimate also included an offsetting downward revision in 
spending for other services that we had not anticipated. 
4 Excluding energy services, real PCE growth is projected to be 2¼ percent in the third quarter and 
3 percent in the fourth quarter.

 The incoming information on housing-sector activity has generally been softer 
than we had anticipated. Most notably, single-family building permits held 
steady in August and September, whereas we had expected a noticeable 
increase. We now expect real residential investment to rise at an annual rate 
of 6¾ pe rcent in the second half of the year, noticeably slower than our 
projection of a 11 percent increase in the September Tealbook.  (The box 
“Recent Changes in Income and Wealth across the Income Distri bution” 
includes a discussion of home and auto purchases by households in different 
parts of the income distribution.) 
 We continue to expect real spending on equipment and intangibles to post a 
moderate gain in the second half of the year, supported by generally upbeat 
business sentiment readings and consistent with ongoing improvements in 
expectations for earnings of capital goods producers.  Our projection calls for 
business investment in nonresidential structures (outside of the drilling and 
mining sector ) to move sideways over the second half of the year a s vacancy 
rates remain elevated and financing for new construction has eased only a 
little. Overall, our near-term projection for business fixed investment is 
essentially unrevised from the previous Tealbook. 
 The data on inventory investment in the third quarter have been weaker than 
expected, a nd we anticipate that this surprise will only partially unwind in the 
fourth quarter.  Accordingly, we now forecast that the change in business 
inventory investment will be a small drag on real GDP growth in the second 
half of the year, compared with it having a neutral effect in the September 
Tealbook projection.   
 We expect net exports to contribute ¼ percentage point (annual rate) to real 
GDP growth in the second half of the year, slightly more than in the 
September Tealbook on account of stronger-than-expected exports in the August trade data.  Real exports are estimated to have risen 5½ percent in the 
third quarter, a bit faster than might be expected given the sluggish pace of foreign economic growth and lagged effects of previous dollar appreciation.  
Export growth is expected to slow to a 3 percent pace in the fourth quarter. 
Real imports are a lso projected to slow, from an unusually rapid pace in the

Recent Changes in Income and Wealth across the Income Distribution 
The distribution of income and wealth of U.S. households has become more unequal in recent 
decades.1 This discussion uses data from the recently completed 2013 Survey of Consumer 
Finances (SCF) to highlight changes in income and wealth across the income distribution and 
points to some ways that households have responded to these changes since the Great 
Recession. 
Over much of the past two decades, real income and wealth rose for families in the bottom and 
middle of the income distribution.2 The blue lines in figure 1 show that, between 1995 and 2007, 
families in the bottom half of the income distribution saw their inflat ion-adjusted income rise 
20 percent and their wealth rise 40 percent.3 Families in the next 45 percent of the income 
distribution (percentiles 51 to 95) experienced similar rates of income growth, but their wealth 
gains were twice as large as those for families in the bottom half of the distribution. Families in 
the top 5 percent experienced significantly larger increases in both income and wealth. 
The Great Recession resulted in declines in income and wealth for all three income groups from 
2007 to 2010; the steepest loss of income was for families at the top of the distribution.  As the 
economic recovery took hold from 2010 to 2013, income and wealth started to rise for families 
in the top 5 percent and in the next 45 percent of the distribution, although average levels for 
both groups remained well below pre-recession peaks.  For families in the bottom half of the 
distribution, both income and w ealth declined further from 2010 to 2013.

Jeffrey Thompson, and Richard A. Windle (2014), “Changes in U.S. Family Finances From 2010 to 2013:  
Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 100 (September), pp. 141, 
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/pdf/scf14.pdf. 
2 Wealth is defined as family net worth in th e SCF. 
3 Figure 1A shows changes in actual income for families sorted into “usual” income groups.  The SCF 
directly asks for the “usual” income in a “normal” year, which is less affected by transitory fluctuations than 
actual income.  Income is for the calendar year preceding the survey; thus, in th e 2013 SCF, respondents 
reported 2012 an nual income.

The changes in wealth across the income distribution importantly reflect the housing market 
bust. Families at all income levels lost home equity between 2007 and 2013, and the rate of 
homeownership declined among families in the bottom 95 percent of the distribution.4 
The SCF also contains other information on households, such as home purchases and new-car 
buying, which reflect how families have responded to the income and wealth changes 
observed in the SCF through 2013 .  
Amid a heavy volume of foreclosures and depressed levels of home equity, fewer families 
were buying houses from 2007 to 2010 .  Indeed, the share of families in their current owner-
occupied residence for two years or less fell sharply across the income distribution (figure 2). 
Between 2010 and 2013, the rate of homebuying fell further for families in the bottom half of 
the distribution, stabilized for the next 45 percent, and rebounded for the highest-income 
families. By 2013, the likelihood of being in a recently purchased home had returned to pre-
recession levels for families in the t op 5 percent of the income distribution, but it remained 
well below pre-recession levels for the rest of the distribution. 
The effects of the changes in real incomes and wealth across the income distribution are also 
evident in car buying behavior. In the SCF, new-car buying peaked in 2004, and it declined 
across the income distribution between 2007 and 2010 (figure 3).  As the economic recovery 
took hold, purchases of new cars rose for all income groups from 2010 to 2013, in contrast 
with the narrower recovery in home purchases.  However, the rate of new-car purchases in 
2013 remained below pre-crisis levels across the distribution. 
4 Adjusting house values in th e SCF based on local price changes between th e survey month in 2013 and 
June 2014 suggests that home equity has increased since 2013, particularly for families in th e bottom 
95 percent of the distribution. Nevertheless, after ad justing house values in th e SCF, home equity for all 
groups is estimated to remain well below 2007 levels.

first half to 2 percent in the second, despite suppo rt from the higher value of 
the dollar.  
 Manufacturing production rose at a solid pace in September, but monthly 
gains have been choppy recently, partly reflecting swings in motor vehicle 
assemblies.  For the third quarter as a whole, manufacturing output rose at a 
moderate annual rate of 3½ percent, a little less than its average increase in the 
first half of the year.  In the current quarter, we expect factory output to 
expand 3 percent, little changed from our previous projection and in line 
with recent readings on new orders from the national and regional 
manufacturing surveys.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Beyond the near term, our forecast for output growth is lower than in the 
September Tealbook.  We now expect real GDP growth to be 2.4 pe rcent in 2015 and 
2.6 percent in 2016 and then to ease to 2.1 percent in 2017 as monetary policy 
accommodation continues to be withdrawn.  The projected level of real GDP at the end 
of 2017 is ¾ percent lower than in our previous forecast. 
 The downward revision to our medium-term outlook for GDP growth reflects 
the higher path for the do llar and lower trajectory for equity prices, as well as 
our weaker outlook for foreign economic growth. (For a discussion of how 
shifts in the exchange rate influence the domestic economy, see the box “The 
Effect of the Dollar on U.S. GDP and Inflation. ”)  However, with lower 
projected output growth and inflation, the policy rule that we use for our 
forecast now calls for a lower path for the federal funds rate over the medium 
term, which partially offsets these forces.  The decline in current and future 
crude oil prices since the September Tealbook provides a small additional 
offsetting boost to GDP growth.  
 We anticipate that output  growth over the next two years will exceed its 
potential rate, supported by accommodative monetary policy and a lifting 
of the restraint from the changes in fiscal policy seen over the past few 
years. These developments are expected to bolster consumer and business 
confidence, which, in turn, should provide additional support to spending growth.

 We have made no material changes to our supply-side assumptions in this 
projection.  Accordingly, the revisions we made to the GDP forecast carry 
through to the GDP gap. We now expect real GDP to be at its potential level 
in 2017, rather than being ¾ percent above potential in the September 
Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The recent data generally suggest that conditions in the labor market are a bit 
stronger than we expected in the September Tealbook.  
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 248,000 in September, about 25,000 more than we had projected.  This reading, combined with upward revisions to July and 
August, put the level of total payrolls about 90,000 higher in September than we had anticipated in the previous Tealbook.  We have reacted by pushing up 
our forecast for payroll gains in the fourth quarter to 225,000 pe r month, 
10,000 more than in the September Tealbook. 
 The unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point in September, to 5.9 percent; 
we had expected it to hold steady at 6.1 percent.  In response, we lowered our 
fourth-quarter unemployment rate projection 0.1 percentage point, to 
5.8 pe rcent.  Similarly, we adjusted our pa rticipation rate projection down a 
bit in response to an unexpected 0.1 pe rcentage point decline last month.  
 The staff’s labor market conditions index , which summarizes the movements 
in 19 labor market indicators, increased a bit more in September than in August, but the pace of improvement over the third quarter as a whole was 
somewhat more subdued than in the second quarter. 
We continue to expect gradual improvement in the labor market over the medium 
term.  The pace of this improvement, though, is slower than in the September Tealbook because of our weaker projection for GDP growth. 
 We now expect monthly job gains to average about 160,000 in 2015 and 
175,000 in 2016 and then slow to around 130,000 in 2017.  On average, these 
gains are 20,000 less per month than in the September Tealbook.

The Effect of the Dollar on U.S. GDP and Inflation 
The dollar has appreciated sharply since the middle of the year, with the broad dollar index 
increasing 4 percent from the beginning of July through October 21, provoking heightened 
interest in the effect of dollar movements on the U.S. economy.  In this discussion, we review our 
rules of thumb for translating changes in the dollar into effects on U.S. GDP and inflation.1 
One important consideration in analyzing the effects of a change in the dollar on th e domestic 
economy is the source of that change.  A rise in the dollar elicited by strengthening U.S. demand, 
for example, would be associated with higher U.S. GDP and higher interest rates.  Conversely, a rise in the dollar triggered by gloomier prospects abroad would be associated with more adverse effects on the economy.  For the purposes of this exercise, we assume the dollar’s initial 
movement is triggered by an exogenous dollar-specific shock. 
Another important consideration in deriving our rules of thumb is our assessment of how monetary policy reacts to dollar shocks.  To illuminate this issue, we first present estimates based on the staff’s  trade equations under the assumption that monetary policy is held constant.  We 
then use the staff’s general -equilibrium SIGMA model to consider the economic effects of a shock 
to the dollar when monetary policy is allowed to respond endogenously to those effects. 
When monetary policy is held constant, the effect of the dollar on U.S. GDP through trade channels is quite large.  As shown in table 1 on the next page, a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar lowers real exports (line 1 in the table) and increases real imports (line 2), on net pushing down the level of U.S. real GDP by almost 2 percent after three years (line 3).  Applying a 
Keynesian expenditure multiplier to this aggregate demand change, as is done in the judgmental 
staff projection, increases the negative drag on GDP to 2¾ percent after three years (line 4).  The 
higher dollar also lowers core import price inflation (line 5) ; core consumer price inflation in the 
U.S. is lower as well (line 6), reflecting both the decline in core import prices and the greater 
amount of slack that results from weaker domestic activity. These inflation effects are rather 
small, however, reflecting both the limited pass-through of exchange rates to import prices and 
the relatively small share of imports in U.S. consumption. 
In reality, a shock to the dollar that leads to reduced economic activity and lower inflation woul d 
likely elicit an easing of monetary policy in response.  Pinning down the exact extent of that 
easing and assessing its effects on the economy is challenging.  As one way to gauge the effect of 
a dollar shock on the U.S. economy when monetary policy is allowed to respond, we used the 
staff’s general-equilibrium SIGMA model.  SIGMA includes an explicit monetary policy rule as well 
as mechanisms linking monetary policy actions back to U.S. GDP and prices.
2 As shown in table 2, 
also on the next page, a 10 percent dollar appreciation in SIGMA lowers real GDP (line 3) by 
considerably less than the amount shown in table 1, as SIGMA embodies a fairly aggressive 
1 This discussion summarizes material from the October 22, 2014, memorandum to the FOMC “The Effect of 
the Dollar on U.S. GDP and Inflation,” by Christopher J. Erceg and Joseph W. Gruber. 
2 In SIGMA, monetary policy follows the inertial version of a Taylor (1999) rule that is similar, but not identical, 
to the rule used in the judgmental projection.

monetary policy response (line 5), which in turn is highly effective in supporting domestic 
demand (line 4).3 Nevertheless, the overall effect of the dollar shock on output and inflation is 
still appreciable. 
What do these estimates imply for the effects of the roughly 3½ percent increase in the projected 
path of the dollar between the July Tealbook and the October Tealbook?  The effects implied by 
the staff’s trade equations augmented with a multiplier, calculated by appropriately scaling the 
estimates shown in lines 4 and 6 of table 1, are to decrease the level of real GDP by almost 
1 percent after three years while lowering core PCE inflation by about 0.1 percentage point in 
each of the next three years. Of course, these estimates hold many aspects of the forecast 
constant, including monetary policy. Allowing for a monetary policy response, the SIGMA model 
suggests that the dollar apprecia tion will lower GDP by about ¼ percent after three years.   
In the judgmental forecast , the cumulative effect of revisions between the July and October 
Tealbooks to the GDP growth projection from 2015 to 2017 leaves the level of GDP down 
1¼ percent, while the projected fed funds rate at the end of 2017 is revised down by 125 basis 
points over the same period.  Whereas the effect of the higher dollar has importantly contributed to the  downward revision to GDP and therefore to the projected revision to policy rates other 
factors have also played a substantial role.  A rough parsing suggests that, taking into account the 
policy offset, about one-half of the decline in the medium-term GDP projection between the July 
and October Tealbooks is attributable to the higher dollar. As for inflation, between the July and 
October Tealbooks, the staff projection for core consumer price inflation has been revised down 0.2 percentage points in 2015 and 2016 and 0.1 percentage point in 2017.  The higher dollar, 
through its effects on both U.S. real activity and import prices, accounts for most of that revision. 
Thus, t he staff’s judgmental forecast attributes a somewhat greater drag on GDP from the higher 
dollar than does SIGMA.  The different GDP effects likely reflect some differences in the operation 
of key transmission channels, including how interest rates affect aggregate demand and how 
resource slack affects inflation.  Such differences are not surprising given the considerable 
uncertainty surrounding how these transmission channels operate in practice. 
3 Although the policy rate is currently constrained at the effective lower bound, the baseline forecast has 
rates increasing in the middle of next year, providing scope in the SIGMA simulation for more accommodative 
policy further out in the forecast.

 From its slightly lower-than-expected starting point at the end of this year, the 
unemployment rate is now projected to decline m ore slowly over the medium 
term than previously envisioned, reflecting the diminished outlook for real 
activity.  All told, we expect it to be 5.2 percent in 2017, 0.3 percentage point 
higher than in the September Tealbook.  Thus, the unemployment rate is no 
longer forecast to undershoot its natural rate during the medium-term 
projection period. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
We have lowered our projection for total PCE price inflation noticeably in both 
the second half of this year and early next year, mainly in response to steeper-than-
anticipated declines in oil prices.  Over the medium term, we continue to expect PCE price inflation to gradually edge up as the downward pressures on inflation from falling 
energy prices and lower import prices fade next year, resource slack slowly diminish es, 
and long-term inflation expectations hold steady. 
 After increasing at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the second quarter, total 
PCE prices are estimated to have risen just 1¼ percent in the third quarter.  In 
the current quarter, we now expect total consumer prices to decline at an 
annual rate of ¼ percent, reflecting the drop in consumer energy prices as well 
as an easing of both food and core price inflation.  
 Incoming data on core PCE prices have been a bit below our expectations, and 
with a lower forecast for core import prices, our near-term projection for core 
price inflation is a little lower than in our previous projection.  We now expect 
core PCE prices to rise 1¼ percent in the second half of the year following a 
2 percent increase in the second quarter.  Our projection for core inflation in 
the second half is also held down slightly by the residual seasonality that we 
find in these data.  
 The incoming readings for consumer food prices in August and September 
were a little higher than we had projected in the September Tealbook.  
However, these data still point to an easing of food price inflation in the third 
quarter following its surge last spring; moreover, favorable crop conditions in 
many parts of the country have contributed to a marked decline in farm prices, 
which should lead to a f urther deceleration in food prices this quarter.

 As the recent declines in crude oil prices continue to feed through to lower 
retail gasoline prices, we anticipate that PCE energy prices will fall sharply 
this quarter and decline further in the first quarter of next year.  Thereafter, we 
expect consumer energy prices to rise modestly through the end of 2017.  
 The recent appreciation of the dollar and lower commodity prices are 
expected to hold down the prices of imported core goods in the near term.  We 
estimate that core import prices rose at an annual rate of just ½ percent in the 
third quarter, and we expect these prices to fall 1 percent in the current and 
next quarters.  Import price inflation is then expected to turn positive and 
slowly move up to 1¼ percent by 2016, consistent with moderate foreign 
inflation and relatively flat projections for commodity prices and the dollar. 
 Over the medium term, as resource slack diminishes further and with long-
term inflation expectations projected to remain stable, we expect core PCE 
price inflation to edge up from 1.5 percent in 2014 to 1.8 percent in 2017.  
This path is a li ttle below our projection in the September Tealbook due to the 
weaker outlook for real activity and the pass-through of lower core import and 
energy prices.  Reflecting the modest projected increases in consumer energy 
prices, total PCE inflation is expected to be roughly in line with core price 
inflation over the medium term. 
 We have received little information on labor compensation since the previous 
Tealbook projection.  Average hourly earnings were slightly below our 
expectations in September, and the 12-month change in this measure of wages 
continues to hover around 2 percent.  Over the medium term, though, we 
continue to expect a gradual acceleration in compensation as the labor 
market tightens. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 Beyond 2017, the federal funds rate continues to be set according to the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  This policy rule 
assumes a long-run equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3¾ pe rcent.

 With inflation gradually moving toward 2 percent, the federal funds rate 
continues to rise, approaching its longer-run normal value early in the 
next decade. 
 Real GDP rises at the projected growth rate of potential output after 2017.  
The unemployment rate is at its natural rate at the end of 2017 and remains at 
that level thereafter. 
 Consumer price inflation remains ¼ percentage point below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective at the beginning of 2018.  Longer-run inflation 
expectations slowly move up to the Committee’ s target, but consumer price 
inflation does not reach 2 percent until early in the next decade.

unemployment rate, while projections for other variables, including the labor force participation rate and payroll employment, were prepared only 
through 2014. This exhibit therefore reports a 2015 projection from the September 2012 Tealbook only for the unemployment rate.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Recent data on foreign economic activity have been mixed, surprising on the 
downside for the euro area and several emerging market economies (EMEs), but coming 
in stronger than expected in China, where official third-quarter GDP data were just 
released.  We estimate that real GDP in the foreign economies registered growth of 
2¾ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, about ¼ percentage point lower than in 
the September Tealbook.  The third-quarter outcome was an improvement over the 
second quarter’s 2¼ percent growth, but the pickup largely reflected some rebound in 
activity in Japan following its earlier tax-related plunge.   
We still expect growth abroad to gradually move up to 3 percent in early 2015 
and to edge up further over the rest of the forecast period.  The pickup in growth in part 
reflects a return to near-trend growth rates in the EMEs.  Growth in the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) will be supported by accommodative monetary policies, diminishing 
fiscal drag, and the substantial appreciation of the U.S. dollar in recent months (see the 
box “The Recent Appreciation of the Dollar”).  We also assume an easier monetar y 
policy stance in Canada, the euro area, and the United Kingdom, as we detail below. 
Our outlook has been revised down somewhat in light of the generally weaker 
data and the heightened stresses in financial markets over the intermeeting period.  
However, the sharp deterioration in financial markets appears to be greater than 
warranted by our straight read of these data, perhaps because markets are focusing more 
closely on the sizable downside risks to the outlook.  In the Risks and Uncertainty 
section, we explore the implications for the U.S. economy of a sharp weakening in 
foreign economic activity and, separately, a stronger U.S. dollar.    
Economic slack and, more importantly, falling commodity prices have continued 
to push down headline inflation in the AFEs.  We have marked down our fourth-quarter 
inflation forecast for these economies by nearly 1 percentage point, to ¼ percent.  We 
expect inflation to remain low in the near term, particularly in the euro area and Japan, 
and then gradually rise as accommodative monetary policy supports the recovery.  
Aggregate EME inflation has remained subdued, reflecting lower food and fuel price 
inflation.  As these factors dissipate, we expect inflation to average 3¼ percent over the 
forecast period.

 The Recent Appreciation of the Dollar 
As shown in the upper-left panel on the next page, since the beginning of July, the dollar has 
appreciated sharply against the currencies of both the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and the 
emerging market economies (EMEs), with almost all of this rise occurring before the end of 
September.  The increase has been broad based, with the dollar rising against almost all foreign 
currencies except the heavily managed Chinese renminbi.  Moreover, the overall appreciation of 
the dollar since July 1 is large by historical standards —the change in the AFE index corresponds to 
about the 94 th percentile for all equivalent-length periods dating back to 1973. 
Some of the dollar ’s movements since July can be explained by the steady stream of weaker-than-
expected data from abroad, whereas U.S. data were generally viewed as more positive .  The 
concerns over the foreign outlook were primarily focused on the euro area and China, but data 
from Japan and South America were also weak.  As shown by indexes measuring economic 
surprises (the upper-right panel on the next page), data releases in the euro area and the EMEs 
have been consistently below expectations since August.  In contrast, cumulative economic 
surprises, although weakening of late, have been positive, on balance, in the United States. 
The data surprises, along with recent policy actions by the European Central Bank (ECB), 
contributed to a widening gap in policy expectations, which also helped support the dollar.  
Expected policy rates in the United Kingdom at the end of 2015 (the lower-left panel, next page) 
are down nearly 60 basis points since July 1, and expected euro-area rates have turned negative.  
Over the past few months, the ECB moved its deposit rate to negative 0.2 percent and announced 
a new asset purchase program.  In contrast, U.S. policy expectations held relatively steady through 
September.  Since that time, expectations for fed funds rates have fallen sharply, declining about 
30 basis points and coinciding with the recent flattening out of the dollar. 
In an effort to parse out the relative importance of the above-mentioned factors in explaining the 
run-up in the value of the dollar through the end of September, we used our empirical model of 
the dollar’s movements to examine the contributions of macroeconomic surprises (foreign and 
domestic), differentials in 24-month-ahead expected policy rates (U.S. less foreign OIS rates), and 
financial stress (VIX and foreign stress indexes) to changes in bilateral dollar exchange rates —
against the euro, U.K. pound, and yen.   The lower-right panel on the next page shows the 
cumulative explanatory power of these variables.  Changes in differentials in expected policy rates 
are by far the most important contributor.  Macroeconomic surprises also boost ed the value of the 
dollar, and the recent rise in financial stress played some role in the appreciation of the dollar 
relative to the European currenci es. 
Even so, as suggested by the bottom two rows of the table (next page) , the model explains only 
between one-fourth and one-third of the run- up in these exchange rates.   Thus, other factors, 
which are more difficult to quantify, may have contributed to the appreciation of the dollar.  
Notably, the flow of incoming data summarized in the macroeconomic surprise variable may not 
be capturing the ful l extent of the market’s concerns about the foreign outlook.  Those data have  
been weak but not extremely so, and outside forecast ers, such as the International Monetary 
Fund and Consensus Economics, have mark ed down their forecasts only a touch in response.

 Board staff have also marked down their projections for the foreign economies by only a small 
amount over the past few months.   
However, even if the modal foreign outlook has not deteriorated substantially in recent months, it 
is likely that market perceptions of the downside risks to the foreign outlook have indeed become 
more pronounced.   Prospects for effective, aggressive policies to jumpstart growth and inflation in 
the euro area are dim; “Abenomics ” appears to be losing momentum; and uncertainty about 
whether China’s property prices may move from a correction to a crash has increased.  Consistent 
with these heightened concerns about downside risks, the decline in market-based measures of 
expected policy rates accelerated in mid-October amid large price swings across a range of asset 
classes, including commodities, equities, and bonds.  Finally, we had been puzzled earlier in the 
summer by the sanguine response of markets to economic and geopolitical risks abroad .  It is 
possible that financial markets are now swinging back toward more fully pricing in these risks. 
In sum, our sense is that, along with some deterioration in foreign economic performance relative 
to the United States and resulting changes in expectations for policy rates, heightened concern 
about the downside risks to the outlook abroad have played an important role in boosting the 
dollar in recent months.

  ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro area.   Industrial production fell sharply in the euro area in August, 
largely owing to an outsized drop in German car production, and survey 
measures of business sentiment continued to trend down in September.  
However, consumption data, including those for Germany, were upbeat, and 
German car pr
oduction mostly recovered in September.  We expect GDP to 
increase at a meager ¾ percent pace in the second half of this year before 
graduall
y firming to a still-subdued 2 percent rate in 2017, supported by 
diminishing fisca
l drag and accommodative monetary policy.  The 
depreciation of the euro should contribute to a pickup in exports, while 
domestic demand benefits from lower oil prices.  Even so, the euro-area 
growth forecast is down nearly ½ percentage point in the second half of this 
year and 
about ¼ percentage point in 2015, reflecting both disappointing data 
and some fall
out from the recent financial market turbulence.   
The recent decline in commodity prices is expected to keep headline inflation 
around ½  percent in the current quarter.  As the output gap narrows and 
commodity prices stabilize, inflation should gradually move up to 1½ percent 
by the end of
 2017.  Amid slower projected growth and weaker inflation, we 
now expect that the European Central Bank (ECB) will purchase a total of 
€500 billion in private -se
ctor assets, which is €200 billion more than we 
assumed in the
 September Tealbook.  The ECB began purchasing covered 
bonds last week, plans to start buying asset-backed securities this quarter, and 
is reported to be considering a new program to buy corporate bonds next year.  
We anticipate that the ECB will keep policy rates near zero through the 
forecast period. 
 United Kingdom.   Real GDP growth is estimated to have stepped down from 
a robust 3½ percent pace in the first half of this year to a still-solid 2¾ percent 
in the third quarter, reflecting a moderation in both domestic and external 
demand.  Although retail sales expanded briskly through August, industrial 
production has leveled off, and manufacturing and services PMIs fell in 
September.  We expect GDP growth to moderate a bit more, to 2¼ percent by 
2017, as the output gap 
closes.

  Twelve-month headline inflation declined to 1.2 percent in September, pushed 
down by the lagged effects of prior exchange rate appreciation and, more 
recently, a fall in food and transport price inflation; core inflation also 
declined.  The recent fall in energy prices prompted us to reduce our inflation 
forecast further in the near term, but we continue to expect inflation to 
gradually move up to 2 percent by the end of 2016.  Amid diminished price 
pressures, we now e
xpect the Bank of England to begin raising its policy rate 
in the second quarter of 2015, one quarter later than we had previously 
anticipated, and then to normalize policy at a somewhat slower pace than we 
had previously assumed. 
 Japan.   We estimate that Japanese real GDP grew 2 percent in the third 
quarter, rebounding only weakly from the consumption tax hike –induced 
slump in the second quarter.  Although data through September indicate some 
pickup in consumption and exports, industrial production fell sharply in 
August and consumer confidence declined in September.  We expect growth 
to slow further, to 1½ percent in the current quarter, and to only ½ percent in 
2015 after another
 consumption tax hike.  Thereafter, we expect growth to 
pick up a bit to 1 percent, above the country’s ½  percent potential growth rate 
but not enough to close the output gap by the end of 2017.   
Inflation is estimated to have been 1½ percent in the third quarter.  Given 
declines in commodity prices, we expect inflation to drop to zero in the 
current quarter.  Inflation should rise to about 1 percent by the middle of next 
year before edging up to 1¼ percent in 2016 and 2017.  With growth slowing 
and inflation well
 below target, we continue to assume that the Bank of Japan 
will step up the pace of asset purchases in early 2015. 
 Canada.   Recent data, including a modest rise in July monthly GDP and a 
decline in the manufacturing PMI in September, have been in line with our 
view that real GDP growth moderated to 2½ percent in the third quarter.  We 
see GDP e
xpanding at this pace through the end of 2016 before slowing to a 
near-potential rate of 2 percent by the end of 2017.  The forecast has been 
revised down a bit, a
s drag from lower commodity prices slightly outweighs 
the boost to net exports provided by the recent depreciation of the Canadian 
dollar.

  Lower energy prices are expected to push inflation below 1 percent thi s 
quarter and next, 1 per
centage point lower than in the September Tealbook on 
average.  Then, as the output gap closes, inflation should slowly edge up and 
reach the Bank of Canada’s 2 percent target by 2017.  In light of the lower 
growth outlook and contained inflation pressures, we now project that the 
Bank’s first rate hike will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015, one quarter later 
than in the September Tealbook, and the rate will rise more gradually 
thereafter.   
EMERGING M ARKET ECONOMIES  
 China.   Economic activity in China expanded at a robust 7¾ percent pace in 
the third quarter, the same
 pace as the second quarter.  A notable deceleration 
in August industrial production, released just after the September Tealbook, 
had suggested that output growth might slow, but, as it turned out, industrial 
production rebounded sharply in September.  Exports also grew strongly in 
the third quarter.  In contrast, domestic demand indicators weakened, 
reflecting a
 sharp downturn in the property market.  Moreover, targeted 
stimulus measures announced since April appear to be providing less support 
to the economy than we had anticipated.  Given the lack of momentum in 
domestic demand, we now see economic growth falling to 7¼ percent in the 
current quarter 
and edging down to just below 7 percent by the end of the 
forecast period.  Thi
s forecast is down ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter 
and a bit less further out.   
Chinese inflation posted a
n annual rate of only 2¼ percent in the third quarter, 
and on a 12-month basis, inflation has fallen to 1½ percent, its lowest level in 
nearly 5 years, reflecting declines in food and fuel prices.  We expect inflation 
to move back up to 3 percent by the middle of next year as these 
disinflationary p
ressures wane. 
 Other Emerging Asia.   We estimate that real GDP in the rest of emerging 
Asia expanded 3¾ percent in the third quarter, supported in part by robust 
exports to the United 
States.  This estimate is a little lower than in the 
September Tealbook, partly in response to weaker-than-expected exports to 
China.  Moreover, social unrest has weigh ed on economic activity in Hong 
Kong.  We see growth in the region remaining at 3¾ percent in the current

  quarter and then rising gradually to a near-trend pace of 4¼ percent by the end 
of the forecast horizon
, supported by strengthening exports and, in Korea and 
Thailand, by additional policy stimulus.  Inflation in the region moderated to 
about 2  percent in the third quarter, primarily reflecting a deceleration in food 
and energy prices.  As the effects of these temporary factors fade, inflation 
should settle in at about 3½ percent by early next year. 
 Latin America.  Recent data suggest that Mexico ’s growth, after stagin g a 
comeback in the second quarter from a prolonged slump, moderated to a still-
strong 3¾ percent in the third quarter.  Export growth slowed sharply in July 
and August from the heady pace of the second quarter, and manufacturing 
activity moderated as well.  However, domestic demand indicators have been 
upbeat.  Construction activity has been especially strong, suggesting that 
residential investment continued to recover from its weakness of the past two 
years.  Retail sales and consumer confidence also strengthened and 
unemployment has tre
nded down.  We expect growth to remain around the 
current pace
 over the forecast period, boosted by continued accommodative 
monetary policy a
nd the effects of recent structural reforms.  Inflation rose to 
nearly 4½ percent in the third quarter, driven primarily by a jump in food 
prices, but it is expected to dr
op back to 3¼ percent by early next year and 
remain at that level over the remainder of the forecast period.     
After a rece
ssion in the first half of the year, we estimate that Brazil ’s 
economy stabilized in the third quarter.  Industrial production expanded in 
July and August, arresting its first-half decline.  However, exports were flat in 
the third quarter, confidence indicators continued to deteriorate, and 12-month 
inflation rose to 6.7 percent in September, breeching the central bank’s target 
band.  Lackluster growth in recent years and persistently high inflation have 
pushed President Dilma Rousseff into a tight presidential race against the pro-
business candidate Aécio Neves, the outcome of which will be decided on 
October 26.  Regardless of who wins, the next government faces difficult 
challenges, and we expect the economy to recover only slowly and inflation to 
stay stubbornly high over the medium term.  Brazilian financial markets have 
been fluctuating with the
 polling returns, as observers believe that if Neves 
wins, he would take steps to improve macroeconomic management and 
implement structural reforms.  Growth has been weak in other South

  American economies.  In Chile , the central bank cut its policy rate again in 
mid-October to support the weakening economy, which has been hurt by the 
falling prices of commodities, especially copper.

Financial Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, percepti ons of a deterioration in economic 
prospects abroad, together w ith somewhat weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data 
releases, prompted a sharp pullback from risky assets.  In addition, a number of technical 
factors reportedly contributed to volatile inte rest rate moves in mid-October.  Concerns 
about a possible wider spread of Ebola also appeared to weigh on market sentiment at 
times.  Federal Reserve communications were perceived as modestly more 
accommodative than expected on net. 
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities d eclined 16 to 36 basis points across 
the curve, and market-based measures of inflation compensation fell amid 
declining commodity prices and lower-tha n-expected data on CPI inflation.   
 The anticipated path of the federal funds  rate implied by market quotes shifted 
down notably, on net, over the intermediate period.  Respondents to the Open 
Market Desk’s primary dealer surve y, however, continued to see the second 
quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of liftoff. 
 The S&P 500 index dropped 3 percent, and the VIX increas ed significantly 
over the period, albeit from very low le vels.  Corporate bond spreads widened, 
particularly for speculative-grade debt.  
 Against the backdrop of heightened risks to the global economic outlook, 
broad foreign equity indexes fell substa ntially over the period.  Benchmark 
sovereign yields abroad declined mark edly.  The nominal broad index of the 
dollar increased about 1¼ percent on net. 
 Some money market rates declined lead ing into quarter-end, reportedly in part 
reflecting the announcement following the September FOMC meeting of 
changes to the overnight reverse repu rchase agreement (ON RRP) exercise.  
After quarter-end, however, short-term rates generally moved back toward 
pre-announcement levels.

that lending standards had ch anged little for most major loan types in the third 
quarter.1  Consumer credit continued to e xpand in the third quarter, while 
mortgage lending remained tepid.  Issu ance of corporate bonds and leveraged 
loans slowed sharply, at least for a time, during the week of heightened 
market volatility.   
TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS 
Concerns about the global growth outlook and the implications for U.S. economic 
performance reportedly contributed to a signi ficant decline in Treasury yields over the 
period.  Growing anxiety about the potential further spread of Ebola may have put some 
downward pressure on rates, particularly in the past two weeks.  U.S. economic data 
releases that were somewhat weaker than expected, on net, also contributed to the decline in Treasury yields.  The Treasury market experienced significant volatility on October 15, 
with 5- and 10-year Treasury yields plungi ng intraday as much as 30 basis points.  
Swaption-implied volatilities on longer-term inte rest rates jumped on the day and have 
stayed elevated since then.  While the rel ease of the somewhat weaker-than-expected 
September U.S. retail sales data was seen as  the proximate trigger for these sharp price 
movements, market participants indicated that a number of technical factors apparently 
amplified these moves (see the box “Treasury Mark et Volatility and Technical Factors”).   
Communications on the day of the Septembe r FOMC meeting were interpreted as 
slightly less accommodative than expected, on balance, and pushed Treasury yields a bit 
higher.  Market participants took note of the upward revisions in the median projected 
level for the federal funds rate at the e nd of 2015 and 2016 that were discussed at the 
postmeeting press conference.
2  By contrast, the September FOMC minutes were seen as 
modestly more accommodative than expecte d, as market participants reportedly 
highlighted policymakers’ concerns about the weaker global economic outlook and the 
potential adverse effects of the strengtheni ng of the dollar.  In addition, communications 
1 See Vladimir Yankov (2014), “The October 2014 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices,” memorandum to the FOMC, October 23. 
2 The Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, released at the same time as the September 
FOMC statement, generally were seen as unsurprisi ng, given the discussion in the minutes of recent 
meetings.  However, changes to the ON RRP exercise, also announced on the same day, were largely 
unexpected, and commentary suggested that strains at quarter-end might partly have reflected the short 
period of time that investors had to adjust their funding and investment plans.  In the event, however, the 
strains were moderate and short lived (see the box “Money Market Dynamics around Quarter-End”).

Treasury Market Volatility and Technical Factors 
On the morning of October 15, yields on longer-term nominal Treasury securities 
dropped 30 basis points in about an hour before retracing much of the decline by 
the close of business (figure 1).  Amid very high trading volumes, Treasury marke t 
liquidity worsened significantly:  Bid-asked spreads widened and measures of 
market depth deteriorated (figure 2).  In the Treasury futures market, volumes 
soared (figure 3). At the same time, market-based implied volatility on longer-
term rates jumped. During the past two decades, intraday yield movements as 
large as those seen on October 15 occurred only six times, and these were mostl y 
associated with major monetary policy announcements or foreign or domestic 
financial crises. Market commentary regarding last week’s moves emphasized 
that many investors were surprised by the intraday volatility in rate markets because these markets are typically regarded as among the most liquid in the 
world.
1 
Market participants noted that the drivers of volatility on October 15 are still not 
entirely understood, in part because only limited market data is available for very 
recent events.  The proximate trigger for the initial decrease in yields appears to 
have been the 8:30 a.m. release of weaker-than-expected retail sales data for 
September, which came against a backdrop of growing concerns regarding the 
global economic outlook, heightened uncertainty around central bank policy in 
Europe, and, to a lesser extent, fears of the further spread of Ebola .  Longer-term 
rates fell by an additional 15 basis points or more in a few minutes after 9:30 a.m. 
before quickly reversing. Market liquidity, which was already significantly 
impaired, declined further and at a rapid pace amid these sharp moves in rates. 
Market participants have pointed to a number of factors that may have 
contributed to the heightened volatility on the day. Many institutional investors, 
which had apparently been holding substantial positions designed to produce 
gains should U.S. interest rates increase, reportedly attempted to rapidly close 
out these trades.2 The consequent decline in rates may have been amplified by a 
limited willingness of dealers to facilitate such transactions in light of more 
1 Market participants noted that volatility and trading volumes increased considerably in 
other li quid markets, such as equity and foreign e xchange markets, amid the volatility in r ate 
markets.  
2 An extensive theoretical literature has demonstrated how rising losses can f orce 
speculators who use leverage to exit their positions, exacerbating changes in prices and 
market liquidity. For canonical models, see Andrei Shleifer an d Robert W. Vishny (1997) , “The 
Limits of Arbitrage,” Journal of Finance , vol. 52 (1), pp. 3555; and Markus K. Br unnermeier an d 
Lasse Heje Pedersen (2009) , Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity, Review of Financial 
Studies , vol. 22 (6), pp. 2201 38. 
With respect to the positions held by institutional investors, contacts also noted that a 
number of market participants who had sold volatility tried to unwind these positions or hedge 
their e xposures by taking long positions in th e cash Tre asury market or in interest rate swaps, 
thus putting additional downward pressure on rates.

stringent regulatory constraints and more conservative risk-management 
practices after the financial crisis.3 Some market participants suggested that a 
structural decline in the levels of staffing and experience at interest rate trading 
desks over the past few years also resulted in dealers being less willing to make 
markets when order flow s are large and one-sided as was reportedly the case 
on October 15. 
Market commentary has also highlighted that an ongoing structural shift away 
from voice-driven, client- to-dealer trading and toward electronic trading that 
uses algorithm-based strategies was an important exacerbating factor. 
Increasingly, firms employ algorithms to accommodate small, idiosyncratic order 
flows, reducing the price impact caused by such flows by taking short-term, 
partially hedged positions in securities that appear mispriced. Under normal 
circumstances, these firms actively provide intraday liquidity to the market. 
However, on October 15, a s certain internal thresholds were crossed, some of 
these firms chose to limit their activities for a time , contributing to the 
deterioration in market liquidity and sharp moves in prices.  Some dealers and 
other market participants also reportedly pulled back from marketmaking .  
Nonetheless, conversations with market participants and a preliminary analysis 
of trading data suggest that some firms employing high-frequency trading 
strategies continued to transact in cash and futures markets, even as volatility 
surged.  However, even the firms that continued to make markets reportedly did 
so only at wider bid-asked spreads and at significantly reduced trade sizes.   
Given this overall mix of factors, yields fell sharply and volatility spiked, 
reportedly until other market participants such as asset managers and 
nonfinancial corporations stepped in by establishing short rate positions. 
3 A number of market participants also mentioned that the change in leadership and 
strategy at Pimco, which had been a s ignificant seller of interest rate optionality in p revious 
months, may have added to dealers’ reluctance to intermediate on October 15, as the cost of 
such protection was already high.

by some Committee participants later in th e period reportedly reinforced the downward 
pressure on yields for a time. 
On balance, the nominal Treasury yiel d curve flattened noticeably over the 
intermeeting period, with the 2-year yield moving down 16 basis points and the 10-year 
yield declining 36 basis points.  TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next 5 years 
and 5 to 10 years ahead fell 26 basis points a nd 17 basis points, re spectively, extending 
the declines seen since the summer.  Thes e moves reportedly refl ected concerns about 
global growth and the risk of building disinf lationary pressures, the lower-than-expected 
August CPI report, the decline in  oil prices, and the apprecia tion of the dollar (see the box 
“Recent Declines in Inflation Compensation”).  Inflation compensation measures based 
on inflation swaps showed declines similar to  those of their TIPS-based counterparts.  
Current-coupon agency MBS yields  decreased 37 basis points,  about in line with the 
10-year Treasury yield, while option-ad justed spreads on the production-coupon MBS 
decreased slightly. 
The path of the federal funds rate base d on financial market quotes shifted down 
markedly over the intermeeting period, with the end-of-2016 federal funds rate implied 
by OIS quotes declining nearly 50 basis point s to about 1.20 percent.  Market-based 
measures suggest that the timing of liftoff for the federal funds rate was pushed back to 
late 2015.  Measures of near-term uncertainty  regarding the path of policy moved down 
over the period on net.  
In contrast to the decline implied by fina ncial market quotes, the median dealer’s 
projected path of the federal f unds rate in the Desk’s Octobe r survey was little changed.  
The distribution across dealers of the most likely timing of the liftoff in the federal funds rate became more concentrated at the sec ond quarter of 2015, as some dealers shifted 
their expectations toward the second quarter from the third quarter.  All but one dealer 
expected the asset purchase s to end in October.  
EQUITY PRICES AND BOND RISK SPREADS 
Broad domestic equity price indexes decreased about 3 percent over the 
intermeeting period on net.  Stock prices for sectors more sensitive to global demand— 
such as basic materials, energy, and industria l goods—fell more than  the broader index.  
The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility of one-month returns on the S&P 500 
index, increased significantly ove r the period and briefly touched levels last seen in 2011.

Recent Declines in Inflation Compensation 
Measures of inflation compensation from Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) and 
inflation swaps have declined noticeably since early August, with 5to10year forward inflation 
compensation reaching levels last seen in 2011. In addition, the probability distribution for 
average headline CPI inflation over the next 10 years, as implied by inflation derivatives, suggests 
that the downward drift in inflation compensation over the period has been associated with a 
lower probability of relatively high inflation outcomes (figure 1).1 In contrast, as can be seen from 
the blue and black curves in figure 2, measures of long term inflation expectations based on Blue 
Chip Economic Indicators and the Desk’s primary dealer surveys remained stable, on balance, over 
the past several months.2 
Market participants offered several potential explanations for the decline in the 5to10year
forward inflation compensation, including some pass through effects of recent low realized 
inflation and declines in oil prices on longer horizon inflation compensation, as well as concerns 
about the growth outlook and disinflationary pressure abroad.3 In addition, several market 
commentaries highlighted the notable negative comovement between longer run inflation 
compensation and the strength of the U.S. dollar in recent years, as can be seen in figure 3. 
Some of these proposed explanations would appear to be more relevant for shorter—rather 
than longer—horizon inflation compensation. For example, a stronger dollar could lead to 
disinflationary pressures by lowering import prices, but such effects are unlikely to persist for a 
prolonged period of time. Nonetheless, the strengthening of the dollar and the decline in longer
horizon inflation compensation could be reflecting the same underlying factors, such as a weaker 
1 The probability distribution in figure 1 is derived under the assumption that average inflation takes discrete 
values at integer percentage points. Thus, the bar for, say, 3 percent, should perhaps be thought of as 
representing the probability attached to average inflation outcomes between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent. 
2 Long term inflation expectations based on Blue Chip Economic Indicators and the Desk’s primary dealer 
surveys are, approximately, for the 7to11year and 5to10year horizons, respectively. Inflation expectations over 
the 5to10year horizon based on the Survey of Professional Forecasters exhibited some declines in recent 
quarters, but that series is relatively volatile, and its recent declines represent reversals of earlier increases. 
3 One possible reason for the pass through effect is that, in response to changes in the intermediate term 
inflation outlook, investors are reportedly more likely to adjust their positions in the more recently issued, and 
thus more liquid, longer term TIPS rather than the older vintage TIPS with shorter remaining maturities. Market 
participants also cited safe haven flows into nominal Treasury securities as a potential technical factor driving the 
decline in forward inflation compensation. - 2 - 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 October 21, 2014

global economic outlook relative to the United States or safe haven flows into U.S. nominal 
Treasury securities. 
To examine some of these possible effects, we regress monthly changes in TIPS implied inflation 
compensation on monthly changes in variables intended to capture the outlooks for domestic 
and global growth and inflation as well as safe haven flows into nominal Treasury securities and 
liquidity conditions in the TIPS market.4 We then use the model estimates to decompose the 
changes in inflation compensation between the end of July 2014 and the end of September 2014. 
Of both the 33 basis point and 36 basis point declines in the 5year and 5to10year inflation 
compensation measures, respectively, the regression attributes about 10 basis points to the 
stronger dollar. Other variables in the regression  contribute 18 basis points and 7 basis points, 
respectively, to the declines in the two measures, while a significa nt portion of the move in 
forward inflation compensation remains unexplained. These results depend on the variables 
used in the decomposition, which may not capture the full extent of investors’ concerns about 
the global economic and inflation outlook. For example, in response to a special question in the 
Desk’s October primary dealer survey, dealers attributed a significant portion of the decline in 
forward inflation compensation from early September through midOctober to lower expected 
inflation and inflation risk premiums.

between inflation swaps and TIPS implied measures of inflation compensation at the corresponding horizons to 
capture liquidity conditions  in the TIPS market. We estimate the model using monthly data from September 2004

About one-third of firms in the S&P 500 index have reported earnings for the third 
quarter, with the reports genera lly about in line with expectations.  As a consequence, 
earnings projections from Wall St reet analysts were little changed and continued to imply 
modest growth in earnings per shar e compared with the prior quarter. 
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds decreased less than those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities , while yields on speculative-grade bonds 
decreased a bit, on net.  As  a result, corporate bond spr eads widened, particularly for 
speculative-grade securities.  Market func tioning and liquidity in the corporate bond 
market were little changed even amid the large price moves.3 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
Over the intermeeting period, financial mark et participants a ppeared to become 
more anxious about the outlook for global growth , especially in the euro area and China.  
In mid-October, a range of asset classe s—including commodities, equities, and bonds— 
experienced large price swings.  Measures of implied volatility increased in many 
markets, especially those for equities.  All told, since the September FOMC meeting, 
major equity indexes are down between 6 and 10 percent in Europe, 7 percent in Japan, 
and a bit less in emerging Asia.  Net flow s into EME-dedicated mutual funds turned 
negative over the past two weeks.   
Reflecting, to varying degrees, concerns  about the economy, declining inflation 
expectations, and anticipations of easier monetary policy, sovereign yields fell in most foreign advanced economies.  In line with U. S. yields, the U.K. 10- year sovereign yield 
fell almost 40 basis points.  German yields decl ined to just below 90 basis points, as euro-
area inflation expectatio ns 5 to 10 years ahead fell to 1.8 percent, a new record low.  
Spreads of yields on 10-year sovereign bonds over comparable German yields widened a 
bit in Italy and Portugal, and th ey increased more than 2 percentage points in Greece, in 
part reflecting concerns that Greece may ex it its IMF program prematurely.  Spreads for 
most EME bonds also widened. 
Over the first half of th e intermeeting period, the dolla r continued to appreciate 
against most of the currencies of our trading partners, with the prominent exception of the 
3 Some market participants had speculated that, following Bill Gross’s departure in late 
September, asset classes to which Pimco’s largest fund reportedly had sizable exposures, such as high-yield 
bonds, could come under pressure.  However, such pressure did not materialize.

Chinese renminbi.  The run-up reflected a combination of downbeat data abroad and U.S. 
data that were generally viewed as positiv e.  In addition, the ongoi ng decline in market-
based policy expectations in the euro area and the United Kingdom likely contributed to 
the rise in the value of the dollar.  (See the box “The Recent Appreciation of the Dollar” 
in the International Ec onomic Developments and Outlook se ction.)  Since early October, 
the dollar has depreciated sli ghtly, as concerns emerged a bout U.S. economic growth and 
as expectations for the path of the federal funds rate moved down.  On net over the 
intermeeting period, the staff’s broad nominal dollar index in creased about 1¼ percent.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
Despite some volatility related to quart er-end, conditions in unsecured funding 
markets were little changed, on ne t, over the intermeeting period.4  In secured funding 
markets, some money market rates fell in the days leading into quarter-end, reportedly 
reflecting in part the announcement of the ch anges to the ON RRP exercise following the 
September FOMC meeting (see the box “Money Market Dynamics around Quarter-
End”).5  After quarter-end, however , short-term rates generally moved back toward their 
pre-announcement levels.  More recently, ge neral collateral repo rates increased in mid-
October and have remained elevated , reflecting a number of factors.6  Market participants 
are reportedly focused on the approaching year-end, but, thus far, repo rates over the turn of the year implied by futures contracts do not point to significant pressures. 
Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Re serve began a series of expanded test 
operations of the Term Deposit Facility involvi ng offerings of deposits with an early 
withdrawal feature.  Deposits awarded in the first two operations—at $110 billion and 
4 The effective federal funds rate averaged 9 basi s points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points. 
5 At its September meeting, the Committee announced the introduction of a $300 billion aggregate 
cap, an auction process to allocate ON RRPs when the cap is binding, and an increase in the individual 
maximum bid size from $10 billion to $30 billion. 
6 In addition to the usual supply and demand factors th at can lead to firmness in repo rates, such as 
an increase in net Treasury securities outstanding an d a decrease in demand by Freddie Mac ahead of its 
payment date for MBS principal and interest, market participants also pointed to some investors unwinding 
short Treasury positions, which p uts upward pressure on these repo rates.

Money Market Dynamics around Quarter-End 
Money market dynamics around the September quarter-end were influenced by three factors:  
dealer firms’ continued reductions in their repo holdings, the Treasury’s bill paydowns since 
early September, and unexpected changes to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON 
RRP) operations announced close to quarter-end .  Taken together, these factors likely led to 
softer money market rates leading up to and including quarter-end, and, to a lesser extent, just 
after quarter-end. 
Going into quarter-end, cash lenders re portedly faced more limited investment opportunities , 
reflecting the efforts of major borrowers including dealers and foreign banks to pare their 
balance sheets , especially on the quarter-end statement date, but also more generally over time 
(figure 1, next page).  A seasonal decline in Treasury bills outstanding further contributed to the 
reduction in risk-free short-term investments. 
Separately, following the September FOMC meeting, several changes were made to the 
parameters of the ON RRP operations. Effective September 22, the individual maximum bid was 
raised from $10 billion to $30 billion , a $300 billion overall size limit for each operation was 
added, and an auction mechanism to allocate ON RRPs when the overall limit binds was 
introduced .  These changes were largely unexpected by the market and may have been 
responsible for the decline in money market yields near quarter-end, as money fund managers 
who were unsure they would be able to place cash at the ON RRP scrambled to find alternative 
investments . Notably, there was a shift lower in the distribution of triparty repo rates at that 
time (figure 2, next page). Yields on Treasury bills with relatively short remaining maturities also 
moved down after the announcement. 
While money markets were strained over quarter-end, the strains were less severe than some 
had anticipated, likely reflecting in part investors ’ efforts to reallocate funds ahead of quarter-
end. Counterparties submitted $407 billion in bids to the ON RRP operation on the quarter-end 
at a weighted-average rate of negative 0.4 basis points, including many mo ney market fund bids 
at negative rates.  The overall limit of $300 billion was awarded at a stop-out rate of 0 basis 
points.  Consistent with previous quarter-ends, balances left with custodian banks rose about 
$80 billion, as money market funds were unable to place this cash elsewhere.1 In repo markets 
more broadly, there was a larger decline in repo rates and volumes on September 30 than on 
the previous three quarter-ends (table 1, next page). The distribution of triparty repo rates 
shifted down further on quarter-end (figure 2, red bars) and there was some intraday volatility 
in rates on very light volume, especially after the close of the ON RRP operation. 
In unsecured markets, behavior this quarter-end was similar to previous quarter-ends, with 
volumes falling by more than half (table 1) .  The exception was the brokered Eurodollar rate, 
which printed at negative 2 basis points (figure 3, next page).  This is the first time the 
Eurodollar rate has printed negative since data collection began in March 2010 and appeared to 
1 Of the $107 b illion not allocated in th e ON R RP operation, $60 billion was from money funds and likely 
went to custodian banks.

reflect the trades of one or more large firms who had very limited alternatives over the 
quarter-end. 
Despite the strain before and on quarter-end, most rates and volumes quickly returned to 
normal over subsequent days, with both secured and unsecured markets trading at pre- quarter-
end levels the next day. The distribution of triparty repo rates shifted back up the week after 
quarter-end to nearly their pre-announcement levels (figure 2, blue bars).  Triparty repo 
volumes are still down somewhat from their pre-quarter-end amounts and the Treasury bill 
curve remains persistently lower in longer-dated bills, perhaps reflecting in part market 
participants’ demand for collateral heading into year-end .

$172 billion, respectively—were more than doubl e those at earlier operations without the 
early withdrawal feature.7 
Notwithstanding the extreme intraday swing in mid-October, liquidity conditions 
in the Treasury markets changed little on ne t.  Over the intermeeting period, the Desk 
purchased $13 billion of Treasury securities and $32 billion of agency MBS securities.  
The Desk conducted $175 million of dollar ro lls.  As of October 21, the Federal 
Reserve’s outright holdings of Treasury securi ties topped $2.4 trillion, and its holdings of 
mortgage-backed securities were about $1.7 trillion.8 
MBS liquidity conditions were somewhat st rained when market volatility picked 
up around the middle of the month.  Of not e, one Federal Reserve MBS purchase 
operation on October 15, at the time of he ightened market volatility, was extended 
because of lack of participation by some d ealers, and offer-to-cover ratios in some 
securities reached new lows that week.  The ratio of the Desk’s MBS settlements to gross 
issuance of these securities increased in Se ptember to 47 percent, mainly reflecting an 
uptick in settlements.   
BUSINESS FINANCE 
The pace of financing by nonfinancial businesses picked up in both credit and 
equity markets in September and early Oct ober.  Gross issuance of investment- and 
speculative-grade bonds rebounded from seasonal lows over the summer.  An increasing 
number of speculative-grade issuers reporte d that they would use the proceeds of bond 
issues to finance mergers and acquisitions (M&A).9  Gross public equity issuance by 
domestic nonfinancial firms also picked up fr om a lackluster pace in the previous months, 
7 In the first two operations, the maximum award amount per counterparty was $5 billion and 
$10 billion, respectively, and the interest rate wa s 1 basis point above the IOER rate in both cases. 
8 The Treasury Department auctioned $154 billion of nominal fixed-rate coupon securities and 
$13 billion of TIPS over the intermeeting period, with  bid-to-cover ratios somewhat weaker than recent 
averages.  The Treasury’s $13 billi on second reopening of the two-year Floating Rate Note on 
September 24 was characterized as well received.  On  October 9, the Treasury conducted a small-value 
buyback operation in the amount of $22 million to ensure operational readiness of its buyback 
infrastructure.  This operation was not a precursor or signal of any pending policy changes regarding the 
Treasury’s use of buybacks more broadly.  
9 Supported by record corporate cash holdings and favorable financing conditions, the pace of 
cash-financed mergers also pi cked up notably in the third quarter, driv en by an increase in the number of 
medium- and small-sized deals.

owing to a rebound in seasoned equity offerings. However, bond and equity issuance 
slowed sharply last week as financial market volatility increased. 
Commercial and industrial loans on banks ’ books continued to expand at a robust 
pace in the third quarter.  Banks reported stronger loan demand, on net, from large and 
middle-market firms in the October SL OOS and cited various reasons for the 
strengthening, with increased M&A financing being the most commonly mentioned 
factor.  Issuance of institutional leveraged lo ans slowed some in September.  However, 
investors’ interest in the asse t class remained strong, with co ntinued outflows from retail 
loan funds being more than offset by robust CLO issuance.  In recent weeks, amid the heightened volatility in broade r financial markets, investor s were cautious in funding new 
issuance of leveraged loans, especially for small-sized deals. 
Credit conditions in commercial real es tate (CRE) markets continued to ease.  
Gradual, though persistent, declines in vacan cies as well as incr eased availability of 
financing have helped boost CRE prices.  The volume of CMBS issuance remained 
robust in September, and strong originati on volumes are expected over the next few 
months. The growth of CRE loans on the bala nce sheets of large banks slowed in the 
third quarter, while outstanding loans at sma ll banks continued to expand at a moderate 
pace.  According to the October SLOOS, banks  continued to ease CRE lending standards, 
on net, and reported stronger demand for th e three major types of such loans.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE 
Credit conditions in residential mortga ge markets remained tight despite the 
easing of two factors weighing on credit availability—capacity constraints and regulatory uncertainty—over the past year.  Indicators of  purchase and refinance activity continued 
to hover around their recent subdued levels .  Since the September FOMC meeting, 
mortgage rates to qualified borrowers have de clined 24 basis points, a little less than 
MBS yields.   
Conditions in most consumer credit ma rkets remained accommodative during the 
third quarter.  Auto loans continued to be wi dely available and appeared to be on pace for 
another large increase in the third quarter.  Respondents to the October SLOOS indicated 
that demand for auto loans had strengthened further over the same period.  The recovery 
in revolving credit that be gan earlier this year  continued through the summer.  Although 
standards are still tight for borro wers with less-than-pristine credit histories, supervisory

data on credit card loans at large bank holdi ng companies (BHCs) indicated an increase 
in July in the share of new accounts originated to consumers with lower credit scores.  
Moreover, according to the October SLOOS, demand for credit card loans increased and 
banks continued to raise credit limits on such  loans.  Despite the recent volatility in 
financial markets, financing and liquidity conditions in the consumer ABS market 
remained largely stable in recent weeks.  
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY 
The stock prices of large U.S. BHCs decreased over the intermeeting period, 
roughly in line with the broader equity market, while CDS spreads for large BHCs edged 
up, about in line with the CDX nonfinancial i nvestment-grade index.  Earnings reports 
for large banks were mixed in the third quart er.  Banks reported that low interest rates 
and litigation expenses conti nued to put downward pressure on bank profitability, and net 
interest margins continued to narrow at seve ral banks as a result of lower loan interest 
rates and increased holdings of relatively lo w-yielding securities.  However, investment 
banking revenue was strong and trading reve nue improved, reportedly helped by market 
volatility in September. 
Bank credit decelerated slightly in the th ird quarter amid slower growth in core 
loans.  Banks’ securities holdings continue d to expand, mainly dr iven by increases in 
holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.  With  reserve balances growing more slowly 
because of the reduction in the pace of Fede ral Reserve asset purchases, some banks are 
reportedly increasing their holdi ngs of U.S. Treasury securitie s to meet Basel III liquidity 
requirements.10  In total, reserves and Treasury se curities, which account for the majority 
of high-quality liquid assets at commercial banks subject to the standard liquidity 
coverage ratio, continued to in crease briskly at large domestic banks in the third quarter.  
Growth of M2 slowed to an annual rate of 3¾ percent in September, with nearly 
all of the components slowing la st month.  The monetary base  contracted in September, 
primarily because of a decline in reserve bala nces resulting from increased take-up in the 
Federal Reserve’s ON RRP exercise. 
10 Holdings of U.S. Treasury securities by comme rcial banks that are subject to the standard 
liquidity coverage ratio requirement have risen about $130 billion thus far this year.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first 
scenario, the recent volatility in financial markets signals the beginning of an extended 
period of heightened risk aversion and depressed consumer and business confidence that 
results in further declines in equity valuations, wider corporate bond spreads, and weaker real economic activity.  By contrast, the second s cenario considers the possibilit y that the 
better-than-expected improvements in the labor market so far this year are consistent with 
a stronger pace for the economic recovery. The third scenario features a deeper and more 
protracted reduction in potential output growth than assumed in the baseline.  In the fourth scenario, the tr ajectory of long er-term inflation expectations is lower than in the 
baseline, leading to a shallower path of actual inflation in the coming years.  The fifth 
scenario considers the risk that the foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciates sharply.  The last scenario examines the possibility that foreign economic growth is 
significantly weaker than in our baseline outlook. 
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its effective lower bound, its movements are governed as in the baseline forecast by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using 
a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in 
the Committee’s recent statements.
1 In all cases, we assume that the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
1 Specifically, in the first three scenarios, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in the quarter 
following the observation of an unemployment rate of 5.7 percent, the level of unemployment prevailing in 
the baseline one quarter prior to liftoff. In the “Lower Long Term Inflation Expectations” scenario, where 
the path of inflation is significantly different from the baseline, the choice of liftoff date is meant to capture 
the Committee’s intention “to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable 
time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer run goal,” as stated in the September FOMC statement. For the last two 
scenarios, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the one used in the first four scenarios. One key 
difference relative to the FRB/US simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack 
equal to the di fference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would 
occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

Increased Financial Turbulence 
In this scenario, the recent bout of financial market volatility marks the beginning 
of a widespread reassessment of risk. The resulting asset price declines and wider bond 
spreads from heightened risk aversion depress consumer and business confidence.  These 
developments put downward pressure on business investment, hiring, and consumer 
spending, leading to broad-based weakness in economic activity. All told, real GDP 
growth slows to 1 percent in 2015 and 1¾ percent in the period from 2016 to 2017. The 
unemployment rate rises above 6 percent in early 2015 and averages 6¼ p ercent from 
2016 to 2019, c ausing the federal funds rate to stay at the effective lower bound through 
2019.  Downward pressure on inflation from weaker aggregate demand is largely offset 
by a reduction in aggregate supply induced by slower investment growth.  As a result, 
inflation is roughly unchanged relative to the baseline. 
Faster Recovery w ith Higher Inflation 
As pointed out in the staff’s quantitative surveillance assessment report, both the 
financial and nonfinancial sectors appear well positioned to weather the recent episode of financial market volatility. In addition, the labor market has continued to improve, 
lending standards have continued to ease, manufacturing output growth has been solid, 
and fiscal policy restraint has faded. In this scenario, the steady improvement in labor 
market conditions boosts household and business confidence in the dura bility of the 
economic expansion, driving a virtuous cycle marked by more rapid economic g rowth 
than in the baseline.  We also assume that inflation will be more sensitive to reductions in 
resource slack than is implicit in the FRB/US model, analogous to the larger inflation effects in some DSGE models.  
Real GDP growth averages 3½ percent in 2015 a nd 2016, 1 percentage point 
higher than in the baseline; the unemployment rate falls below 4¼ percent in early 2017. 
With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the baseline, 
reaching 2½ p ercent in early 2018.
2 The federal funds rate lifts off one quarter earlier 
and rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in mid-2017 a nd reaching 5½ percent 
in late 2019. Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually 
2 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially steeper wage and price 
Phillips curves used in this scenario. Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation 
would have peaked at 2 percent.

drive the unemployment rate to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 
2 percent. 
No Room to Grow 
Some of the models we consult suggest that potential output may currently be 
lower than is assumed in the baseline projection and may grow more slowly in the future.  
In this scenario, we assume that structural productivity gains in recent years have been 
slower than the staff currently estimates and continue to be so over the projection period ; 
we also assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been constant at 6¼ percent 
since early 2011 and will remain at that level in the future.  With these assumptions, 
potential output has expanded at an annual rate of only 1 percent since 2011; looking 
ahead, it rises at only a 1¼ percent pace through 2019.  As a consequence, the output gap 
is estimated to have closed in the previous quarter. 
Compared with the baseline, real GDP growth is substantially slower as 
households and firms base their spending on lower levels of and slower anticipated 
growth inpermanent income and potential output.  Inflation is higher than in the 
baseline, reflecting the effects of both tighter resource utilization and lower productivity.  
The unemployment rate begins to move up in 2016 and re aches the higher assumed 
natural rate of 6¼ pe rcent in early 2019.  Inflation is slightly above 2 percent in that year.  
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
In the b aseline projection, consumer price inflation is projected to increase 
gradually to the Committee’s longer-run target of 2 percent. A key assumption behind 
this projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting is currently 1.8 pe rcent and eventually rises to 2 percent.  However, some 
models point to even lower estimates of long-term inflation expectations, and there is an associated risk that these expectations could remain low for an extended period of time.
3 
In this scenario, we assume that households and businesses form their long-term 
expectations adaptively based on past inflation and that long-term inflation expectations 
currently stand at 1.5 p ercent.  Low actual inflation in the coming years and the subdued 
inflation expectations are mutually reinforcing. As a re sult, inflation in this scenario runs

persistently below baseline and reaches only slightly above 1½ p ercent in 2019, causing 
liftoff to occur in the first quarter of 2017, almost two years later than in the baseline.  At 
that time, the unemployment rate has declined to 5 percent, ¼ p ercentage point below its 
natural rate.  However, given the decline in long-term inflation expectations, inflation 
projected one to two years ahead is still below the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
despite tighter labor market conditions. 
Stronger Dollar 
We project that the broad real dollar will depreciate slightly over the forecast 
period.  However, the dollar may continue to appreciate for any number of reasons, 
including a greater-than-expected reaction by investors to the prospective normalization 
of policy rates in the United States, heightened concern about the foreign outlook, or 
both.  In this scenario, we examine the possibility that the broad real dollar appreciates 
10 percent relative to baseline by the end of next year due to foreign exchange risk 
premium shocks.4 
The stronger exchange value of the dollar reduces U.S. real net exports 
substantially and also pushes down inflation as a result of lower import prices and greater resource slack.  Consequently, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound 
one quarter longer than in the baseline and U.S. monetary policy removes 
accommodation more gradually going forward, with the federal funds rate in 2016 about 
50 basis points below the baseline path.  The more accommodative policy stance provides 
a boost to U.S. domestic demand and helps reduce the adverse effect of the stronger 
dollar on real activity.  Even so, U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of only 1¾ percent, 
on average, in 2015 about ½ percentage point below the baseline.  Lower import prices 
cause core PCE inflation to run about ½ percentage point below baseline next year before gradually reverting to baseline thereafter. 
Weaker Foreign Growth 
Our baseline forecast projects some pickup in foreign GDP growth relative to its 
tepid pace through most of this year.  However, the materialization of downside risks to 
the global outlook a renewed recession in the euro area, a hard landing in China, or an 
escalation of geopolitical stresses could trigger financial market turbulence and 
widespread declines in foreign growth. In this scenario, foreign GDP growth is assumed

and Inflation” in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section.

to average 1 percentage point below the baseline over the next three years.  Weaker 
foreign demand and some flight- to-safety flows to dollar-denominated assets induce the 
broad real dollar to appreciate by about 4 percent relative to the baseline by the end 
of 2015. 
The slower foreign growth and stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands by 2 percent in 2015, about 
½ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Weaker U.S. economic activity and lower 
import price inflation hold core inflation to about 1¼ percent through 2016.  Relative to 
the previous scenario, the path of the federal funds rate runs a little further below baseline 
after 2016.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
