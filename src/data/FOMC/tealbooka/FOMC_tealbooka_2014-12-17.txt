Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information about real activity that we have received during the intermeeting 
period has generally been in line with or a litt le stronger than our e xpectations as of the 
October Tealbook.  We now expect real GDP to  increase at an average annual rate of 
3 percent over the second half of this year; we expect  that private domestic final 
purchases (PDFP)—a measure of aggregate dema nd that often gives a clearer view of the 
underlying thrust of the economy—to increase  about 3¼ percent over the same period.1  
Both of these figures are slightly stronge r than we had written down in our October 
projection.  In the first half of next year, we expect PDFP to continue to rise at about the 
same solid pace as in the second half of this year, even as real GDP growth slows 
somewhat.  Meanwhile, the two employment reports that were published since the 
October Tealbook were stronger, on balance, than we had expected—especially with 
regard to payroll employment—and we have  upgraded our near-term outlook for labor 
market conditions accordingly.   
As in previous forecasts, we anticipate that output growth over the next three 
years will exceed the growth rate of potent ial.  We see accommodative monetary policy, 
further improvements in the labor market, and continued gains in business sales as 
bolstering consumer and business confidence, a nd all of these factors work together to 
provide additional support to spending growt h.  Indeed, our medium-term projection for 
economic activity is a little stronger than in  the October Tealbook, as the higher path for 
stock prices and lower trajectory  for crude oil prices in this projection offset the restraint 
implied by the further appreciation of the dollar.2  All told, real GDP is expected to 
increase 2½ percent next year , 2¾ percent in 2016, and 2¼ pe rcent in 2017.  By the end 
of the medium-term projection, therefore, real  GDP growth will have slowed most of the 
way back to its potential rate of growth, re strained by a stance of monetary policy that 
will have been significantly normalized relative to its position today.  
                                                 
1 PDFP includes personal consumption expenditures and residential and business fixed investment.  
Relative to GDP, PDFP excludes net exports, government spending, and inventory investment. 
2 During the intermeeting period, we also adjusted our assumptions about the sensitivity of real 
GDP to changes in the exchange rate.  In particular, we  decided to tamp down the e ffect that changes in the 
dollar are assumed to have on domestic spending in the judgmental projection; moreover, we applied the 
smaller sensitivity retroactively to the cumulative rise in the dollar since last summer.

Revisions  to the Staff  Projection  since  the Previous  SEP
The FOMC  most  recently  published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections,  or SEP, 
following  the September  2014 FOMC  meeting.  The table  below  compares  the staff ’s 
current  economic  projection  with  the one we presented  in the September  Tealbook.
We have  revised  our projection  for real GDP growth  over  the next  three  years  slightly  
lower,  on net, since  September;  the dollar ’s stronger  exchange  value  is among  the 
factors  accounting  for this revision.  (Working  in the opposite  direction,  equity  prices  
are higher  than  we expected  in September.)  The unemployment  rate has continued  
to fall more  than  we had projected  and is now  expected  to be lower  at the end of this 
year  than  in the September  Tealbook.  But given  the lower  projected  pace  of GDP  
growth,  the unemployment  rate declines  more  slowly  than  in September,  and by the 
end of the medium-term  projection  it is unrevised  at 4.9 percent,  ¼ percentage  point  
below  our estimate  of the natural  rate. (Although  the unemployment  rate is a bit 
lower  than in the September  projection  through  most  of the medium  term,  our 
projection  for the GDP gap is now  a touch  weaker  than  it was in September.  The 
difference  is that  we have  allowed  for a little more  cyclical  weakness  in the labor  force  
participation  rate. In this environment,  we judge  unemployment  to be understating  
somewhat  the degree  of slack  in the labor  market,  and we view  the GDP gap as 
providing  a more  accurate  assessment  of resource  slack.)
The staff ’s projection  for headline  PCE inflation  has been  revised  lower  in the near  
term,  reflecting  the substantial  further  drop in oil prices  since  September.  However,  
given  our assumption  that  longer-run  inflation  expectations  will remain  well anchored,

these  energy  price  declines  are assumed  to have  only a small  and transitory  effect  on 
core inflation,  and our projection  for core is little revised  (it is just a touch  lower  in 
2015 and 2016  than it was in September).  We project  that headline  inflation  will come 
back  into alignment  with core inflation  after  next  year,  and we continue  to project  
that  inflation  will remain  below  the Committee ’s 2 percent  objective  through  2017.
With  our forecasts  for core inflation  and the GDP gap both  a shade  softer  than  they  
were  in the September  Tealbook,  the projected  path  for the federal  funds  rate is a bit 
lower  than in September;  however,  the date of liftoff  from  the effective  lower  bound 
remains  unchanged  at the second  quarter  of 2015.
Because  FOMC  participants  are now  providing  additional  information  about  their  
expectations  of the economic  conditions  that  will exist  at the time  they  anticipate  it 
will first become  appropriate  to increase  the target  range  for the federal  funds  rate,  
we include  a second  table  providing  quarterly  information  from  the staff  projection.  
In the second  quarter  of 2015,  our projected  quarter  of liftoff,  we now  forecast  the 
unemployment  rate to average  5.4 percent,  and we project  the trailing  four-quarter  
change  in real GDP  to be 2.8 percent. 1 We project  the four-quarter  change  in core PCE 
inflation  to be 1.5 percent  in the second  quarter  of next  year,  but because  of the 
energy  price  declines,  the four-quarter  change  in headline  PCE inflation  is projected  to 
be only 0.5 percent.  (Only  in early  2016 do we project  the recent  energy  price  declines  
to fall out of the four-quarter  change.)

  The unemployment rate is expected to average 5.7 percent in the current quarter, 
slightly lower than anticipated in the Oc tober Tealbook, and it decreases a bit more over 
the medium term than in the previous projection.  The steeper dec line reflects both the 
faster pace of output growth in this forecast and a small downward revision we made to 
our assumption about potential GDP growth over the forecast period.  That revision was intended to correct the string of forecast errors for the unemployment rate we have made 
over the past few years.  We now project the unemployment rate to decline to 5.2 percent 
at the end of next year—equal to our estim ate of its natural rate—and to edge down 
further to 4.9 percent by the end of 2017, 0.3 percentage point below the October 
Tealbook forecast.  (For a different perspe ctive, see the box “Alte rnative View:  The 
Unemployment Rate Falls below 5 Percent in 2015.”)  Thus, as in the September (but not 
October) Tealbook, we now have a small overshooting of full re source utilization.  
The forecast of inflation is little revised from the October other than the near-term 
consequences of the steeper decline in cons umer energy prices.  As a result of that 
decline, we now expect overall  PCE prices to be about uncha nged this quarter and then to 
decline at an annual rate of about ½ percent next quarter.  However, by the middle of next 
year when the recent declines in crude oil prices have been fully passed through to the retail level, we expect overal l PCE price inflation to move back roughly into line with 
core PCE price inflation.  Over the medium term, we continue to expect that in an 
environment of stable long-term inflation expectations, both ove rall and core PCE 
inflation will rise gradually to 1¾ per cent in 2017, aided by tightening resource 
utilization and waning rest raint on import pric es from dollar appreciation.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 As in recent Tealbooks, we assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from 
its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  
 Following liftoff, the federal funds rate is  assumed to rise at a pace determined 
by the prescriptions of an inertial versi on of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.  In 
this projection, the federal funds rate av erages about 3 perc ent in the fourth 
quarter of 2017, around 40 basis points hi gher than was projected in the 
October Tealbook, reflecting the upward revision to the level of resource 
utilization in the me dium-term projection.

Alternative  View: The Unemployment  Rate Falls below  5 Percent  in 2015
In contrast  to the staff ’s baseline  projection  that  the unemployment  rate will decline
½ percentage  point  in 2015,  this discussion  presents  the view  that  it will fall considerably  faster  
and end the year  below  5 percent. 1 Since  mid-2011,  the unemployment  rate has declined  
markedly  faster  than  the staff  anticipated,  even  as GDP has largely  risen  more  slowly  than  we 
had projected  (see  figure).  This combination  of outcomes  suggests  important  changes  in the 
structure  of the economy,  albeit  ones  that  we do not understand  very  well. The perspective  of 
this discussion  is that,  like most  other  forecasters,  the staff  has not adjusted  its projection  
methodology  or underlying  assumptions  sufficiently  to incorporate  potentially  new  labor  
market  behavior.  Consequently,  sizable  forecast  errors  have  resulted  and will likely  persist.
At first blush,  the staff  baseline  projection  looks  quite  reasonable.  Over  the course  of 2015,  we 
project  GDP growth  of 2½ percent,  about  ¾ percentage  point  above  our estimate  of its 
potential  rate, and a decline  in the unemployment  rate of 0.5 percentage  point.  This projection  
is quite  close  to that of the Blue Chip Consensus  forecast.  However,  their  forecasts  have  
suffered  the same  sort of errors  as the staff ’s: Both  forecasts  for the one-year-ahead  
unemployment  rate have  been  too pessimistic  by roughly  ¾ percentage  point  in each  of the 
past  three  years  (see  table).
The staff ’s projection  of the unemployment  rate is informed  by Okun ’s law, the long-run  
historical  relationship  between  the unemployment  rate relative  to its natural  rate and real GDP  
relative  to potential  GDP. However,  while  it is commonly  used,  Okun ’s law suffers  from  several  
weaknesses  as a forecasting  tool. First,  two of the key variables,  potential  GDP and the natural  
rate of unemployment,  are unobserved  yet are thought  to be changing  over  time. Second,  
some  researchers  find that  the Okun ’s law coefficients  have  not been  stable  over  time. 2 Third,

 the GDP data used in the Okun’s law relationship are subject to substantial revision, which 
reduces their usefulness for real-time forecasting.3  Indeed, the staff has tried to address the 
poor quality of the initial GDP da
ta for the first half of 2014 by heavily discounting those data. 
 
Why has Okun’s law performed so poorly  during
 the current expansion ?  One possible reason is 
that the staff may have been reluctant to mark down its assumptions for potential GDP growth 
going forward or to adjust other parameters of the relationship.  Note that the staff’s current 
estimates of potential GDP growth for recent years are lower than we had assumed when we 
were making those projections, although not low enough to completely explain the drop in 
unemployment.  In addition, the staff's assumption of the stability of the Okun’s law 
relationship is unlikely to hold.  This assumption relies on stable cyclical properties for several 
labor market variables , chief among them the participation rate, hours worked per person, and 
productivity.  However, these variables instead appear to have become less cyclical.  For 
example, demographic groups with more cyclical labor force participation, such as teenagers, 
are a smaller share of the labor force now than previously.  Hours worked seems to be different 
this cycle as evidenced by the elevated share of those working part time for economic reasons.  
Finally, productivity has not been as pro-cyclical in the past three business cycles as it was in 
earlier business cycles.  Changes in the behavior of these variables will affect the estimated 
Okun’s law  relationship —in particular, reduced cyclicality on these margins would boost the 
sensitivity of the unemployment rate to 
changes in real GDP .   
Given the staff’s baseline projection o f economic activity, how much faster would the 
unemployment rate f all if recent patterns persist ?  One gauge would be to adjust the Okun 
coefficient and our estimate of potential GDP so that there are no persistent errors in the 
Okun’s law relationship ove r the past four years.  Beginning with an Okun coefficient of 
negative 0.6, such a calibration generates an underlying growth rate of potential output of 
1 percent.4  This relatively low reading on potential growth would incorporate actual damage to 
the ec onomy’s potential as a result of t
he Great Recession as well as measurement error and 
other unidentified structural changes that would otherwise cause persistent Okun’s law errors .  
Applying this alternative specification of Okun’s law to the staff’s projection for real GDP 
growth leads to an unemployment rate of 5¼ percent in the second quarter of 2015 and 
4¾ percent in the fourth quarter.

Adjustment,”  Working Paper Series 2013-32 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, September), 
www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2013-32.pdf. 
3 As documented by Daly and others (2014), during the Great Recession, Okun’s law fits better after the 
data revisions than it does with the initial data.  This is true with earlier recessions as well.  See Mary C. Daly, 
John Fernald, Òscar Jordà, and Fernanda Nechio (2014) , “Interpreting Deviations from Okun’s Law ,” Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter,  2014-12, www.frbsf.org/economic-
research/publications/economic-letter/2014/april/okun-law-deviation-unemployment-recession. 
4 These estimates are also based on the assumption that the natural rate of unemployment has fallen as 
much as the staff has assumed.  The Okun coefficient of negative 0.6 is consistent with the findings of Daly and 
others (2013) for the 40 quarters ending in 2012.  Other combinations of potential and the Okun coefficient are 
also consistent with these data and yield similar drops in the unemployment rate.

   The SOMA portfolio is assumed to rema in at its current size until about two 
quarters after the federal funds rate is  raised above its effective lower bound, 
at which point the portfolio  begins to contract.   
Other Interest Rates 
 Our projection continues to call for a si gnificant rise in the 10-year Treasury 
yield, primarily because of the moveme nt of the valuation window through the 
period of extremely low short-term inte rest rates as well as a gradual waning 
of the effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet policies on term premiums.  This 
yield averages about 25 ba sis points higher over the medium term compared 
with the October Tealbook projection, reflecting the upward revisions to the 
projected federal funds rate.   
 We have marked up our assumptions fo r corporate bond yields slightly, while 
mortgage interest ra tes are little changed. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Since the October Tealbook, equity prices  have risen about 6 percent.  We 
have revised up our forecast of the path  of stock prices in response to the 
recent strength in market prices and the more positive medium-term 
macroeconomic outlook, which more than offset the effect of higher interest 
rates.   
 House price data for September and Oct ober, on net, were in line with our 
October Tealbook forecast.  We have thus maintained our projection that 
house price appreciation will continue  to slow—from around 4 percent this 
year to an average rate of about 3 percent per year from 2015 to 2017. 
Fiscal Policy 
 In this projection, stronger-than-an ticipated incoming data on federal 
purchases as well as a small change in  our policy assumptions action provide 
a slightly larger boost to real GDP growth.3 
                                                 
3 As in previous Tealbooks, we continue to assume  that certain tax breaks to businesses that have 
expired will be extended.  We previously assumed that the extension of these provisions would be partially 
financed by some other tax increases, but we now expect it to add to the deficit.

  Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 The broad nominal index for the dollar ha s appreciated another 4 percent since 
the October Tealbook.  Looking ahead, we expect the dollar to depreciate 
about ½ percent annually in real terms,  as some further appreciation against 
the currencies of the advanced foreign economies is more than offset by 
depreciation against the currencies of  the emerging market economies.  The 
overall pace of decline in the real value of the dollar is a touch slower than in 
the previous Tealbook, reflecting the upward revision to projected U.S. interest rates. 
 We estimate that foreign real GDP growth picked up only a little from its anemic pace in the first half of the year  to an annual rate  of about 2½ percent 
in the second half, somewhat slower th an we projected in October.  We see 
growth abroad stepping up to just ab ove a 3 percent pace over the medium 
term, little changed from our previous projection, as the positive effects of the 
fall in oil prices and the higher value of the dollar are offset by the weaker 
tone of recent data.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen $19 per barrel since the time of the 
October Tealbook, reaching $67 per barrel on December 9.  Although subdued global demand growth likely con tinued to weigh on prices, most of 
the decline occurred after OPEC decided at its November 27 meeting not to 
cut production.  Despite persistent geopo litical risks in Libya and Iraq, far-
dated futures prices also fell sharply to levels not seen since 2009.  Going 
forward, based on prices in the futures ma rket, we project oil prices to move 
higher.  Reflecting some lag in the pass-through of spot oil prices to the price of imported oil, we project the price of imported oil to decline from $84 per 
barrel in the current quarter to $64 per barrel in the sec ond quarter of next 
year.  Thereafter, the price is projected to rise to $70 per barrel by the end of the forecast period.  The downward revisi on to this forecast is about $15 per 
barrel in 2015 and tapers to about $10 per barrel by the end of 2017. 
 Nonfuel commodity prices have decreased  much less than oil prices and are 
projected to remain about flat over the forecast period.

  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
After rising at an annual rate of 4 per cent in the third quarter, real GDP is 
projected to increase at a 2¼ percent average pace in the fourth and first quarters.  
Although growth in consumer spending is expected to pick up noticeably from its third-
quarter pace, both net exports and fede ral government purchases—volatile spending 
categories that were important positive cont ributors to GDP growth  last quarter—are 
projected to drop back in the near term.   
 The recent data for consumer spending have generally been in line with our 
expectations, and thus we continue to project that real PCE growth will step 
up, to an average rate of 3½ percent in the fourth and first quarters from about 
2¼ percent in the third quarter.4  Much of the projected pickup in the fourth 
quarter reflects a sizable rebound in ener gy services spending, which was held 
down in the third quarter by unusually cool summer weather.  The limited available indicators suggest that outlays  for goods, includin g motor vehicles, 
have risen at a solid pace so far this quarter.  More broadly, PCE this quarter and next should be supported by ongoing improvements in the job market, household wealth, and consumer sentiment as well as by the boost to real 
incomes from the drop in energy prices.  
 We have modestly downgraded our fo recast for housing construction once 
again through the near term.  Although single-family housing starts rose in 
October, permits—which provide a better signal about the tr ajectory for home 
building—were about unchanged and have been essentially flat since June.  
 The growth rate of real equipment a nd tangibles was booste d significantly in 
the third quarter by a transitory jump in  spending on transportation equipment.  
Excluding transportation spending, real E&I rose at an annual rate of about 5 percent in that quarter and is projected to increase at about this rate, on 
average, in the fourth and first quarters. 
 We expect net exports to subtract ¾ pe rcentage point from real GDP growth 
in the fourth quarter of 2014—compared with a roughly neutral projection in 
                                                 
4After the December Tealbook projection was closed, the Census Bureau released the Quarterly 
Services Survey, or QSS, for the third quarter.  The retail sales for November will be released on 
December 11.

  the October Tealbook—after adding about the same amount to growth in the 
third quarter.  The deterioration in ne t exports in the curr ent quarter largely 
reflects an upward revision to our forecas t for imports:  Recent data point to a 
smaller decline in real oil imports than we had previously projected, while the 
higher value of the dollar is expected to boost non- oil imports and restrain 
exports a bit in the near term.   
 The physical product and production worker  hours data for November suggest 
manufacturing output rose briskly last month.  In addition, the national and regional manufacturing surveys are upbeat , and automakers have boosted their 
near-term production schedules.  All tol d, we now expect manufacturing IP to 
increase at an average pace of about 4 percent over the fourth and first 
quarters, 1½ percentage points more  than in the October Tealbook.   
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As in previous Tealbooks, we anticipate that output gr owth over the next two 
years will significantly exceed its poten tial rate, supported by a still-accommodative 
stance of monetary policy.  The gains in a ggregate demand drive improvements in labor 
market conditions, business sales, and consumer  and business confidence, all of which, in 
turn, should provide additional support to sp ending growth.  As the normalization of 
monetary policy proceeds, we expect real  GDP growth will eventually slow to 
2¼ percent in 2017.  Our forecast for output grow th over the next three years is slightly 
faster than in the October Tealbook, with th e projected level of real GDP at the end 
of 2017 about ½ percent higher than  in our previous forecast. 
 Relative to the October Tealbook, we expect  output growth in this projection 
to be boosted by the higher equity prices , slightly more e xpansionary fiscal 
policy, and lower oil prices.  In contrast, the higher path for the dollar in this 
projection is expected to  hold down GDP growth th rough 2017 relative to the 
prior Tealbook. 
 In addition, we have reassessed the extent  to which changes to our forecast for 
the real exchange value of the dollar show through to our projection for U.S. 
GDP growth.  Broadly speaking, we now think that GDP will be affected a 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Page 13 of 88
Authorized for Public Release
   
  little less by changes in the exchange ra te than we had assumed in previous 
Tealbooks.5   
 We also made a small adjustment to our supply-side assumptions in this 
projection.  In particular, we revise d down our assumptions for structural 
productivity and potential output growth in 2016 and 2017, reducing the 
projected acceleration in potenti al GDP through the medium term.6  Taking 
into account the revisions to both actual GDP and its potential, GDP stands 
¾ percent above its poten tial level in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared 
with no output gap at that tim e in the October Tealbook.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The two employment reports that have been published since the October FOMC 
meeting, as well as the other indicators th at have become available, show more 
improvement in labor market conditions than we had expected.  
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 321,000 in November.  This reading, combined with upward revisions to the estimates in previous months , put the level of 
total payrolls about 150,000 higher in N ovember than we had anticipated in 
the previous Tealbook.  In response, we ra ised our forecast for payroll gains to 
245,000 in December and to 210,000 per month in the first quarter—about 50,000 more per month than we had previously projected.  
 The unemployment rate was 5.8 perc ent in November, unchanged from 
October but down about ½ percentage poi nt from six months earlier.  We 
expect the unemployment rate to edge  down to 5.7 percent in December and 
                                                 
 5 Our new assumptions about the sensitivity of U.S. real GDP to changes in the exchange rate 
better reflect the view that a rise in the dollar will te nd to boost domestic spending by lowering consumer 
prices, thus providing some offset to declines in the trade balance.  Empirical estimates of the sensitivity of 
U.S. real GDP to the dollar vary fairly widely; the sensitivity that we have now built into the judgmental projection bring us into closer alignment with simulations from staff models.  With our new assumptions, 
we now estimate that the cumulative roughly 7¼ percent upward revision to the path broad real exchange 
rate since the July Tealbook has reduced our forecast for the level of real GDP at the end of the medium term by about 1 percent; had we not made this change, the effect would have been roughly 1½ percent.   
6 We also revised up our assumption for the trend labor force participation rate beginning in 2013 
to bring it closer to the center of the range of tren d estimates presented in the recent paper, “Labor Force 
Participation:  Recent Developments  and Future Prospects,” by Stepha nie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce 
Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher that will be published in the Fall 2014 edition of the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity .

  then to average 5.5 percent in the first quarter; these figures are 0.1 percentage 
point and 0.2 percentage point, respectiv ely, below our previous forecast.   
 The labor force participation rate held  steady in November at 62.8 percent, 
0.1 percentage point above our proj ection in the October Tealbook.  The 
participation rate has been unchanged, on net, since the spring, which, relative 
to its declining trend, is consistent with a modest cyclical improvement.  
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, which summarizes the movements 
in 19 labor market indicato rs, continued to improve in October and November 
but at a slower pace than  earlier this year.  
Relative to the October Tealbook, we ha ve marked up the expected pace of 
improvement in labor market conditions through the medium term.  This upgrading 
reflects the additional momentum indicated by the two most recent labor market reports 
and the more positive outlook for the GDP gap in  this projection, as well as an effort to 
better balance the risks around our unemployment rate forecast in light of the faster-than-
projected declines registered over the past few years.   
 We now expect monthly job gain s to average about 220,000 in 2015 and 
230,000 in 2016 before slowing to around 150,000 in 2017.  These gains are considerably faster than we had proj ected in October:  We marked up 2015 
and 2016 by an average of approximately 55,000 per month and 2017 by 
about 20,000 per month. 
 We project the unemployment rate to reach 5.2 percent (our estimate of the 
natural rate) in the four th quarter of next year and to move down to 
4.9 percent at the end of 2017, 0.3 percentage point lower than in the October Tealbook.   
 At present, we believe that the unempl oyment rate gap und erstates the amount 
of slack remaining in the economy, refl ecting an unusually weak recovery in 
the labor force participati on rate and, we think, an unusually elevated level of 
involuntary part-time employment.  (A lso see the box, “Indi cators of Labor 
Shortages.”)  As the economy improves, we expect that wage gains will pick 
up and that more of the i ndividuals not in the labor force will be drawn in.  
This effect will accelerate the cyclical re covery in the participation rate while

 Indicators of Labor Shortages  
Anecdotal reports of labor shortages, especially for skilled labor, are widespread.  For example, 
recent Beige Books have frequently noted the difficulties firms face in finding qualified workers 
for certain positions, particularly in construction, manufacturing, and energy-related industries.  
In a recent inquiry conducted by the Federal Reserve Banks about staffing plans among their 
business contacts , 41 percent of respondents reported that an inability to find workers with the 
required skills restrained their hiring.1  Similarly, the ISM Semiannual Economic Forecast from 
December 9 reported that a lack of qualified applica
nts impinged on hiring plans for 29 percent of 
manufacturers and 19 percent of nonmanufacturers.   A survey from the National Association of 
Home Builders during the past summer suggest ed that skilled labor shortages were particularly 
acute for construction —46 percent of respondents reported a labor shortage, up from 
34 percent in 2013 and 21 percent in 2012.2  Anecdotes also suggest widespread shortages of truck 
drivers and of workers with skills crucial for the ex
pansion of the nation’s oil and gas 
infrastructure.    
In a dynamic economy, some industries will always grow faster than others, creating temporary 
shortages of specific skills.  Such shortages are more likely to arise as the economy improves, and 
a key question is whether the reported degree of labor shortages suggests more or less slack 
than is indicated by other labor market and product market indicators.  We therefore turn to data 
sources that allow us to compare the current labor supply situation with previous business cycles.  
 
One way to explore the extent of labor shortages is through the use of wage data.  At the 
aggregate level, some measures of wages have shown modest acceleration, but wage gains 
remain tepid .  At a more detailed level, if certain industries are facing shortages of skilled labor, 
market pressures should lead to larger wage gains for workers in those industries.  However, the 
distribution of wage increases suggests that shortages are not especially acute at the moment .  
                                                 
1 This share of respondents is considerably higher than the 30 percent who reported skills shortages as a 
restraint on hiring in a January 2014 survey, which, in turn, was double the share in the survey three years earlier. 
2 In addition, the Associat ed General Contractors of America reported in their 2014 National Workforce 
Survey (published October 22) that “the construction industry is likely to face significant, and growing, worker 
shortages, as demand for construction continues to rebound. ”  The Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank reported in 
their Real Estate Survey for October 2014 that two-thirds of builders were experiencing a labor shortage.

 As shown by the top red line in figure 1, at the 90 th percentile of the distribution of wage 
changes, wage growth is still below where it was, on average, during the second half of each of 
the two previous business cycles.  
The monthly survey conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business provides 
another historical perspective.  One of the possible responses to the survey’s query about “the 
most important business problem” affecting small business is “quality of labor” ( figure 2 ).  This 
response is often interpreted by analysts as beari
ng on the issue of labor shortages.   The share of 
small businesses choosing this response has moved up 
since the recession, but even so, it 
remains near where it was around the midpoint of each of the preceding two business cycles and 
is in line with what the unemployment rate, based on a simple regression, would suggest (the red 
line in the figure). 
For manufacturing, the Census Bureau’s Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization asks those 
respondents who report producing at less than full capacity the ir reasons for doing so.  One 
possible answer is “insufficient supply of local labor force/skills ,” which was cited by more than 
20 percent of survey respondents in the late 1990s (the black line in figure 3).  This share 
plummeted to less than 2 percent during the recession but moved up to 9½ percent in the third 
quarter of 2014, its highest level since the beginning of the recession but a bit below its historical 
average.  The recent shares are broadly consistent with a regression-based prediction using the 
unemployment rate and manufacturing capacity utilization (the blue line in the figure ).3  To be 
sure, some individual industries are reporting elevated shares; for example, in recent quarters 
roughly 20 percent of respondents in the construction-related wood products industry reported 
skills shortages, the highest level since 1999. 
Despite the anecdotes, a variety of evidence suggests that skill shortages are not especially 
widespread, nor has there been a significant acceleration in wages, either in general or at the top 
percentiles of industry wage changes.  Moreover, where lengthy time-series data are available, 
the extent to which labor shortages are restraining hiring and production is about what one 
would expect given the unemployment rate and capacity utilization.

capacity has been “Insufficient orders ,” the red line in figure 3.

  attenuating the decline in the unemployment rate.  As a result, we expect that 
the unemployment rate will only edge down during 2016 and 2017, even as GDP continues to increase faster than its potential. 
 Given our view that the pa rticipation rate is unusua lly cyclically weak, our 
estimate of the output gap is wider than one would infer based on the 
unemployment rate gap alone.  Indeed, we expect the discrepancy to widen a little more over the next few quarters.  Beginning later next year, however, we 
think the process of labor market repair will feed  into the behavior of labor 
force participation more thoroughly, eventually eliminating the unusual 
cyclical weakness.  Until that process is complete, we consider the output gap, 
rather than the unemployment rate gap, to provide a more accurate assessment of resource slack. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Our near-term projection for PCE price inflation continues to be heavily 
influenced by the recent precipitous drop in energy prices.  We now have the overall PCE 
price index showing little change  in the current quarter and then declining at an annual 
rate of ½ percent in the first quarter.  Starting in the s econd quarter of 2015, we expect 
overall PCE inflation to be much  closer to core inflation and to follow a trajectory that is 
little changed from the October Tealbook.  We c ontinue to expect that headline and core 
PCE price inflation will move up to 1¾ percent by 2017, reflecti ng the tightening in 
resource utilization as well as a resumption of modest increases in  core import prices 
following a period of persistent declines.  Of course, as we discuss in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section, a wide  confidence interval surr ounds this point forecast. 
 Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in October, a little faster than we had 
expected.  The surprise was concentrated  in volatile categories, in particular 
the non-market-based component of the index.  Thus, although we have marked up our projection for core PCE inflation in the current quarter to 
1½ percent from 1¼ percent in the Oct ober Tealbook to reflect the incoming 
data, we left our first-quarter project ion for core inflation unrevised at 
1½ percent.   
 Given the usual lags between changes in oil prices and adjustments at the 
retail level, we have left  our current-quarter projection for consumer energy 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
December 10, 2014
Page 18 of 88

  prices largely unchanged but made a la rge downward revision to our first-
quarter projection; we now expect that consumer energy prices will fall at an 
average annual rate of around 30 percent in both quarters.  With the pass-
through from crude to retail prices complete, consumer energy prices are 
expected to rise gradually thereafter. 
 We expect consumer food price inflat ion to moderate through the near term 
from its faster pace in the middle of th is year and then to eventually move 
back in line with core infl ation over the medium term.   
 After only edging up in the third quarter, core import prices are expected to 
fall at a 1½ percent pace in the fourth  quarter and a 2¾ percent pace in the 
first quarter of next year , largely reflecting the recent appreciation of the 
dollar.  Core import price inflation is then expected to move up to a 
1¼ percent pace in 2016 and thereafter, consistent with modest foreign inflation and a roughly flat project ed path for the nominal dollar. 
 We expect core PCE price inflation to edge up from 1½ percent in 2015 to 
1¾ percent in 2017 as resource slack diminishes further and core import 
prices turn up in an environment of an chored long-run inflation expectations.  
The core inflation projection is unch anged from the October Tealbook, as the 
pass-through of lower core import and energy prices about offsets the effects 
of tighter labor and produc t markets.  We have noted  the recent low readings 
on inflation compensation from TIPS and the recent downtick in long-run 
inflation expectations as measured in the Michigan survey, but we have not 
built any response into our baseline projection.
7  One of the scenarios in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section explores the possibility that we are wrong in 
that assessment. 
 The several indicators of compensation that have become available since the 
October Tealbook convey mixed messages.  For the second and third quarters, 
the ECI increased at an average annual  rate of about 3 percent—noticeably 
                                                 
7 Historically, long-term household expectations ha ve been somewhat sensitive to large moves in 
energy prices, but we expect this eff ect to be transitory.  Staff models attribute recent declines in longer-
term measures of inflation compensation from TIPS primarily to declines in term and liquidity premiums 
rather than declines in expected inflation, while some financial market participants have tended to put more 
weight on expected inflation.

  faster than its average pace during the past three years.  However, the BLS 
now reports that hourly compensation in the business sector increased at an 
annual rate of only ½ percent in the third quarter after having dropped at a 
1 percent rate in the second quarter.  Looking through the noisy quarterly 
readings, hourly compensation rose 2 percent during the four quarters ended 
in the third quarter, unchanged from the rate over the comparable period four 
quarters earlier.  Finally, average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent in 
November, but the increase in this meas ure over the past 12 months was just 
2 percent, little different from a year ago.  
COMPARING THE STAFF PROJECTION WITH THE BLUE CHIP   
Over 2015, the staff’s forecast of real GDP gr owth (2.6 percent) is somewhat below the 
Blue Chip consensus outlook (2.9 percent).  Nonetheless, the staff’s unemployment rate 
forecast lies just below the Blue Chip Consensu s.  One interpretation of this juxtaposition 
is that our assumption about the potential GDP growth rate may be more pessimistic than 
the one implicitly embedded in the Blue Ch ip.  In addition, the staff’s projection for 
consumer price inflation lies below the cons ensus of the Blue Chip panelists.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 Beyond 2017, the federal funds rate conti nues to be set according to the 
prescriptions of an inertial version of th e Taylor (1999) rule.  This policy rule 
assumes a long-run equilibrium level of  the nominal federal funds rate of 
3¾ percent.   
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is completed by 
2021. 
 The federal budget deficit conti nues to widen beyond 2017, primarily 
reflecting fast-rising tran sfer payments for retirement and health-care 
programs.  The ratio of federal debt to GDP is around 73 percent in 2018 and 
rises thereafter.  
 The real foreign exchange value of the dollar moves down about ½ percent 
per year, on average, over the 2018–20 period.  The price of crude oil is

  constant in real terms.  Foreign real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 
3 percent from 2018 to 2020. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is  5¼ percent.  Potential GDP rises 
2 percent per year on av erage in the 2018–20 period.  
 As monetary accommodation is wit hdrawn, real GDP growth slows to 
1¾ percent in 2018 and then continues to run for a while at a pace just below 
the assumed growth rate of potential output.  The unemployment rate stays flat at just under 5 percent in 2018 be fore gradually edging up toward its 
natural rate.  
 PCE price inflation remains below the longer-run objective of the Committee 
at the end of 2017.  With the unemploym ent rate below the natural rate, long-
run inflation expectations and PCE pri ce inflation gradually move up to the 
Committee’s 2 percent target.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Economic activity abroad appears to have improved little from its anemic pace in 
the first half of the year.  Foreign real GDP grew 2¼ percent at an annual rate in the third 
quarter, ½ percentage point lower than we had estimated in October, owing largely to 
unexpected weakness in Japan and Mexico.  Indicators for the current quarter suggest that 
foreign growth will remain subdued, around 2½ percent.       
We see foreign growth picking up to a pace of 3 percent next year and a little 
more thereafter.  Much of this acceleration reflects a projected recovery of growth in the 
euro area, Japan, and South America, regions that recently went into recession or are 
treading near recession.  Going forward, foreign economies should benefit from the 
depreciation of their currencies and the decline in oil prices.  (See the box “The Global 
Macroeconomic Effects of the Recent Decline in Oil Prices.”)  Growth in the advanced 
foreign economies (AFEs) will also be supported by accommodative monetary policies 
and diminishing fiscal drag.  The pickup in AFEs, in turn, should boost exports in the 
emerging market economies (EMEs) and contribute to a return to near-trend growth there 
as well.  On balance, our medium-term outlook is little changed from the October 
Tealbook:  The boost to our outlook from the lower path of oil prices, weaker currencies, 
and stronger U.S. growth is largely offset by the weaker momentum we are seeing in 
some key foreign economies.   
Nevertheless, our foreign growth forecast is down from earlier this year, and we 
continue to see downside risks to our outlook.  In particular, the global economy remains 
vulnerable to a derailing of the recovery in the euro area or a sharp deceleration in China.  
In the Risks and Uncertainty section, we explore the implications for the U.S. economy 
of a pronounced weakening of foreign activity that puts further upward pressure on the 
dollar.  However, there are some upside risks to global growth as well.  Most 
prominently, supply developments could push oil prices even lower, contrary to our 
expectation for a moderate recovery in prices (based on futures quotes). 
Despite some upward pressure on prices from weaker currencies, inflation in the 
AFEs continues to be restrained by falling energy prices and still-sizable resource slack.  
As the effect of the latter factors fades and as accommodative monetary policies continue 
to provide support, we expect inflation to rise from an estimated 0 percent in the fourth

 The Global Macroeconomic Effects of the Recent Decline in Oil Prices 
Since late June, the price of crude oil has fallen sharply, with the spot price of Brent (the black line 
in figure 1) dropping about 40 percent and the price of the December 2017 futures contract (the 
red line) declining almost 20 percent.  Much of the decline is likely due to favorable supply 
factors, including the rapid growth of U.S. oil production.   A substantial portion, however, is a 
reaction to a downgrade in expectation
s for global growth since June, which complicates the 
assessment of the macroeconomic effects of the lower prices.  In this discussion, we review the 
channels through which lower oil prices affect global growth and inflation, and then we present 
some rules of thumb used to assess the macroeconomic effects of oil price shocks derived from 
staff models. 
One important channel through which a decline in oil prices affects the global economy is the 
transfer of wealth from oil producers to oil consumers.  As shown in figure 2, the largest net oil 
importers and, thus, the prime beneficiaries of lower oil prices are the emerging Asian economies, 
the euro area, and, despite recent sharp increases in oil production, the United States.1  Losses 
are concentrated in the oil-producing countries in the Middle East, Russia, and Venezuela.  (For 
Russia and Venezuela, lower oil prices have also worsened their fiscal situation and destabilized 
their financial markets.)  Globally, the wealth transfer nets to zero, but the overall effect on 
global economic activity is likely to be positive in the near term; oil consumers tend to spend a 
substantial portion of the windfall, while oil producers generally absorb at least some of the initial 
effect through reduced saving or higher borrowing.2   
The stimulus from this wealth transfer is likely to be somewhat offset by reduced investment in 
the oil sector.  This channel is particu
larly relevant for the United States, where investment 
decisions are more market driven than in many countries.   So far, however, current and projected 
U.S. oil production has yet to decl
ine appreciably, although this could primarily reflect lags in the 
adjustment process .  Moreover, the U.S. oil industry could well respond to lower prices by 
accelerating the deployment of cost-saving technology, similar to what occurred in U.S. natural 
gas production after the “fracking” boom triggered the collapse in domestic natural gas prices.   
Re
gardless, even if investment by the U.S. oil industry were to shrink , the direct effect on U.S. 
GDP of a decline would be small because the share of this investment in output —though rising in 
recent years —is only about 1 percent
 of GDP .   
The decline in oil prices may also affect
 economic activity by influencing monetary policy , 
including through its effects on inflation.   Both in the United States and abroad, the fall in prices 
leads to large but transitory decl
ines in headline inflation with only minimal pass-through to core 
inflation.  In principle, if lower oil prices induce only transitory declines in inflation while tending 
to push up output, they should engender a slight tightening of monetary policy.  In the current 
situation, however, lower inflation may instead lead to further monetary accommodation in a 
                                                
1 Although many economies have oil producers as well as oil consumers, and thus some domestic losses as 
well as gains, net exports of oil by country provides a useful proxy for the global distribution of gains and losses 
following a price change.   
2 Another channel through which lower oil prices benefit all economies is by lowering the cost of a factor of 
production, equivalent to a positive productivity shock.

number  of economies,  including  the euro  area  and  Japan,  where  inflation  expectations  may  be at 
risk  of further  declines.  Of course,  if inflation  expectations  do decline,  such  an occurrence  could  
effectively  tighten  monetary  policy  at the zero  lower  bound  and  hinder  the economic  recovery.
While  there  is a general  consensus  that  lower  oil prices  should  boost  U.S.  and  global  growth,  
considerable  uncertainty  exists  over  the ultimate  size  of the effect,  in part  because  it is difficult  to 
distinguish  instances  where  changes  in oil prices  were  due  to changes  in supply  from  those  where  
they  reflected  changes  in demand  associated  with  shifts  in economic  growth.  Different  
approaches  have  yielded  a wide  range  of empirical  estimates.  For the United  States,  the FRB/US  
model  suggests  that  a persistent  10 percent  decrease  in the price  of oil from  current  levels  will 
boost  GDP  by about  0.1 percent,  within  the range  of outside  estimates.  The  staff's  SIGMA  model  
suggests  a somewhat  larger  effect,  with  U.S.  and  global  GDP  boosted  about  0.2 percent  in the 
year  following  a persistent  10 percent  decline  in oil prices.  Regardless  of the model,  the recent  
rapid  increase  in domestic  oil production  has  likely  reduced  the positive  net effect  of lower  oil 
prices  on the U.S.  economy  somewhat,  compared  with  if production  had  not increased.
All else  being  equal,  the recent  decline  in oil prices  has  bolstered  our outlook  for global  activity,  
although  the effect  would  likely  have  been  more  significant  if the fall in prices  was  not,  at least  in 
part,  due  to a weaker  outlook  for global  demand. 3 All told,  we project  that  the roughly  
20 percent  decline  in long-run  oil prices  since  the June  Tealbook  will  contribute  approximately   
¼ percent  to the level of both U.S. and foreign  GDP over  the next  year,  as the positive  effect  on 
consumption  more  than offsets  the negative  effect  on oil investment  and demand  in 
oil-exporting  economies.  Of course,  on net, since  the June  Tealbook,  the positive  impetus  from  
lower  oil prices  has not been  enough  to offset  other  factors  that  have  led us to revise  down  our 
outlook  for both U.S. and foreign  growth  over  the period.

3 We believe  that  a majority  of the decline  in prices  since  June  is due  to more  abundant  supply,  including  
OPEC's  decision  at its November  27 meeting  to not cut production.  However,  weaker-than-expected  global  oil 
demand,  particularly  in China  and  the euro  area,  also  contributed  to the decline.

  quarter to 1¾ percent by end-2016.  With inflation and growth both low, the Bank of 
Japan (BOJ) increased the pace of its asset purchases, and we are expecting the European 
Central Bank (ECB) to expand its asset purchases next year.  While the recent declines in 
oil prices are generally a positive for economic growth, they also carry the risk of 
depressing medium-term inflation expectations, particularly in the euro area and Japan.  
Accordingly, we see lower oil prices as contributing to more accommodative policies 
abroad.  
In the EMEs, inflation is holding steady at 3 percent, only a little below its longer-
term trend.  Because of the prevalence of administered prices in the energy sector, not all 
of the declines in oil prices have been passed through to consumers; there have also been 
upward pressures from idiosyncratic shocks in several of these economies.  In some 
EMEs, high inflation remains a concern.  Notably, the central bank of Brazil raised its 
policy rate further in a move that was bigger than expected.    
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro area.   Real GDP expanded a meager 0.6 percent in the third quarter; 
private consumption accelerated, but export growth slowed and investment 
spending declined.  Recent indicators have been lackluster:  Consumption data 
were mixed in October, and November PMIs moved lower while staying in 
expansionary territory.  We see GDP growth remaining near ¾ percent in the 
current quarter before increasing to 1½ percent in 2015 and 2 percent 
thereafter, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing financial and 
credit conditions, and low oil prices.  
Twelve-month headline inflation inched down to 0.3 percent in November as 
retail energy prices plunged, while core inflation stayed subdued at 
0.7 percent.  Recent declines in oil prices are expected to depress quarterly 
headline inflation to an annual rate of negative ½ percent in the current quarter 
and 0  percent next quarter.  Thereafter, as energy prices increase and the 
output gap narrows, inflation should move up to a still-subdued 1½ percent 
rate by mid-2016.  No new policy actions were introduced by the ECB, but 
given the weak outlook for growth and inflation, we expect the ECB early 
next year to expand its purchases beyond the asset-backed securities and 
covered bonds it is already buying; potential candidates for future purchases 
include corporate and even sovereign bonds.

   United Kingdom.   Real GDP growth slowed to a still-solid 2.8 percent in the 
third quarter from the nearly 3½ percent pace recorded in the first half of the 
year.  The third-quarter expansion was driven by strong domestic demand.  
Recent data, including softer PMI readings and some decline in business 
confidence, point to a slight step-down in economic growth to 2½ percent this 
quarter.  As the output gap closes, we have growth moderating further to 
2¼ percent by 2017.  
The declines in energy prices have pushed inflation down to an estimated 
¼ percent in the current quarter.  We expect inflation to increase to 2 percent 
by 2017, however, as energy prices start rising again and economic slack 
diminishes.  In response to a more dovish tone in its Inflation Report, we now 
anticipate that the Bank of England will begin raising its policy rate in the 
third quarter of 2015, one quarter later than previously expected.   
 Japan.   Real GDP unexpectedly contracted 1.9 percent in the third quarter, 
following a tax hike –induced plunge in the second quarter.  Although export 
growth was solid, the pickup in final domestic demand was disappointingly 
modest and inventory investment fell sharply.  With the economy in recession, 
Prime Minister Abe delayed a second consumption tax hike —originally 
planned for October 2015 —to April 2017 and called for parliamentary 
elections on December 14.  In addition, the BOJ expanded its asset purchase 
program.  These policy actions prompted a large depreciation of the yen and a 
surge in equity prices, both of which should support economic activity.  
Indeed, solid export and industrial production data through October point to 
growth of 1¾ percent in the current quarter.  The recovery should continue in 
2015 and 2016 before stalling in 2017 as fiscal consolidation resumes.   
We project that inflation will decline from 1.8 percent in the third quarter to 
negative 1 percent in the current quarter because of falling food and energy 
prices.  Core prices have continued to increase, however, and we expect 
headline inflation to bounce back to 1 percent next year, reflecting in part 
some pass- through of the recent sizable depreciation of the yen.  The BOJ’s 
aggressive expansion of its asset purchases came sooner than we expected and 
prompted us to assume that these purchases will persist through 2016, a year 
longer than we assumed in October.  Accordingly, we marked up a bit our

  medium-term outlook for inflation and now project inflation to rise to 
1½ percent by 2017.  
 Canada.   Real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the third quarter, 
driven by strong exports and firm private domestic demand.  Although there 
was an unexpected decline in employment in November, robust 
manufacturing PMIs through November point to ongoing momentum.  
Accordingly, we expect that GDP will expand at a solid 2½ percent pace in 
the current quarter and over the next two years.  This forecast is little changed, 
on net, as the boost from higher U.S. demand is offset by reduced investment 
in oil extraction. 
We estimate that inflation remained low in the current quarter at 1¼ percent, 
restrained by falling energy prices.  Core prices, however, have posted rapid 
gains in recent months.  We expect inflation to rise to the Bank of Canada’s 
2 percent target by 2017 as output edges above its potential level.  With the 
outlook for growth and inflation little changed, we continue to project that the 
bank’s first rate hike will occur in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
EMERGING M ARKET ECO NOMIES  
 Chin
a.  Recent indicators suggest that growth in the current quarter has 
slowed to 7¼ percent from 7¾ percent in the middle of the year.  Industrial 
production and PMI data point to a deceleration of manufacturing activity, and 
the downturn in the property market continues to weigh on investment.  In 
addition, export growth has slowed from its rapid pace during the past few 
quarters.  We expect the boost from external demand to wane further but 
domestic demand to strengthen as authorities add policy stimulus.  The 
People’s Bank of China (PBOC) injected substantial liquidity into large - and 
medium- sized banks in September and October and cut banks’ benchmark 
lending and deposit rates in late November.  Although these measures have 
eased the monetary policy stance somewhat, we believe the PBOC does not 
intend to generate another sharp surge in credit as in 2009 and in 2013.  We 
continue to see GDP growth edging down to 7 percent by 2017.  Continued 
sharp declines in property prices and weak credit growth in October, however, 
suggest that risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside.

  We expect inflation to dip below 2 percent at an annual rate in the current 
quarter, restrained by a deceleration in food prices and the recent decline in 
energy prices.  As these factors subside, inflation should pick up to 2½ percent 
by the middle of next year and to 3 percent by 2016.      
 Other Emerging Asia.   In emerging Asia excluding China, real GDP 
expanded at an annual pace of 3.9 percent in the third quarter.  Recent 
indicators, such as exports and PMIs, suggest that growth will step down a bit 
to 3½ percent this quarter.  In particular, a combination of soft external 
demand and one-off factors—such as street protests in Hong Kong and 
reductions of fuel subsidies in Indonesia and Malaysia —are weighing on 
activity.  We see growth in the region recovering to 4½ percent in 2015, 
supported by lower oil prices and improvements in external demand.  
Inflation, after moderating in the third quarter to an annual rate of 2 percent, is 
estimated to have picked up to 2½ percent in the fourth quarter.  Although in 
several economies inflation remains low due to falling energy prices, country-
specific factors, such as the reductions in fuel subsidies and expiration of 
housing subsidies in Hong Kong, have driven it substantially up in a few 
cases.  Over the medium term, consistent with central bank targets, we 
anticipate that inflation will settle at 3½ percent. 
 Latin America.  Real GDP growth in Mexico  dropped to 2 percent in the third 
quarter, well below our October Tealbook estimate.  This result is also 
somewhat at variance with relatively strong third-quarter monthly indicators.  
We believe this divergence is unlikely to persist and, with upbeat readings 
from PMIs, consumer confidence, and motor vehicle production and exports 
in the current quarter, we expect growth to step up to 3¼ percent.  Growth 
should then move up a bit further, to 3½ percent by mid-2015, supported by 
U.S. manufacturing activity and the positive effects of recently enacted 
economic reforms.  A spike in food prices pushed up inflation to an annual 
rate of 4½ percent last quarter.  As this effect fades, we expect inflation to 
moderate to 4 percent in the current quarter and to 3¼ percent next year.   
After a recession in the first half of the year, Brazil ’s economy grew only 
0.3 percent in the third quarter.  Recent indicators, including exports and 
industrial production, have been weak, and consumer and business confidence

  remain depressed.  Accordingly, we see GDP growth picking up only slightly 
to 1 percent in the current quarter, about ½ percentage point lower than our 
October projection.  We expect that Brazilian activity will remain subdued, 
increasing to a pace of only 2 percent by 2016, restrained by lower commodity 
prices and tighter macroeconomic policies.  Brazil’s new finance m inister, 
Joaquim Levy, pledged to tighten fiscal policy to stabilize the public debt- to-
GDP ratio.  In addition, the central bank recently raised the policy rate again, 
by a greater-than-expected 50 basis points.  These measures are meant to 
rebuild policy credibility, but while any favorable effects of improved 
business confidence pose upside risks to the outlook, such effects will 
probably show up only slowly over time.  Brazil’s inflation rate remains near 
the 6½ percent upper limit of the central bank’s  target range, and we estimate 
only a moderate step-down to 5½ percent over the forecast period.    
 Russia and Venezuela.  The Russian  economy is reeling from the twin blows 
of sanctions imposed in response to its aggression against Ukraine and the 
sharp decline in oil prices.  Private consumption and investment have plunged, 
and the country’s financial markets are in distress.  Russian authorities have 
hiked interest rates 400 basis points this year and have been intervening —to 
varying degrees over the past few months —in foreign exchange markets to 
support the currency.  However, these actions have not prevented a sharp 
depreciation of the ruble, which has fallen 65 percent this year.  We project 
the Russian economy to remain mired in recession next year, with only a weak 
recovery thereafter.     
Similarly, the sharp fall in oil prices has plunged the economy of Venezuela  
into further disarray.  Oil accounts for more than 95 percent of the country’s 
exports and a large portion of its fiscal revenues.  Venezuela’s economy had 
already been suffering from the effects of years of economic mismanagement, 
evidenced by very high inflation (over 60 percent), widespread shortages of 
goods, and substantial capital flight.  Amid these economic woes and soaring 
credit risk spreads on sovereign external debt (to over 4,100 basis points), the 
government is facing growing pressures to undertake macroeconomic policy 
adjustments.  Prospects for the economy remain dim.

Financial Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, market participants became a bit more optimistic 
about U.S. economic prospects, and the expect ed path for policy implied by asset prices 
moved higher.  Meanwhile, amid ongoing signs  of economic weakness abroad, investors 
were heartened by foreign central bank acti ons and communications  that were more 
accommodative than expected.  A sharp dec line in oil prices weighed on inflation 
compensation and left a mixed imprint on other asset markets.    
 The path for the federal funds rate im plied by OIS quotes rose as much as 
25 basis points, and yields on nominal Tr easury securities increased at two- 
and five-year maturities.  However, po licy expectations of the respondents to 
the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants 
changed little.   
 Measures of inflation compensation m oved down further over the period and 
contributed to declines in longer-dated nominal Treasury yields.  Most survey-
based measures of long-term inflation expectations were little changed.  
 The S&P 500 equity price index rose about  4 percent, with notable increases 
following some key foreign central bank announcements.  
 Reflecting the divergent trends in m onetary policy here and abroad, the 
nominal broad index of the dollar appreciated about 4 percent.   
 Business financing resumed its robust pace after a brief lull in mid-October.  
Household financing conditions were littl e changed, with mort gage credit still 
tight for many borrowers but consumer  credit more broadly available. 
 Tests of the Federal Reserve’s supplem entary tools, including term RRPs, 
ON RRPs, and the Term Deposit Facility (T DF), shed light on how these tools 
might affect market dynamics during monetary policy normalization.    
TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS

  U.S. economic recovery continues to gain momentum, and that monetary policy 
normalization remains on track.  In add ition, the October FOMC statement was 
reportedly seen as suggesting a slightly tighter monetary policy path.  Market participants 
highlighted the Committee’s characterization in the statement of an improving labor market and pointed to the passages on th e inflation outlook, which were viewed as 
downplaying somewhat the declin es in realized inflation a nd market-based measures of 
inflation compensation.  Investors also reportedly took note of the new language 
emphasizing the data dependency of the timi ng of liftoff.  Other FOMC communications 
appeared to have little effect  on policy expectations.     
In the Desk surveys of dealers and mark et participants, a majority of dealer 
respondents indicated that they expect the “considerable time” language to be removed in 
the December FOMC statement, and a majority of respondents to both surveys anticipated that the December FOMC co mmunications—including the postmeeting 
statement, the SEP information, and the press conference—will be interpreted by 
investors as less accommodative than curren tly expected.  However, a majority of 
respondents to both surveys also  continued to view the June 2015 meeting as the most 
likely date of liftoff, and expectations for the pace of tightening following liftoff were 
generally little changed since the October survey.  
On net, the expected path of the federa l funds rate based on a straight read of 
financial market quotes moved up, and two- and five-year Treasury yields increased 
19 basis points and 9 basis points, respectivel y.  Market-based measures of uncertainty 
about the path of policy increased, particul arly at horizons of 12 months or more. 
Although yields on 10-year TIPS rose 6 basi s points, comparable nominal yields 
declined 10 basis points.  The associated decrease in inflation compensation reportedly reflected increased concerns a bout global growth and declines in oil prices, with a notable 
drop in the wake of OPEC’s decision not to cut production at its November 27 meeting.
1  
Five-year inflation compensation based on TIPS dropped 12 basis points, and the five-
year measure five years ahead decreased 22 basis points and now stands a bit below its 
recent trough in 2011.  Measures of inflation compensation taken from inflation swaps declined by similar amounts.  In addition, quo tes on inflation caps and floors suggest that 
the decline in inflation compensation has been  associated with an increase in concerns

  about relatively low inflation outcomes and a comparable decline in concerns about 
relatively high inflation outomes. 
Staff models suggest that much of the decrease in five-year forward inflation 
compensation reflected changes in risk a nd liquidity premiums, with longer-term 
inflation expectations only a li ttle lower.  Respondents to th e Desk surveys reported little 
change in their own inflation expectations but nonetheless at tributed about half of the 
decline in inflation compensation to a drop in  investors’ expected average CPI inflation 
and the other half to inflation ri sk and other premiums.       
Most survey-based measures of longer-t erm inflation expectations have changed 
little of late.  In the dealer  survey, the average point estimate for annual CPI inflation 
over 2020 to 2024 declined only a few basis point s.  By contrast, the Michigan survey 
measure of long-term inflation expectat ions has dropped 20 basis points in recent 
months.2  However, this measure has historically  been somewhat sensitive to large moves 
in energy prices. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, global financial markets were buoyed by substantial 
policy actions announced in Japan and the pros pect of easier moneta ry policies elsewhere 
than had previously been expected.  Thes e developments contributed to substantial 
appreciation in the dollar and robust increases in major equity indexes; they also put 
downward pressure on benchm ark sovereign bond yields. 
Officials at the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Japanese Government Pension 
Investment Fund (GPIF) surprised markets early in the period with nearly simultaneous 
announcements of expanded asset purchase s and revised investment allocations, 
respectively.  The BOJ raised its target fo r expanding the monetary base to an annual 
pace of ¥80 trillion (16 percent of GDP), to be accomplished primarily through larger purchases of domestic government bonds.  The GPIF revised its investment targets, 
raising its allocations of Japanese and global equities each from 12 percent to 25 percent.  
Later in the period, in the wake  of an unexpected contracti on in third-quarter GDP, Prime 
Minister Abe delayed the next planned c onsumption tax increase by 18 months to 
                                                 
2 The Michigan long-term measure is the median  of household forecast s of average inflation 
“during the next five to ten years,” not just the period five years ahead.

  April 2017.  Elsewhere in Asia, the People’s Bank of China surprised markets by cutting 
its official lending and deposit rates am id concerns about weakening growth. 
European policymakers were also perceive d to have become likely to pursue more 
accommodative policies.  The ECB surprise d markets by indicating its intention to 
increase the size of its balance sheet by roughly €1 tril lion, toward early 2012 levels.  
Communications by President Draghi and othe r ECB officials over the period led market 
participants to expect further actions by the ECB as early as January, potentially 
including sovereign bond purchases.  In th e United Kingdom, market expectations for 
liftoff of the policy rate were pushed back to  late 2015 as statements from the Bank of 
England were interpreted as  being somewhat dovish.   
Foreign benchmark 10-year yields fell, w ith the largest decline (35 basis points) 
in the United Kingdom.  Expectations for more aggressive purchases by the ECB pushed 
German yields down to a record low of 70 basis points, and most spreads of 10-year 
peripheral sovereign bonds over those yiel ds narrowed further over the period. 
In response to relatively good economic news in the United States, as well as 
ongoing concerns about tepid growth and e xpectations for more policy accommodation 
abroad, the dollar appreciated substantially, co ntinuing the rapid rise seen since July. The 
AFE and EME currency indexes both rose almost 4 percent.  Notably, the dollar 
appreciated 10 percent versus the Japanese ye n.  Chinese authorities guided the value of 
the renminbi lower, allowing it to depreciate about 1¼ percent against the dollar, 
consistent with a generally more accommodative policy stance.  The Mexican peso fell 7 percent against the dollar, and, in respons e to recent depreciation, Mexican authorities 
reintroduced a system of  dollar auctions intended to limit large intraday declines in the 
currency.     
With new policy measures seeming to outwe igh growth concerns, Japanese equity 
indexes rose 17 percent and European inde xes rose between 2 a nd 9 percent over the 
period.  However, euro-area bank stocks fell amid some weak earnings reports.  The ECB 
published the results of its comprehensive as sessment of banks early in the period; 
although the assessment was broadly viewed as credible and most banks passed, stocks of 
those banks identified as relatively weaker underperformed.  (See th e box “The European 
Central Bank’s Comprehensive Assessment of Euro-Area Banks.” )  Although Chinese 
stock prices shot up more than 20 percent, an  unusually large move even by that market’s

Broad U.S. equity price indexes increas ed; the S&P 500 rose about 4 percent, 
with notable gains on the days  of the monetary policy comm unications in Japan, China, 
and the euro area.  The S&P small-cap stock index also rose somewhat, despite a 
25 percent slide in the sub-index that track s the energy sector.  Stock prices were 
supported by the generally posi tive tone of third-quarter earnings announcements.  On 
net, option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—was little changed and 
remained in the lower portion of its historical range. 
Corporate credit spreads, pa rticularly those for spec ulative-grade bonds, widened 
a bit from fairly low levels, primarily because of the underperformance of energy firms, which account for a relatively large fraction of speculative-grade bonds outstanding.  On 
net, 10-year speculative-grade bond spreads increased 49 basis points over the intermeeting period, while spreads for investment-grade bonds increase d 15 basis points.  
On balance, however, credit conditions for corporations stayed accommodative 
over the intermeeting period.  Gross issuan ce of investment-grade corporate bonds 
increased at its strongest p ace in over a year, more than compensating for a slowdown in 
October, and issuance of speculative-grade  bonds remained robust.  Nonfinancial 
commercial paper outstanding expanded notably  in November, more than offsetting its 
drop in October.  In addition, leveraged loan issuance in October and November 
continued to be strong, boosted in part by borrowing to fund mergers and acquisitions, and CLO issuance stayed robust.  Finally, commercial and industrial loans on banks’ 
books continued to expand strongl y in October and November. 
Financing for the commercial real es tate (CRE) sector remained broadly 
available.  CRE loans on banks’ books gr ew at a moderate pace in October and 
November.  The volume of CMBS issuance remained solid in October, and, based on the 
pipeline of forthcoming deals, CMBS issu ance overall in 2014 is expected to be 
somewhat stronger than in 2013.  CMBS sp reads continued to be tight through the 
beginning of November.  In the December Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, about one-fifth of broker-dealers with a significant presence in

 The European Central Bank’s Comprehensive Assessment of 
Euro-Area Banks 
In late October, the European Central Bank (ECB) concluded a comprehensive 
assessment of significant euro- area lenders in preparation for the ECB to assume 
principal supervisory authority for the largest euro-area banks on November 4.1  
The assessment was conducted by domestic banking supervisors, third-party 
consultants, and the European Banking Authority, all under ECB leadership.  
Covering 130 institutions with €22 trillion in assets, the assessment was 
unprecedented in size and scope.  The assessment consisted of a stress test 
preceded by an asset quality review (AQR), which evaluated the accuracy of 
banks’ dete rminations of nonperforming loans and the adequacy of their loan 
loss reserves.  Based on these evaluations, adjustments were made to the capital 
and risk-weighted assets that were used in the stress test.  Market participants 
largely viewed the exercise as credible, with reasonably stringent methodology 
and economic assumptions.  
The results of the assessment suggest that the larger euro-area banks are in 
sound condition.  On average, banks’ benchmark capital ratios under the stress 
tests’ adverse scenario  were estimated to be 9 percent, about 4 percentage 
points lower than their capital ratios at the end of 2013.2  Moreover, most banks’ 
benchmark capital ratios exceeded the 5
.5 percent minimum required under the 
adverse scenario.  Ultimately, only eight banks, mostly from the peripheral 
economies, will be required to raise a combined €6  billion in additional capital.  
The modest requirement in part reflects the roughly €40 billion in net capital 
raised by all banks in the assessment after December 2013, the balance sheet 
date used for the exercise. 
Even so, the quality and quantity of capital held by euro-area banks remain below 
desirable levels.  Although risk-based capital ratios were more than adequate, 
many institutions in the assessment had weak leverage ratios.  Among all euro-
area banks that are now subject to direct ECB supervision, those with a leverage 
ratio below 3 percent —likely to be the euro-area minimum in 2018 —hold 
15 percent of t
otal assets.3  Within some of the larger euro-area economies, such 
as Germany, the figure is higher, reflecting the relatively low ratio of risk-
weighted assets to total assets at the largest German banks (figure 1).4

assets. 
3 Of the 130 banks in the assessment, 110 are now subject to direct ECB supervision. 
4 French, German, Italian, and Spanish banks hold over 70 percent of euro-area banking 
assets.

 Additionally, a material portion of euro- area banks’ existing capital—items such 
as deferred tax assets, goodwill, and equity holdings in other financial 
institutions —does not, in all instances, absorb losses.  Under Basel III rules, these 
types of low-quality capital will gradua
lly lose eligibility, but they remain 
acceptable as so-called transitional capital during the multiyear phase-in period.  
Banks in Germany, Italy, and Spain rely on such transitional capital for a hefty 
15 to 20 percent of their capital stock, or roughly 2 percentage points of their 
benchmark capital ratios on average (figure 2).   
Another concern is that some capital in peripheral banks continues to be 
provided by their weak sovereigns.  Notably, in Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, 
some deferred tax assets —assets that can be used to reduce taxes on future 
profits —have  been transformed into permanent government credits that, in 
addition to offsetting taxes due, can also be redeemed when a bank incurs losses 
or needs to be resolved .  This shift is particularly relevant for Spanish banks ; an 
estimated 25 percent of their total benchmark capital consists of tax credits that 
were converted from deferred tax assets.  These actions have improved the 
reported capital quality of some peripheral banks, but at the same time, these 
actions have reinforced the link between weak sovereigns and their banking 
sectors.   
As full implementation of Basel III approaches, many euro-area banks will need to 
improve leverage ratios and replace transitional capital.  As a result, many banks 
will likely remain vulnerable to shocks and are poorly positioned to contribute to 
the region’s economic recovery.

HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Measures of mortgage lending conditions were little changed over the 
intermeeting period and continue to indicat e that credit conditions for residential 
mortgages are tight for borrowers with less- than-pristine credit.  Mortgage lenders 
continued to digest the impli cations of the new GSE guide lines on policies related to 
putbacks and mortgage originations with highe r loan-to-value ratios, but reportedly they 
are unlikely to ease lending conditions materially in the near term.  Interest rates on 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages were little ch anged at about 3.8 percent, approximately 
40 basis points above their lows in the spring of 2013.  Indicators of refinance activity 
remained subdued through the end of November.   
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally stayed 
accommodative.  Auto and student loan ba lances continued to expand robustly, and 
revolving credit balances expanded further at a moderate pace.  Auto and student loans 
remained widely available.  Credit performa nce has also stayed strong overall for auto 
loans, although cumulative loss rates have crep t up on the most recent vintages of loans 
originated by banks.   
During the third quarter, th e distribution of credit sc ores on newly originated 
credit card accounts moved lower, suggesting that access to revolving credit continued to 
improve for consumers with blemished credit records.  That said, the terms of credit 
extended to such borrowers stayed tight, with  credit limits remaining low and interest 
rates still elevated.  ABS issuance has continue d to be robust in the fourth quarter, with 
year-to-date issuance sligh tly outpacing that of last year and ABS yield spreads 
remaining tight. 
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
The stock prices of large U.S. bank holding companies (BHCs) outperformed 
broad market indexes, while CDS spreads for large BHCs were slightly lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  In the third qua rter, the profitability of BHCs remained 
within its post-crisis range but was still well be low the levels that prevailed in the decade 
prior to the crisis.  Noni nterest income improved, supported by investment banking and

  trading revenues.  In contrast, net interest ma rgins at large banks remained low, reflecting 
continued low interest rates and, to a lesser extent, increased holdings of high-quality 
liquid assets, which banks are reportedly purchasing to meet Basel III liquidity 
requirements.   
M2 expanded at roughly a 4½ percent p ace over October and November.  Over 
the same period, the monetary base contracted  at an annual rate of about 30 percent, 
largely reflecting a decline in reserve balances associated with the recent TDF operational testing. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Testing of the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP operations continued over the 
intermeeting period.  ON RRP rates ranged fr om 3 basis points to 10 basis points in 
November and December.3  Early in the period, the effec tive federal funds rate averaged 
8 basis points when the ON RRP rate was 5 basi s points.  Later on, the federal funds rate 
averaged 10 basis points and then 12 basis poi nts when the ON RRP rate rose to 7 basis 
points and then 10 basis points, respectivel y, suggesting that the ON RRP operations put 
some upward pressure on unsecured rates.4  In addition, GCF repo rates for Treasury and 
MBS collateral, as well as repo rate futures contracts for December, rose, on net, as the 
the ON RRP offered rate continued to provide  a soft floor for secured money market 
rates.   
In addition, the Desk announced four term  RRP operations in December that will 
cross year-end with a cumulative cap of $300 billion.  The first term operation was 
conducted on December 8.  It was oversubscribed, with more than 70 counterparties placing bids for a total of $102 billion, about  double the $50 billion on offer, resulting in 
a stopout rate of 8 basis points.   Later that day, usage at the overnight operation dropped 
by more than $40 billion from the day befo re—even though lower secured money market 
rates on that day, all else be ing equal, might have incr eased demand for the operation—
                                                 
3 For a summary of how money market rates were influenced by the ON RRP testing, see 
Elizabeth Klee and Bernd Schlusche (Board of Governors) and Steven Burnett, James Egelhof, Jacqueline 
Yen, and Patricia Zobel (Federal Reserve Bank of New York) (2014), “Assessment of Changes to Reverse 
Repo Testing,” memorandum to the FOMC, December 8. 
4 The effective federal funds rate averaged 10 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 5 basis points.  The volume of federal funds trading remained stable over the intermeeting period.

  suggesting that some counterparties substi tuted term RRP investments for overnight 
investments. 
Market participants reported that the term  RRPs would help alleviate the expected 
downward pressure on most short-term rates ove r year-end.  Indeed, the rise in repo rate 
futures contracts for December may have re flected in part the announcement of these 
operations.  Another sign that market partic ipants may be anticipating a fairly normal 
year-end is that the amount of commercial paper maturing by year-end and the associated 
maturity structure appear to be in line with those of previous years. 
The most recent testing of the TDF conc luded with an auction of $402 billion in 
deposits maturing on December 11, 2014.  The number of participants and the total 
amount deposited continued to be sensitive to the offering rate and maximum individual 
award amount (known as the cap).  The cap wa s binding for the largest banks even at its 
highest level of $20 billion.  The introduction of an early withdrawal option led to 
significant increases in the number of depository institutions participating and in the take-
up relative to earlier operat ions without this feature.5  
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury and MBS markets remained relatively stable 
after the Federal Reserve concluded its pur chases under the flow-based asset purchase 
program.6  The Desk purchased $29 billion of  agency MBS securities under the 
reinvestment program over the period.

“Recent Testing of the Term Deposit Facility,”  memorandum to the FOMC, December 5.   
6 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk conduc ted $625 million of dollar rolls.  No Treasury 
securities were purchased in the secondary market, while the amount of SOMA Treasury holdings rolled 
over at auctions was small.  Over the same period, the Treasury Department has auctioned $222 billion of 
nominal fixed-rate coupon securities, $13 billion of TIPS, and $28 billion of the two-year Floating Rate 
Notes.  The auctions were generally characterized as well received, although for some auctions the bid-to-
cover ratios were a bit below recent averages.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  As always, a number of upside and downside risks 
attend our forecast; importantly, however, we see neither monetary nor fiscal policy as 
well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  Consequently, we 
continue to view the risks to our forecast for real GDP growth as tilted somewhat to the 
downside.  By contrast, we continue to view the risks around our unemployment 
projection as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse 
demand-side developments offset by the possibility that we continue to overestimate 
potential output.   
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Most measures of long-
term inflation expectations have remained stable in recent years despite fluctuations in 
the prices of crude oil, other commodities, and imports more generally as well as the deep 
recession and subsequent slack in labor and product markets.  Recently, however, some 
measures of long-term inflation expectations have softened at the same time that other 
major economies have seen worrisome downturns in inflation.  As a consequence, we 
view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted somewhat to the downside. 
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s  ongoing 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which views the vulnerability of the financial 
system to adverse shocks as moderate overall.  This assessment reflects the modest use of 
leverage in most parts of the financial sector, low- to-moderate levels o f securitization and 
maturity transformation in the financial sector, and the lack of acceleration in borrowing 
by the nonfinancial sector.  Nevertheless, certain vulnerabilities in the financial system 
remain:  There are continued pressures in speculative-grade corporate debt markets and 
emerging pressures in commercial real estate lending.  In addition, there are increasing 
concerns that some asset prices do not accurately reflect their liquidity risks —in part 
because of increased holdings of less-liquid securities by pooled investment vehicles — 
which suggests the potential for the amplification of any adjustment in investors’ views 
about the economic outlook.

 ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first 
scenario, foreign economic growth is significantly weaker than in our baseline outlook, 
while the dollar appreciates sharply.  The next scenario examines the effects of a return to 
weak consumption growth early in 2015.  In the third scenario, the trajectory of longer-
term inflation expectations is lower than in the baseline, leading to a lower path of actual 
inflation in coming years.  The final scenario considers the possibility that the better-
than-expected improvements in the labor market so far this year are consistent with a 
stronger pace for the overall economic recovery.     
We generate the first scenario using the multicountry SIGMA model.  
Recognizing our uncertainty about the true structure of the economy, we run the second 
scenario in both the EDO and FRB/US models.  (SIGMA and EDO are both DSGE 
models, but, unlike SIGMA, EDO focuses exclusively on the domestic economy.)  The 
remaining scenarios us e the FRB/US model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off 
from its effective lower bound, its movements are governed —as in the baseline 
forecast —by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each 
scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the 
guidance provided in the Committee’s recent statements.1  In all cases, we assume that 
the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
                                                 
1 Specifically, with the exception of the “Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar” and 
“Lower Long -Term Inflation Expectations” scenarios, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in the 
quarter following the observation of an unemployment rate of 5.6 percent, the level of unemployment 
prevailing in the baseline one quarter prior to liftoff.  In the “Lower Long -Term Inflation Expectations” 
scenario, where the path of inflation is significantly different from the baseline, the choice of liftoff date is 
meant to capture the Committee’s intention to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate , 
“especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal ,” as 
stated in the October FOMC statement.  In th e “Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar” scenario, in 
which the unemployment rate rises gradually and persistently relative to the baseline throughout the 
forecast period, the federal funds rate does not lift off from its effective lower bound as long as the 
projected unemployment rate over the forecast horizon is above 5.6 percent.  For the scenarios run in EDO 
and SIGMA, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the FRB/US simulations.  One key difference 
relative to the FRB/US simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the 
difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the 
absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

 Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar 
Our baseline forecast projects some pickup in foreign GDP growth relative to its 
tepid pace through most of this year.  However, there are a number of downside risks to 
the global outlook, including a renewed recession in the euro area, a hard landing in 
China, or an escalation of geopolitical stresses.  The realization of any of these risks 
could trigger financial market turbulence and widespread declines in foreign economic 
growth.  In this scenario, foreign GDP growth is assumed to average 1 percentage point 
below the baseline over the next three years.  Weaker foreign economic activity and 
flight- to-safety flows to dollar-denominated assets induce the broad real dollar to 
appreciate by about 10 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2015. 
The slower foreign economic growth and stronger dollar cause U.S. real net 
exports to decline relative to baseline.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands by about  
2 percent in 2015 and 2016, about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline in each 
year.  Weaker U.S. economic activity and lower import price inflation hold core inflation 
to about 1 percent through 2016.  The federal funds rate remains at its effective lower 
bound two quarters longer than in the baseline and U.S. monetary policy accommodation 
is removed more gradually going forward. 
Weaker Domestic Demand 
While the previous scenario highlights external risks to the outlook, this scenario 
considers a possible homegrown risk.  The Tealbook forecast features a pickup in output 
growth next year driven in large part by stronger gains in consumer spending.  However, 
consumption growth in recent quarters has been lackluster, in line with some staff models 
that now project more of the same in the near future.  This scenario uses both the 
FRB/US and EDO models to trace out the consequences of a more restrained path for 
consumption growth.2   
In the FRB/US simulation, output rises by 2 percent in 2015, while the 
unemployment rate remains above 5½ percent through the end of the year.   Activity 
rebounds firmly in 2016, and the unemployment rate fall s slightly below baseline  
in 2018.  While the federal funds rate exits the zero lower bound in the second quarter  
of 2015, as in the baseline, a wider output gap and a largely unchanged path for inflation 
                                                 
2 Specifically, in FRB/US, shocks are applied such that total consumption in 2015 grows at 
roughly the same pace as in the past few years, while in EDO, comparable shocks are implemented such 
that the yearly change in output over 2015 is in line with the FRB/US simulations.

 imply a lower path for the federal funds rate thereafter.  Given shocks in EDO that also 
produce a 2 percent rise in output over 2015, outcomes for unemployment, inflation, and 
the federal funds rate are quite similar to the FRB/US results over the simulation period.   
Thus, although EDO and FRB/US differ substantially in their economic structure, 
they display very similar paths when hit with this adverse demand shock.  It is likely that 
the models have similar responses because both are estimated using the same data and 
because the shocks underlying the scenario in each model are the typical drivers of the 
business cycle.3 
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
A key assumption behind the baseline inflation projection is that the level of long-
term inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting is currently 1.8 percent and 
eventually rises to 2 percent.  However, some models suggest that long-term inflation 
expectations are currently lower than 1.8 percent, and there is an associated risk that these 
expectations could take even longer than in the baseline to converge to the Committee’s  
2 percent objective.4  In this scenario, we assume that long-term inflation expectations 
currently stand at 1.5 percent and that, going forward, households and businesses form 
their long-term expectations adaptively based on past inflation.  Low actual inflation in 
the coming years and subdued inflation expectations are mutually reinforcing.  As a 
result, inflation in this scenario runs persistently below baseline, reaching only  
1.6 percent in 2017, and the federal funds rate does not lift off until the third quarter of 
2017.  The added stimulus generated by holding the federal funds rate at its lower bound 
for an additional two years is sufficient to drive the unemployment rate well below its 
natural rate, eventually generating a pickup in inflation, and —with some delay —moving 
long-term inflation expectations back toward the Committee’s target .   
Faster Recovery with Higher Inflation  
Over the past year, the unemployment rate has continued to move down 
appreciably.  At the same time, lending standards have continued to ease, manufacturing 
                                                 
3 We emphasize, however, that substantial differences in theoretical structure between EDO and 
FRB/US mean that the shocks used to generate this scenario have different structural interpretations in the 
two models.

 output growth has been solid, and fiscal policy restraint has faded.  In this scenario, these 
favorable developments solidify business confidence about the durability of demand 
going forward; the resulting strong investment growth supports a much more robust 
economic recovery than in the baseline.  We also assume that inflation will be more 
sensitive to reductions in resource slack than is implicit in the FRB/US model, in line 
with the larger cyclical effects on inflation in some DSGE models.  
  Real GDP growth averages 3¼ percent in 2015 and 2016, about ¾ percentage 
point higher than in the baseline; the unemployment rate falls to about 4¼ percent by the 
end of 2017.  With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the 
baseline, reaching almost 2½ percent at the beginning of 2019.5  The federal funds rate 
lifts off in the second quarter of 2015, as in the baseline, but rises more steeply thereafter, 
passing 4 percent in late 2017 and reaching 5 percent in 2019.  Given enough time, this 
path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate to its 
assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent.  
                                                 
5 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially steeper wage and price 
Phillips curves used in this scenario.  Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation 
would have peaked at 2 percent.

    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. 
HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
