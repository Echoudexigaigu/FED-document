Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we have received sin ce the December Tealbook suggests that 
economic activity expanded at a strong pace over the second half of last year.  Folding in 
the upward revision to GDP growth in the th ird quarter and the incoming spending data 
for the fourth, we now estimate that real GDP rose at an average annual rate of 
3¾ percent over those two quart ers, ¾ percentage point ab ove the December Tealbook 
forecast and well above our estimate of poten tial output growth.  Real private domestic 
final purchases (PDFP), which we judge to  be a better indicator of the underlying 
momentum in the economy, appear to have incr eased at about the same pace as real GDP.  
Meanwhile, labor market conditions improved a little more than we had anticipated.  
Taken together, the positive surprises in labor and product market s suggest that the 
economy entered 2015 with a little less resource slack than we had previously projected. 
In light of the greater momentum suggeste d by the recent data and the significant 
boost to household purchasing power implied by the latest declines in oil prices, we have 
also marked up our projection for economic ac tivity in the first half of this year.  
Although real GDP growth is expected to slow to an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the first 
half, real PDFP is now expected to increase at a robust annual ra te of 4 percent; both 
figures are higher than in the December T ealbook.  Similarly, we have upgraded our 
near-term outlook somewhat for the pace of j ob gains and slightly lowered the projected 
near-term path for the unemployment rate.   
As in previous forecasts, we anticipat e that accommodative monetary policy will 
continue to help support a pace of real GDP gr owth over the next three years that exceeds 
the growth rate of potential output.  Although we judge the level of GDP to be currently 
½ percent higher than in the December Teal book, our forecast of GDP growth over the 
next three years is little revised, as the car ry-on effects of the pos itive near-term spending 
surprises and the support to household spendi ng from lower energy prices are offset by 
the restraint implied by the recent appreciati on of the dollar.  (See the box “Reviewing 
the Effects of Changes in the Do llar and Oil Prices on U.S. GDP.”1)  We now project that 
1 During the intermeeting period, we decided to build into the judgmental projection a somewhat 
greater boost to real activity from the further decline in oil prices in order to bring these effects closer to the 
center of the range of estimates from various staff models and other empirical estimates in the research 
literature.

Reviewing the Effects of Changes in the Dollar and Oil Prices on U.S. GDP 
Since the middle of 2014, oil prices have declined dramatic ally and the dollar has appreciated 
sharp ly.  In this discussion, we review the estimated effects of the higher dollar and lower oil 
prices on U.S. GDP.  Both the appreciation of the dollar and the fall in oil prices have had large 
effects on our outlook, with, on net, the negative e ffect of the higher dollar outweighing the 
positive effect of lower oil prices.  
Table 1 reviews the rules of thumb in the staff judgmental forecast for a 10 percent appreciation 
of the dollar and a 10 percent decline in the price of oil.1 The table reports the estimated direct 
effects o f these changes, abstracting from the response of monetary policy and other financial 
variables. Dollar appreciation lowers exports and increases imports, both of which contribute to 
a large negative effect on the level of GDP that increases with time.  In contrast, lower oil prices 
boost the level of GDP, as the positive impetus to consumption more than offsets the negative effect on net exports and investment in the oil industry.
2 The positive effect of an oil price 
decline largely occurs within a year. 
Since the July Tealbook, the broad real dollar has appreciated about 10 percent, lowering the 
level of the staff forecast for U.S. GDP by 1.6 percent by the end of 2017 (as shown in table 2) .  
Over the same period, the spot price of Brent crude oil has declined almost 60 percent, while 
prices for further-dated futures contracts have fallen about 35 percent. Judging movements in 
prices that are further out on the futures curve to be more indicative of persistent price changes, 
the staff estimates that the 35 percent fall in futures prices will boost the level of GDP by about 
¾ percent, with most of the increase occurring by the end of this year (a lso shown in table 2). 
Thus, on net, the two effects roughly offset one another in 2014 and 2015, but thereafter the 
negative dollar effect grows to be the larger influence. 
The effects reported above are not the only considerations linking changes in the dollar and oil 
prices to changes in the overall staff outlook.  For instance, the estimates do not include the 
response of monetary policy, which buffers t he effects coming through either channel. In 
addition, the estimated effects do not take into account the underlying factors that might be 
driving the higher dollar and lower oil prices, which could show up elsewhere in the staff forecast 
with implications for GDP. Of course, considerable uncertainty also attends these estimates, both 
for the effects of movements in the dollar and in oil prices.  
1 These rules of thumb are inclusive of recent changes in the staff’s methodology, including changes adopted 
in the December Tealbook that lessened the sensitivity of U.S. GDP to exchange rate movements and changes 
adopted in the January Tealbook that increased the responsiveness of U.S. GDP to oil prices.  
2 For a fuller discussion of the effects of lower oil prices on the U.S. economy and the risks surrounding our 
estimates, see the January 21 , 2015, memorandum to the FOMC, “The Effects of Lower Oil Prices on U.S. Activity: 
Baseline Assumptions and Risks,” by Kimberly Bayard, David Byrne, Gustavo Suarez, and Rober t Vigfusson.

real GDP will expand about 2¾ percent pe r year in both 2015 and 2016.  Although the 
continued normalization of monetary policy is expected to lead to an easing in economic 
growth in 2017, the level of real GDP is nonetheless expected to  be around 1 percent 
above its potential at the end of  that year, a little higher than in our previous projection. 
An undershooting of the unemployment ra te, relative to our estimate of a 
5.2 percent natural rate, remains a feature of the labor ma rket projection.  In particular, 
we expect the unemployment rate to drift down steadily, from 5.6 percent last month to 
4.8 percent in the final quarter of 2017.  Both  of these figures ar e 0.1 percentage point 
below the December Tealbook projection.  Even so, the decline in the unemployment rate 
continues to be more gradual than one w ould infer from the change in the GDP gap, 
reflecting an unwinding of the current unusual weakness in the labor force participation 
rate. 
The further sharp declines in  crude oil prices have had a substantial effect on the 
near-term forecast for PCE price inflation.  We now project that headline PCE prices 
decreased last quarter and will show an even larger decline this quarter.  We have also marked down our near-term outlook for core PCE inflation in response to surprising softness in the incoming price data for November and December.  Nevertheless, we still 
expect core PCE price inflati on to step up gradually to 1¾ percent over the medium term, 
as the extended period of falling import prices  comes to an end and resource utilization 
tightens further.  With an upward tilt in th e forecast for energy prices beyond the near 
term, total PCE inflation follows a slightly higher trajectory than core inflation over the 
medium-term projection. 
As always, numerous risks attend our outlook.  We view the uncertainty around 
our projection for real GDP gr owth, inflation, and the unemployment rate as roughly in 
line with the average of the past 20 years, a period that includes cons iderable volatility.  
We have maintained our assessment that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted 
somewhat to the downside, la rgely reflecting our view that  neither monetary policy nor 
fiscal policy appears well posit ioned to offset substantial a dverse shocks to the economy.  
We also still see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced, as the downside risks to real activity are about offset by the possibility that the 
unemployment rate could continue to decline more rapidly than we expect.  Our 
downside concerns with respect to inflation have intensified somewhat given the recent

COMPARING THE STAFF PROJECTION WITH OTHER FORECASTS  
The staff forecasts of real GDP growth  in 2015 and 2016 are essentially the sam e 
as the January Blue Chip consensus outlook.  Meanwhile, the staff’s forecasts of the 
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of this year and next are a bit lower than the 
Blue Chip Consensus.  The staff’s projecti on for consumer price inflation in 2015 stands 
about 1 percentage point below the consensus of the Blue Chip panelists, but, given the recent declines in energy prices, this dive rgence likely reflects the difference in the 
timing of the Blue Chip survey and the close of the January Teal book; the two forecasts 
are similar in 2016.

employment reports for November and December, strong  recent spending data, and much of the recent

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We continue to assume that the fede ral funds rate will lift off from its 
effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  However, taking note of 
the Committee’s statement in December that it “can be patient in beginning to 
normalize the stance of monetary policy,”  we now assume more specifically 
that liftoff does not occur unt il the June meeting.  Following liftoff, the federal 
funds rate rises at a pace prescribed by an inertial ve rsion of the Taylor (1999) 
policy rule.  In the near term, the slig ht delay of liftoff leaves the projected 
federal funds rate a little  lower than in the previous forecast; by the fourth 
quarter of 2017, however, the federal funds rate is 18 basis points higher than 
in the December Tealbook, primarily re flecting the positive revision to the 
output gap in the medium-term projection. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The projected trajectory for the 10-year Tr easury yield is notably lower in the 
near term compared with the Decembe r Tealbook projection, consistent with 
the substantial recent declines in market  rates.  Further out in the forecast 
period, the path of the 10-year Treasur y yield was revised up somewhat to 
better align it with the pr edictions of our model.  Our medium-term projection 
continues to call for Treasury yields to  rise significantly, primarily because of 
the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well as an increase in term 
premiums.  The rise in term premiums, in turn, is partly due to a gradual waning of the effects of the FO MC’s balance sheet policies. 
 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium 
term have been revised essentially in lin e with the revisions to the path for the 
Treasury yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 The projected path for equity prices over the medium term is essentially 
unrevised relative to the December Tealbook.

 Incoming house price data for October and November were close to our 
December Tealbook forecast, and we con tinue to project that house price 
appreciation will slow from roughly 5 pe rcent in 2014 to an average rate of 
about 3 percent per year from 2015 to 2017.   
Fiscal Policy 
 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.  
We continue to anticipate that the small drag on real GDP growth from fiscal policy actions across all levels of government in 2014 will swing to a small 
stimulus from 2015 through 2017.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 The pace of foreign economic activity app ears to have stepped up slightly in 
the second half of last year, to a still- subdued annual rate of 2½ percent.  We 
expect that economic growth abroad will step up to an annual rate of 3 percent 
over the medium term, supported in part by lower oil prices, more 
accommodative monetary policy, and depreciation of foreign currencies 
against the dollar.  Nevertheless, the dow nside risks to the foreign outlook still 
appear elevated. 
 The broad nominal index for the dollar has appreciated about 2¼ percent since 
the previous Tealbook, likely reflecting, in part, the continued divergence 
between the expected paths of mone tary policy across countries and the 
perception of increased risks to econom ic growth abroad.  Looking ahead, we 
expect the nominal dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of 1 percent this year 
and then to flatten out over the remainder of the forecast period, as further appreciation against other major currencies is offset by depreciation against 
the currencies of the emerging market economies.  The slope of the medium-
term path of the dollar is somewhat flat ter in this projection, as we now expect 
Chinese authorities to put further re nminbi appreciation on hold through 2015.  
All told, the broad real dollar is about 3 percen t higher by the end of 2017 
than in the previous Tealbook.   
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent cr ude oil declined an add itional $19 per barrel since 
the time of the December Tealbook, reach ing $48 per barrel on January 20.

This decline likely reflected increased  concerns about global demand and the 
persistent strength of global production.  Prices for futures contracts with 
delivery at the end of 2017 also fell noticeably, but by less than the drop in the 
spot price, which increased the upward ti lt in the futures curve.  We view the 
projected increase in prices  as reflecting expectations  of a pickup in global 
demand accompanied by a slowing in s upply growth, as producers respond 
gradually to the lower path for prices.  We expect the price of imported oil to 
move up from $49 per barrel this quarter to about $61 per barrel by the end of 
the forecast period.  Relative to th e December Tealbook, our forecast is 
$15 per barrel lower this year and $9 per barrel lower at the end of 2017. 
 For most of 2014, metals prices remained relatively flat even though oil prices 
plunged and the dollar appreciated.  Since the December Tealbook, however, 
metals prices have fallen 8 percent, likely indicating heightened concerns 
about the prospects for global demand, primarily from China. 
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The incoming spending data have led us to revise up our esti mate of real GDP 
growth during the second half of last year, to  an annual rate of 3¾ percent, substantially 
above the weak growth rate recorded over th e first half of the y ear and ¾ percentage 
point above the December Tealbook projection.  We  expect real GDP growth to slow to a 
rate of 2¾ percent in the fi rst half of this year, pulled down by both net exports and 
inventory investment.  
 For the most part, we have interpreted the stronger-than-expected increase in 
aggregate output last year as indica ting that resource utilization around the 
turn of the year was tighter than we had previously thought, an assessment that is corroborated by la bor market indicators.   
 Upward revisions to the third-quarter estimate of real PCE, coupled with 
stronger incoming data, on balance, fo r the fourth quarter, pushed up our 
estimate of PCE growth in the second half  of last year to an annual rate of 
3½ percent, ¾ percentage point faster than in the December Tealbook.  We 
took some signal from the higher trajectory, as well as the further decline in 
oil prices and a notable improvement in  consumer sentiment, and revised up 
PCE growth to a robust annual rate of 4¼ percent in the fi rst half of this year.

 Incoming data on housing starts and ho me sales suggest a moderate upward 
trajectory for homebuilding in the near te rm.  We project that  real residential 
investment rose only sluggishly in the second half of last year but will 
increase at a more rapid annua l rate of 9 percent in the first half of this year.  
 After rising at a solid pa ce through much of last year, growth in private 
business fixed investment slowed in th e fourth quarter and is expected to 
weaken further in the first half of this year, as declines in outlays for drilling 
structures caused by the large drop in cr ude oil prices largel y offset moderate 
increases in other capital expenditures.  
 Weighed down by the drag from previous  dollar appreciation , net exports are 
expected to subtract ½ per centage point from real GDP growth in the first half 
of this year after exerting a roughly ne utral influence on output growth in the 
second half of last year.   
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We continue to anticipate that real GDP growth will exceed its potential rate of 
1¾ percent throughout the medium term.  Specifically, real GDP is projected to increase 2¾ percent in both 2015 and 2016 and then slow to about 2 percent in 2017, as economic 
growth eases with the ongoing norma lization of monetary policy.   
 Although the projected level of GDP this quarter is ½ percent higher than in 
the December Tealbook, our forecast of GD P growth over the medium term is 
little revised.  The greater momentum  from the positive spending surprises 
and the support to household spending from lower energy prices are about 
offset by the restraint implied by the recent appreciation of the dollar.  
 The only change we made to our supply-side assumptions was to slightly raise 
our estimate of potential output grow th in 2014.  This revision unwound a 
little more of the downward adjustment  we made in the July Tealbook to 
insulate our estimates of the output gap ag ainst what we judge to be statistical 
noise in the spending data from the first quarter of last year. 
 Even with a higher level of potential output, the sizab le upward revisions to 
the projection for actual GDP since the December Tealbook imply that the 
output gap at the start of this year is somewhat narrower than in the previous

projection.  We now expect that GDP will be 1 percent above its potential 
level by the fourth quarter of 2017, a lit tle wider gap than in the December 
Tealbook.3 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The December employment report and other incoming indicators showed 
somewhat more improvement in labor market conditions than we had expected. 
 Although the December gain in nonfarm payrolls was in line with our 
expectations, upward revisions to the October and November figures pushed 
up the average monthly gain in the four th quarter to 290,000.  In response, we 
nudged up our forecast for first-quarter payroll gains by 15,000 per month, to 
230,000.  
 The unemployment rate was 5.6 percen t in December, down 0.2 percentage 
point from November and 0.5 percentage poi nt lower than six months earlier.  
In the first quarter, we expect the un employment rate to average 5.4 percent, 
0.1 percentage point below our previous forecast. 
 The labor force participation rate edged down to 62.7 percent in December, a 
touch lower than our projection in th e previous Tealbook but little changed, 
on net, over the past several quarters.  
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, which summarizes the movements 
in 19 labor market indicators, improve d noticeably in December and over the 
fourth quarter as a whole.  
Since the December Tealbook, we have also upgraded our medium-term outlook 
for the labor market, largely reflecting the more positive outlook for the GDP gap in this 
projection.   
3 As was noted in the December T ealbook, we intend our estimate of the output gap to provide a 
more comprehensive gauge of overall resource slack over the projection period than the unemployment rate 
gap because the former measure also includes the unusua l degree of cyclical weakness that we estimate in 
labor force participation. We project that the so-ca lled Okun’s law error will pers ist over the next several 
quarters before tapering off over the medium term, eventually bringing the different measures of resource 
slack into alignment.

 We expect monthly job gains to averag e about 230,000 this year and next year 
before slowing to around 150,000 in 2017.  These gains are little changed 
from what we had projected in December. 
 We project that the un employment rate will edge down gradually to 
4.8 percent by the end of 2017.  The unemplo yment rate is projected to move 
below our estimate of 5.2 percent for the natural rate later this year and is 
anticipated to be nearly ½ percentage poi nt below the natural rate at the end of 
the projection period.   
 At present, we believe that the unempl oyment rate gap und erstates the amount 
of slack remaining in the labor market , reflecting an unusually weak recovery 
in the labor force participation rate a nd, we think, an unusually elevated level 
of involuntary part-time employment.  As the economy improves, we expect 
that wage gains will pick up and that more of the individuals currently not in the labor force will be drawn in.  Th is effect will accelerate the cyclical 
recovery in the participation rate while attenuating the decline in the 
unemployment rate.  As a result, we e xpect that the unemployment rate will 
only edge down during 2016 and 2017 even  as GDP continues to increase 
faster than its potential.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The further sharp declines in crude oil prices have resulted in a substantially 
lower near-term projection for headline PCE pr ice inflation.  We now estimate that total 
PCE prices decreased at an annual rate of ½ percent last quarter , and we anticipate a 
further decline of 2½ percent this quarter.  In addition, the incoming data on core prices 
have been softer than we had expected.  Neve rtheless, we still expect core PCE inflation 
to reach 1.8 percent by the end of the medium term, as import prices turn up and resource 
utilization tightens.  With cons umer energy prices projected to rise faster than core prices 
beginning later this year, total PCE inflation fo llows a slightly higher trajectory than core 
inflation in 2016 and 2017.  (Also see th e box “Alternative View:  A Different 
Framework for Inflation.”) 
 After folding in negative surprises for November and December, we now estimate that core PCE inflation was about  1 percent last quarter and expect it 
to be the same this quarter.  Pri ces for goods other than food and energy,

which are heavily influenced by core impor t prices, have been especially soft.  
In light of the ongoing dollar appreciati on and further projected declines in 
import prices in the near term, we carried forward some of the negative 
surprises and lowered our forecast for core  inflation over the fi rst half of this 
year.   
 With crude oil prices continuing to decline, we marked down the near-term 
projection for consumer energy prices considerably and now expect these 
prices to fall at an annual rate of more than 50 percent in the first quarter.  Our 
projection assumes that the pass-through fr om crude to retail gasoline prices 
will be essentially completed by midyear, and we therefore expect that consumer energy prices will turn up in the second half and rise somewhat 
faster than core prices in the medium  term, consistent with the moderate 
upward tilt in the futures path for crude oil prices. 
 Consumer food price inflation slowed in  the fourth quarter from the elevated 
rates observed in the middle of last y ear.  Given the substantial declines in 
farm commodity prices observed in recent months, consumer food price 
inflation is expected to be soft in the next few quarters.  In the medium term, 
we project that consumer food prices w ill rise at a pace roughly in line with 
core inflation.  
 Core import prices are expected to declin e at an average annual rate of nearly 
3 percent in the first half of this year , reflecting the apprec iation of the dollar 
and declines in commodity prices.  As the dollar flattens out and foreign CPI 
inflation picks up, core import price inflation is expected to turn positive by 
the second half of the year and to move up to a 1¼ percent pace in 2016 and 2017. 
 Survey-based measures of long-run in flation expectations have remained 
within the narrow range of values seen in recent years.  By contrast, TIPS-
based measures of inflation compensation have declined further since the time 
of the December Tealbook.  Staff models continue to attribute little of this 
decline in inflation compensation to lower expected inflat ion.  (Also see the 
box “An Update on Measures of Longe r-Term Inflation Compensation and 
Inflation Expectations” in the Fi nancial Developments section.)

Alternative View: A Different Framework for Inflation 
Traditional Phillips curves generally suggest that inflation should have continuously declined in 
recent years as low current-period inflation resulting from excess unemployment fed through to 
lower expected future inflation, which in turn lowered next period’s inflation in a repeating cycle 
(the so-called accelerationist assumption) .  The staff has relied on anchored inflation 
expectations the idea that expected future inflation has been little influenced by observed 
inflation and instead remained roughly constant over the past 15 years to explain the lack of 
continuously declining inflation since the onset of the recession .  
An alternative to this as sumption of anchored inflation expectations is a nonlinear Phillips curve.  
This alternative framework maintains the traditional accelerationist assumption but allows the 
tradeoff between inflation and unemployment to diminish as unemployment increases.1 
Nonlinearities in the Phillips curve can arise from several factors, including nominal wage rigidities, 
which could reduce the ability of firms to cut wages and prices, and an elevated share of long-term 
unemployed workers in d eep recessions , which might put less downward pressure on inflation 
than the usual mix of unemployed workers.2 Depending on the degree of labor market slack, 
which is highly uncertain, this alternative nonlinear Phillips curve framework could imply risks 
either to the upside or the downside of the staff’s baseline projection for inflation. 
Note:  This alternative view was prepared by Alan D etmeister. 
1 While most empirical Phillips curve models as sume a constant tradeoff between i nflation and unemployment in 
the short run, a nonlinear slope in th e Phillips curve has a long history in e conomics, and many introductory textbooks 
draw the Phillips curve nonlinearly. 
2 Among the large number of recent works on inflation and unemployment duration, see Daniel Aaronson and 
Andrew Jordan (2014), “ Understanding the Relationship between R eal Wage Growth and Labor Market Conditions ,”

Examining data such as those shown in figure 1, recent work on nonlinearities in the Phillips curve 
has focused on wage inflation.3 Here, instead, we delve into core PCE price inflation using a Phillips 
curve that closely approximates Robert Gordon’s well -known triangle model.4 As shown in 
figure 2, allowing for nonlinearities in this otherwise traditional model suggests that 
unemployment affects inflation considerably less (that is, t he slope is much flatter) when the 
unemployment rate gap is very high compared with when it is very low.  As a result, this nonlinear 
model explains the relatively small decline in inflation in recent years fairly well without relying on 
anchored expectations. 
Since past inflation feeds through into future inflation in this model and the unemployment rate is 
projected to be relatively close to the natural rate of unemployment over the next few years , this 
model suggests no increase in core inflation in the medium term a projection that is notably 
below the slowly increasing inflation in the current Tealbook baseline (compare the blue dashed 
line with the black line in figure 3).  However, the projection from this framework is much more 
sensitive to the assumed amount of slack in the unemployment rate gap than the staff’s baseline 
view .  For example, if in reality there is considerably less slack than in the Tealbook baseline such 
as if the natural rate of unemployment is around 6 percent as suggest ed by some of the estimates 
in a recent Cleveland Fed Economic Commentary the nonlinear model would project inflation 
roughly ½ percentage point higher than the baseline in 2017 (the red dashed line in figure 3), even 
though the staff’s usual response in the anchored expectations framework would move the 
projection up only about one-tenth of a percentage point (not shown).5 
3 For example, see Anil Kumar and Pia Orrenius (2014), “ A Closer L ook at the Phillips Curve Using State Level Data ,” 
Working Paper 1 409 (Dallas: Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, October), 
www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2014/wp1409.pdf; and Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig 
(2014), “ Are We There Yet? Assessing Progress toward Full Employment and Price Stability ,” Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas, Economic Letter , vol. 9 (13), pp. 1 4, www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf . 
4 The model predicts quarterly core PCE inflation using 24 lags of core PCE inflation, import prices, the change in 
trend productivity growth, the difference between core and total PCE inflation, and a measure of slack.  For slack, we 
use the staff unemployment rate gap.  See Robert J. Gordon (2013), “ The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well: Inflation and 
the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery, ” NBER Working Paper No. 19390 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic 
Research, August).  
5 The projections, which are fitted values through th e end of 2014 and forecast values thereafter, assume a natural 
rate of unemployment of 6 percent starting in th e first quarter o f 2012, when th e Tealbook baseline natural rate first falls 
below that threshold, and Tealbook baseline forecasts for the unemployment rate; trend productivity; and food, energy, 
and import prices.  The comparison of natural rate estimates see Murat Tasci and Randal Ver brugge (2014), “How Much 
Slack Is in the Labor Market? That Depends on What You Mean by Slack,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Federal 
Reserve Bank of Cleveland Economic Commentary, 2014-21 (October),

 We expect core PCE price inflation to edge up gradually from 1½ percent this 
year to 1¾ percent in 2017, as core import prices turn up and resource slack 
diminishes in an environment of well-anchored long-run inflation expectations.  Although the projection for core inflation last year and for the 
first half of this year has been revi sed down somewhat, it is unchanged over 
the medium term, as the effects of sl ightly tighter labor and product markets 
about offset the pass-through of lower core import and energy prices.   
 The only piece of information on wages that we have received since the 
previous Tealbook is the December report on average hourly earnings, which was weaker than expected.  Pendi ng corroborating readings from other 
compensation measures, we have put little weight on the recent average 
hourly earnings figures.  With labor and product markets tightening steadily 
over the projection, we expect the Pr oductivity and Cost measure of hourly 
compensation to accelerate to about 3½ percent, over 2016 and 2017.
4 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Tayl or (1999) rule.  The policy rule assumes a long-run 
equilibrium level of the nominal fede ral funds rate of 3¾ percent.   
 The federal funds rate continues to ri se after 2017, moving slightly above its 
long-run level in 2019 and 2020, reflecting the positive output gap. 
 Real GDP growth slows to 1.6 percent in 2018 and 2019—a pace below its 
estimated longer-run potential growth ra te of 2 percent—reflecting the less 
accommodative stance of monetary policy.  The unemployment rate gradually 
edges up from 4¾ percent in early 2018 toward its natural rate of 5¼ percent.   
 With the unemployment rate below th e natural rate, longer-run inflation 
expectations gradually return to the Committee’s target and PCE price 
inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019. 
4 While our projections for hourly compensation and average hourly earnings are essentially 
unrevised in the medium term, projected increases for the employment cost index (ECI) have been revised 
down to better reflect the lower cyclical sensitivity, a nd somewhat lower long-run average growth rate, of 
this measure compared with the other compensation measures.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
We estimate that economic growth abroad pick ed up a bit in the fourth quarter of 
last year to a  modest pace of 2¾ percent at an annual rate.  Indicators point to a moderate 
recovery in Japan from its tax-induced recession and to a bounceback in Mexico from 
surprisingly weak performance in the third quarter, but the pickup in total foreign growth 
was damped somewhat by a slowing of growth in Canada and China.  
Going forward, we project that economic growth abroad will edge up further to its 
trend pace of 3 percent this year and remain near that pace through 2017.  In the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs), the acceleration is concentrated in the euro area, where monetary stimulus and diminishing fiscal drag should support the economy.  Much 
of the pickup in growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs) comes as South America recovers from its recent malaise and the Asian economies outside of China, 
following a soft patch, strengthen.  The foreign economies, in aggregate, should benefit 
from solid U.S. growth, depreciat ed currencies, and lower oil prices.  Relative to the 
previous Tealbook, our forecast for the level of foreign GDP over the next couple of 
years is boosted 0.1 pe rcent b y the stronger dollar and an additional 0.1 percent by lower 
oil prices.  The oil price decline would provide a greater boost to the foreign outlook, 
except that benefits to oil-importing countries are offset by markdowns to growth in oil-
exporting countries, such as Canada and Mexico, which have high weights in our trade-
weighted aggregate for foreign GDP.  Moreover, our foreign outlook is a touch weaker 
than in the December Tealbook, as the boosts from the stronger dollar and the lower oil 
prices are outweighed by more underlying weakness in some key foreign regions, 
including China and South Ameri ca. 
Although the forecast is only slightly weaker, significant risks attend the outlook.  
On the downside, the slump in the property market and ongoing decline in the growth of potential output may result in a more pronounced slowing in China than we currently 
anticipate.  The prospects for the euro area also remain worrisome. Sharp declines in 
inflation could unhinge inflation expectations and weigh on recovery, while the recent renewal of tensions in Greece may escalate, with greater spillovers to the rest of the euro area, a scenario we explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook.  W e 
also see upside risks.  The decline in oil prices may provide a larger boost to global 
growth than currently projected.  In addition, as explored in another scenario in the Risks

and Uncertainty section, solid foreign growth that bolsters investor confidence in the 
outlook could lead to a lower dollar and higher oil prices, with a net positive effect on the 
U.S. economy.  
Amid rapidly falling energy prices, headline quarterly inflation turned negative in 
the AFEs at the end of 2014, and we project a further decline to negative 1¼ percent at an 
annual rate in the current quarter.  As oil prices stabilize, we expect AFE inflation to 
bounce back to slightly above 1 percent by midyear and gradually rise to 1¾ percent by 
2017. With growing concerns over persistently low inflation in the euro area, our 
baseline outlook assumes that the European Central Bank (ECB) will announce a 
sovereign bond purchase program at its January 22 meeting.  Anticipation of that action 
already has put downward pressure on the euro, contributing to the Swiss National 
Bank’s decision to abandon its exchange rate floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro while 
cutting its LIBOR target ra te to negative 0.75 pe rcent. Similar considerations also 
prompted Denmark ’s Nationalbank to lower its policy rates. In addition, in a surprise 
move on January 21, the Bank of Canada (BOC) lowered its target for the overnight rate 
by ¼ percentage point to 0.75 percent, where we expect it to stay until early 2016.  
Finally, we now anticipate that the Bank of England (BOE) will lift off  at the end of 
2015, one quarter later than previously assumed, in response to subdued inflation 
pressures. 
In the EMEs, we estimate that inflation declined from a 3 percent rate in the 
middle of 2014 to 2½ percent in the fourth quarter. This relatively modest step-down in 
the face of plunging oil prices partly reflects the prevalence of administered energy sector 
prices in many EMEs, which lowers the pass-through from changes in oil prices to 
consumer prices.  Moreover, some EMEs have experienced upward price pressure from 
rapidly depreciating currencies.  Again st this background, most EME central banks kept 
monetary policy unchanged since the time of the December Tealbook. Notable 
exceptions were the Reserve Bank of India and the Central Bank of Turkey, which cut 
their policy rates in January, citing declining inflation pressures, and the Central Bank of 
Brazil, which raised its policy rate in response to inflation concerns.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
 Euro area. Recent indicators point to a mild pickup of economic activity in 
the last quarter of 2014.  Retail sales, car registrations, and industrial production through November were above their third-quarter averages.

Accordingly, we estimate that real GDP expanded 1 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  We project that growth will strengthen to 1¾ percent in 2015 and 
increase somewhat further over the next two years. This growth forecast is up 
almost ¼ percentage point through 2017.  Our baseline scenario assumes that the heightened political uncertainty and financial stresses in Greece will 
persist for some time, but that the spillovers to other countries will be contained, limiting the drag on euro- area growth.  (See the box “Recent 
Developments in Greece.”) 
Headline inflation declined to negative ¾ percent at an annual rate in the 
fourth quarter, as energy prices fell.  Recent further declines in oil prices are 
anticipated to push inflation to negative 1½ percent this quarter.  As 
commodity prices stabilize and the output gap narrows, inflation should move up to ½ percent in the second quarter and 1¾ percent by end-2017.  Amid 
weak projected growth and low inflation, we expect the ECB to announce a 
new asset purchase program at its January 22 policy meeting.  We had already 
assum ed the ECB would purchase about €300 billion of asset-backed 
securities and covered bonds in the next two years through its previously announced program.  We now assume the ECB will also purchase 
€500 billion of sovereign bonds through the new program.  Based on our 
estimates, these new purchases should boost the level of euro-area GDP by 
¾ pe rcent and inflation by ¼ percentage point over the next two years.  
 Japan. Following two consecutive quarters of contraction, real GDP rose an 
estimated 3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Data through November indicate 
that private consumption continued to recover but remained well below its 
level before April’s consumption tax hike.  In 2015, we see GDP expanding at 
a solid 1¾ percent, largely reflecting ongoing monetary stimulus and new 
fiscal measures.  The recovery should continue in 2016 but then grind to a halt 
in 2017, whe n a second consumption tax hike is implemented.  We estimate 
that headline inflation declined to negative 1 percent in the fourth quarter. However, core inflation appears to have remained near 1 percent, partly reflecting some pass-through from the yen ’s depreciation in late 2014.  Thus, 
we expect headline inflation to bounce back to 1 percent in the second half of 2015 and rise to 1½ percent by 2017.  With below-target inflation and

Recent Developments in Greece 
After more than two years of relative quiet, the financial situation of Greece has 
reemerged as a significant concern.  Sapped by mounting public frustration with 
fiscal austerity and extraordinarily high unemployment, the Greek government in 
December failed to muster the parliamentary supermajority required to elect a 
new president.  As prescribed by the Greek constitution, the Greek parliament was subsequently dissolved.  Parliamentary elections are scheduled for 
January 25, 2015. The leading party in most polls is Syriza, a far-left party that has 
advocated for a t ougher approach to negotiations with Greece’s official 
creditors, with the goal of extracting further debt relief and rollbacks of austerity 
measures. 
Negotiations over the terms of Greece’s EU -IMF financial assistance program 
have been deadlocked since last fall because the former Greek government 
resisted calls by the EU and the IMF for more fiscal austerity.  In response, the EU 
and the IMF have withheld loan disbursements, which the Greek government 
likely needs in order to avoid default on more than €15 billion worth of debt 
maturing in 2015.  More generally, Greece needs to maintain an EU-IMF financial 
assistance program in order to qualify for ECB liquidity support , which accounts 
for roughly 15 percent of the Greek banking system’s liabilities.  
Hence, financial stability in Greece depends on the country’s continuing eligibili ty 
for official financing.  The prospect of a Syriza-led government has revived fears 
that discussions with official creditors could break down altogether, thereby 
depriving Greece of financial support and possibly leading the country to exit 
from the euro area. 
These fears have reportedly triggered deposit flight from Greek banks and 
prompted at least two Greek banks to request emergency liquidity assistance 
from the Greek central bank.  In addition, spreads on Greek sovereign debt have 
risen to their highest levels since mid-2013, as shown in the figure on the 
following page.  However, in sharp contrast to previous episodes of Greek 
financial stress, financial spillovers to other peripheral euro-area countries have 
thus far been short lived and limited, likely reflecting three factors.  First, credible 
financial backstops for other peripheral countries now exist, particularly the 
ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT) program.  Second, these peripheral 
countries are somewhat more resilient, reflecting some strengthened public 
finances, bank capital, and competitiveness.  Finally, private foreign investors are 
now less exposed to Greece for example, euro-area bank claims on Greece 
have fallen from $76 billion in late 2011 to $20 billion in mid-2014. 
In our baseline forecast, the Greek situation initially deteriorates further, as political uncertainty persists even after the election, but it eventually stabilizes. 
Unless the election gives one party a strong majority, there will initially be a

political vacuum while political parties attempt to form a coalition government. 
If they cannot agree on a new government, then another election will be 
necessary. Should a Syriza-led government emerge, it would likely demand 
concessions that its official creditors would find unacceptable.  As a result, 
brinkmanship among Greece, the ECB, the IMF, and other euro-area countries 
could ensue for a time. Ultimately, however, we expect the new Greek 
government and its official creditors to compromise, thereby unlocking EU-IMF 
financial assistance.  In this scenario, the gyrations in Greece’s situation intensify 
deposit flight from Greek banks and push up bond spreads in Greece and other 
peripheral countries for a time.  However, spillovers to the rest of the euro area are transitory, and the effect on the United States is minimal. 
However, negotiations could prove even more contentious and protracted than 
in our baseline, i ntensifying fears of Greece leaving the euro area.  Moreover, an 
aggressive challenge of EU-IMF orthodoxy by Greece could embolden populist and euroskeptic parties elsewhere in Europe, reviving concerns about peripheral 
countries’ debt sustainability or core countries’ willingness to provide financial 
support (including ECB purchases of government debt via the OMT program).  As 
a result, peripheral spreads and financial volatility could return to levels reached 
during the euro-area crisis in 2012, pushing the euro area back into recession.  In 
turn, the U.S. economy would suffer from reduced demand from the euro area, 
dollar appreciation in response to safe-haven flows, and significant volatility in global equity and bond markets.  (The Risks and Uncertainty section of this 
Tealbook examines that alternative scenario in more detail.)  
In the extreme, a complete breakdown of negotiations and Greece’s EU -IMF 
program could prompt the ECB to terminate its liquidity support to Greek banks, 
likely triggering the country’s exit from the euro area. This exit could cause an 
even more severe and prolonged euro-area crisis and recession, with significant 
disruptions to global financial markets.  We continue to place a low probability on 
such a scenario, given the large losses to all sides and the Greek public’s 
continued interest in keeping the euro. That said, much depends on complex 
political negotiations with outcomes that are difficult to predict.

considerable resource slack, we assume that the Bank of Japan will continue 
to accumulate assets at the rapid current pace through the end of 2016. 
 Canada. We estimate that real GDP growth moderated from 2.8 percent in 
the third quarter to 2½ percent in the fourth, consistent with the weaker tone 
of incoming labor market data. We see growth remaining near its fourth-
quarter pace through 2016 and then slowing to a near-potential rate of 
2¼ percent in 2017.  This forecast has been revised down a bit from 2016 
onward on the assumption that lower oil prices will lead to reduced 
investment in oil extraction.  Based on recent declines in energy prices, we 
now project that inflation will be negative 1½ percent in the first quarter.  As 
oil prices level off, we expect inflation to bounce back to 1½ percent in the 
second quarter and reach the Bank of Canada’s ( BOC) 2 percent target in 
2017.  In response to the expected negative effect of oil price declines on the 
outlook for growth and inflation, the BOC cut its policy rate to 0.75 percent 
on January 21.  We now expect the first rate hike in the first quarter of 2016. 
 United Kingdom. Recent data, including soft PMI readings and declining 
industrial production, suggest that real GDP growth dropped from 3 percent in the third quarter to a still-solid 2½ pe rcent in the fourth, a touch lower than 
projected in the December Tealbook.  We expect that growth will hold at 
about this pace in 2015 and 2016 before moderating to 2¼ percent by 2017.  
Declines in food and energy prices pushed headline inflation down to negative ¾ pe rcent in the fourth quarter; core inflation also eased.  We expect inflation 
to increase to the BOE’s target of 2 percent by 2017, as food and energy 
prices start rising again and economic slack diminishes.  Low inflation 
readings and BOE communications prompted us to push out by one quarter 
our e stimate of the first rate hike to the fourth quarter of this year.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
 China. Chinese real GDP growth edged down from 7¾ percent in the third 
quarter to just under 7½ percent in the fourth, in line with our forecast in the December Tealbook, partly reflecting further moderation in residential 
investment.  For 2014 as a whole, the growth rate was just under the authorities’ target of 7½ percent and was supported by a sizable net export 
contribution. We expect exports to soften in 2015, given the significant

appreciation of the Chinese renminbi against many of its trading partners in 
recent months, as the renminbi followed the dollar up.  A pickup in domestic 
demand from lower oil prices and some increase in policy stimulus will 
provide only a partial offset, and thus we see GDP growth moderating to 
about 7 percent in 2015 before edging down further to 6¾ percent in 2017.  
Relative to the December Tealbook, this forecast is down about ¼ percentage 
point through 2017.  The drop in oil prices caused inflation to step down to 
1 percent in the fourth quarter, but, as energy prices stabilize, we expect 
inflation to pick up and settle near 3 percent by the end of the year. 
 Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP in the rest of emerging 
Asia expanded at a subdued 3¾ percent pace in the fourth quarter, a slight deceleration from the previous quarter.  We see growth in the region rising to 
4½ percent, slightly above its trend rate, in 2015 and holding at about th at rate 
over the remainder of the forecast period.  The step-up in growth largely 
reflects the boost  from lower oil prices and the projected firming of activity in 
the advanced economies as well as the dissipation of idiosyncratic factors that 
restrained growth last year, including social unrest in Hong Kong.  The drop in energy prices push ed down inflation in the fourth quarter, although this 
decline was partially offset by one-off factors, such as the expiration of 
housing subsidies in Hong Kong and reductions of fuel subsidies in Indonesia 
and Malaysia.  As oil prices level off, inflation is expected to rise from 
1¾ percent in the fourth quarter to 3¼ percent by mid-2015 a nd then stay at 
about that rate over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Latin America.  Incoming data for Mexico , including trade, industrial output, 
and vehicle sales, are consistent with our view that real GDP growth stepped 
up to 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter following a  disappointing 2 percent 
pace in the third quarter.  We see Mexican growth remaining near 3¼ percent 
through 201 7, supported, in part, b y the effect of past economic reforms.  This 
outlook is a bit weaker than in the December Tealbook.  Continued declines in oil prices are expect ed to damp the response of private investment to recent 
energy reforms and eventually force a tighter fiscal stance.  Headline inflation 
remained elevated at 4¼ percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting higher food 
prices and little pass-through of lower oil prices into administered fuel prices.

As food prices normalize, we see inflation moving down to 3¼ percent in the 
current quarter and holding at this rate through 2017. 
In Brazil , we estimate that real GDP growth edged up in the fourth quarter, 
but only to a meager ¾ percent pace.  Retail sales grew strongly, but business 
confidence was still depressed and exports contracted.  Brazilian inflation 
remained elevated at 6 percent in the fourth quarter, and we expect it to 
moderate to 5¾ percent in the current quarter before settling near 5½ percent 
over the remainder of the forecast period.  Elsewhere in South America, 
Argentina and Venezuela remained mired in recession, and growth in Chile 
and Colombia continued to be below trend.  Looking ahead, economic growth 
in South America is projected to average a subdu ed 1 percent rate in the first 
half of the year, restrained by lower commodity prices and, in Brazil, tighter 
macroeconomic policies.  Thereafter, we expect the region’s recovery to 
gradually firm, with growth rising to 2½ percent in 2016 a nd a trend pace of 
2¾ percent in 2017.  All told, our outlook for South America is almost 
¼ pe rcentage point weaker than in the December Tealbook, reflecting the 
negative effects of the recent decline in commodity prices and a less 
accommodative policy stance in Brazil. 
 Russia and Ukraine. The Russian economy continues to struggle with the 
adverse effects of lower oil prices and Western sanctions.  Market doubts over 
the ability of the authorities to address financial stresses contributed to a free 
fall in the ruble and a surge in CDS spreads in mid-December.  A series of 
policy actions, notably a whopping 650 basis point increase in the policy rate 
to 17 percent, and the provision of liquidity and capital support to Russian 
banks led to an appreciation of the ruble.  Since then, the ruble has resumed 
depreciating and CDS spreads have widened, and both are now back to their 
mid-December levels.  We expect the Russian economy to contract sharply 
this year and to recover only weakly thereafter. 
In Ukraine, a sharp contraction in real GDP last year and plummeting foreign 
reserves have seriously jeopardized the IMF’s Stand -By Arrangement 
progr am agreed to last April.  This outcome has increased the risk of a 
sovereign default, and the government is currently in talks with the IMF on a 
new support package of greater size and longer duration.

GLOBAL IMBALANCES 
 With the current account surpluses of oil-producing countries having been an 
important source of global imbalances, the fall in oil prices might be expected 
to cause a narrowing in global imbalances.  Indeed, the current account 
surplus of the major oil exporters, including the Middle East, Africa, and Russia (the green bars in the following figure), fell significantly in 2014 from 
recent years and is expected to turn to a deficit in 2015. 
 As the figure shows, however, global current account imbalances widened 
somewhat in 2014, despite the fall in oil prices, and are projected to remain 
higher than in recent years.  This outcome reflects a number of factors: First, 
some of the current account surplus economies, such as China, other emerging Asia, and the euro area, are oil-importing countries; the surpluses of these economies increased last year as oil prices fell.  Second, despite a decline in the value of oil imports, past appreciation of the U.S. dollar and relatively 
robust growth result in larger current account deficits for the United States. Finally, as growth strengthens in China’s major advanced -economy trading 
partners, higher demand from these economies should push up China’s current 
account surplus.  Nevertheless, we expect global imbalances to remain 
narrower than in the period preceding the global financial crisis.

Financial Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, amid trading that was volatile at times, longer-term 
sovereign yields in the United States and other advanced economies declined and the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar rose notabl y.  These moves were at tributed in part to 
a deterioration in market sentiment associated  with deflationary pr essures abroad as well 
as an increased concern about the global economic outlook, a concern that might have 
both contributed to and been boosted by further steep declines in oil prices.  U.S. 
economic data releases were viewed by investors as a bit weaker than anticipated, on 
balance, and the expected path of the federal funds rate declined.  Th e prospect of a near-
term announcement of sovereign bond purch ases by the ECB as well as the Swiss 
National Bank’s elimination of its exchange rate floor also  reportedly contributed to 
downward pressure on U.S. and foreign longer-te rm yields.  Equity prices in the United 
States and several foreign economies moved higher, on net, over the period. 
 The intermeeting change in the path fo r the federal funds rate implied by OIS 
quotes suggested a modest delay in the date of liftoff and a slower pace of 
tightening; the implied federal funds ra te at the end of 2017 declined about 
40 basis points to 1.6 percent.  Policy e xpectations of the respondents to the 
Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants 
indicated somewhat increased odds of a la ter liftoff date, but little change in 
the pace of normalization after liftoff, relative to the December surveys. 
 Yields on inflation-indexed bonds dec lined, and those on nominal Treasury 
securities continued to move lower.   Longer-term forward measures of 
inflation compensation fell significantly further to levels at the low ends of their historical ranges. 
 Business financing conditions generally remained accommodative despite 
some pullback in lending to speculative-grade firms; household credit became 
somewhat more available; and loan  demand reportedly strengthened, on 
balance, in the fourth quarter.

  TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period (including the 
December FOMC statement, the Summary of  Economic Projections, the Chair’s press 
conference, and the December FOMC minutes) were characterized as fairly close to 
expectations on balance.  U.S. economic data  releases, on net, were a bit weaker than 
anticipated by market partic ipants, with the lower-than-expected December average 
hourly earnings and retail sales numbers ga rnering some attenti on.  Reflecting these 
perceptions and the dete rioration in market sentiment, th e path of the federal funds rate 
implied by a straight read of financial market quotes shifted down.  In the Desk’s surveys 
of dealers and market partic ipants, the respondents across the surveys continued to view 
June as the most likely FOMC meeting for liftoff, although the average probability 
assigned to liftoff in July or later increased  somewhat.  Expectations for the pace of 
tightening following liftoff were generally little changed si nce the December surveys, and 
the median expected federal funds rate at the end of 2017 stood near  3 percent across the 
two surveys. 
These downward revisions to market-based policy expectations and declines in 
foreign benchmark sovereign yields pushed nomin al Treasury yields lo wer.  On balance, 
the Treasury yield curve flattened over th e intermeeting period, with the 2-, 5-, and 
10-year yields declining 7 basis points, 22 ba sis points, and 23 basis points, respectively, 
amid somewhat increased volatility.  Longe r-term Treasury yields are now near their 
historically low levels.  (See the box “The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields over 
the Past Year” for a discussion of the factors th at appeared to have contributed to the drop 
in yields.)  In addition, th e TIPS-based 5-to-10-year meas ure of inflation compensation 
declined further, falling 19 basis points to 1.8 percent, its lowest le vel in a decade.  (See 
the box “An Update on Measures of Longer-T erm Inflation Compensation and Inflation 
Expectations.”)   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Since the December FOMC meeting, market  participants have focused on actual 
and anticipated changes in monetary polic y abroad coming in response to elevated 
downside risks to the economic outlook and very low and declining rates of inflation in a 
number of jurisdictions.  Greece reemerged as a concern, while Russian financial markets 
remained under pressure despite a number of official measures to reduce volatility.

 The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields over the Past Year 
Despite the increased momentum of the U.S. economic expansion and the expected approach 
of liftoff, longer-term Treasury yields have continued to move down over the past year amid a 
sharp decline in oil prices and a marked appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  The 10-year Treasury 
yield is currently at the low end of its historical range and is only a bit higher than the level seen 
just prior to the “taper tantrum ” in 2013 (figure 1).  Similar declines in longer-term yields to 
historically low levels have been observed in many advanced foreign economies, continuing the 
historical pattern of co-movement in longer-term sovereign yields despite sometimes-divergent 
economic fundamentals and expectations for monetary policy (figure 2). 
As can be seen in figure 3, the fall in the 10-year yield since early 2014 mainly reflects decreases 
in forward rates at horizons of 4 years and beyond.  Indeed, the 1-year forward rate 9 years 
ahead dropped more than 200 basis points over this period to the lowest levels in more than 
30 years .  By contrast, the 1-year forward rate 1 year ahead increased steadily over the same 
period, reflecting investor expectations about the timing of liftoff of the federal funds rate .     
Over this period, the 10-year TIPS real yield has declined 52 basis points and inflation 
compensation has fallen substantially, by 65  basis points , while  survey-based measures of 
inflation expectations have remained stable (see the box “An Update on Measures of Longer -
Term Inflation Compensation and Inflation Expectations”).   
Staff models can be used to decompose the 10-year yield into the average of expected future 
short-term rates over the next 10 years and a term premium that compensates investors for the 
risks associated with longer-term fixed-income assets.  According to these models, the decline 
in the 10-year yield since the beginning of 2014 primarily reflects reductions in the term 
premium, while expected short-term interest rates over the next 10 years have also moved 
down modestly.   In contrast, survey respondents and the staff appear to have revised up their 
projectio
ns for the average future federal funds rate over the same period , likely reflecting the 
expected approach of liftoff and despite frequent market discussions about the possibility of 
secular stagnation.1  This upward revision in average expected future short rates would imply an 
even greater de
cline in the term premium. 
Other than the possibility of somewhat higher concerns about the tail risks of deflation and 
persistently low interest rates in the United States , market participants have cited three main 
explanations for the continued decline in term premiums.  First, a weaker global economic 
outlook and deflationary pressures abroad are thought to have led to increased demand for 
U.S. Treasury securities, putting downward pressure on their yields.  While some of this 
increased demand may reflect safe-haven flows, investors might also have rebalanced their 
portfolios, increasing the weight of U.S. Treasury securities, as sovereign yields in many 
advanced economies have been declining and now lie significantly below U.S. Treasury yields.  
For example , some investors have reportedly engaged in a so-called carry trade by borrowing at 
                                                 
1 Between December 2013 and December 2014, the expected average federal funds rate over the next 
10 years rose about 10 basis points, according to the Desk’s Primary Dealer Survey.  Over the same period, staff 
projections for the 40-quarter-ahead average of the federal funds rate increased about 40 basis points.

 lower rates in other currencies and investing the proceeds in higher-yielding U.S. Treasury 
securities, thereby putting downward pressure on Treasury yields.  However, direct evidence of 
the magnitude of such carry trades is typically hard to find .    
Second, holding U.S. Treasury securities might have become less risky.  Market-based measures 
of the relative risk of outsized increases in long-term rates —such as the swaption-implied 
skew —came down noticeably over the course of 2014, suggesting that market participants 
became less concerned about large upside movements in Treasury yields over the year 
(figure 4).2  In addition, the CAPM beta, which measures the co-movemen t between returns on 
U.S. Treasury bonds and broad equity returns, moved down further in 2014, indicating that 
Treasury bonds may have become a better hedge against stock market fluctuations (figure 4). 
Last, institutional factors could have amplified price movements in Treasury markets.  For 
example, a rapid unwinding of short positions in Treasury securities might have amplif ied the 
decline in yields.  However , one measure of such behavior, the net long speculative position in 
10-year Treasury futures, did not increase significantly over the past year (figure 4). 
Regression analysis indicates that proxies for these three factors can account for only about 
one-fourth of the decline in the 10-year term premium over the past year, suggesting that a 
large portion of the decline in the term premium remains puzzling.3  
 
                                                 
2 The skew is measured as the difference between implied volatilities from swaptions with strike rates 
50 basis points above and 50 basis points below the at-the-money rate. 
3 We regress the 10-year yield on net foreign purchases of Treasury coupon securities, the CAPM beta, 
speculative positions in Treasury futures, and swaption-implied volatility.

 An Update on Measures of Longer-Term Inflation Compensation  
and Inflation Expectations 
Measures of longer-term inflation compensation from TIPS and from inflation swaps, such as 5- to-
10-year forward inflation compensation, have declined notably since last summer to levels 
comparable to those last seen during the 2008 financial crisis (figure 1).  In contrast, survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations have generally remained stable over that period 
(figure 2).  Recent FOMC statements have noted these developments and stated that the 
Committee would continue to monitor inflation developments closely.  This box provides an 
update on these developments.1 
Both TIPS- and swaps-based measures of inflation compensation reflect not only expected 
inflation but also an inflation risk premium, as well as other premiums driven by liquidity 
differences and shifts in the relative supply and demand of nominal versus inflation-indexed 
securities.  Staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and New York maintain 
term structure models that aim to disentangle the various components of inflation compensation 
and to provide estimates of inflation expectations and risk premiums.  Nominal Treasury yields, 
along with inflation swap rates in the Cleveland Fed model and TIPS yields in the two other 
models, are modeled as functions of a small number of factors.  The Board model has a separate 
latent factor to capture the potential departure of TIPS yields from the “true” real yields , while 
the New York Fed model ties the TIPS liquidity premium to several observed liquidity indicators in 
the TIPS market.  In contrast, the Cleveland Fed model does not explicitly account for other 
premiums that might be associated with inflation swaps.  The three models also differ in other 
aspects of their specifications and in their implementation, which could potentially lead to 
significant differences in their results.  
As shown in figure 3, staff models generate relatively stable estimates of 5- to-10-year inflation 
expectations and do not indicate notable declines in longer-term inflation expectations since last 
summer.   As seen in figure 4, while the New York Fed model points to notably lower inflation risk 
premiums 
over this period, the Board and the Cleveland Fed models show only a modest decline 
in the inflation risk premium and attribute a large portion of the decline in inflation compensation 
to changes in other unexplained premiums (not shown). 
 
                                                 
1 For a more detailed analysis of this topic, see Yuriy Kitsul, “ A Review of Market- and Survey-Based Measures 
of Medium- and Longer-Term Inflation Expectations ,” memorandum to the Board of Governors, December 10, 
2014.

 A decline in inflation risk premiums appears to be consistent with the relative changes in the 
distributions of future inflation derived from surveys and from inflation caps and floors .  Survey -
based distributions of 5- to-10-year forward inflation have generally remained stable since last 
summer (figure 5).   In contrast, the risk-ne utral  distribution derived from inflation caps and floors 
suggests that investors may have become more concerned about low er inflation outcomes and 
less concerned about high er inflation outcomes since that summer (figure 6).2  This shift could 
reflect an increase in the perceived likelihood of low inflation outcomes as well as an increased 
willingness to pay higher premiums for insurance against such outcomes, perhaps because 
investors increasingly associate them with poor economic performance. 
In summary , despite the recent notable decline in longer-term inflation compensation, surveys 
and staff models generally continue to point to stable longer-term inflation expectations.  Staff 
models estimate that the inflation risk premium has declined somewhat, and that investors may 
have become more concerned about the risk of low inflation outcomes, thereby contributing to 
the decline in inflation compensation.  A number of other factors, including increased demand for 
U.S. nominal Treasury securities in response to an increase in perceived downside risks to 
economic activity and inflation overseas, may have also placed downward pressure on nominal 
Treasury yields and hence on inflation compensation (see the box “The Decline in Long-Term 
Treasury Yields over the Past Year ”). 
 
                                                 
2 The inflation caps-and-floors-based distribution is for the average inflation rate over the next 10 years  
because there is no available estimate of the distribution of the 5- to-10-year forward inflation rate.

  On January 15, the Swiss National Bank (S NB) terminated its policy of defending 
an exchange rate floor of 1.20 Swiss francs per euro, responding in part to resurgent 
capital inflows as investors anticipated further easing from the ECB, and lowered the 
interest rate it pays on sight deposits from negative 0.25 percen t to negative 0.75 percent.  
The Swiss franc appreciated sharply following the announcement and ended the 
intermeeting period about 9 percent stronger ag ainst the dollar.  Vo latility in foreign 
exchange markets increased following the m ove, and Swiss equity prices fell notably, 
with shares of UBS and Credit Suisse underp erforming the broader market.  Effects on 
U.S. large, systemically important financia l institutions were reportedly small, while 
some hedge funds and retail foreign exch ange brokers suffered sizable losses.  
Advanced foreign economy (AFE) sovereign yields have conti nued to decline, on 
net, since the December FOMC meeting.  Yields in the United Kingdom fell about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period, a nd 10-year German yields declined about 
15 basis points, reflecting in part the antic ipated ECB announcement of sovereign bond 
purchases.  Longer-term market-based measures  of inflation compen sation in the euro 
area moved down further over the period.  Swi ss yields, which fell sharply following the 
SNB decision to lower its policy rate, reco rded negative rates for maturities up to 
10 years.     
Reflecting the uncertainty associated with  upcoming elections, in which the anti-
austerity Syriza party may garn er a plurality of votes, yiel ds on Greek sovereign bonds 
climbed to about 9 percentage points above those on comparable-maturity German bonds.  
(See the box “Recent Developments in Greece” in the International Economic 
Developments and Outlook section.)  However,  spreads on Spanish and Italian sovereign 
debt narrowed slightly.    
Foreign equity markets generally moved higher over the period, as stock prices 
recovered from a mid-December slump, but ar e largely unchanged, on net, over recent 
months.  Chinese equity markets rose vigorous ly for most of the intermeeting period but 
fell sharply on January 19, afte r Chinese regulators cracked down on margin lending rule 
violations, ending the period up about 5 percent.    
The broad nominal measure of the foreign exchange value of the dollar has 
increased almost 2 percent since the Decembe r FOMC meeting, as the dollar rose against 
the AFE currency index and was roughly unchanged against the EME index.  The dollar

  appreciated about 8 percent against the eur o, as prospects for sovereign bond purchases 
by the ECB increased.  In a surprise move  on January 21, the Bank of Canada cut its 
policy rate 25 basis points to 0.75 percen t, prompting an immediate 2 percent 
appreciation of the U. S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.   
Russian CDS spreads narrowed and the ruble appreciated in late December 
following steps taken by the central bank and the government to stabilize financial 
markets and shore up the banking sector.  Howe ver, since the end of  the year, financial 
market stresses have resumed:  CDS spreads and the ruble both returned to near their 
mid-December levels, and Fitch Ratings a nd S&P both downgraded Russia’s sovereign 
credit rating to one notch  above “junk” status.   
EQUITY PRICES AND BUSINESS FINANCE  
In recent weeks, U.S. equity markets we re volatile, but the major indexes ended 
the period up about 2½ percent, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Stock prices for 
large energy firms, which had fallen shar ply over the previous intermeeting period, 
increased, on net, about in line with the overall market.  The VIX fell back from its mid-
December highs but subsequently retraced  to end the period down just a touch, on 
balance, at the high end of its range over the past year.2   
Spreads of 10-year corporate bond yiel ds over those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities also fluctuated over th e period but were little changed, on net, for 
investment-grade issuers and slightly lower for speculative-grade firms.  Overall, 
corporate bond spreads across the credit spectrum remained near their historical median 
levels.  Five-year bond spreads for speculative-grade energy companies narrowed somewhat but stayed close to their highest levels in three years, likely reflecting 
continuing concerns about the near-term credit outlook for such firms. 
After accounting for typical seasonal pattern s, credit flows to nonfinancial firms 
generally remained strong through the last quarter of 2014, though they slowed somewhat 
for riskier firms.  Gross corporate bo nd issuance continued to be solid, although 
speculative-grade issuance late in the year dr opped more than would be expected based 
on historical patterns.  Earl y indicators suggest that bond issuance has been subdued this 
                                                 
2 Relative to the close of the December Tealbo ok, broad stock price indexes declined about 
2 percent, while the VIX moved up a bit.  Meanwhile, Treasury yields decreased a bit more than over the 
intermeeting period.

  month, particularly for speculative-grade fi rms.  Nonfinancial commercial paper 
outstanding was about unchanged in the fourth quarter.   
Commercial and industrial loans continued to  expand at a robust rate last quarter.  
According to the January SLOOS, banks re ported stronger loan demand from large and 
middle-market firms.  However, several ba nks reported having tightened standards and 
terms for oil and gas firms.  Moreover, some banks indicated that they expected to see 
some deterioration in the cred it performance of syndicated leve raged loans over this year.  
Institutional leveraged loan issuance in the fourth quarter was at its slowest pace in two 
years, as spreads on newly issued loans in creased and refinanci ng activity declined 
significantly.  Originatio n of new-money loans, however, ra n at about the average pace of 
the past two years, driven by merger a nd acquisition activity.  U.S. CLO issuance 
declined but remained solid, and 2014 was the strongest year on record for the issuance 
of such securities. 
In the fourth quarter, financing for the comm ercial real estate (CRE) sector stayed 
accommodative regardless of loan size and pr operty type.  In the January SLOOS, banks 
reported that standards continued to ease,  on net, for CRE lending and cited stronger 
demand for all CRE loan types.  The volum e of CMBS issuance stayed solid in 
November and December, supported by low in terest rates and steady increases in 
property values.  CMBS spreads remained narrow through the end of December.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
There were a few indications over the inte rmeeting period that th e availability of 
mortgage credit had increased somewhat, a lthough mortgage lending standards continued 
to be tight for borrowers with less-than-pristine credit histories.   Respondents to the 
January SLOOS indicated that lending sta ndards on GSE-eligible home-purchase loans 
eased in the fourth quarter, perhaps reflecting in part th e GSEs’ announcement that they 
will start purchasing loans with higher loan-to-value ratios.  In addition, the 
announcement that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) will reduce mortgage 
insurance premiums by about one-third relative to the level that prev ailed during the past 
four years is expected to make FHA loans mo re attractive to borrowe rs.  More generally, 
the price of mortgage credit for qualified borrowers fell further over the intermeeting 
period:  The 30-year fixed mortgage rate declined 16 basis points.  Taking a longer 
perspective, mortgage rates have fallen about  75 basis points over th e past year and are 
not far from their all-time lows reached in 2012.  Likely owing to th e recent declines in

  mortgage rates, applications for refinances rose considerably in the past two weeks, 
reaching their highest level since the sec ond half of 2013.  Nevertheless, refinance 
applications remain much lower than the le vel seen in 2012 and the first half of 2013.   
Conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely accommodative over the 
intermeeting period.  Auto and student loan ba lances continued to post significant growth 
through November, while the expansion of credit card loans on banks’ books remained 
moderate during the fourth quarter as a whole.  Respondents to the January SLOOS 
indicated that demand for auto and credit card loans had stre ngthened further in the fourth 
quarter, while standards and terms for these loan s were little changed on net.  Issuance of 
consumer ABS continued to be robust last  quarter, and yield spreads on ABS remained 
tight. 
Consumer credit quality stayed strong, on balance, with delinquencies on credit 
card loans hovering near historical lows.  The credit performance of auto loans, however, 
reportedly deteriorated a bit further for lenders holding sizable amounts of subprime 
loans, and several banks indicated in th e January SLOOS that they expected the 
performance of subprime auto loans held on their books to worsen this year.   
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
Since the December FOMC meeting, large bank equity prices fell about 
4½ percent, on net, and CDS spreads for such institutions increased moderately.  Of those 
large banks that have reported earnings, the majority have missed analysts’ profit 
forecasts for the fourth quarter; large bank prof itability declined a b it, reportedly because 
of continued litigation expens es, a decrease in trading revenue, and pressures on net 
interest margins from low interest rates. 
Bank credit decelerated slightly in the fourth quarter amid somewhat slower 
growth across the major categories of core  loans.  Meanwhile, large domestic banks’ 
combined holdings of reserve balances and Treasury securities, which account for the 
majority of their high-quality liquid assets  under the Basel III li quidity requirements, 
continued to grow at about the robust and re latively stable pace seen since the end of 
2013.   
M2 expanded at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in December, reflecting strong 
growth in liquid deposits and U.S. currency.  Currency growth picked up, a result of

  increased shipments to countries in the former Soviet Union, which reportedly 
experienced a surge in public demand for U.S. dollars.  The monetary  base increased at 
an annual rate of about 32½ percent last month, primarily reflecting the increase in 
reserve balances associated with the mid-m onth maturity of nearly $400 billion in term 
deposits. 
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Testing of the Federal Reserve’s term and overnight re verse repurchase agreement 
(term RRP and ON RRP) operations con tinued over the intermeeting period.3  Although 
the first two term auctions (conducted prio r to the December FOMC meeting) were 
oversubscribed, the third and fourth term operations were undersubscribed; money 
market funds accounted for the majority of take-up in all four operations.  Term RRP 
take-up cumulated to $226 billion, and ON RRP take-up on December 31, 2014, climbed 
to $171 billion.  The unwinding of the term  operations on January 5, 2015, was orderly, 
and no market dislocatio ns were reported.   
Overall, the ON RRP and term RRP operati ons appeared to ease downside rate 
pressures in money markets over year-end.4  On December 31, the effective federal funds 
and Eurodollar rates did not fall below the ON RRP offered rate, and the overnight repo 
rate for Treasury collateral, as surveyed by the Desk, stayed within a range of 9 to 
11 basis points through the year-end period.5  However, some upside pressures emerged 
in a few money markets.  For example, A2/P 2 nonfinancial CP rates rose leading into 
year-end, reportedly reflecting the elevated ra tes paid by low-credit-quality borrowers 
amid thin markets at this time;  GCF rates also increased.   
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury and MBS markets remained relatively stable 
over the intermeeting period, although some typical deterioration was evident around 
                                                 
3 On January 16, 2015, the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York announced that 25 institutions 
were being added as RRP counterparties, bringing the total number of counterparties to 164.   
4 For details on the RRP operations and their e ffect on money markets, see James Egelhof , 
Elizabeth Klee, Joshua Louria, John McGowan, Zeynep Senyuz, Jacqueline Yen, and Patricia Zobel 
(forthcoming), “Assessment of Overnight and Term Reverse Repo Testing over Year-End,” memorandum to the FOMC. 
5 The effective federal funds rate averaged 12 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

  year-end.6  The Desk purchased $22 billion of  agency MBS under the reinvestment 
program and conducted a limited amount  of dollar rolls over the period.7  The ratio of the 
Desk’s MBS settlements to gross issuance of these securities declined to 37 percent in 
December, partly reflecting an  uptick in MBS issuance.

testing operational readiness over the intermeeting period .  MBS sales totaled $315 million in current face 
value.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first 
scenario, wage growth is significantly lower than in our baseline outlook, leading to a 
lower path of headline price inflation in coming years.  The next two scenarios explore 
the implications of misperceptions about potential output. In the second scenario, 
potential output grows faster than in the baseline, whereas the third scenario features a 
deeper and more protracted reduction in potential output growth.  These two scenarios have opposing implications for the indicated pace of policy tightening.  The fourth 
scenario examines the possibility that the better-than-expected improvements in the labor market and in GDP growth in recent months portend a stronger pace for the economic 
expansion and higher inflation over the projection period.  In the fifth scenar io, foreign 
economic growth is significantly weaker than in our baseline outlook, as spillovers from 
a reemergence of crisis in Greece trigger a recession in the euro area.  The final scenario 
considers the possibility that faster foreign growth leads investors to reassess the risks to 
the global economy and push down the dollar. 
We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the final two 
using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its effective lower bound, its movements are governed as in the baseline forecast by an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in 
the Committee’s recent statements.
1 In all cases, we assume that the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
1As in the baseline, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in June 2015. In the discussion of 
several scenarios, we also consider the implications of introducing an inflation floor to capture the 
Committee’s intention to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate especially if projected 
inflation continues to run below the Committee s 2 percent longer-run goal,” as described in the December 
FOMC statement. For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the 
FRB/US simulations. One key difference relative to the FRB/US simulations is that the policy rule in 
SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of 
the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

Weaker Wage Growth 
The markup of prices over unit labor costs has been rising steadily since 2000.  In 
the baseline projection, this markup roughly flattens out over the forecast period as gains 
in hourly labor compensation pick up from around 2 percent in recent years to 
3½ percent, on average, during 2016 and 2017.  However, little acceleration is yet 
evident in the data. In this scenario, we assume that hourly compensation rises only 
2 percent per year from 2015 to 2019, about the rate observed over the past five years.  In 
the FRB/US model, weak wage growth pass es through to lower headline inflation; this 
pass-through is only partial, however, so the markup continues to rise.  
Inflation declin es persistently as a result of the lower wage growth, falling below 
1 percent in 2018. GDP growth and the unemployment rate remain very close to baseline 
through 2016 but deviate more significantly after 2017 ; the unemployment rate is 
0.4 percentage point lower than in the baseline at the end of 2019, reflecting a distinctly more accommodative monetary policy.
2 
In light of the large a nd persistent decline of inflation in this scenario, monetary 
policymakers might alternatively choose to implement an inflation floor similar to that 
discussed in note 1.  Under this kind of policy, the federal funds rate would stay at its 
effective lower bound through 2019.  The added stimulus would boost real activity and 
inflation, but inflation would nonetheless remain well below the Committee’s long -run 
objective.  
Room to Grow 
Both unemployment and inflation have continued to surprise us on the downside.  
One potential reason why wage and price gains have remained modest despite falling 
unemployment may be that the staff’s estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is 
too high.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 
lower in the past five years than assumed by the staff and that it continues to fall, 
eventually reaching 4.2 percent later this year, 1 percentage point below the current 
2 Given the tenuous nature of the empirical evidence linking labor costs to inflation, we also 
consider the possibility that there is no pass-through from labor compensation to headline inflation. In this 
case, the markup rises a touch more steeply than in the scenario reported in the text. As a result of a lower 
propensity to spend by firms relative to households, GDP growth is about ¼ percentage point lower at the 
end of 2015 and the beginning of 2016. The unemployment rate is about 0.1 percentage point higher on 
average. The federal funds rate lifts off in the second quarter of 2015, but rises less steeply, reaching 
3½ percent in 2019.

estimate in the baseline.  In addition, we assume that structural productivity gains in 
recent years have been about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  With these 
assumptions, potential output rises, on average, a bout ½ percentage point more than in 
the baseline over the 2015 19 pe riod.  The output gap closes only in the middle of 2017. 
Inflation stays below the baseline through 2019, reflecting diminished pressures 
from resource utilization.  The federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound for 
an additional year, lifting off in the second quarter of 2016.  The unemployment rate continues falling after 2016, closing the unemployment gap at the end of 2017 and 
moving below the assumed natural rate thereafter. Real GDP growth picks up, reaching 
close to 4 percent in the first half of 2017 before slowing to jus t below 3 percent by the 
end of 2019.  This acceleration is due not only to higher structural productivity, but also to more accommodative monetary policy.
3 
No Room to Grow 
Contrary to the premise of the previous scenario, this one considers the possibilit y 
that the natural rate may be higher and structural productivity growth lower than in the 
baseline, consistent with some of the models we consult.  Specifically, we assume that 
structural productivity gains in recent years have been slower than the staff currently 
estimates and will continue to be so over the projection period.  In addition , we assume 
that the natural rate of unemployment has been declining more slowly than in the baseline since early 2011 and will reach 5.2 percent only by the end of 2019.  With these 
assumptions, potential output has expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent, on average, since 2011, about 0.4 percentage point below the baseline; looking ahead, it rises at a 
1½ percent pace through 2019.  As a consequence of this revision to potential output, the 
output gap is estimated to have closed in the third quarter of 2014 and real GDP currently 
stands ½ percent above potential.  
Compared with the baseline, GDP growth is about 1 percentage point slower in 
2016 and 2017, as households and firms condition their spending on lower levels of and 
slower anticipated growth in permanent income and potential output.  Inflation is 
slightly higher than in the baseline, reflecting the effects of both tighter resource 
3 Implementing an inflation floor in this scenario would delay liftoff until the third quarter of 
2017. This additional accommodation raises GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 somewhat, decreases 
unemployment by an additional ¼ percentage point in 2019, and allows inflation to move slightly faster 
toward the Committee’s target.

utilization and lower productivity.  Inflation reaches the Committee’s target by the 
middle of 2017 and remains just above this level in 2018 and 2019.  The unemployment 
rate begins to move up slowly in 2016 and reaches 5.4 percent in 2019, 0.3 percentage 
point higher than in the baseline and 0.2 percentage point above its natural rate.  The federal funds rate rises more steeply than in the baseline in the first six quarters after 
liftoff.  
Faster Recovery w ith Higher Inflation 
Over the past year, the unemployment rate has continued to move down 
appreciably.  At the same time, lending standards have continued to ease, manufacturing 
output growth has been solid, oil prices have fallen, and fiscal policy restraint has faded.  
In this scenario, these favorable developments solidify household and business 
confidence about the durability of demand going forward; the resulting strong spending 
growth supports a much more robust economic recovery than in the baseline.  We also 
assume that inflation will be more sensitive to reductions in resource slack than is 
implicit in the FRB/US model, in line with the larger cyclical effects on inflation in some DSGE models.  
Real GDP growth is close to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, compared with 
2¾ percent in the baseline projection; the unemployment rate falls to about 4¼ percent by the end of 2017.  With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the baseline, reaching 2½ percent at the beginning of 2019.
4 The federal funds rate lifts 
off in the second quarter of 2015, as in the baseline, but rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in the second half of 2017 and 5 percent at the end of 2018.  Given 
enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent. 
Recession in the Euro Area 
As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook box 
“Recent Developments in Greece,” we assume that the euro area will experience only 
modest and short-lived spillovers from developments in Greece, reflecting our view that Greece is likely to work out a compromise with its international creditors that gives it 
renewed access to EU-IMF financial assistance.  However, the euro area is clearly 
4 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially steeper wage and price 
Phillips curves used in this scenario. Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation 
would have peaked at 2 percent.

vulnerable to much worse outcomes. In this scenario, we consider the possibility that 
heightened anxiety about an exit of Greece from the euro area as debt negotiations 
break down has much larger adverse spillovers, especially to the periphery, and pushes 
the euro area back into recession. 
Specifically, we assume that ongoing problems in Greece cause periphery 
sovereign and private borrowing spreads to rise about 250 basis points above baseline by 
the middle of this year and euro-area consumer and business confidence to 
decline.  These developments in turn prompt the ECB to expand its purchases of euro-
area sovereign bonds by €500 billion more than we have already built into the baseline.  
Notwithstanding this aggressive monetary easing and a 10 percent further depreciation of 
the euro against the dollar, euro-area GDP contracts 1½ percent in 2015 and only rises about 1 percent in 2016.  Our scenario also assumes that the EMEs experience a modest 
tightening in financial conditions and depreciation of their currencies against the dollar. 
U.S. real exports fall relative to baseline in response to the weaker foreign activit y 
and a 5 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar.  Nevertheless, given that financial 
spillovers to economies outside of Europe are assumed to be quite limited in this scenario 
and that U.S. monetary policy has scope to slow the pace of tightening, the overall effect 
on the U.S. economy is fairly contained.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands roughly 
2 percent in 2015, ¾ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Lower domestic and 
imported inflation cause U.S. core inflation to run at about 1 percent in 2015 and 
2016.  The federal funds rate lifts off at the same time as in the baseline but follows a 
shallower path after liftoff. 
Greater Confidence in Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar 
Some of the dollar’s sharp appreciation since June appears to refl ect markets ’ 
increasing confiden ce in U.S. growth prospects, even as the outlook for foreign growth 
has become somewhat more uncertain and the risk of adverse outcomes more 
pronounced.  This scenario assumes that foreign growth runs only modestly higher than 
in our baseline about ½ percentage point in 2015 but that the more favorable 
incoming data gradually increase confidence that growth abroad will be solid and 
sustained.  This more sanguine foreign growth outlook in turn causes the broad real dollar to depreciate about 6 percent relative to baseline by end-2016 undoing about half the 
dollar’s appreciation since June—and helps boost the Brent price of oil about $15 above its baseline path.

Despite the drag from higher oil prices, the weaker dollar and stronger foreign 
growth boost U.S. real activity by causing U.S. real net exports to expand relative to the 
baseline.  Core PCE inflation runs well above baseline as the weaker dollar puts upward 
pressure on import prices, resource slack narrows more quickly, and some modest pass-
through of higher oil prices occurs.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands by about 3¼ percent 
in 2015, about ½ percentage point more than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation runs above 2 percent in 2016 and 2017, while the unemployment rate falls to about 
4½ percent.  The federal funds rate lifts off at the same time as in the baseline, but rises

HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
