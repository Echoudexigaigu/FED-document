Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that has become available during the intermeeting period 
suggests that aggregate spending has been weaker, and the labor market somewhat 
stronger, than we had projected in the January Tealbook.  In particular, real GDP is estimated to have increased at a 2 percent annual rate in the fo urth quarter of last year and 
we project a 2¼ percent pace of growth in the fi rst half of this year.  These growth rates 
are both about ½ percentage point below our previous projection.  In contrast, payroll 
employment increases have averaged about 50,000 per month faster over the past three 
months than we expected, and we have rais ed projected employment growth in the near 
term by 30,000 per month.   
While we anticipate that some of the recent weakness in GDP growth will be 
transitory, our forecast of output at the end of 2017 is revised down by 1 percent 
compared with the January T ealbook—largely in response to a further appreciation of the 
dollar.  We now project that real GDP will expand 2¼ percent in both 2015 and 2016, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy.  In 2017, the continued normalization of monetary policy induces a slightly easi ng of growth to 2 percent.     
Confronted with the fact that aggreg ate spending appears to have been 
disappointingly sluggish of late and yet sufficient to have gene rated at least as much labor 
market improvement as we had expected, we trimmed our assumption for structural 
productivity growth in the second half of last year.  In addition, we propagated forward a small part of that adjustment to structur al productivity growth through the medium-term 
projection.  Consequently, poten tial output at the end of 2017 is a little more than 
½ percent below its level in the January Teal book.  The combination of lower actual and 
potential GDP generates a GDP gap that is w eaker than in our Janua ry projection, but not 
by as much as the downward revision to act ual GDP alone would suggest.  Even so, over 
the course of the projection, actual GDP sw ings from an estimated 1 percent below 
potential in the current quarter to ½ percen t above potential at the end of 2017.     
The unemployment rate declines in this projection from 5.5 perc ent last month to 
5.0 percent in the final quarter of 2017, 0.2 pe rcentage point below our estimate of its 
natural rate.  The decrease in  the unemployment rate contin ues to be more gradual than 
one would infer from the change in the GDP gap, as some of the economy’s cyclical

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP 
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, 
following the December 2014 FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s 
current economic projection with the one we presented in the December Tealbook. 
Since the December projection, we have revised down, on net, our forecast for real GDP 
growth over the next three years, primarily reflecting the effects of a higher projected 
path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar. We also have slightly lowered our 
assumed path for potential GDP growth over both the medium and longer term portions 
of the projection period. Altogether, these revisions leave our proje ction for the GDP gap 
next year and in 2017 somewhat weaker than in the December forecast. The 
unemployment rate has declined a bit more than we expected in December and is 
projected to average 5.2 percent over the second half of this year, equal to the staff’s 
estimate of its natural rate. By the end of the medium term projection, the 
unemployment rate is revised up just a touch to 5.0 percent, still ¼ percentage point 
below its natural rate. 
The staff’s projections for both headline and core PCE inflation have been revised down 
in the near term, partly reflecting recent soft readings for core inflation; on net, 
consumer energy prices have declined only a little more than we had expected in 
December. Given our assumptions that longer run inflation expectations will remain 
stable over the medium term and that declines in energy prices and core import prices 
will be transitory, our forecasts  for headline and core inflation after this year are little 
changed. We continue to project that inflation will run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective through 2017.

As discussed in the box “Changes to Longer Run Interest Rates,” we adjusted downward 
our assumptions about long run equilibrium interest rates. Specifically, we lowered our 
assumed longer run nominal value of the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, to 
3½ percent. By design, we insulated our projection of real economic activity from being 
boosted by this adjustment. With the downward revision to our assumption for longer
run equilibrium interest rates and relatively small changes in our projections for the GDP 
gap and inflation, the medium term path for the federal funds rate in the current 
projection is only a bit more than ¼ percentage point lower than in December. 
Because FOMC participants are providing additional information about their expectations 
of the economic conditions that will exist at the time they anticipate it will first become 
appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, we include the table 
below providing quarterly information from the staff projection. In the second quarter of 
this year—the quarter when our baseline projection assumes liftoff of the federal funds 
rate will occur—we forecast the unemployment rate to average 5.3 percent and the 
trailing four quarter change in real GDP to be 2.8 percent.1 We project the trailing four
quarter change in core PCE inflation to be 1.1 percent, and the four quarter change in 
headline PCE prices to be flat because of the declines in energy prices. (We do not 
anticipate that the recent decreases in energy prices will fall out of the four quarter 
change in headline inflation until early next year.)

not be available until after the quarter has ended. Staff Economic Projections Compared with the December Tealbook, Quarterly

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff forecasts of real GDP growth and inflation are, on balance, a little lower 
than the most recent Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) median and Blue 
Chip Consensus outlooks. Meanwhile, the staff’s forecast of the unemployment 
rate is in line with those surveys in 2015 but a little higher than the Blue Chip 
in 2016.

improvement takes the form of an unwinding of the current unusual weakness in the labor 
force participation rate and some diminishme nt of the currently elevated number of 
involuntary part-time workers. 
As a result of the earlier sharp declines in crude oil prices, headline PCE prices 
decreased last quarter, and we expect an even larger decline this quarter.  In addition, we 
have marked down our forecast for core PCE inflation in the current quarter to just 
¾ percent in response to softne ss in the incoming price data and to the higher exchange 
value of the dollar.  Neverthe less, we still expect core PC E price inflation to step up 
gradually to 1¾ percent by 2017, as  resource utilization tighten s further and import prices 
increase.  With oil prices havi ng turned up in recent weeks and projected to rise further, 
total PCE inflation follows a slightly highe r trajectory than core inflation over the 
medium term.  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its current 
target range after the June FOMC meeting, and that following liftoff, the rate 
will rise at a pace determined by the pres criptions of an inertial version of the 
Taylor (1999) policy rule.  However, we lowered our assumption for the equilibrium real federal funds rate by  25 basis points this round, which, in 
conjunction with a somewhat weaker pa th for the output gap, resulted in a 
shallower trajectory of th e federal funds rate in th is projection.  (See the box 
“Changes to Interest Rates in the L onger Run.”)  We now project that the 
federal funds rate will average 2.7 percen t in the fourth quarter of 2017, about 
0.5 percentage point lower than was projected in the January Tealbook.   
Other Interest Rates 
 Over the next couple of years the increas e in 10-year Treasury yields is less 
steep than in the previous Tealbook, refl ecting the lower path  of short-term 
interest rates.  Our projection continues to call for a significant rise in Treasury yields through 2017, as the eff ects of the FOMC’s balance sheet 
policies wane and the 10-year valuati on window moves through the period of 
extremely low short-term interest rates.

Changes to Interest Rates in the Longer Run 
In this Tealbook, we lowered our assumptions for the longer-run values of the federal funds rate 
and the 10-year Treasury yield by ¼ percentage point, to 3½ percent and 4¼ percent, respectively.  
Because longer- run inflation remains unchanged at the Committee’ s objective of 2 percent, these 
reductions i n nominal interest rates reflect a reduction in long-run equilibrium real interest rates. 
Our decision to reconsider our longer-run interest rate assumptions is motivated by the decline in 
long-term interest rates in both the United States and abroad since we last updated our 
assumptions in June 2014. As discussed in a recent memo to the FOMC, there is good reason to 
ascribe a large portion of the recent downward movement in long-term interest rates to term 
premiums, but we now judge that lower levels of equilibrium interest rates have been playing a 
larger role than we previously thought.1 This reassessment is supported by evidence from time-
series models, such as that of Laubach and Williams (2003), the latest update of which indicates 
that the equilibrium real interest rate has moved down considerably over the past decade or so to 
levels well below historical averages.2 
One likely source of downward pressure on global interest rates is higher global saving a factor 
that was noted even before the financial crisis and may stem from the larger share of world 
output coming from developing countries with relatively high saving rates. Greater risk aversion 
after the financial crisis is also sometimes mentioned as pushing up precautionary savings 
demand. In addition, investment demand has likely been depressed by low trend growth rates i n 
the United States and other advanced economies owing to small er gains in working-age 
populations. In this forecast, we have revised down slightly our assessment of longer-run 
potential GDP growth to 1.9 percent, reflecting our judgment that recent subdued productivity 
gains contain some signal about longer-run increases as well.  This pace for potential output 
growth is well below that seen in the decade prior to the financial crisis (1997 to 2006), when we 
estimate that potential output growth averaged 3 percent. Given the global nature of recent 
interest rate movements, one probably should not look at U.S. potential output growth in 
isolation.  Still, it is worth noting that our downward revision to longer-run interest rates in this 
forecast could be viewed as moving these rates into better alignment with our estimate of 
potential GDP growth. 
Taken together, these forces imply that , all else being equal, aggregate demand will be lower in 
the longer run. As such, to achieve the target level of resource utilization and the Committee’s 
inflation objectives, interest rates will need to be lower.  To ensure that monetary policy will be 
consistent with this new lower level of aggregate demand, we adjusted the constant term in our 
inertial Taylor rul e down to be consistent with a long er-run real federal funds rate of 1½ percent.

 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium 
term have been revised essentially in  line with the path for the Treasury 
yields. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have risen a bit less, on  net, than in our projection from the 
January Tealbook, and over the forecast period they remain close to their 
previous trajectory.  Overall, our projection has stock prices rising at about 7 percent per year. 
 On net, the house price forecast is littl e changed since the January Tealbook.  
We continue to project that house pr ice appreciation will slow further—from 
4½ percent in 2014 to an average rate of  about 3 percent per year from 2015 
to 2017.  
Fiscal Policy 
 Our fiscal policy assumptions are also little different than in the January 
Tealbook.  We continue to anticipate th at the small drag on real GDP growth 
from fiscal policy actions across all levels of government in 2014 will swing 
to a small stimulus from 2015 through 2017.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We project foreign real GDP to grow  at a 2½ percent pace in the current 
quarter and then strengthen to a 3 percent rate by the end of the year, 
reflecting accommodative monetary policie s, depreciated currencies, and still-
low oil prices.  Foreign growth is anti cipated to remain at 3 percent, roughly 
its trend pace, in 2016 and 2017.  The projected pace of foreign growth is 
¼ percentage point lower this year  than in the January Tealbook and 
essentially unrevised in 2016 and 2017.   
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated  4 percent since the time of the 
January Tealbook, responding to a shift up in market expectations for the 
federal funds rate as well as incr eased policy accommoda tion by many foreign 
central banks.  Expectations of continued investor focus on Federal Reserve 
tightening and ongoing concerns about the global outlook lead us to project 
that the dollar will appreciate an a dditional 3¼ percent th rough the remainder

of this year.  Thereafter, as foreign gr owth firms and some prominent tail risks 
(such as Greek exit) recede, the dollar is projected to begin weakening.  On 
average, over the forecast period, the br oad real dollar is 6¼ percent above its 
level in the January Tealbook.  
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has m oved up $8 per barrel since the time of 
the January Tealbook, reaching $56 per barr el on March 10.  The rise appears 
to reflect greater market confidence that the growth of global crude oil 
production will slow over the coming year.  Prices for futures contracts with 
delivery at the end of 2017 also rose, but  by less than the in crease in the spot 
price, reducing the upward ti lt in the futures curve.  Consistent with those 
futures contracts, we project the price of imported oil to move up from 
$59 per barrel this quarter to about $65 per barrel by the end of the forecast 
period—a projected path that is $7 per ba rrel higher this year and $4 per barrel 
higher by the end of 2017 than in the January Tealbook. 
 In contrast to the recent increases in o il prices, metals prices have generally 
remained depressed, reflecting both  dollar appreciation and continued 
concerns about global growth.   
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As noted in the introduction, the incoming spending data have been disappointing.  
We now estimate that real GDP rose at an a nnual rate of 2 percent in the fourth quarter, 
½ percentage point below the January Tealbook estimate, and we have revised down our forecast for the first half of this year by a comparable amount, to an average annual rate 
of 2¼ percent.  We judge that severe weathe r may have held down activity a little in the 
first quarter, but any such effect will be reversed in the second quarter.
1 
 A little more than half of the downward surprise to GDP has been in net 
exports.  Reflecting past appreciation  of the dollar, net exports are now 
estimated to have subtracted 1 percenta ge point from real GDP growth in the 
1 Although some anecdotal evidence  points to the labor disruptions at West Coast ports as having 
restrained exports or consumer spending on imports, our assessment is that the GDP implications of those 
effects have been small.

fourth quarter and are expected to subtract nearly 1 percentage point in the 
first half of this year.   
 Real PCE growth appears to have been solid last quarter but  to have slowed 
modestly in the current quarter.  Anecdotal reports suggest consumer 
purchases, particularly for motor vehicl es, in the current quarter may have 
been inhibited somewhat by unseasonably cold and snowy weather, though this damping effect is partially offset by increased outlays for energy services.  
As the fundamental forces supporting consumer spending remain strong, we 
expect consumption growth to pick up in the second quarter and to average a 
4 percent pace in the first half of the year.

 The incoming data on housing starts a nd home sales have continued to fall 
short of our expectations.  We remain puzzled by the failure of a more robust 
recovery to resume in this sector; for the near term, we are essentially projecting more of the same and expect residential investment to increase only 
5 percent at an annual rate in  the first of the year, close to its rate in the fourth 
quarter.  (Also see the box “Evaluati ng Mortgage Availability.”)      
 After rising at a solid pace through much of last  year, business fixed 
investment decelerated in the fourth quarter and is expected to decelerate 
further in the first half of this year, as sharp declines in outlays for drilling 
structures (at more than 30 percent at an annual rate over the first half of the 
year) in response to the large drop in crude oil prices largely offset moderate increases in other capital expenditures.  
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Over the medium term, the ongoing normali zation of monetary policy contributes 
to the slowing of GDP growth toward its potential rate.  Real GDP is projected to 
increase 2¼ percent both this year and in 2016 be fore edging down to 2 percent in 2017.

 Evaluating Mortgage Availability 
In the aftermath of the mortgage crisis and amid the slow recovery in housing market 
activity, a number of researchers have developed new measures of mortgage credit 
availability.  For example, analysts at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and at the 
Urban Institute have both construct ed measures of  the riskiness of newly originated 
mortgages, while the Mortgage Bankers Association summarizes the attributes of loans 
that lenders are willing to make.  While valuable, these measures do not convey the 
heterogeneity in credit conditions that potential buyers face, and they may confound 
changes in mortgage availability with changes in mortgage demand.  In this discussion, 
we present some new measures of mortgage availability that Board staff have developed 
with the aim of addressing these issues. 
We consider two measures of mortgage availability.  First, we measure the maximum 
loan amount in real terms that borrowers are able to obtain in a particular period given 
their credit score —the “loan -amount frontier. ”  The solid line in figure 1 shows this 
frontier for 2014, which we construct using data on all types of first-lien purchase 
originations that amortize over 30 years (the grey dots in the figure). 1  Second, we 
estima
te the “LTV frontier,” which shows the maximum loan- to-value (LTV) ratio that 
borrowers can obtain given their credit score.  The LTV frontier and the underlying 
purchase originations data for 2014 are shown in figure 2.   Of course, these two measures 
do not completely characterize mortgage availability conditions, as they abstract from 
other relevant borrower characteristics, such as income and other debt, as well as other 
aspects of mortgage availability, such as overall cost to the borrower.  
 
 
                                                 
1 The frontier is estimated using a method that is more robust to outliers than standard frontier 
estimation techniques.  See Catherine Cazals, Jean-Pierre Florens, and Léopold Simar (2002), 
“Nonparametric Frontier Estimation:  A Robust Approach,” Journal of Econometrics , vol. 106 (1), pp. 1 –25.

Not surprisingly, both frontiers indicate that lenders in 2014 were willing to extend larger 
loans with lower down payments to borrowers with better credit scores .  The frontiers 
also show that borrowers with very low credit scores were essentially unable to obtain a 
loan at all last year .  We think that our measures are not strongly influenced by demand 
for mortgage credit .  Put in simplest terms, we think there must have been at least a 
small number of people in the country with a credit score of less than 570 who wanted a 
mortgage, yet effectively no one with such a credit score shows up in our data set as 
having obtained a loan, suggesting that lender policy drives the estimate of the frontier.      
 
Figures 3 and 4 plot the two types of frontiers in recent years and in the couple of years 
before the housing market collapse .  Both the loan-amount frontier and the LTV frontier 
in 2014 were well below those seen in the early part of the 2000s for borrowers with 
lower credit scores .  In fact, the LTV frontier suggests that credit has tightened further 
for these borrowers since 2012.  However, for borrowers with credit scores above 700, 
mortgage availability has eased somewhat in recent years, and in 2014, availability by this 
metric was comparable with availability in the early 2000s.      
Like mo
st other measures of mortgage availability, our measures provide a 
straightforward way to assess changes in credit conditions, but assessing whether credit 
is t
ight or loose in an absolute sense requires some judgment about the appropriate level 
of risk.   For example, the AEI analysts conclude that the current level of risk is elevated, 
wh
ile the Urban Institute analysts conclude that mortgage credit is tight ; in part, this 
difference is because they have different assessments of the appropriate level of risk.   
Board staff take the view that mortgage availability is tight for borrowers with lower 
credit scores, but conditions seem favorable for borrowers with higher credit scores, a t 
least in that the loan-amount and LTV frontiers for such borrowers in 2014 were 
comparable with their levels over the past 10 to 15 years .

 Relative to the January Tealbook, we have taken down our forecast for the 
level of real GDP at the end of 2017 by 1 percent.  The downward revision 
largely reflects a stronger dollar, but also higher oil prices.   
 In response to the slower productivity growth implied by the stronger recent 
labor market data and weaker incoming GDP data, we lowered our estimate of 
structural productivity growth in 2014 by ¼ percentage point.  We also took a 
bit of forward signal from the disapp ointing productivity performance and 
nudged down our assumption for structural productivity growth in the projection period to 1½ percen t per year.  On balance, the level of structural 
productivity, and hence the level of pot ential output, at the end of 2017 is 
½ percent lower than in  the January Tealbook. 
 Over the past couple of years, we have  been too optimistic in our assessment 
of aggregate supply conditions; put diffe rently, relative to our assessment in 
real time, currently available data su ggest that a smaller amount of GDP 
growth has been required to genera te a given amount of labor market 
improvement.  In another of a succession of steps we have taken to try to 
balance the risks around this aspect of  the projection, we did not allow the 
modestly slower growth of potential GDP over the next few years to feed 
through directly into a weaker outlook  for aggregate demand.  Instead, this 
lower potential implies a slightly fa ster improvement in the GDP gap, and 
hence the unemployment rate gap, all else  being equal.  Taking into account 
our revisions to both aggregate demand and aggregate supply, actual GDP is 
now projected to be about ½ percent above  the level of potenti al at the end of 
2017, a relative position about ½ percentage  point weaker than  in the January 
Tealbook.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
Since the January Tealbook, the employmen t reports for January and February 
were published.  Taken together, these reports were more positive than we had expected. 
 Over the past three months, payroll employment growth has averaged 290,000 
per month, roughly 50,000 higher than proj ected at the time of the January 
Tealbook.  In response, we raised our forecast for payroll gains to 280,000 in 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

March and to an average of 250,000 per month in the second quarter— 
30,000 more than we had previously projected.3 
 The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in February, 0.1 percentage point 
higher than projected in the January Tealbook.  The small upside surprise for 
the unemployment rate was accompanie d by a higher-than-expected labor 
force participation rate, thus leavi ng the employment-to-population ratio in 
February in line with our previous forecast. 
 We expect the unemployment rate to move down to 5.2 percent by June and the labor force participati on rate to hold steady at 62.8 percent, which, relative 
to its declining trend, is consistent w ith a modest cyclical improvement.   
 The staff’s labor market conditions index, which summarizes the movements 
in 19 labor market indicato rs, continued to improve in January and February 
at a pace similar to the one observed in the second half of last year.  
Consistent with the revisions to the GDP gap, the medium-term outlook for the 
labor market is a little we aker in this projection.   
 We expect monthly job gains to av erage about 240,000 this year before 
slowing to around 180,000 in 2016 and 140,000 in 2017.  These projected 
gains are a little faster this year than we had forecast in January, but they are 
about 50,000 lower per month in 2016 and 10,000 lower in 2017.   
 The unemployment rate is projected to m ove down to 5.0 percent at the end of 
2017, 0.2 percentage point higher than in the January Tealbook and 0.2 percentage point below our es timate of the natural rate. 
 As in previous Tealbooks, we judge that  the unemployment rate gap currently 
understates the amount of slack remaining in the labor market, reflecting an unusually weak recovery in the labor for ce participation rate and, we think, an 
unusually elevated level of involuntar y part-time employment.  With the 
economy improving and real wages rising, we expect additional individuals to 
3 The January employment report incorporated the annual benchmark revisions and a number of 
associated adjustments (including revised seasonal fact ors) as well as newly available survey data.  Taken 
together, these adjustments raised the level of payroll employment in December 2014 by 245,000 compared 
with the value published at the time of the January Tealbook.

be drawn into the labor market a nd the rate of involuntary part-time 
employment to move down.  The improve ment in the labor force participation 
rate relative to its trend attenuates the decline in the unemployment rate, and, 
as a result, we expect that the unemployment rate will only edge down during 
2016 and 2017 even as GDP continues to in crease moderately faster than its 
potential.  
 As shown in the exhibit “Alternative M easures of Slack,” output gaps from 
the Philadelphia Fed’s PRISM model a nd the New York Fed’s DSGE model 
suggest more slack than the staff’s unemployment rate gap.  Alternatively, 
gaps derived from the National Federa tion of Independent Business measure 
of jobs that are hard to fill and the JOLTS job openings rate suggest somewhat tighter labor market conditions.
4 
 We considered lowering our assumpti on for the current natural rate of 
unemployment by ¼ percentage point, to 5 percent.  Arguments in favor of 
such an adjustment include evidence th at increases in disability rolls and 
changes in the age distribution of th e population may have resulted in less 
structural unemployment.  A lower natural rate of unemplo yment (and hence a 
larger unemployment rate gap) might also  be consistent with the muted levels 
of inflation observed in the past couple of years.  Arguments against such an 
adjustment include a possible deterioration of matching efficiency and persistent labor market scarring implie d by the continued elevated level of 
long-term unemployment.  At this point,  we opted to leave our natural rate 
assumption unrevised.       
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The BEA now reports that total PCE pri ces decreased at an  annual rate of 
½ percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and we anticipate  a decline of 2 percent this 
quarter; both declines reflect th e steep drop in crude oil prices since last June.  The recent 
upturn in crude oil prices has led us to ra ise our near-term projection for headline PCE

price inflation, and we now proj ect total PCE prices to rise at a 1¼ percent pace in the 
second quarter.5 
 Core PCE price inflation in the final quar ter of last year, at about 1 percent, 
was in line with our esti mate in the January Tealbook.  However, we have 
lowered our estimate of core PCE price inflation in the current quarter to 
¾ percen t:  Medical services prices came in weaker than expected in January; 
also, core goods prices fell m ore than e xpected and are likely to be held down 
in future m onths by the rise in the dollar.  
 Consumer food price inflation has conti nued to slow from the elevated rates 
observed in the middle of last year, and we now project only a very small 
increase in prices for food purchased fo r home consumption in the first quarter 
of this year.  Given the substantial declines in farm commodity prices 
observed in recent months, consumer f ood price inflation is expected to 
remain soft in the next few quarters.  In the medium term, we project that 
consumer food prices will rise at a pace roughly in line with core inflation.  
Beyond the near term, we continue to exp ect inflation to gradually move higher, 
as energy and core import prices turn up and resource slack diminishes in an environment 
of well-anchored long-run inflation expectations. 
 Core import prices are expected to de cline at an average annual rate of 
4 percent in the first half of this year , reflecting the apprec iation of the dollar 
and net declines in commodity prices.  Given our projecti on that the dollar 
will top out and foreign CPI inflation w ill pick up, core import price inflation 
is expected to turn positive by the end of 2015 and to reach 1¾ percent 
in 2017. 
 Most survey-based measures of long-run inflation expectations, such as those 
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and PCE price 
inflation expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), have 
remained within the narrow range of values seen in recent years.6  TIPS-based 
5 Despite a projected upturn of headline PCE pri ces, the 12-month change is expected to edge 
lower and be near zero in June.

2.1 percent, from 2.2 percent at the time of January Tealbook and 2.5 percent in mid-2012.  The decline

measures of inflation compensation are little changed from the low levels 
observed at the time of the January Tealbook.   
 Because import prices are pr ojected to bottom out late this year, and we think 
the decline in medical care prices will  prove transitory, we have not carried 
the recent surprise in core inflati on forward beyond the near term.  We 
continue to expect core PCE price inflation to edge up gradually from 
1¼ percent this year to 1¾ percent in 2017 as the restraint from import prices 
wanes and slack continues to diminish.  We see some role for the drop in 
energy prices to hold down business costs and so restrain core inflation this 
year and next, but we estimate those effects to be small.  (See the box “The 
Pass-Through of Energy Prices to Core Inflation.”) 
 With consumer energy prices projected to rise faster than core prices 
beginning later this year, total PCE inflation follows a slightly higher 
trajectory than core inflation in 2016 and 2017—increasing at a rate just a 
touch below 2 percent in 2017. 
 Incoming data continue to show a fairly modest pace of wage increases.  
Average hourly earnings of all employ ees were up 2 percent in the 12 months 
through February, in line with the Janua ry Tealbook projection.  Likewise, the 
employment cost index for the fourth quarter was close to our expectation, 
showing a modest acceleration to a 2¼ pe rcent rate of increase over the past 
year.  The growth rate of business-se ctor compensation per hour from the 
“Productivity and Costs” release was re vised up in the second half of 2014, 
and this measure now also shows a four-quarter change of 2¼ percent last 
year.  With labor and product market s tightening over the projection period, 
we expect the productivity and cost measure of hourly compensation to 
accelerate to about 3 percent this year and 3½ percent in 2016 and 2017; this projection is essentially unrevised from the one in the January Tealbook.  (For 
a different perspective on the recen t wage data, see the box “Alternative 
View:  Wages Have Been Accelerating.”) 
from 2.2 percent to 2.1 percent appears to be the result of changes in the composition of panelists between 
surveys rather than a shift in individual panelist vi ews.  The movement in CPI expectations since 2012 
largely reflects a downward movement in expectations of inflation in the next 5 years.  Indeed, expected 
CPI inflation for the period 5 to 10 years ahead shows less decline and currently stands at 2.3 percent.

The Pass-Through of Energy Prices to Core Inflation 
Crude oil prices have fallen about 50 percent, on net, since the middle of 2014, 
placing substantial downward pressure on consumer energy prices and overall 
inflation.  As shown by the blue bars in figure 1 on the next page, the direct 
contribution of the sharp fall in consumer energy prices was to reduce the an nual 
rate of total PCE inflation by 1½ percentage points in the fourth quarter of last year 
and by an estimated 2¾ percentage points in the first quarter of this year .  Unless 
oil prices fall further, we anticipate that these effects on headline PCE inflation will 
be transitory.  Indeed, oil prices already appear to have bottomed out, and the 
futures path for crude oil points to rising oil prices going forward .  Accordingly, w e 
project that consumer energy prices will begin to rise moderately in the second 
quarter (red line) after declining 20 percent, on average, over the previous 
four quarters and that they will make a small positive contribution to PCE 
inflation over the medium term . 
While the direct effect of oil prices on consumer energy prices is relatively 
straightforward to quantify, there is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude 
and timing of the pass-through of energy price changes to core inflation. Much of 
the empirical literature finds that the pass-through of energy prices to core 
inflation was appreciable following the energy price shocks in the 1970s but has 
diminished since the early 1980s.  There are many possible reasons that the pass-
through has declined, including a reduction in the energy intensity of U.S. output, 
the decline in the persistence of core inflation, and the anchoring of inflation 
expectations.  Current estimates of energy price pass-through are typically small 
but are very imprecisely estimated.  However, even if the pass-through of energy 
price changes to core inflation is small, the question remains whether the recent 
decline in energy prices is large enough to produce policy-relevant contributions to 
the path of core inflation. 
The starting point for many of the models that inform the staff’s inflation foreca st 
is the expectations-augmented Phillips curve.1 In this model, core inflation 
depends on long-run inflation expectations, usually proxied by survey-based 
measures; economic slack; and supply shock terms, including relative energy price 
inflation. Depending on the exact specification of the Phillips curve, these models 
estimate that a permanent decline in the level of PCE energy prices of 10 percent 
lowers core PCE prices by a cumulative 0.1 to 0.2 percent after eight quarters. 
Given the se small estimates for the pass-through of energy price changes to core 
inflation, even the very large declines in consumer energy prices since the middle 
of 2014 are projected to have relatively small effects on core PCE inflation.  Figure 2

memorandum to the FOMC, “The Staff’s Outlook for Price Inflation,” by Alan Detmeister, Jean
Philippe Laforte, and Jeremy Rudd.

 shows the estimated contribution of energy price changes to core inflation from 
two of our Phillips curve models along with the staff’s judgmental estimate.  The 
contributions plotted as red bars in the figure come from a model where inflation 
expectations are proxied by long-run inflation expectations from the Michigan 
survey; the blue bars report contributions from a model where expectations are 
pro
xied by the 10-year forecast of PCE inflation from the Survey of Professional 
Forecas
ters, or SPF.   The magnitude and timing of the response of core inflation to 
energy price movements is only slightly different in these two models , and the 
staff’s judgmental estimate, shown by the black line, is similar to both models’  
estimates.2  Changes in energy prices are estimated to have had little effect on 
core i
nflation in 2013 and 2014, but the drop in energy prices since the middle of 
last year is projected to hold down core inflation slightly this year and by one-tenth 
to two-tenths of a percentage point in 2016.  In 2017, the energy price effect on 
core inflation is roughly neutral.  
All of the estimates presented here—like the staff’s inflation projection as a 
whole—are based on the assumption that inflation expectations remain 
stabl
e.  While survey-based measures have moved relatively little in recent years, 
market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined notably, on net, 
since the middle of last year.  If the energy price declines since June were to bring 
about a reduction in the inflation expectations that are relevant for price-setting 
behavior, then energy pass-through likely would be larger and more persistent 
than the staff assumes and would produce additional downward pressure on our 
medium-term inflation forecast.  However, in the absence of a change in inflation 
expectations, estimates from our models suggest that it is unlikely that the drop in 
energy prices to date poses a significant downside risk to our medium- term 
for
ecast of PCE inflation. 
 
                                                 
2 These differences greatly understate the uncertainty around estimates of the energy pass-
through because they do not incorporate, for example, model specification and parameter 
uncertainty or uncertainty about the staff energy price forecast.

 Alternative  View:  Wages  Have Been Accelerating1 
Few signs of acceleration  are evident in the wage series that typically appear in the 
Tealbook,  as they have been presented  there.  However, the  evidence  on acceleration  is 
more mixed when those series  are presented  differently.  Furthermore,  a variety of  other 
data series, which have  proven reliable  in recent years, indicate wages  have been 
accelerating  over most  of this recovery and  continue  to accelerate  now.   
Figure 1 plots four sources of survey data on wage changes not reported  in the Tealbook  
along with one  that is, the  wage and salary component  of the employment  cost index (ECI) 
from the Bureau of  Labor Statistics  (BLS).  Each alternative series  extends back  to the late 
1990s or earlier.  Three  are diffusion indexes, measuring  the breadth of firms reporting  that 
they have raised wages recently (the National  Association  for Business  Economics,  or NABE; 
the National  Federation  of Independent Business, or  NFIB; and the Richmond  Fed 
measures),  while the Duke/CFO  survey reports the average expected  wage increase at 
respondent firms over the  next year.  The  ECI (the blue line) appears  noisier than the 
alternative  wage measures  and shows a less pronounced  cyclical pattern.  In particular,  all 
the alternative  measures  show wage growth as having been extraordinarily  low in 2009 
before stepping  up early in the expansion,  and all show wages accelerating  again in 2014. 
The main  text of the Tealbook  plots two other  wage measures  along with the ECI:  average  
hourly earnings (AHE),  from the BLS establishment survey, and  the BLS productivity  and 
costs measure  of compensation  per hour (CPH).  Among these, CPH is unique in that its 
wages and salaries component  is benchmarked  to unemployment  insurance  tax records.  
Paradoxically,  because those  records are comprehensive and  capture irregular  payments  
missed by surveys, CPH is more volatile than AHE or ECI, making its trend hard to see in the

way it is normally presented in the Tealbook. But smoothing into annual average growth 
rates shows clear acceleration from 2009 to 2012 in the wage and salary component of 
nonfarm business CPH (or wage CPH, for short), as shown by the black bars in figure 2.1 
Because wage CPH is the only one of these measures benchmarked to tax records, it should 
be accorded heavy weight in assessments of wage growth. However, tax records are not 
perfect—not least because irregular payments can obscure the trend even in annual 
averages, and the hours series used in the denominator of CPH may be measured with 
error—so placing some weight on an average of the other measures does make sense. The 
striped blue bars in figure 2 show such an equal weighted average of wage CPH growth 
forecasts from the five measures shown in figure 1 and AHE. Note that, while the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis uses AHE as their primary extrapolator in wage estimates computed 
before tax data are available—wage estimates that are then used in the numerator of CPH— 
AHE has the lowest correlation of all these six measures with later estimates of wage CPH 
that have been benchmarked to tax data.2 Equal weighting the six measures follows the 
literature on optimal forecast combination, but if any wage measure merits less weight, it is 
AHE. This bears keeping in mind when evaluating movements like the anomalous decline in 
AHE in December 2014. 
Comparing the black and blue striped bars in figure 2, the forecast average tracks wage CPH 
growth well from 2008 to 2011. Income shifting from 2013:Q1 into 2012:Q4 in anticipation of 
2013 tax increases probably pulled about ½ percentage point of CPH growth from 2013 into 
2012. Netting out that effect, which is likely not fully reflected in the other wage measures, 
puts wage CPH growth ¼ percentage point above the forecast average in 2012 and ¾ 
percentage point below it in 2013. For 2014, industry data necessary to compute nonfarm 
business wage CPH growth are not yet available, but available estimates of private wages 
and salaries suggest growth slightly above 2½ percent, shown by the gray bar. However, 
that estimate is still subject to revisions, which have been well predicted by the forecast 
average over the past six years, so it would be reasonable to place close to full weight on the 
3¼ percent forecast average in estimating  2014 wage CPH growth. Doing so shows wages 
growing at a pace of more than 3 percent last year and accelerating. 
1 Unlike most of the wage and salary measures plotted in figure 1, headline CPH includes estimates of 
other types of employee compensation like employer contributions for health insurance, and recent 
changes to the health care system make these estimates hard to interpret. Figure 1 focuses on the wage 
and salary component of CPH to avoid these complications and provide more of an apples toapples 
comparison with the other measures. Average annual headline CPH growth looks similar, but from 2010 to 
2013, it averaged about ¼ percentage point less than the wage and salary component shown in the figure 
because of low estimated growth rates of nonwage compensation. 
2 In regressions from 1997 to 2013 of annual wage CPH growth on the annual average of each of the 
measures, the adjusted Rsquared statistics using the four alternative measures range from 0.62 to 0.75, 
while those using the ECI and AHE growth are only 0.53 and 0.25, respectively. AHE growth is least 
correlated with wage CPH growth at the quarterly frequency as well. Note that this box focuses on the AHE 
of production and nonsupervisory workers because it has a relatively long history, and the Bureau of 
Economic Analysis now uses the AHE of all employees for its extrapolations, a measure with no history prior 
to 2006. That measure is uncorrelated with quarterly or annual CPH growth, though, over its short history.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) rule.  This policy rule now assumes a 
long-run equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3½ percent.   
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The 
process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by 2021. 
 Risk premiums on corporate equities a nd corporate bonds are assumed to edge 
down toward their l onger-run levels.   
 The natural rate of unemployment rema ins at 5¼ percent, and potential GDP 
is assumed to rise 1.8 percent per year on average from 2017 to 2020.  
 As monetary accommodation is wit hdrawn, real GDP growth slows to 
1½ percent in 2018 and then continues to run for a while at a pace just below 
the growth rate of potential output. Th e unemployment rate stays flat at about 
5 percent in 2018 before gradually edgi ng up toward its natural rate.     
 PCE price inflation remains slight ly below the Committee’s long-run 
objective at the end of 2017.  However, with the unemploymen t rate below the 
natural rate, longer-run inflation exp ectations gradually edge up and PCE 
price inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign real GDP growth edged up to 2¾ percent at an annual rate in the fourth 
quarter, in line with our January Tealbook projection.  We expect growth abroad to 
continue at a similar rate in the first half of this year before moving up to a trend pace of 
about 3 percent through 2017.  The pickup reflects continuing improvement in the euro 
area and a recovery in South America. Foreign economies, more generally, should 
benefit from solid U.S. growth, accommodative monetary policies, depreciated currencies, and still-low oil prices.  The forecast for growth abroad is somewhat lower 
this year, partly because we now judge that the low oil prices will exert a greater drag on 
the Canadian economy than we expected in January. 
Nevertheless, we continue to expect foreign growth to firm over the medium term, 
and our outlook beyond the next several quarters is little changed. Positive data from th e 
euro area are giving us a little more confidence in the strength of its recovery, and more 
accommodative European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy should further bolster the 
region’s expansion . Indeed, foreign growth, notably in the euro area, may be faster than 
in our baseline, a scenario we explore in the Risks and Uncertainty section. We also take 
some comfort from the recent agreement on a four- month extension of Greece’s bailout 
program and the absence of financial spillovers to other peripheral countries’ financial 
markets during the tense negotiations over that agreement.  Our baseline view is that the 
process of reaching a long-term agreement will be rocky and lead to some limited drag on 
the euro-area economy in the months ahead, but we expect that Greece will eventually 
reach a compromise with its official creditors. That said, Greece’s economic and 
political environment is precarious and we cannot rule out the possibility of a disorderly 
Greek exit from the euro area a scenario we also explore in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section. 
Lower oil prices have weighed on foreign inflation.  In the advanced foreign 
economies, we estimate that consumer prices fell at an annual rate of ¾ percent in the 
first quarter following a ½ percent decline in the fourth.  As energy prices rise slightly 
and weaker currencies pass through to consumer prices, inflation moves up to 1 percent next quarter and further to 1¾ percent by 2017, supported by diminishing economic 
resource slack.

In the emerging market economies (EMEs), consumer price inflation likely 
dipped to just ½ percent in the current quarter, substantially below our previous 
projection.  Retail energy prices fell sharply in recent months, suggesting a greater 
pass-through than we had previously assumed. In addition, food prices decelerated in 
some countries, particularly China.  We expect EME inflation to rise back toward 3 percent in coming quarters, boosted primarily by the shift from sharply falling to 
slightly rising oil as well as other commodity prices. 
The widespread decline in inflation and still-subdued economic growth have 
prompted many foreign central banks to ease monetary policy.  The ECB announced a 
significant quantitative easing program that includes purchases of government securities.  
The People’s Bank of China cut its reserve requirement ratios for banks and further 
reduced banks’ benchmark lending rates.  And, other foreign central banks—including 
those of Australia, Denmark, India, Indonesia, Israel, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, 
Thailand, and Turkey all loosened monetary policy since the close of the January 
Tealbook.  In contrast, only a few countries raised policy rates to combat inflation, notably Brazil, and, in the case of Ukraine, to also support the exchange rate. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
 Euro area. Real GDP expanded 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, 
¼ pe rcentage point more than estimated in the January Tealbook, as 
consumption remained solid and investment spending improved.  Recent data, including consumption indicators and PMIs, suggest growth will firm a bit more in the current quarter.  Nevertheless, we continue to expect that the recovery will face some near-term headwinds coming from stresses related to 
Greece (see the box “Recent Developments in Greece”). All told, we see 
GDP growth picking up from 1¾ percent in the first half of this year to 2¼ pe rcent in 2017, supported by accommodative monetary policy, a 
depreciated euro, and low oil prices.  We estimate that headline inflation will 
fall further in the current quarter to negative 1¾ percent at an annual rate, as 
retail energy prices through February plunged and core inflation inched down.  
As oil prices rise slightly and the output gap gradually narrows, inflation 
should move up to 1½ percent by late this year and 1¾ percent in 2017. 
On March 9, the ECB initiated the program announced in January under which the Eurosystem will purchase €60 billion per month of public and

private-sector securities.  The program will continue until at least September 
2016, which will bring the cumulative purchases to €1.2 trillion, €400 billion 
more than anticipated in the January Tealbook.  Based on the larger size of the program, we have revised up the projected level of euro-area GDP at the end 
of 2017 by ½ percent.  (The effects of this program on the United States are 
discussed in the box “Spillovers from Euro -Area Quantitative Easing to the 
U.S. Economy.”) 
 Japan. Following two consecutive quarters of contraction, real GDP rose 
only 1.5 percent in the last quarter of 2014, 1½ percentage points less than we 
had projected.  Growth was supported by robust exports and solid private 
consumption, but private investment continued to fall and the decline in 
inventories accelerated.  Recent economic indicators have been mixed: Exports soared in January, but consumption indicators have been weak.  All told, we see GDP growth picking up to 2 percent in the first quarter before 
moderating through 2016.  In 2017, growth stalls again because of another 
consumption tax hike. 
After negative headline inflation in the fourth quarter, data through February 
suggest that consumer prices will be about flat in the current quarter.  However, with core inflation running at nearly 1 percent in recent months, we 
project that headline inflation will rise to 1½ percent by early 2017, as oil 
prices rise, the output gap narrows, and the Bank of Japan maintains its rapid 
pace of asset purchases through the end of 2016. 
 Canada. Real GDP growth slowed to 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, in line 
with our January Tealbook estimate, as investment contracted.  Recent 
indicators suggest further slowing in the current quarter as the drag from low 
oil prices extends beyond the energy sector : Existing home sales declined 
through January and the manufacturing PMI fell into contractionary territory 
in February for the first time in two years.  Accordingly, we project that GDP growth will slow to 1¾ percent, on average, in the first half of this year.  
Growth should rebound to 2½ percent in 2016, supported by the slight rise in 
oil prices, accommodative monetary policy, and strong U.S. growth, before 
slowing a bit to a near-potential pace of about 2 percent in 2017.  Compared 
with the January Tealbook, this projection is ½ percentage point lower in 2015 
and little changed thereafter.

Recent Developments in Greece 
In national parliamentary elections in January, the far-left and anti-austerity party, Syriza, 
soundly defeated centrist parties.  The new government reaffirmed its campaign pledges to 
relax Greece’s fiscal targets, increase the minimum wage, and rehire laid off government 
employees .  It publicly rejected Greece’s existing EU -IMF financial assistance program, calling 
for a new arrangement involving less austerity, less intrusive monitoring, and more debt 
relief. 
Other European authorities rejected the new government’s demands, calling instead for an 
extension of Greece’s €144 billion EU financial assistance program (funded by the European 
Financial Stability Facility, or EFSF), which was scheduled to expire at the end of February. 
Such an extension would preserve the Greek government’s eligibility to receive about €4 
billion in general funding and €11 billion earmarked for bank recapitalization. 
Through mid-February, contentious negotiations between the Greek government and its 
creditors fueled fears that Greece could become ineligible for EFSF funding, default on its 
public debt service obligations (shown in figure 1), and exit the euro area. We estimate that 
deposits in Greek banks plunged nearly 20 percent between late December and late 
February (figure 2), forcing Greek banks to depend increasingly on the ECB and the Greek 
central bank for liquidity support. With the ECB growing uncomfortable with its 
mushrooming exposure to Greek banks , it stopped accepting Greek sovereign debt as 
collateral in its open market operations, forcing Greek banks to rely heavily on more costly 
emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) from the Greek central bank.  To compensate for 
deposit flight, t he ECB has since raised the limit on ELA to Greek banks four times in as many 
weeks , albeit by progressively smaller amounts.   
Mounting funding pressures on the Greek government and banks forced the government to 
concede to most of its official creditors’ key demands.  On February 20, the government 
agreed to adhere to the framework of the existing EU-IMF financial assistance program, 
including a commitment to meet its debt obligations and maintain primary fiscal surpluses 
necessary to promote debt sustainability . In exchange, Greece’s official creditors signaled 
that they would ease Greece’s 2015 fiscal target (from a primary surplus of 3 percent of GDP 
to a yet- to-be-determined figure).  On the basis of this agreement, European authorities 
extended Greece’s EFSF program by four months.   
While this agreement has r eportedly moderated deposit flight for the time being, significant 
challenges remain. Under the terms of its program, Greece would normally not receive 
disbursements until the completion of its program review, which typically requires several 
months.  However, the Greek government will likely need funds before then to avoid default.  Hence, Greece and its creditors have begun difficult negotiations over early 
disbursement of some funds . European authorities are demanding that Greece commit to 
(and begin implementing) a comprehensive a nd well-defined reform program, including

 fiscal consolidation measures .  So far, they have reportedly deemed the Greek government’s 
proposals incomplete and insufficiently detailed. 
Even if European authorities successfully address Greece’s immediate funding needs, major 
hurdles lie ahead.  The Greek government will likely require a new, longer- term assistance 
program to avoid default on about €9  billion in debt service in July and August combined 
and, beyond that, to promote sustainable growth and public finances .  Such an arrangement 
must identify fiscal, privatization, and structural reform measures acceptable to both the 
Greek government and its creditors , as well as a highly controversial restructuring of 
Greece’s debt to other European authorities.   
Securing a mutually acceptable agreement will be a daunting political challenge.   We expect 
more brinkmanship between the Greek government and its creditors, which will likely 
intensify deposit flight from Greek banks and push the Greek government to the brink of 
default.  Renewed financial stresses in Greece could spill over to the rest of the euro area to 
some extent, weighing on the euro-area economic recovery for a time (although probably 
not significantly affecting other major economies).  Ultimately, however, we believe that the 
mutual interest of both sides in avoiding a catastrophic Greek exit from the euro area will 
lead them to compromise further and reach a deal .   
Even if a Greek exit is averted, populist euroskeptic movements in other euro-area countries 
could gain momentum, undermining confidence in the vulnerable euro-area economies .  
Moreover , with Greece’s relations with its creditors already strained, the risk of a Greek exit 
from the euro area cannot be ruled out.   Several considerations suggest that a Greek exit 
may be less disruptive than was feared earlier, including the ECB’ s new asset purchase 
program, progress toward a European banking union, and the ECB’s pledge to do “whatever 
it takes” to preserve the euro area.  But there is still a risk that a Greek exit could have very 
adverse effects that plunge the euro area back into recession and spill over to the U.S. 
economy, as described in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook.

Spillovers from Euro-Area Quantitative Easing to the U.S. Economy 
On January 22, the ECB announced a large-scale bond purchase program that aims to boost euro-
area inflation toward its 2 percent target more quickly and to minimize downside risks to longer-
term inflation expectations. The program is intended to last through September 2016, with 
purchases of public debt, covered bonds, and asset-backed securities eventually accumulating to 
€1.2 trillion (about 12 percent of euro-area GDP ). But the program is open ended and will continue 
until the ECB is confident that its goals will be achieved. This box provides an assessment of how 
the ECB’s program is like ly to affect the United States, including whether it might have “beggar 
thy n eighbor  effects . 
Quantitative easing (QE) is likely to spill over to other economies through several channels.  First, 
domestic demand in the economy implementing QE should rise as the asset purchases reduce 
interest rates, raise inflation, and boost equity values; this impetus to domestic demand, in turn, 
should provide a boost to the exports and GDP of its trading partners.  Second, the currency of 
the economy implementing QE should depreciate, which can be expected to reduce the real net 
exports of its trading partners.  Third, QE may affect other economies t hrough financial channels.  
For example, a reduced supply of euro-area bonds in response to ECB asset purchases may spur 
rebalancing toward U.S. assets , thus lowering U.S. bond yields, raising equity values, and 
stimulating U.S. demand. 
The overall effects o f QE on a country’s trading partners depend on the relative strength of these 
channels.  We estimate that the Federal Reserve’s QE programs boo sted U.S. domestic demand 
significantly , caused the dollar to depreciate only modestly, and exerted substantial downward 
pressure on foreign bond yields.  Thus, we view the Fed’s QE as likely to have raised foreign 
growth on net.  However, QE in the euro area may provide less of a boost to domestic demand, 
given the bank-centric nature of their financial systems and because interest rates are already 
very low. If the ECB’s QE depends more heavily on exchange rate depreciation to boost GDP, it 
may exert contractionary effects on trading partners.   
To evaluate these issues, we estimate the effects of the ECB’s QE program on the U.S. economy 
using the staff’s SIGMA model under two different scenarios.  In o ur benchmark scenario , the 
program including through anticipation effects prior to the announcement is estimated to 
have reduced the term premi um on German 10-year bonds about 35 to 40 basis points, depressed 
the term premium on U.S. 10-year Treasury securities by about half as much as on German bonds, 
and caused the broad real euro to depreciate about 4 percent.  (Note that the euro has also been 
weighed down by other factors , and its actual decline since June has been about 11 percent.) 
These benchmark estimates capture the staff’s best guess about how the ECB QE likely has 
affect ed interest rates and exchange rates:  The effects on domestic interest rates are sizable, 
even if somewhat smaller than typically estimated for a U.S. QE program of similar size. By 
contrast, our other scenario captures the possibility that most of the stimulus to euro-area GDP 
from the QE comes from euro depreciation. In this beggar-thy-neighbor scenario, the broad real 
euro depreciates 8 percent due to the QE program, euro-area domestic demand rises less, and 
financial spillovers to the United States are assumed to be negligible.

 Figure 1 shows the effects of the ECB QE program under each scenario :  All results are reported as 
deviations from the levels that would prevail absent any ECB QE.  Under the benchmark scenario, 
represented by the blue lines, the ECB ’s asset  purchases boost euro-area GDP more than 
1½ percent after two years as the expansionary effects of lower interest rates on domestic 
demand are reinforced by euro depreciation.   U.S. GDP and inflation rise, with most of the output 
expansion reflecting an increase in domestic demand in response to the decline in U.S. Treasury 
term premiums, although U.S. real net exports also improve a bit.  Accordingly, the Taylor rule 
prescribes a higher path for the U.S. federal funds rate.   By contrast, in the beggar-thy-neighbor 
scen
ario (the red lines) , while euro-area GDP rises as much as in the benchmark scenario, the 
effects on U.S. GDP are slightly contractionary, as the relatively large depreciation of the euro 
depress es U.S. real net exports .  With U.S. GDP and inflation slightly weaker, the funds rate path 
is a tad lower.     
Overal l, these results support our view that ECB QE is likely to provide a slight boost to the U.S. 
economy, but
, in any event, it seems unlikely to cause a ny material decline in U.S. GDP.   
Moreover, even if ECB QE were to depress U.S. output through the exchange rate channel, it 
seems plausible that the U.S. economy could benefit through channels not captured by SIGMA .  
These channels include favorable effects on global confidence and diminished tail risks that 
would likely result if QE pushes the euro area onto a higher growth path and raises inflation 
closer to the ECB’s target.

We expect inflation to remain near zero in the first quarter, due mainly to 
lower energy prices.  As oil prices increase, we expect inflation to bounce 
back to 1¾  percent in the second quarter and to reach the Bank of Canada’s 
2 percent target by 2017.  With inflation and growth projected to pick up, we 
do not expect any further monetary easing following January’s surprise rate 
cut. 
 United Kingdom. Real GDP expanded 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter, down 
from the 2¾ percent pace seen in the first three quarters of 2014.  Strong 
recent activity in services and construction as well as solid PMIs and business 
confidence point to growth strengthening to 2½ percent in the current quarter.  
We expect GDP growth to remain around this robust pace this year and next 
before moderating to 2¼ percent in 2017.  Inflation is estimated to have 
remained negative in the current quarter due mainly to lower energy prices. 
We expect inflation to rebound to 1¾ percent next quarter and to rise to the 
2 percent target by 2017, as the effects of past energy price declines dissipate 
and slack in the economy is eliminated.  We continue to project that the Bank 
of England’s first rate hike will occur in the fourth quarter of this year and that subsequent rate increases will be gradual. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
 China.  Recent indicators have been mixed but, on balance, suggest that real 
GDP growth remained in the neighborhood of 7 percent in the current quarter.  
Exports were very strong in January and February, though manufacturing 
activity decelerated and indicators of domestic demand including 
investment, retail sales, and imports remained weak.  
The Chinese economy faces significant headwinds this year from the slowing 
property market, the stronger trade-weighted value of the renminbi, and 
overcapacity in some industries.  To counter the adverse effects of these 
headwinds, Chinese authorities have taken a number of steps to ease monetary 
conditions in recent months, including lowering banks’ required reserve ratio and cutting their benchmark lending and deposit rates.  We expect the authorities to continue to calibrate policies to keep economic growth at about 
7 percent this year, in line with the target announced by the Chinese

authorities in early March.  We see growth edging down to 6¾ percent in 
2017, reflecting a gradual decline in the rate of potential growth.  
We estimate that Chinese inflation fell to negative ½ percent at an annual rate 
in the current quarter.  Most of the recent decline is attributable to lower food 
prices (mainly pork) and fuel prices, although core inflation has also fallen. Inflation is expected to average about 1½ percent this year and rise to 
2½ pe rcent next year, as food prices normalize and energy prices increase 
slightly.  Compared with the January Tealbook, our inflation forecast is down about 1 percentage point this year and ½ percentage point in 2016 and 2017. 
 Other Emerging Asia. Growth in emerging Asia excluding China remained 
at 4 percent in the fourth quarter, a bit higher than predicted in the January 
Tealbook.  Economic activity in the region was generally supported by robust 
domestic demand and exports, particularly to the United States.  We expect 
growth to average just under 4½ percent over the forecast period, buoyed by still-low oil prices, accommodative policies, and firmer recovery in the 
advanced economies. 
Inflation in the region surprised significantly to the downside, reflecting 
decelerating food prices and greater-than-expected pass-through of oil prices 
to retail energy costs.  As a result, we now estimate that inflation in the region 
fell to an annual rate of ¼ percent in the first quarter. As the price of oil rises 
slightly and food prices normalize, inflation should rise to 3 percent later this 
year.  Citing lower inflation, the Reserve Bank of India, Bank Indonesia, and 
the Bank of Thailand each cut policy rates by 25 basis points. 
 Mexico. Real GDP growth stepped up to 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter, a 
bit less than we had projected.  Exports, notably to the United States, were 
strong, and fixed investment and construction activity continued to expand. By contrast, household demand has not shown convincing signs of a pickup.  
We expect growth to edge up to about 3¼ percent this year and remain at that 
rate over the forecast period. In late January, the Mexican government 
announced that it will cut fiscal spending this year in response to a fall in oil revenues, which should largely offset a boost from the depreciation of the 
peso. Mexican inflation is estimated to have plunged to an annual rate of 
½ percent in the first quarter, reflecting a decline in energy prices, a

retracement of food prices after earlier spikes, and the one-off effect of 
telecommunications reform.  We expect inflation will move up to 3¼ percent 
over the forecast period. 
 South America. We expect economic growth in the region to remain subdued 
this year, reflecting weak growth prospects for Brazil and Venezuela. 
In Brazil , we estimate that real GDP stayed flat in the fourth quarter, as 
confidence remained depressed and exports fell.  We now expect real GDP to 
contract this year.  The widening corruption scandal at Petrobras , Brazil’s 
largest state-owned company, appears to be further depressing investment 
spending throughout the economy.  Moreover, the authorities are tightening 
fiscal and monetary policies to combat inflation and restore fiscal discipline.  
Next year, we anticipate less drag from monetary policy and expect 
confidence to move up.  Accordingly, the economy should begin to expand, 
albeit at a subdued 2 percent rate.  Due to the rapid depreciation of the real 
and an increase in administered energy prices and bus fares, we now estimate 
that inflation rose to 10½ percent at annual rate in the current quarter, but we expect it to decline to 5½ percent by the second half of this year.  Rising inflation prompted the central bank to hike its policy rate 50 basis points to 
12.75 percent in March, bringing the cumulative rate increases since last 
October to 175 basis points. 
Political and social tensions have intensified in Venezuela , and economic 
conditions have deteriorated substantially, with headline inflation approaching 
triple digits and widespread shortages.  Accordingly, we marked down the 
growth path substantially and now expect a sizable contraction of GDP this 
year and next. 
 Russia and Ukraine. Real GDP contracted last year in both of these 
economies, and we see further sharp contractions this year.  Russian financial 
market tensions appear to have eased a bit as oil prices have come off recent lows, but economic conditions remain dire.  Ukraine reached an agreement 
with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new four-year Extended 
Fund Facility (EFF) of about $17.5 billion.  The EFF would replace the two-
year Stand-By Arrangement signed last April, which was compromised by a 
significant deterioration of economic conditions amid continuing conflict in

the country. The EFF is expected to be complemented by other bilateral and 
multilateral financing as well as private-sector debt restructuring.  Ukraine ’s 
central bank raised its policy interest rate by a whopping 10.5 percentage 
points to 30 percent to contain inflationary pressures and stabilize the ailing 
hryvnia, the local currency.

Financial Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, broad movement s in asset prices seemed to reflect 
increased appetite for riskier investments, a pparently as investors’  concerns about the 
downside risks to the global economic outl ook receded.  The strong U.S. employment 
reports, the market’s positive interpretation of the January CPI release, the anticipation of 
sovereign bond purchases by the ECB, the somewhat more encouraging economic news 
from Europe, and positive developments in Greek debt negotiations all appeared to 
contribute to improved sentimen t in financial markets.   
 The expected path of the federal funds  rate steepened, leaving the federal 
funds futures rate for the end of 2017 about 29 basis points higher, at about 
2 percent.  Results of the Open Market  Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and 
market participants indicated further co alescing of expectations for the timing 
of liftoff around the June and September meetings but little change, on 
balance, in the expected pace of normalization after liftoff. 
 On net, 5- and 10-year Treasury yiel ds rose 28 basis points and 31 basis 
points, respectively, while market m easures of inflation compensation 
registered relatively small mixed changes. 
 The nominal exchange value of the dollar appreciated notably, in part 
reflecting divergent trends in m onetary policy here and abroad.  
 Business financing picked up noticeably in February after a lull in January, 
while household financing conditions we re little changed, with mortgage 
credit still tight for borrowers with low credit scores but consumer credit 
remaining largely available. 
TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS 
On balance, Federal Reserve communicati ons over the intermeeting period were 
seen as a bit more accommodative than expected.  Investors reportedly focused on discussion in the FOMC minutes suggesting th at many meeting participants judged that 
the balance of risks inclined them toward k eeping the federal funds rate at its effective 
lower bound for a while.  Also garnering at tention was the Chair’s statement at the

Monetary Policy Report  testimony that the removal of th e “patient” language should not 
be viewed as indicating that the federal funds rate would ne cessarily be increased within 
a couple of meetings.  Nonetheless, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate 
steepened over the intermeeting period, refl ecting the strengthening labor market, the 
January CPI release that exceeded market expectations, and perceptions of receding 
downside risks in the global economic outlook. 
On net over the intermeeting period, the fe deral funds rate for the end of 2016 and 
end of 2017 implied by OIS quotes increased  20 basis points a nd 29 basis points, 
respectively. According to the Desk’s surv eys of dealers and market participants, 
expectations for the timing of the liftoff coalesced further around the June and September 2015 meetings.  Expectations for the pace of  tightening following liftoff were little 
changed, on balance, since the January surveys.   In addition, survey  respondents widely 
expected the “patient” language to be dropped in the upcoming meeting. 
Treasury yields rose across the maturity spectrum, with sizable reactions to the 
January and February employment reports and CPI data release and little response to the somewhat lower-than-expected sp ending data.  On net, the 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields rose 
17, 28, and 31 basis points, respectively, reflecti ng a 37 basis point increase in the 5-to-
10-year nominal forward rate.  
TIPS-based measures of inflation compen sation increased notably early in the 
intermeeting period amid rising oil prices a nd investor sentiment but ended the period 
little changed on net.  Similarly, the distribution of expected infl ation over the next 
10 years, as gauged by inflation deriva tives, is little cha nged since January. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
The improvement in investor sentiment in foreign financial markets over the 
intermeeting period was fueled by further monetary easing in many countries, some 
positive economic data in the United Kingdom and euro area, and the extension of 
Greece’s aid program. 
Stock markets in Europe were buoyed by the anticipation and start of sovereign 
bond purchases by the ECB and by a strong labor market report in the United Kingdom.  
In addition, the release of bette r-than-expected data on euro-a rea real GDP for the fourth 
quarter—showing, in particular, robust growth  in Germany—alleviated concerns of a

near-term recession in the euro area.  Se ntiment in Europe was also buoyed after 
contentious negotiations between Greece and its official-sector creditors resulted in a 
provisional four-month extension of Gr eece’s support package (see the box “Recent 
Developments in Greece” in the Interna tional Economic Developments and Outlook 
section).  Equity markets across the advanced  foreign economies are up since the January 
FOMC meeting, with euro-area equities outperforming, having ri sen more than 6 percent. 
German sovereign yields declined further following the start of the ECB’s asset 
purchase program and are now negative up to seve n years’ maturity.  Sovereign yields in 
several other European countri es also moved further below zero, and the Danish National 
Bank (DNB) and Sweden’s Riksbank pushed pol icy rates further into negative territory 
(see the box “Negative Interest Rates:  Whither the Zero Lower Bound?”).  In contrast, 
U.K. sovereign bond yields moved higher across the term structure, boosted by a 
modestly improved outlook as well as increases in expectations for policy rates following 
the less-accommodative-than-expected Inflation Report from the Bank of England in 
February.  The spread on Greek 10-year bonds over equivalent-maturity German bunds 
was quite volatile over the intermeeting pe riod and, on net, moved higher.  Financial 
markets in Italy and Spain showed little r eaction to the ups and downs of negotiations 
with Greece, with Italian and Spanish bond sp reads ending the period down slightly.   
Overall, the dollar appreciated a further 3½ percent, as measured by the staff’s 
broad nominal dollar index.  The dollar has ap preciated against the currencies of most 
advanced economies, as the divergence between  anticipated monetary tightening in the 
United States and monetary easing abroad wi dened.  The dollar appreciated more than 
6 percent against the euro and rose 10 percent against the Swiss franc.  The franc fell 
back after having appreciated sharply fo llowing the January decision by the Swiss 
National Bank (SNB) to end its defense of an ex change rate floor for the euro against the 
Swiss franc.  Early in the period, the SNB and DNB both intervened to counter upward 
pressures against their currencie s.  The dollar has also appreciated against most emerging 
market currencies, and a number of EME cen tral banks eased mone tary policy, including 
the People’s Bank of China.  The dollar rose 21 percent against the Brazilian real, 
reflecting Brazil’s continuing economic struggles and concerns regarding a deepening 
political scandal involving Brazil’s st ate-owned oil company, Petrobras.   
The recent increase in oil prices has somewhat allayed financial market concerns 
for some struggling emerging market economies, such as Russia and Venezuela.  Stock

Negative Interest Rates: Whither the Zero Lower Bound? 
Confronting low and declining inflation, shown in figure 1, weak economic growth, and, in some 
cases, appreciation pressures on their currencies, a number of European central banks have 
recently pushed their policy rates to below zero (figure 2). At the same time, nominal yields on 
many sovereign bonds have declined and turned negative for maturities up to several years 
(figures 3 and 4).  Although zero has commonly been thought of as the lower bound, these recent 
policy moves re inforce the idea t hat zero is not a hard floor for nominal interest rates.  To date, 
the demand for currency has not soared and investors continue to purchase sovereign bonds with 
negative yields to maturity.  Nonetheless, it is an open question as to how much further rates can 
fall before currency hoarding becomes more pronounced, the functioning of money markets is 
impaired, and other strains on financial systems materialize.  
The European Central Bank (ECB) first moved its deposit rate into negative territory last June . It 
has since decreased the rate to negative 20 basis points, and is now implementing a large-scale 
asset purchase program. The ECB’s main refinancing rate remains slightly positive at 0.05 percent. 
The ECB’s policies increased upward pressure on some other European currencies, and a number 
of central banks responded by lowering policy rates . The Danish National Bank (DNB) cut its 
deposit rate to negative 0.75 percent , but left all other policy rates, including the target rate, at 
0 percent or above.  The Swiss National Bank moved both its deposit rate and the center of its 
target range for the three-month the Swiss franc LIBOR, its main policy rate, to negative 
0.75 percent. Sweden’s Riksbank moved its deposit rate to negative 0.85 percent; however, its 
main policy rate, the repo rate, was lowered to a more modest n egative 0.10 percent. In each of 
these jurisdictions, the negative rates apply to both domestic and foreign banks, though the 
proportion of bank reserves that earn negative interest depends on each central bank’s operating 
procedures and rules determining required and excess reserves. 
Partly as a consequence, 10-year sovereign yields in these economies have reached record lows 
and are far below comparable maturity yields in the United Kingdom and the United States.  In 
addition, significant parts of the yield curves in continental Europe now sit below zero, with Swiss 
yields, for example, negative out to a maturity of 10 years (figure 4) .  Rates on some European 
corporate bonds have also turned negative, and in Denmark, where the rates paid on floating-rate 
mortgages do not have a floor, some homeowners are now receiving negative interest on the ir 
mortgages. 
How low can rates go? The argument that nominal interest rates could not go much below zero 
was based on the belief that households and firms would turn to holding cash if rates became 
negative. But thus far, there has been no apparent increase in demand for cash, gold, or other 
noninterest-paying assets in any of the countries with negative interest rates , nor have deposits 
fled to countries with nonnegative rates.  Currently, most retail bank deposits are not paying 
negative rates, but larger corporate deposits are.  At some stage, corporations may attempt to 
hold cash or simply move their deposits abroad to avoid negative rates.  However, holding cash is 
complicated, and demand for cash would likely depend on access to vault facilities and the 
willingness of insurance companies to insure those holdings; moving at least some holdings 
overseas is easy to accomplish, but those holdings would be subject to exchange rate risk. There

 have been some reports that firms are prepaying taxes and other payables early to avoid earning 
negative rates, but this would only help on the margin. 
Staff conversations with these central banks indicate that they believe th eir policy rates could be 
cut further, but they are unsure as to how much further rates could fall before cash hoarding 
would begin.  Thus, they are also looking at other policy tools to support their accommodative 
policy stances.  For example, at the urging of the DNB, the Danish government helped discourage 
further inflows by halting its issuance of bonds for 2015 and by refusing to accept any bids at its 
most recent scheduled auction of bills (the government is already prefunded through this year).  
The DNB and SNB have both argued, fairly persuasively, that they have relatively small domestic 
sovereign and corporate debt markets, which could limit their ability to conduct quantitative 
easing, but they could purchase other assets or combine action with the fiscal authority.  
Even if rates could be pushed down further, very negative rates may pose other risks .  If 
commercial banks resist lowering the rates they offer on deposits, then their profitability will be 
harmed, but if they do make rates on deposits negative, then businesses and households, who are 
already unhappy earning low rates of interest, may protest, inducing legislators to interfere with 
the central bank ’s policies.  And at some point, negative rates could threaten the functioning of 
financial markets:   Investors may be unwilling to fund loans at negative rates, choosing instead to 
hold
 cash or invest abroad.  For example, bondholders in Denmark who fund the country’s 
mortgages may object to a negative return and may withdraw capital from the mortgage market.  
Money market institutions may also be unable to function in negative rate environments.   
At present, these risks have not materialized and the low rates may help stimulate borrowing and 
economic activity and alleviate appreciation pressures, but it is probably too early to draw firm 
conclusions about the costs of negative rates .  In particular, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
adverse outcomes will emerge as negative rates persist and market participants adjust over time 
to the low returns .

indexes in the emerging market economies were mixed, but net flows into dedicated 
emerging market funds turned positive in  recent weeks following a few months of 
outflows. 
U.S. EQUITY PRICES AND CORPORATE BOND YIELDS 
Broad U.S. equity indexes ended the in termeeting period up only about 1 percent 
despite rising in line with the broader move  toward risky assets early in the period.  
Reaction to domestic economic news was mos tly muted, with the notable exception of a 
selloff following the strong February employme nt report.  Underlying the small gains by 
the broader indexes were substant ial sectoral divergences, as st ocks of firms in cyclically 
oriented industries generally rose while t hose of more defensive, higher-dividend-paying 
firms such as utilities were sharply lower.   One-month option-im plied volatility on the 
S&P 500 index (VIX) slipped to the lower end of its post-crisis ra nge before backing up 
late in the intermeeting period. 
Spreads of 10-year corporate bond yiel ds over those on comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities for both BBB-rated and speculative-grade issuers narrowed notably.  
While the tightening of spreads was broad based,  the declines in short- and intermediate-
term spreads for speculative-grade energy fi rms were particularly  pronounced, retracing 
quite a bit of their dramatic run-up near th e end of 2014; still, these spreads remained 
well above the average spreads of  other speculative-grade bonds. 
BUSINESS FINANCE 
In February, credit conditions for large nonfinancial businesses stayed generally 
accommodative.  Corporate bond issuance picked up after a lull in January, mostly reflecting activity by investment-grade firms.  Meanwhile, commercial and industrial 
loans at banks continued to expand strongly, reportedly in part to  fund an increase in 
merger and acquisition activity.  Gross public equity issuance  jumped in February from 
an already robust pace, as some companies co mpleted large seasoned equity offerings to 
finance their planned merger deals.  In January and Februar y, institutional leveraged loan 
issuance was slow as refinancing activity eff ectively came to a stop because of elevated 
spreads even as new money issuance kept p ace.  Averaged over January and February, 
CLO issuance was only modestly below the fourth quarter’s strong pace.

In January and February, equity analysts  sharply revised down their forecasts for 
year-ahead earnings for firms in the S&P 500 index.  Although substantial downgrades to 
energy-sector firms accounted for a sizable portion of aggregate revisions, earnings 
forecasts were also marked down outside the energy sector.  Those negative revisions 
were concentrated among firms with a higher share of sales abroad, presumably owing to 
analysts incorporating the effects of th e strong dollar as well as sluggish foreign 
economic activity.  Nonetheless, these revisions  left little visible im print on stock prices, 
as investors seemed more attu ned to receding tail risks. 
Financing for commercial real estate ( CRE) remained broadly available for large 
and small loans and the full range of prope rty types.  The volume of CMBS issuance 
stayed robust, on average, in January and February.  Countin g deals in the pipeline for 
March, issuance in the first quarter of 2015 is expected to be the strongest since the 
financial crisis, although still well below the pre-crisis levels.  CMBS spreads continued 
to be low through the end of February.  Gr owth of CRE loans on banks’ books remained 
solid, in part supported by loans to finance construction activity, repor tedly mainly in the 
form of multifamily projects. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE 
Mortgage credit remains tight for riskier borrowers, with relatively few mortgages 
originated to borrowers at th e low end of the credit score di stribution.  Combined with a 
further contraction in the fr action of underwater mortgage s and continued improvements 
in the labor market, tight underwriting sta ndards have likely cont ributed to a downward 
trend in delinquency; at the e nd of last year, the share of  mortgages becoming delinquent 
reached its lowest level since at least 2000.  Meanwhile, for borrowers that can qualify 
for a mortgage, the cost of credit remains low by historical standards, with the 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgage rate aver aging 3.6 percent in February. 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets stayed largely accommodative 
over the intermeeting period.  Outstanding balan ces of auto and student loans continued 
to expand significantly through January, as su ch credit remained widely available, 
including to subprime borrowers.  Borrowing th rough credit card accounts decelerated a 
bit in early 2015 after having expanded last year at the fastest pace since the financial 
crisis.  While access to credit cards appears to have continued to expand for borrowers

with less-than-pristine credit records, the te rms of credit extended to such borrowers 
stayed tight, with credit limits remaining low and offered interest rates elevated. 
Delinquency rates on consumer debt have, on the whole, continued to be stable in 
recent months, with delinquencies on credit ca rd loans staying near historical lows and 
those on student loans little changed at elevated  levels.  The performance of auto loans, 
however, appears to have softened a bit furthe r, particularly for lenders with significant 
subprime loan holdings.  Issuance of ABS backed by all types of consumer debt 
continued to be robust duri ng the intermeeting period. 
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY 
Bank credit grew at a solid pace over th e intermeeting period, reflecting strong 
growth in core and noncore loans.  Banks also  continued to add secu rities to their books, 
mainly Treasury securities and, more recentl y, agency mortgage-backed securities.  
Banks generally report having acquired these securities to meet Basel III liquidity 
requirements.  Since year-end, cash holdings at branches an d agencies of foreign banks 
rebounded to a level significantly below the p eak registered late last year, following 
pronounced year-end declines presumably owing to the introduction of Basel III leverage 
ratios in foreign jurisdictions.   
In the fourth quarter, th e profitability of bank holding companies (BHCs) 
remained within its narrow post-crisis range, well below the levels seen in the decade 
prior to the crisis.  Declining net interest margins continued to be a key factor for the 
relatively low profitability of large banks, with  significant increases in their holdings of 
high-quality liquid assets adding downward pr essure to such margins.  In addition, 
noninterest income at banks remained weak in the fourth quarter , as trading revenue 
declined and mortgage banki ng activity stayed subdued.   
The stock prices of large U.S. BHCs  increased about 4 percent over the 
intermeeting period, outperforming broad market  indexes, and the CDS spreads of large 
BHCs narrowed back toward post-crisis lows.  On March 5, the Federal Reserve released

M2 expanded at a robust annual rate of about 10 percent, on average, over 
January and February, reflecti ng strong growth in currency and liquid deposits, while less 
liquid components of M2 continued to run off.   The monetary base contracted at an 
average annual rate of about 14 percent, primarily reflecting a decline in reserve balances 
that resulted from the nearly $400 billion in  term deposits that banks booked in the Term 
Deposit Facility (TDF) during the series of operational tests that were conducted in 
February.2 
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS 
In addition to TDF operations, testing of the Federal Reserve’s term and overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement (term RRP and ON RRP) operations continued over the 
intermeeting period.  The Open Market De sk auctioned one-week term RRPs on four 
consecutive weeks beginning on February 12, 2015.  The size of the term operations 
increased from $10 billion on February 12 to $50 billion on March 5.  All four term 
auctions were oversubscribed, and the competitively determined award rate was 6 basis 
points at each operation, which was in line with  private market rates.  Total Federal 
Reserve RRPs outstanding did not change sign ificantly following the term operations, as 
participants largely substitu ted investments from overnight RRPs to term RRPs.   
Overall, the ON RRP and term RRP operati ons continued to pr ovide a soft floor 
on money market rates during the intermeeting period.  The federal funds and Eurodollar 
rates stayed steady, although both dipped on the January and February month-ends.3  The 
overnight GC repo rate for Treasury collateral,  as surveyed by the Desk, stayed at or 
above the ON RRP offer rate of 5 basis points.   In contrast, there were some moderate

3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 11 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging about 4 basis points.

TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING 
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury and MBS markets remained stable.4  Over 
the period, the Desk purchased $33 billion of  MBS under the reinvestment program and 
rolled about 2.5 percent of the expected settlements.  In Febr uary, the ratio of the Desk’s 
MBS settlements to gross issuance of these secu rities declined somewh at relative to its 
January level and was about 32 percent.  
On March 6, 2015, Treasury Secretary Lew sent a letter to the Congress noting 
that on March 13, the Treasury Department w ill begin to take “extraordinary measures” 
to remain under the debt limit.  With the availa bility of these measures as well as April’s 
typically sizable tax receipts, the Treasury is not expected to hit the debt limit before the 
fall of 2015.5 
4 Since the January FOMC meeting, the Treasury has auctioned $268 billion of Treasury nominal 
fixed-coupon securities, $9 billion of Treasury Inflation-Protection Securi ties, and $28 billion of two-year 
Floating Rate Notes. 
5 The debt limit suspension period will expire on March 15, 2015.  Once the Treasury declares a 
debt issuance suspension period, it will have the fo llowing accounting measures to stay under the debt 
limit:  suspending sales of State and Local  Government Series Treasury securities, suspending daily 
reinvestment of the Treasury securities held by th e Government Securities Investment Fund, redeeming 
existing investment and suspending new investment in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, 
and suspending the daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund into 
Treasury securities.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  As always, a number of upside and downside risks 
attend our forecast; importantly, however, we see neither monetary nor fiscal policy as 
well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  Consequently, we 
continue to view the risks to our forecast for real GDP growth as tilted somewhat to the 
downside.  By contrast, we continue to view the risks around our unemployment 
projection as roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse 
demand-side developments about offset by the possibility that the unemployment rate will continue to surprise us to the downside even though we have taken another step in 
this projection to try to counteract that possibility. 
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, we 
continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.  Since 
the January Tealbook, oil prices have risen somewhat and TIPS-based inflation compensation has rebounded from its recent lows.  Nonetheless, inflation compensation remains lower than it was a year ago, especially at the five- to-ten-year horizon.  
Moreover, core PCE price inflation is well below the Committee’s target, despite a 
declining unemployment rate and other signs of labor market tightening.  One factor that has likely held down U.S. inflation recently has been the rise in the exchange value of the dollar.  With other major central banks increasingly adopting aggressive policies to fight 
their own inflation shortfalls, there is a risk that the dollar may continue to appreciate, 
leading to further downward pressure on U.S. inflation.  
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which views the vulnerability of the U.S. financial 
system to adverse shocks as moderate overall. This assessment reflects low levels of 
leverage and maturity transformation in the banking sector, moderate use of leverage in 
the nonbank financial sector, and a subdued pace of borrowing by the private

nonfinancial sector.1 That said, there are some concerns about valuation pressures.  
Corporate bond yields remain near historical lows, reflecting low term premiums. Debt 
issuance to speculative-grade business borrowers stayed strong throughout 2014, 
although there has been some slowing in recent months in the issuance of leveraged 
loans.  And, in commercial real estate, valuation pressures, while still moderate, 
continued to build last year.  Structural vulnerabilities in the mutual fund sector persist, particularly for U.S. money market funds and funds that invest in illiquid assets. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario, the long-run equilibrium real rate is substantially lower than in our baseline, but 
policymakers only gradually reduce their estimate, leaving the federal funds rate initially 
higher than is desirable.  In the second scenario, the trajectory of longer-term inflation 
expectations is lower than in the baseline, leading to a shallower path of actual inflation 
in the coming years.  The third scenario considers the possibility that the natural rate of 
unemployment is lower, and potential output grows faster, than in the baseline.  In the 
fourth, better-than-expected improvements in the labor market and robust readings on 
consumer sentiment in recent months portend a  stronger pace for the economic expansion 
and higher inflation over the projection period.  In the fifth scenar io, a disorderly exit of 
Greece from the euro-area monetary union causes Europe to plunge into a deep recession 
with severe adverse effects on global financial conditions and confidence.  The final 
scenario considers the possibility that the ECB’s expansionary monetary policies and the 
large decline in oil prices over the past year yield a much stronger and more broad-based 
pickup in foreign growth than we envision in our baseline outlook.

governed as in the baseline forecast by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  
The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended to be 
broadly consistent with the guidance provide d in the Committee’s recent statements.2 In 
all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their 
baseline paths. 
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Funds Rate 
In the baseline, the staff has lowered the long-run equilibrium real federal funds 
rate the rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation in the long run from 
1¾ percent to 1½ percent.  However, there is considerable uncertainty around this rate, 
with some analysts and statistical models suggesting that it might be considerably lower 
than the revised staff estimate.  In this scenario, the equilibrium real rate is 1 percentage point lower than in the revised ba seline, and poli cymakers only gradually recognize that 
fact.  As a result, the path of the federal funds rate is initially higher than policymakers 
would have chosen if fully informed. 
Consequently, output expands more slowly, and the unemployment rate falls more 
slowly, than in the baseline. Real GDP growth in 2016 through 2018 is about 
¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline projection; the unemployment rate is about 
¼ percentage point higher in 2017 through 2019. With lower resource utilization, 
inflation rises a little more slowly than in the baseline.  Because policymakers learn about 
the shift in the long-run equilibrium real rate gradually, the path of the federal funds rate 
is initially similar to that in the baseline.  However, as policymakers eventually learn 
about the shift in t he long-run equilibrium real rate, the federal funds rate later in the 
projection period is much lower than in the baseline, reaching 2¼ pe rcent in 2018 and 
staying at that level thereafter. 
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
In the baseline projection, consumer price inflation is projected to increase 
gradually t o the Committee’s longer -run target of 2 percent.  A key assumption behind 
this projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for wage and 
2As in the baseline, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule takes over in June 2015. For the scenarios run 
in SIGMA, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the FRB/US and EDO simulations. One key 
difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA uses a measure of 
slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that 
would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

price setting is currently 1.8 pe rcent and eventually rises to 2 percent.  However, a wide 
range of uncertainty surrounds this estimate, and some models the staff consults point to 
lower long-term inflation expectations.  
In this scenario, we assume that long-term inflation expectations currently stand at 
1.5 percent and that, going forward, households and businesses form their long-term 
expectations adaptively based on past inflation.  The subdued inflation expectations and 
low actual inflation in the coming years are mutually reinforcing.  As a result, inflation in 
this scenario runs persistently below the baseline and rises only slightly above 1½ percent 
in 2019. The federal funds rate increases more slowly after liftoff because of the lower 
trajectory of inflation, but given the inertial specification of the policy rule, the path of real interest rates is roughly unchanged from its baseline trajectory.  As a result, the paths 
of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged as well. 
Room to Grow 
While the unemployment rate has come down substantially over the past few 
years, inflation has not picked up, with core PCE inflation averaging less than 1½ percent since 2012.  One reason wage and price gains have remained modest despite falling 
unemployment may be that the staff’s estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is 
too high.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 
lower in the past five years than assumed by the staff and that it continues to fall, 
eventually reaching 4.2 percent in early 2016, 1 pe rcentage point less than in the baseline.  
This lower natural rate of unemployment is also consistent with the rapid decrease in 
unemployment seen in recent years given the modest rates of GDP growth. In addition, 
we assume that structural productivity gains in recent years have been about 
¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  With these assumptions, potential output rises, on average, about ½ percentage point more than in the baseline over the 
2015 19 pe riod.  The output gap closes only in the final quarter of 2018. 
Inflation rises more slowly than in the baseline, reflecting both greater resource 
slack and faster productivity growth.
3 Core PCE inflation reaches only 1¾ percent at the 
end of 2019. The federal funds rate remains at its current target range for an additional 
year, lifting off in the second quarter of 2016.  The unemployment rate continues falling 
3 A higher path of productivity holds down marginal costs of production, which are a key 
determinant of inflation in FRB/US and many other macroeconomic models.

after 2016, reaching its natural rate at the end of 2018 and moving below it thereafter.  
As a result of a combination of higher structural productivity and more-accommodative 
monetary policy, real GDP growth picks up, averaging about 3 percent over the 
2016 19 pe riod.4 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
While recent data on aggregate spending have been somewhat softer than 
expected, improvements in labor market conditions have been solid and readings on 
consumer sentiment in recent months are at the ir highest levels since the recovery began.  
In this scenario, house holds and businesses are more confident about the underlying 
strength of the economy and are willing to spend and hire more. The resulting strong 
spending and investment growth support a much faster economic expansion than in the 
baseline.  We also assume that inflation will be more sensitive to reductions in resource 
slack than in the standard version of the EDO model, consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE models.
5 
Real GDP growth averages 3¼ pe rcent in 2015 and 2016, c ompared with 
2¼ percent in the baseline projection. The unemployment rate falls below 5 percent by 
the end of 2015, reaches its lowest point of 4¼ percent in the beginning of 2017, and 
increases slowly for the remainder of the forecast horizon.  With resource utilization 
running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the baseline, reaching 2¼ percent in 2018.6 
The federal funds rate lifts off in the second quarter of 2015, as in the baseline, but rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in the second half of 2017 and reaching almost 
5 percent in 2019.  Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would 
4 In this scenario, policymakers are aware of the increase in structural productivity growth. If 
policymakers instead learned about the increase in structural productivity growth only gradually, and thus 
the stance of the federal funds rate were tighter than they would have implemented if fully informed, real 
GDP growth would be ¼ percentage point lower and inflation would be 10 basis points lower, on average, 
through 2019 than in the original scenario. In this case, the unemployment rate would decline to only 
4¾ percent at the end of 2019. 
5 We make inflation more sensitive to slack by reducing the adjustment cost parameters for prices 
and wages in EDO. In particular, we use values that are two standard deviations below the EDO point 
estimates of these two parameters. 
6 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for 
wages and prices in this scenario. Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation 
would have peaked at only a little over 2 percent.

eventually drive the unemployment rate to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation 
back down to 2 percent. 
Greek Exit with Severe Spillovers 
As discussed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook box 
“Recent Developments in Greece,” our baseline assumption is that the Greek 
government after a protracted period of contentious negotiations and political 
brinkmanship eventually works out a compromise with its international creditors that 
keeps Greece in the euro area.  However, this outcome is far from certain, and in this 
scenario we consider the extreme possibility that debt negotiations completely break 
down, leading to a cutoff in official funding and the rapid collapse of Greece’s banking 
system, ultimately triggering a disorderly exit of Greece from the euro area.  Although the firewalls erected during the past few years and aggressive actions by the European authorities could, even in this event, keep spillovers to other countries reasonably contained, our scenario considers a more dire outcome in which Greek exit causes the 
euro area to plunge into a deep recession and has severe adverse effects on global 
financial conditions and confidence. 
Specifically, our scenario assumes that financial conditions in the euro area 
tighten sharply and that confidence plummets amid rising unemployment and heightened 
disinflationary pressures.  Periphery sovereign spreads rise 400 basis points above 
baseline while euro-area corporate borrowing spreads rise more than 200 basis points.  
As a result, euro-area real GDP falls more than 6 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2016.
7 The euro-area crisis has substantial adverse spillovers to the United States.  
U.S. corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 100 basis points, while flight- to-
safety flows cause the trade-weighted dollar to increase nearly 8 percent and depress 10-year Treasury yields about 25 basis points.  Financial conditions tighten even more in 
the EMEs, and their currencies depreciate substantially.  
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  Given that U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to baseline as a result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions, U.S. real GDP 
expands only 1 percent, on average, in 2015 and 2016, about 1¼ percentage points per 
7 The effects on euro-area GDP in this scenario are roughly two-thirds the size of those considered 
in the July 2012 Tealbook scenario titled “European Crisis with Severe Spillovers.”

year less than in the baseline.  Lower domestic demand and lower import p rice inflation 
cause U.S. core inflation to fall about ¾ percentage point below baseline in 2016.  The 
inertial Taylor rule prescribes a substantially shallower path for the federal funds rate 
than in the baseline.  
Faster Foreign Growth 
This scenario considers the possibility that the ECB’s expansionary monetary 
policy and the large decline in oil prices over the past year yield a much stronger and more broad-based pickup in foreign growth than we envision in our baseline.  In this 
scenario, higher consumer and business confidence boosts the levels of GDP in the euro 
area and the rest of the world 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, above the baseline 
over the next two years.  Amid the more favorable foreign outlook, the run-up in demand for dollar-denominated assets seen since last summer partially reverses, leading the broad real dollar to fall about 6 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2016.  
The weaker dollar and stronger foreign growth boost U.S. real activity by 
increasing U.S. real net exports relative to the baseline.  Core PCE inflation rises as the weaker dollar puts upward pressure on import prices and resource slack narrows more quickly.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands by about 2¾ percent in 2016, roughly 
½ percentage point more than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation rises to nearly 
2 percent by late 2016, while the unemployment rate falls well below 5 percent.  The 
inertial Taylor rule prescribes that the federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the 
baseline.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
