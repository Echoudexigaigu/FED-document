Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook   
The information we received during the intermeeting period suggests that 
household and business spending, production, an d labor demand were all weaker last 
quarter than we projected in the March T ealbook.  We now estimate that real GDP was 
about unchanged in the first quarter—compared  with a 1¾ percent increase in the March 
projection—and that industri al production contracted.1  Although the labor market 
continued to improve last quarter, payro lls rose 70,000 per month less than we had 
expected, and the unemployment rate in March was 0.1 percentage point higher. 
In response to the incoming data, we lowe red our projection for real GDP growth 
in the second quarter to just under 2½ percen t, ¼ percentage point less than in the March 
Tealbook, and trimmed our forecast for pa yroll gains in the coming months.  
Nevertheless, we judge much of the weakne ss in the recent data to be the result of 
transitory factors or noise, with few implicat ions for GDP growth beyond the first half of 
this year.  Over the medium term, moneta ry policy is assumed to be a bit more 
accommodative in this projection, and othe r conditioning factors are a little more 
supportive, on balance, of economic growth.  All told, we revised up modestly our 
forecast of output growth beyond the near  term, with real GDP increasing about 
2½ percent in the second half of this year and in 2016 befo re slowing to 2 percent in 
2017.  At the end of the medium term, the leve l of real GDP is about ¼ percent below the 
March Tealbook projection.  The output gap at  that time is positive, but with our 
unchanged supply-side assumptions, the gap is  slightly smaller than in the March 
Tealbook.   
The unemployment rate in the current pr ojection declines from 5.5 percent in 
March to 5.1 percent in the final quarter of 2017, slightly below our estimate of its natural 
rate but a bit higher than in the Marc h Tealbook.  The modest decrease in the 
unemployment rate over the projection period remains more gradual than implied by the 
change in the GDP gap, as we continue to anticipate that an unwinding of the current 
unusual weakness in labor force participation will  attenuate the decline in the jobless rate. 
                                                 
1 The BEA is scheduled to publish its initial estimate of first-quarter GDP on April 29, the second 
day of the FOMC meeting.

  We estimate that total PCE prices fell 2 pe rcent in the first qu arter, dragged down 
by the earlier sharp declines in oil prices, and that core PCE prices rose just ¾ percent, 
partially reflecting soft read ings that we think are transitory.  Both estimates are 
unrevised from the March Tealbook.  With th ese temporary influences on inflation 
anticipated to fade, both headline and core pr ice inflation are projec ted to be 1½ percent 
in the current quarter and then to edge up to 1¾ percent by 2017, as energy prices rise, 
import prices turn up next year, and resource utilization tightens further.   
As always, numerous risks attend our outlook.  We view the uncertainty around 
our projection for real GDP gr owth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in 
line with the average of the past 20 years, a pe riod that includes cons iderable volatility.  
We have maintained our assessment that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted 
somewhat to the downside, larg ely reflecting our view that neither monetary nor fiscal 
policy appears well positioned to offset subs tantial adverse shocks  to the economy.  We 
still see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment ra te as roughly balanced, as 
the downside risks to real activity are offset by the possibility that the unemployment rate 
could continue to decline more rapidly than we expect (despite the small upside surprises 
in recent months).  Our concerns with resp ect to the inflation outlook remain mostly on 
the downside, given the stil l-muted readings on TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation and risks to domestic in flation from dollar appreciation.   
The box “Tealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2014” discusses the 
recent errors in the staff’s forecasts for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.  A related discussion is in the box “New Exhibit on Pred iction Intervals Derive d from Historical 
Tealbook Forecast Errors” in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 We now assume that the federal funds ra te will lift off from its effective lower 
bound after the September meeting rather than after the June meeting.  This 
small modification to our monetary po licy assumption is broadly consistent 
with the responses to both  the “flash” Survey of Primary Dealers conducted 
following the March FOMC meeting and the latest survey, as well as with expectations of liftoff suggested by the federal funds futures market.  As in 
our previous projections, following liftoff,  the federal funds rate is assumed to

 Tealbook Forecast Errors :  An Update through 2014 
As was the case for 2013, staff forecasts were roughly in line with the latest 
estimates of real GDP growth for 2014 but did not anticipate the sizable drop in the 
unemployment rate.  Meanwhile, inflation in 2014 was slightly below the staff’s 
expectations .  Here we present and discuss these recent forecast errors. 
The gray bars in the left panel of figure 1 show the currently published Q4/Q4 percent 
changes in real GDP from 2011 to 2014 ; the blue squares show the forecasts for growth 
made in the April Tealbook one year prior, and the green triangles show the forecast 
from the April Tealbook in the contemporaneous year.   The whisker bands around the 
squares and triangles demarcate 70 percent forecast-error bands, with unusually large 
forecast errors represented by cases where the top of a gray bar (the actual value) falls 
outside one of the whisker bands.  Because the bars themselves represent the latest 
revised data, the red dots show the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimate of 
GDP growth for eac
h year from April of the subsequent year (known as the third 
estimates) , along with 70 percent bands computed from past revisions. 
The staff errors in forecasting 2013 and 2014 GDP growth were not particularly large, 
and while the forecasts for 2014 Q4/Q4 GDP growth currently appear slightly too high, 
revisions could easily reverse that conclusion —for example, forecasts of 2013 GDP 
growth that earlier appeared slightly too high now appear to have been slightly too 
low, given the subsequent upward revisions to the BEA’s estimates .  Indeed, an array 
of indicators suggest economic growth stepped up in 2014 from its 2013 pace, currently 
estimated to be around 3 percent.  For example, the pace of payroll employment gains 
picked up in 2014, and the unemployment rate fell by more than in prior years.  As such, 
the staff views GDP
 growth in 2014 as likely held down by measurement err or, and an 
upward revision to 2014 GDP growth would not be surprising.

As shown in the right panel of figure 1, the staff’s errors in forecasting the 
unemployment rate in 2014: Q4 were unusually large.  In addition , the staff’s 
projections for the unemployment rate one quarter and further ahead were 
consistently too high from August 2011 to October 2014, with the forecast errors 
reflecting a mix of lower-than-expected labor force participation and higher-than-
expected household survey employment.   Payroll employment gains (not shown) also 
were larg er in 2014 than the staff had anticipated. 
Figure 2 shows the staff’s forecasts , with standard error bands, for total and core PCE 
price inflation along with the latest estimates from 2011 to 2014 .  The figure shows that 
the errors in forecasting 2014 inflation were not particularly large.  The 
contemporaneous-year forecast error for 2014 inflation w as concentrated in energy, 
reflecting lower-than-anticipated crude oil prices, while the error in forecasting 2014 
inflation one year ahead was spread across more categories, including the broad non-
energy, non-housing services category. 
The staff compensation growth forecasts (not shown) also appear to have been 
slightly too high recently —for example, the staff forecast of the four-quarter growth 
rate of the employment cost index for hourly compensation over  2014 was 2¾ percent 
in April 2013 and 2½ percent in April 2014, above the current published value of 
2¼ percent.   Similarly, the staff forecast of the four-quarter growth rate of nonfarm 
business compensation per hour over 
2014 was about 3 percent in April 2013 and 
2½ percent in April 2014, compared with the current Bureau of Labor Statistics 
estimate of 2½ percent.1 
                                                 
1 The staff recently switched from forecasting nonfarm business compensation per hour (CPH) to 
business CPH, which shows a slightly lower Q4/Q4 growth rate in 2014, around 2¼ percent instead of 
2½ percent.

  rise at a pace determined by the prescr iptions of an inertial version of the 
Taylor (1999) policy rule.  The projected path of the federal funds rate is a bit 
lower than in the March projection, reach ing an average of 2.3 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2017.2 
Other Interest Rates 
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
significantly, albeit a bit le ss steeply than in previ ous rounds.  This downward 
revision reflects the new trajectory of e xpected short-term rates along with a 
slightly lower projected pa th for the term premium.  The rising path of the 
Treasury yield reflects the movement  of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates, as well as an 
increase in term premiums that is due in part to the waning of the effects of 
the FOMC’s balance sheet policies.   
 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium 
term have been revised essentially in lin e with the changes to the path for the 
Treasury yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are projected to rise 6 percent per year over the forecast period, 
a little slower than in the March Teal book.  This revision reflects a slightly 
shallower projected decline in the equity premium. 
 Incoming data on house prices have been  in line with our expectations, 
leaving our forecast little changed from  the March Tealbook.  We continue to 
project that house price appr eciation will slow, from 4¾ percent last year to an 
average rate of about 3¼ percen t per year from 2015 to 2017.  
Fiscal Policy 
 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.  
We continue to anticipate that fiscal policy actions at all levels of government 
                                                 
2 If we had maintained our assumption that the federal funds rate would lift off in June, the 
FRB/US model projects that, relativ e to our current forecast, real GDP growth would be less than 
0.1 percentage point weaker in both 2016 and 2017, the unemployment rate would be less than 
0.1 percentage point higher at the end of 2017, inflation would be a couple of basis points lower in 2017, 
and the federal funds rate would be about 15 basis points higher at the end of the medium term.

  will swing from a small drag on real GDP  growth in 2014 to a small stimulus 
this year and over the rest of the medium term.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that foreign real GDP grow th slowed from an annual rate of 
2¾ percent in the second half of 2014 to  a surprisingly low 1¾ percent in the 
first quarter of this year.  We proj ect that foreign economic growth will 
bounce back and reach 3 percent by the end of this year—supported by 
accommodative monetary policies, deprec iated currencies, and still-low oil 
prices—and that it will maintain this pace, roughly its trend rate, in 2016 and 
2017.  Foreign real GDP growth in the fi rst half of 2015 is ½ percentage point 
lower than in the March Tealbook and is essentially unrevised  thereafter.   
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciat ed about 2 percent since the March 
Tealbook, consistent with the downward shift in the expected path of the 
federal funds rate and weaker-than-exp ected U.S. economic data.  However, 
we project that the nominal dollar will appreciate 2¾ percent through the 
remainder of 2015 as investors refocu s their attention on the divergence 
between expected monetary  policies in the United States and abroad.  
Thereafter, as foreign economic growth firms and as some tail risks for the 
euro-area economy diminish, the nominal dollar is projected to weaken.  Our 
forecast leaves the broad real dollar a bout 1½ percent lower at the end of the 
forecast period relative to the previous Tealbook.  
Oil and Other Co mmodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has ri sen $6 per barrel since the time of the 
March Tealbook, reaching $62 per barrel on April 21.  The rise appears 
primarily to reflect signs that U.S.  production may level out soon, which 
would help reduce the current supply glut .  Prices for futures contracts with 
delivery at the end of 2017 were little  changed.  We expect the price of 
imported oil to move up from $56 per ba rrel this quarter to about $64 per 
barrel by the end of the forecast period—a projected path that, relative to the 
March Tealbook, is $3 per barrel higher in  the second half of this year and 
little changed on average for the remainder of the forecast period.

   Among non-oil commodity prices, iron ore and zinc prices have declined 
sharply in response to increases in supply and to concerns about Chinese 
demand.  However, the price of copper moved higher because of supply 
disruptions.   
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As noted earlier, the incoming spending data  have been disappointing, on balance, 
and we have downgraded our estimates for nearly  all of the major categories of final sales 
in the first quarter.  We currently estima te that real GDP was about unchanged last 
quarter, compared with a 1¾ pe rcent increase in the March Tealbook.  (Estimates of first-
quarter GDP growth from most other near-ter m forecasting approaches within the System 
have also revised down consid erably over the past two mont hs.  See the box “Nowcasting 
Models within the Federal Reserve System.” )  While we judge some of the weakness 
seen in a variety of indicators to be the result  of transitory factors or statistical noise, we 
also perceive some of the incoming data as suggesting a slower pace of underlying spending than we had previously expected.
3  As a result, we have marked down slightly 
the projected second-quarter increase in real GDP to a little below 2½ percent.  
 Much of the downward revision to our first-quarter estimate reflects a 
considerable slowing in real PCE grow th, from 4½ percent in the fourth 
quarter of last year to only 2 percent in the first quarter of this year, about 1½ percentage points less than we exp ected in the March Tealbook.  We have 
attributed some of the weakness in first-quarter consumer spending to 
transitory factors.  For example, light motor vehicle sales rebounded in March, 
consistent with our assumption that February sales had been held down by 
unusually bad weather.  However, core retail sales bounced back in March by 
less than we expected, and overall PCE appears inexplicably soft last quarter.  With the fundamentals underpinning consumer spending remaining solid, we 
expect real PCE growth to step up to a 4¼ percent pace in the current quarter, 
only about ¼ percentage point less than in the March forecast.  (For 
information on recent developments in households’ health-care spending, see 
                                                 
3 These transitory factors include the harsh weather in February, disrupted production associated 
with the West Coast port dispute, a measurement problem for core retail sales that is related to the inclusion 
of gasoline sales in the tallies for some large retailers, and apparent residual seasonality in the data on state 
and local government construction spending.

 Nowcasting  Models  within the Federal Reserve  System 
“Nowcasting” is  the prediction  of economic  conditions  in the present and the very near  
future.  One important  development  in recent years has been the  application  of statistical  
methods  capable of  dealing with mixed ‐frequency  information  to nowcasting.   Such 
methods  are particularly  helpful because they  allow data that reflect the state of 
economic  activity at frequencies  higher than the quarterly releases  of the national 
accounts  measures  to be incorporated  in a formal way.  The availability  of these 
techniques  has spurred a great deal of interest in nowcasting,  including  among Federal 
Reserve System staff.  Here  we summarize  the nowcasting  models used across the  
Federal Reser ve System for estimating  real GDP growth with real‐ time data and show the 
nowcasts  of first‐quarter real GDP growth from  the various models. 
Most nowcasts  of real GDP growth use  one of two approaches.   The first,  more 
traditional  approach is  often referred to as a “tracking  model.”  The second, more 
modern approach is  based on statistical  models that formalize the  influence of many data 
releases on estimates  of GDP growth.1  
Under the more  traditional  approach,  the quarterly growth  rates of the major 
expenditure  components  of GDP are estimated  using either accounting  translations  of 
the available  data or so‐called bridge equations  that regress the growth rate of each 
component  of GDP on a few related variables,  which are typically monthly.   Under the 
bridge equation  method,  missing value s of the “explanatory”  variables  in the quarter of 
interest are forecast using, for example,  time‐series models.  The nowcast  of real GDP 
growth is then constructed  by aggregating  the nowcasts  of its components  in a way that 
attempts  to mimic the  Bureau of  Economic  Analysis methodology,  sometimes  
incorporating  judgmental  adjustments  to the process . 
In contrast,  the more modern approach  formulates  the nowcast  process as a joint system  
in which a large set of observed  variables  at low (quarterly)  or high (monthly,  weekly, or  
daily) frequencies,  among which is quarterly  real GDP  growth, are related to high‐
frequency  latent variables.   Given the  large number of variables  used to provide  
information  about the state of the economy, conventional  econometric  models—such as  
least‐ squares regression—would  run the risk of  being highly parameterized,  which could 
make their estimation  imprecise.   The nowcasting  models typically employ one of two 
approaches  to solve this high‐dimensionality  problem.   First, in “dynamic factor  models,”  
a few unobserved  macroeconomic  factors driving the evolution of  economic  activity are 
extracted  from the observed  variables  and ultimately  used to produce the nowcasts;  
“factor‐augmented  autoregressions”  are variants of these models.  Second,  models can 
gain precision by  applying  estimation  methods  that overcome the high‐dimensionality  
issue; the use of Bayesian  vector autoregressions  (VARs) is one such  technique.   Because 
                                                 
1 In the summary  table on the next page, all of the models use one of the two approaches  to at 
least  some degree.  However,  some Federal  Reserve Banks  use models that are hybrids of the two broad 
approaches  described  in the text.   For the sake of brevity,  we do not explain  them  here, but the 
respective  regional Banks  can provide additional  information.

 these approaches  can be applied to data at different frequencies, they  are often referred 
to as mixed‐frequency models. 
Within the Federal Reserve System, 14  different nowcasting  models are currently  in use 
(see the table below).  For each model, the  table shows nowcasts  of real GDP growth for 
the first quarter of this year as of both February 13 and April 16.  The nowcasts  at these 
two dates  illustrate how  the estimates  can change  as more information  is added to the  
process.  In this instance,  they show how these different models  have interpreted  the 
generally  disappointing  data received  in recent weeks:  The median nowcast  declined  
from 2.5 percent  on February  13 to 1.4 percent on April 16.2  Additionally,  even though the 
same information  is available  to the models at a given  point in time, the flow of 
information  can determine  the variability  of the nowcasts  beyond the particularities  of 
the individual  models:  Early  in the quarter, when information is  very limited,  the models 
likely yield forecasts  of real GDP growth  mostly based on recent historical  data; as more 
news becomes  available  from the data releases, the nowcasts  could start to differ 
depending  on the features of the models.  For  example,  for 2015:Q1,  the dispersion of  
estimates  across models  as of April 16 was greater than it was on February  13.

of the Affordable Care Act”.)   
 The incoming data on housing starts a nd permits were well below our already 
lackluster expectations.  We attribut e some of the weaker-than-anticipated 
readings on housing construction to the se vere winter weather in February, but 
the paltry March rebound in starts and permits suggests that weather was not 
the principal factor depressing cons truction activity.  Consequently, we 
marked down our projection for housing st arts in the coming months and now 
expect real residential in vestment to increase at an annual rate of only 
1½ percent in the first half of this ye ar, 3½ percentage points less than in the 
previous Tealbook.   
 Business fixed investment is forecast to decline in the first half of the year 
compared with the small gain projected in the March Tealbook.  In particular, 
spending on nonresidential structures is now  projected to fall at an annual rate 
of 20 percent in the firs t half, reflecting a plunge in outlays on drilling 
structures in response to the earlier dr op in crude oil prices.  Moreover, we 
expect outlays on equipment and intangibles  to rise only modestly in the first 
half, consistent with weak recent data on orders, shipments, and net imports of capital goods, as well as tepid fo rward-looking indicators of business 
spending. 
 Both real exports and real  imports appear considerably weaker in the first 
quarter than expected in the March Te albook.  However, taken as a whole, net 
exports are projected to be a bit less of a drag on GDP growth than in our previous projection.
4  Net exports are now estimated to have subtracted 
⅔ percentage point from real GDP growth  in the first quarter, and they are 
expected to subtract the sam e amount in  the second as exports flatten out and 
imports rebound.  
 In the industrial sector, mining output fell last quarter as the sharp declines in 
the drilling of new oil and gas wells were only partly offset by continuing 
increases in the extraction of oil and gas from existing wells.  Manufacturing 
                                                 
4 Although the West Coast port labor dispute likel y reduced both exports and, especially, imports 
in the first quarter, the February decline was too larg e for the labor dispute to be the primary explanation.

 In this discussion, we examine changes in hea lth insurance coverage and medical 
spending during the first year of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).  Although the ACA 
became law in 2010, implementation of the major components began only in 2014.  
The four main provisions of the ACA, designed to increase health insurance coverage, are 
the expansion of Medicaid eligibility, the introduction of health insurance exchanges, the 
individual mandate, and the employer mandate.  In 2014, the expansion of Medicaid 
eligibility to adults with household incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty line was 
adopted by 28 states and the District of Columbia.1  These locations accounted for 
9½ million net new Medicaid enrollees.2  States that did not expand eligibility add ed 
1½ million net new enrollees.3  
The health insurance exchanges —government-
administered marketplaces where in
dividuals can purchase insurance and receive income-
based subsidies for premiums —enrolled another 8 million individuals.  An estimated 
57 percent of these e
nrollees were previously uninsured.4  All told, as shown in the figure 
below, the uninsured rate for ad
ults age 18 to 64 fell from about 18 percent at the end of 
2013 to about 13 percent by the end of 2014.  The uninsured rate in states that expanded 
                                                 
1 Prior to the Medicaid expansion, childless adults in most states were not eligible for Medicaid or 
the income limit was lower than 138 percent of the poverty line.

(2015),  Medicaid and CHIP:  January 2015 Monthly Applications, Eligibility Determinations and Enrollment 
Report  (Washington:  HHS, March), http://medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/program-
information/downloads/medicaid-and-chip-january-2015-application-eligibility-and-enrollment-data.pdf . 
3 Increased Medicaid enrollment in states that did not expand eligibility may reflect increased 
awareness of Medicaid eligibility because of the publicity surrounding the ACA, easier enrollment in 
Medicaid through the health insurance exchanges, and greater demand for insurance coverage as a 
result of the individual mandate.

 Medicaid eligibility decline d 5 percentage points (from a level of 15 percent) compared 
with a 4 percentage point decrease (from a level of 20 percent) for states that did not 
expand Medicaid eligibility. 
Given the rise in the number of people with health insurance , it seems likely that the ACA 
boosted spending on health-care-related goods and services.  However, parsing out the 
increase in spending directly associated with the ACA is not straightforward, as other 
factors may also have caused outlays for health care to increase in 2014.  One approach is 
to compare the increase in health spending in 2014 with the average increase in past 
years in order to roughly net out the influence of other factors.  Our preferred measure 
of health spending, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for health-care goods 
and services, grew 4.1 percent over the four quarters of 2014.  In the three years prior to 
the implementation of the ACA, health spending rose an average of 2.7 percent.  The 
difference between these growth rates is consistent with the ACA boosting real PCE 
health spending growth roughly  1¼ percentage points in 2014.  
Another approach to estimating the effect of the ACA on real PCE health spending is to 
combine the decline in the uninsured rate during 2014 with assumptions about average 
health spending by uninsured and insured individuals; in particular, we assume that the 
newly insured spend twice as much on health care as uninsured people of the same age.5  
This method suggests that the ACA boosted the growth in real PCE health spending 
1.2 percentage points in 2014.  Thus, both approaches point to an increase in health 
spending growth of roughly 1 ¼ percentage points.  In dollar terms, this suggests that the 
ACA increased PCE health spending by $30 billion, equivalent to adding 0.2 percentage 
point to the growth rate of real GDP in 2014.6 
Looking forward to 2015, we expect the uninsured rate to continue to fall, but the 
magnitude of any further decline depends on a number of factors.  One is whether 
additional states choose to expand Medicaid eligibility.  Another is that individuals who 
failed to obtain insurance will be paying the individual mandate penalty for the first time 
this year (as 2014 final tax payments were due by April 15).  Paying the penalty may 
increase its salience and lead to increased enrollment in the exchanges.  Moreover, the 
penalty rises in 2015 and again in 2016.  Finally, the employer mandate for firms with 
100 or more employees began this year, although this mandate is expected to have only 
modest consequences, as the vast majority of these firms already offer health insurance 
to their employees. 
                                                 
5 This assumption is based on the results in Jack Hadley and John Holahan (2003), “Covering the 
Uninsured:  How Much Would It Cost?” Health Affairs , June, 
http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/early/2003/06/04/hlthaff.w3.250/suppl/DC1.  
6 In addition, the ACA may have increased nonhealth spending, as the subsidies may have freed up 
consumer resources that were formerly devoted to purchasing insurance.  Offsetting these effects, the 
increased taxes and cuts to Medicare providers used to finance the expansion probably reduced 
aggregate demand.

  output also moved down last quarter, reflecting both temporary factors (such 
as the West Coast port labor dispute) and longer-lived factors (such as weaker 
demand due to the appreciation of th e dollar).  Looking ahead, the survey-
based measures of new orders activity ar e at levels that suggest only a modest 
rise in factory output this quarter, leav ing a projected first-half pace that is 
much weaker than that  in the March Tealbook. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Given our view that much of the recent  weakness in real ac tivity likely reflects 
transitory influences, we continue to projec t that real GDP will increase about 2¼ percent 
per year, on average, over the medium term.  As in previous Tealbooks, we expect the 
ongoing normalization of monetary policy to weigh more heavily on economic growth 
over time. 
 We expect real GDP to increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second 
half of this year, just a touch faster than in the Ma rch Tealbook, as the slightly 
weaker momentum in domestic spending suggested by the recent data is a bit 
more than offset by the effect of the lower dollar on net e xports; for the year 
as a whole, GDP growth is 1¾ percent,  ½ percentage point  less than in the 
March Tealbook.  Real GDP is projected to increase 2½ percent next year—a 
shade faster than in the March projecti on, as the lower inte rest rates and the 
lower dollar provide a greater boost to ac tivity—and then to slow to 2 percent 
in 2017.  All told, the level of real GDP at the end of the medium term is ¼ percent lower than in the March Tealbook. 
 In previous Tealbooks, we have often in terpreted a divergence in signals of 
slack as a reason to adjust our supp ly-side assumptions.  However, the 
incoming data for spending, production, and the labor market all suggest 
slightly greater resource sl ack than we had projected in March.  As a result, 
we did not change our forecast of potential output in this projection, which 
rises about 1½ percent this  year and 1¾ percent over  the rest of the medium 
term.  Real GDP rises somewhat faster than potential output over the medium term and is ¼ percent above  its potential at  the end of 2017, a slightly smaller 
output gap compared with the Marc h Tealbook given the downward revision 
to GDP in this projection.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
Although the March employment report was not  as strong as we had expected, the 
labor market has continued to improve in re cent months.  In the near term, we expect 
payroll employment to rise at a similar rate as in the first quarter  and the unemployment 
rate to edge down further.  
 The smaller-than-expected payroll incr ease in March followed several months 
of outsized gains.  For the first quarter as a whole, payroll employment growth 
averaged about 200,000 per month.  This pace, while still solid, is roughly 
70,000 less than we had projected at the time of the March Tealbook. 
 The unemployment rate remained at 5.5 percent in March, whereas we had 
projected it to move down 0.1 percenta ge point.  Similarl y, the labor force 
participation rate was lower than anticipated, edging down 0.1 percentage 
point, whereas we had exp ected it to be flat.  
 The staff’s labor market conditions i ndex indicated that the labor market 
continued to improve in the first quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the 
second half of last year. 
 We expect payroll employment to ri se about 200,000 jobs per month this 
quarter and the unemployment rate to e dge down to 5.4 percent.  Relative to 
the March Tealbook, projected payroll gains average 40,000 less per month 
and the projected unemployment rate  is 0.1 percentage point higher. 
Consistent with the modest revision  to real output over our medium-term 
projection, the outlook for the labor market is little changed. 
 We expect monthly private job gains to average about 200,000 in the second 
half of this year, the same pace as in  the first half.  Increases in payroll 
employment are expected to sl ow to around 165,000 in 2016 and 125,000 in 
2017, as productivity moves back up toward its trend.   
 The unemployment rate is projected to  move down from an average of 
5.6 percent in the first quar ter of this year to 5.1 pe rcent at the end of 2017.  
The path of the unemployment rate is  0.1 percentage point higher over the

  projection period, which is consistent w ith the slightly weaker path of the 
GDP gap. 
 As in previous Tealbooks, we view the unemployment rate gap as currently 
understating the amount of slack remaining in the labor market as a result of 
an unusually low labor force participati on rate and an unusually elevated level 
of involuntary part-time employment.  As the economy continues to improve, 
we expect more individuals to be drawn into the labor market and the rate of 
involuntary part-time employment to m ove down.  The improvement in labor 
force participation relative to its trend attenuates the decline in the 
unemployment rate, which only edges down over the next three years even as 
GDP continues to increase moderate ly faster than its potential.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Recent data on inflation have been a touch higher, on balance, than anticipated in 
our March Tealbook projection and support our e xpectation that consumer price inflation 
will step up in the second quarter.  Over th e medium term, our forecast for PCE inflation 
is little changed.   
 We estimate that total PCE prices fell at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, principally reflec ting a steep drop in cons umer energy prices, and 
core PCE prices rose just ¾ percent.  Our estimates for both total and core 
PCE inflation are unchanged from the March Tealbook, as a slightly higher reading on core CPI prices in March wa s offset by softer medical services 
prices implied by incoming PPI data.   
 Factoring in the March CPI data and the slightly higher path of oil prices, we 
now project both total PCE inflation and core PCE inflation to rise to about 
1½ percent in the second quarter, ro ughly ¼ percentage point above the 
March projection.
5 
 Following the declines in farm commodity  prices observed la te last year and 
early this year, indexes of spot and fu tures prices for foodstuffs have been 
relatively stable.  That said, the data on consumer food prices surprised us on 
                                                 
5 Despite a projected upturn in total PCE prices in the second quarter, the 12-month change in this 
price measure is expected to edge lower in coming months and temporarily turn negative in June.

  the downside, and our current forecast for the first half of this year is 
noticeably lower than in the March Tealbook.  We now estimate that PCE 
food prices edged down in the first quarte r, and we project them to decrease at 
a similar pace in the second quarter.6  In the medium term, consumer food 
prices are projected to rise at a pace in line with core inflation.  
Beyond the near term, we expect inflation to move up gradually to 1¾ percent as 
energy prices rise, import prices turn up next year, and resource utilization tightens 
further in an environment of well-anc hored long-run inflation expectations. 
 Core import prices are expected to de cline at an average annual rate of 
4 percent in the first half of this year , reflecting the previ ous appreciation of 
the dollar and net declines in commodity prices as well as unusually low 
foreign inflation.  With our projection th at the dollar will peak early next year 
and foreign CPI inflation will pick up, co re import price inflation is expected 
to turn positive by the start of 2016 and move up to 1¾ percent in 2017.  (See the box “The Effect of the Dollar on U.S. Core Import and Consumer Prices.”) 
 Expected PCE inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) remain s unchanged at the FOMC’s longer-run 
inflation objective.  However, the preliminary April reading on expected 
inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan Survey ticked down to 
the bottom of the range seen over recent years.  TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation have been lit tle changed recently and remain only 
slightly above the low levels observed earlier this year.  We have not altered 
our assessment of the level of long-term  inflation expectations relevant for 
wage and price setting, but one of the scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section explores the possibility that th ese long-term inflation expectations are 
lower than we assume.   
 With import prices expected to begin to turn up early next year and with labor 
and product markets tightening, we con tinue to project core PCE price 
inflation to rise from 1¼ percent th is year to 1¾ percent in 2017.  As 
consumer energy prices are projected to ri se only a bit faster than core prices 
                                                 
6 Even though drought conditions in California worsen ed, prices of fruits and vegetables in March 
were lower than we expected.

 The Effect of the Dollar on U.S. Core Import and Consumer Prices 
Since last summer, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated 13 percent (see figure 1 on the 
next page).  A stronger dollar lowers U.S. inflation by reducing the prices we pay for our 
imported goods and services.  This discussion reviews our estimates of the exchange rate 
pass-through to U.S. core import prices and examines the implications of these estimates fo r 
our forecast of core PCE inflation.1 
The prices we pay for our imports reflect the value of our exchange rate as well as foreign 
prices for these products and global commodity prices.  In terms of forecasting import 
prices, the staff finds it useful to focus on the prices of imported “core goods,”  which we 
define as imports of goods exclud
ing oil, natural gas, computers, and semiconductors.2  
According to the staff’s econometric model of core import prices, a 10 percent dollar 
appreciation is estimated to reduce the level of core import prices by 3 percent, all within 
two quarters.   This relatively small effect reflects, in part, that, for reasons of competition 
and market structure, producers tend to vary their markup over cost rather than allow the 
dollar prices of their goods to move fully with exchange rates.3  Our pass-through estimate 
of one-third is within the range of estimates in the academic literature.       
Declines in core goods impor
t prices, in turn, depress U.S. core PCE inflation, as these 
imports constitute part of the U.S. consumption basket.  Core PCE prices are also held down 
indirectly through the drag that an appreciation of the dollar has on net exports and, thus, 
on aggregate demand.  All told, including t hese “GDP effects,” the staff’s judgmental 
forecasting rule is that a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar lowers U.S. core PCE inflation 
nearly ¼ percentage point in each of the first two years following the shock, and 
0.1 percentage point in the third year.  This somewhat limited effect reflects both the small 
pass-through from the dollar to import prices and the small share of core imports —about 
10 percent —in U.S. GDP.    
The recent behavior of core 
goods import price inflation and our staff forecast are shown by 
the solid black line in figure 2 on the next page.   As can be seen, core import prices have 
fallen sharply and are expected to continue to decline in the near term.  To assess the role of 
the dollar in this decline, we compare the import price model’s current prediction (the 
dashed red line) with the prediction if we keep all else equal but use the dollar path from the 
June 2014 Tealbook, before the dollar’s run -up (the solid red line).4  The model attributes 
                                                 
1Although this discussion focuses on how the dollar affects core import inflation and core PCE inflation, 
a rise in the dollar also lowers the dollar price of oil.  The lower oil price reduces headline inflation by 
somewhat more than core PCE inflation, but that difference is only material in the near term.   
2 We exclude these categories because they can obscure the economic signals coming from underlying 
import prices.  Oil and natural gas prices are very volatile, and the price indexes for computers and 
semiconductors are constructed to account for the rapid pace of technological change, which makes them 
behave very differently from other goods.   
3 Another reason for low pass-through is that, reflecting the importance of global supply chains, many 
imported goods are produced using intermediate inputs whose costs are fixed in dollars.   
4 In making this comparison, we incorporate the implications that the different path of the dollar has 
for nonfuel commodity prices.

 much of the weakness in import prices to the sharp appreciation of the dollar, as can be seen 
by comparing the two model paths. 
As mentioned above, our model estimates of the pass-through of exchange rate changes to 
core goods import prices are consistent with those in the literature , but there is a range of 
these estimates .  Although, so far, core goods import prices have declined less than what 
our model predicts, there is a risk that pass-through going forward will be higher than our 
current estimate.  We examine this possibility using the staff’s  SIGMA model.  In particular, 
we compare the effect of an additional 10 percent appreciation of the dollar using our 
standard version of SIGMA (where pass-through is about one-third) with the case where 
pass-through is assumed to be one-half.5  This higher pass-through represents the upper end 
of the plausible estimates in t
he literature.  As can be seen by comparing the red and blue 
lines in figure 3, the higher pass-through coefficient amplifies the effect of the dollar on core 
import price inflation, reducing it by about 1 percentage point in the first year and by 
somewhat less in the second.   The effect of higher pass-through on core PCE inflation, 
shown in figure 4, is smal
ler; core PCE inflation falls about ¼ percentage point more than in 
the standard pass-through case in each of the two years following the shock.   
 
      
                                                 
5 The details of this simulation using the standard pass-through assumption is presented in the 
“Stronger dollar” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook.  Note that the PCE price 
response in SIGMA is somewhat larger than the response in the judgmental forecast, primarily because 
inflation is more sensitive to resource slack in SIGMA.

  after the first quarter, total PCE inflati on runs at about the same pace as core 
inflation through the medium term. 
 We have received little data on comp ensation since the previous Tealbook, but 
the data we did receive continue to s uggest that recent wage increases remain 
subdued:  In the 12 months through Ma rch, average hourly earnings of all 
employees increased 2 percent, in line with our forecast in the March 
Tealbook.  As labor markets tighten over the forecast period, we continue to 
expect hourly compensation to accelerate,  with increases in  the productivity 
and cost measure of compensation pick ing up from 2¼ percent last year to 
about 3 percent this year and to 3½ percent in 2016 and 2017.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Tayl or (1999) rule.  This polic y rule assumes a long-run 
equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3½ percent. 
 The federal funds rate rises further after 2017 and reaches its long-run value 
by 2020. 
 As monetary accommodation continues to be withdrawn, real GDP growth 
slows to 1¾ percent in 2018 and in 2019, just slightly below the growth rate of potential.  The unemployment ra te moves down to 5.0 percent in 2018 
before edging up to its natural rate of 5.2 percent.  
 PCE price inflation remains slight ly below the Committee’s long-run 
objective at the end of 2017.  However, with the unemploymen t rate below the 
natural rate, longer-run inflation exp ectations gradually edge up and PCE 
price inflation increases to 2 percent by 2019.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
We estimate that foreign real GDP growth slowed from a 2¾ percent annual pace 
in the second half of 2014 to 1¾ percent in the first quarter of this year, ¾ percentage 
point below our March Tealbook forecast.  The deceleration in GDP was widespread 
across advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) and 
was accompanied by a slowing in industrial production and international trade.   
Although the recent weakness gives us pause, w e do not expect the first-quarter 
slump to persist.  Part of the unexpected decline reflected a greater-than-anticipated hit 
from lower oil prices to economic activity in Canada —our largest trading partner —and, 
with oil prices stabilizing, we expect this effect to dissipate.  A dip in Chinese growth 
also is expected to be retraced as the authorities add to policy stimulus.  In addition, a 
projected step-up in U.S. growth from its first-quarter weakness, along with the 
continuation of highly accommodative monetary policies and the positive effects of past 
currency depreciation, should support activity abroad.  Thus, we continue to project that 
foreign growth will rise to a near-trend pace of 3 percent by late this year and remain at 
that pace in 2016 and 2017.  That said, we certainly see a risk that the first-quarter slump 
reflects deeper underlying weakness in the foreign economies than we have assumed.   
Although data suggest that euro-area activity is improving, the situation in Greece 
has grown more worrisome.  The Greek government is running out of cash and there has 
been little apparent progress toward an agreement with its official creditors that would 
unlock loan disbursements.  We judge there to be an appreciable likelihood that Greece 
will impose capital controls and miss debt payments in coming months, increasing the 
risk that it will eventually leave the euro area.  Because we also assume that European 
authorities will take concerted actions to protect other peripheral economies from 
disarray, Greek developments are still expected to  have fairly limited spillovers to the rest 
of the euro area.  However, we see a significant risk of a Greek exit that prompts a much 
more adverse reaction, one that roils financial markets and plunges the euro area back 
into recession.  We describe such a scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
Data on foreign inflation have come in about as expected.  In the AFEs, we 
estimate that consumer prices fell at an annual rate of ¾ percent in the first quarter 
following a ½ percent decline in the fourth.  As energy prices rise and earlier currenc y

  depreciation pass es through to consumer prices, inflation should move up to 1 percent 
this quarter and to 1¾ percent by late 2016, also supported by diminishing resource slack.  
Similarly, in the EMEs, consumer price inflation dipped to just ½ percent in the first 
quarter, in part because of a steep  decline in retail energy prices, but should rise back 
toward 3 percent in coming quarters. 
Amid low inflation and continued economic slack, we see monetary policy 
remaining highly accommodative in the AFEs and relatively easy in many EMEs as well.  
In contrast to the previous intermeeting period, central banks have taken few new policy 
actions since the March FOMC meeting.  A notable exception is China, where the 
authorities cut the reserve requirement ratio to support economic growth. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro area.   Recent indicators o
f economic activity, including industrial 
production, retail sales, and the composite purchasing managers index (PMI), 
suggest further firming of GDP growth, which we estimate at 1¾ percent in 
the first quarter.  We continue to see strong fundamental support for euro-area 
growth from ongoing monetary stimulus, past currency depreciation and oil 
price declines, and easing credit conditions.  We see these positive factors 
outweighing the negative effect of Greek developments, described in the 
following paragraph, helping euro-area GDP growth to rise to almost 
2 percent in the second half of this year and to average 2¼ percent in 2016 
and 2017.  Inflation was ne
gative 1½ percent at an annual rate last quarter, 
close to our projection in the March Tealbook.  As energy prices stabilize and 
the output gap narrows, inflation should rise to 1½ percent by the end of this 
year and 1¾ percent by the end of 2017.  We continue to expect the European 
Central Bank (ECB) to purchase asse ts totaling about €1 .2 trillion by 
September 2016 and to keep its main policy rate near zero through the end of 
2017.    
Negotiations between Greece  and its creditors aimed at unlocking financial 
assistance from European authorities and the International Monetary Fund 
continue to be extraordinarily difficult.  Despite some progress in recent 
weeks, the two sides remain far from an agreement.  Meanwhile, the Greek 
government is running out of cash, and concerns are mounting that it will 
default on some of the nearly €3 billion in payments on its medium - and long-

  term debt  coming due over the next month.  These fears have apparently 
intensified deposit outflows from Greek banks in recent weeks.  All told, we 
see an appreciable likelihood of capital controls and sovereign default, which 
could eventually culminate in Greek exit from the euro area.  In our baseline 
outlook, spillovers to the rest of the euro area from financial turmoil in Greece 
are limited, reflecting reduced exposure by European banks to Greece, support 
from the ECB’s ongoing sovereign debt purchases, and expectations that 
European authorities will take aggressive actions to keep remaining peripheral 
economies in the euro area.  Thus, financial tensions emanating from Greece 
exert only a modest drag on euro-area growth this year.  However, 
considerably more-adverse responses to a Greek default or exit represent a 
substantial downside risk to the outlook. 
 Canada.   We now estimate that real GDP growth slowed to ¼ percent in the 
first quarter, more than 1 percentage point below our March Tealbook 
estimate.  January monthly GDP fell, February imports of machinery and 
equipment —which are highly correlated with investment —declined, and the 
March manufacturing PMI remained in contractionary territory for a second 
month.  These data likely reflect the harsh winter weather, a sharper-than-
expected effect of the decline in oil prices on Canada’s oil sector,  and slowing 
U.S. demand.  As the se effects dissipate, we expect GDP growth to bounce 
back to 1½ percent in the second quarter and to rise to 2½ percent in 2016.  
The Canadian economy should be supported by the projected upward tilt in oil 
prices, accommodative monetary policy, and moderate U.S. growth.  
Compared with the March Tealbook, this projection is ½ percentage point 
lower in 2015 and little changed thereafter. 
As expected in the March Tealbook, first-quarter consumer prices were flat, 
held down by lower energy prices.  As oil prices bottom out, we expect 
inflation to bounce back to 1¾ percent in the second quarter and to reach the 
2 percent target by 2017.  Amid contained inflation pressures and weaker 
growth, we now expect the Bank of Canada to start tightening monetary 
policy in the second quarter of 2016, one quarter later than we had previously 
assumed. 
 Japan.   We estimate that real GDP growth slowed to a 1 percent pace in the 
first quarter from 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  This estimate is almost

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  1 percentage point below our projection in the March Tealbook, reflecting 
weaker-than-expected data for both the domestic and the external sectors.  
However, this year’s spring wage negotiations yielded the largest gains in 
nearly two decades, supporting our forecast that private consumption will firm 
going forward.  Accordingly, and amid considerable monetary policy 
stimulus, we project that GDP growth will rise to 1½ percent this quarter and 
average just below that pace through 2016.  In 2017, the recovery will likely 
grind to a halt as a second hike to the consumption tax rate is implemented.  
Consumer prices appear to have been roughly flat in the first quarter, with 
lower energy prices offsetting the boost from a depreciated yen.  With oil 
prices picking up, we project that inflation will increase to ¾ percent in the 
second quarter.  Thereafter, as the output gap narrows and inflation 
expectations resume rising, we see inflation moving up to almost 1½ percent 
by early 2017. 
 United Kingdom.   We estimate that real GDP growth moderated to 2 percent 
in the first quarter from 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  This estimate is 
½ percentage point below our forecast in the March Tealbook due to weaker-
than-expected data on external trade, industrial production, and construction 
activity.  That said, PMIs and business confidence indicators through March 
have been strong, suggesting that growth will rebound to 2¾ percent in the 
second quarter.  We expect GDP growth to remain robust through the 
remainder of this year and next before moderating somewhat to 2¼ percent by 
2017 as the output gap closes.  Declines in food and energy prices pushed 
inflation down to negative 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter.  
We expect inflation to rebound and increase to the Bank of England ’s (BOE) 
target of 2 percent by 2017 as the transitory effects of lower energy prices 
dissipate and slack in the U.K. economy is eliminated.  Given the BOE’s 
recent communication on the dangers of deflationary pressures in the United 
Kingdom, we have pushed back our expectation for the date of the BOE’s first 
rate hike to the first quarter of 2016.  We continue to predict a gradual pace 
for subsequent policy rate increases. 
EMERGING M ARKET ECONOMIES  
 China.  Recentl
y released  GDP data indicate that economic growth in China 
stepped down from an annual ra
te of 7 percent in the fourth quarter to only

  5¼ percent in the first quarter, 1¾ percentage points below our March 
Tealbook estimate.  Industrial production and exports dropped sharply in 
March .  Indicators of domestic demand, such as fixed-asset investment and 
retail sales growth, were somewhat stronger, although investment has 
decelerated considerably since the beginning of last year as the property 
market has cooled.  W e see growth picking up to a 7¼ percent pace in the 
second half of the year, supported by recent and further monetary easing as 
authorities seek to keep growth near their 7 percent target for this year ; 
authorities already announced a 100 basis point cut in banks’ reserve 
requirement ratios.  Growth should also be supported by a strengthening of 
exports as demand in China’s trading partners picks up and as the drag from 
last year’s appreciation of the real trade-weighted renminbi lessens.  We see 
growth then decreasing to about 6½ percent by the end of the forecast period, 
in line with our estimate of declining potential growth, and a bit below our 
March Tealbook forecast.    
Inflation dipped below zero in the first quarter from 1 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  The decline is primarily due to falling food and fuel prices.  We 
expect inflation to rebound to 2½ percent by the end of the year and to hold at 
that pace over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that growth in the rest of emerging Asia 
edged down to 3¾ percent in the first quarter, almost ½ percentage point 
below our March forecast, owing primarily to a widespread decline in exports.  
Although most of the region’s  economies are estimated to have slowed, 
growth in Korea and Hong Kong appears to have picked up from depressed 
levels in the fourth quarter.  With growth in the advanced economies projected 
to bounce back, we expect the decline in Asian exports to be short-lived and 
still see GDP growth in the region rising to 4½ percent by the end of 2015.  
Growth will also be supported by still-low oil prices and accommodative 
monetary policies.  Incoming data suggest that inflation likely bottomed out in 
the first quarter at negative ½ percent, largely reflecting the pass-through of 
lower oil prices.  We see inflation rising to 3¼ percent by 2016.  
 Latin America.  Recent  indicators for Mexico  suggest growth slowed from 
2¾ percent in the fourth quarter to 2 percent in the first quarter, 1 percentage 
point lower than in the March Tealbook.  Mexican manufacturing output and

  exports through February were weak, consistent with the sharp drop in U.S. 
manufacturing production in the first quarter.  Some of that weakness likely 
was caused by the labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which disrupted 
supply chains, and by the severe U.S. winter weather.  We expect Mexican 
growth to rebound in the current quarter to 2¾ percent, in line with the path 
for U.S. manufacturing activity, and average about 3¼ percent over the rest of 
the forecast period, boosted by the significant depreciation of the peso since 
mid-2014 and the effect of past economic reforms.  Headline inflation plunged 
to ¼ percent in the first quarter from more than 4 percent in the fourth, owing 
to a fall in some food and energy prices and the one-off effect of 
telecommunications reform.  As the effects of these factors fade, we expect 
inflation to move up to about 3¼ percent by the second half of this year and 
stay at that rate thereafter.      
Real GDP readings received since the March Tealbook indicate that South 
American  economies grew in aggregate at an annual rate of ½ percent in the 
fourth quarter.  Chile and Colombia enjoyed solid growth, but Argentina’s 
economy continued to flatline, and Venezuela plunged into recession.  
In Brazil , real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter, 
which, although meager, was better than we expected.  Growth was supported 
by strong private consumption, which more than offset a contraction in 
investment and exports.  Despite this positive surprise, we expect GDP to 
contract at an annual rate of nearly 2 percent in the first half of this year and to 
expand only slightly during the second half.  Domestic demand is held back 
by the adverse effects on consumer and business confidence of the corruption 
scandal at Petrobras and the tighter monetary and fiscal policies implemented 
to combat inflation and restore fiscal discipline.  Next year, we anticipate less 
drag from monetary policy and expect confidence to improve.  Accordingly, 
the economy should begin to expand, albeit at a subdued 2 percent rate.  
Inflation increased to an annual rate of 11 percent in the first quarter because 
of the pass-through from the sizable depreciation of the real and an increase in 
administered prices.  As the effects of these factors wane, and with policy 
interest rates likely to be kept near their curren t 12¾ percent level, we expect 
inflation to moderate to 5¾ percent next year.

Financial Developments 
Financial conditions, on balance, became  more supportive of economic activity 
over the intermeeting period.  Domestic mone tary policy communications that investors 
interpreted as more accommodative than anti cipated put downward pressure on interest 
rates while supporting risky asset prices.  Generally weaker-than-expected domestic 
economic data, especially the March U.S. empl oyment report, also pushed interest rates 
lower but weighed on risk sentiment at times.    
 The federal funds rate at the end of 2016 implied by OIS quotes decreased 
32 basis points.  Results of the Open  Market Desk’s surveys of primary 
dealers and market participants indicate d that the probability of liftoff at the 
June meeting had been marked down, and that the highest odds are now 
placed on liftoff at the September 2015 meeting.  
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities with maturities between 2 and 10 years declined 13 to 21 basis points, whil e 5-to-10-year-forward inflation 
compensation rose.  
 Yields on corporate bonds generally follo wed Treasury yields down.  Equity 
prices increased slightly, on net, as the shifts in mone tary policy expectations 
likely were partially offset by the weaker economic data.   
 Those same factors, as well as some improvements in the outlook for the euro 
area, contributed to a small depreciation in the nominal exchange value of the 
U.S. dollar.  
 Businesses raised significant amounts of funds, particularly for M&A activity.  
On balance, banks reportedly eased  lending standards and experienced 
increased loan demand in the first quarter.

  TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
Federal Reserve communications following the March FOMC meeting were 
characterized by investors as more accommodativ e than expected despite the removal of 
the “patient” language from the March FOMC stat ement.  Market part icipants reportedly 
focused on the sizable downward revisions to the projected path of the federal funds rate 
in the Summary of Economic Projections, as well as downward revisions to participants’ 
projections for inflation, GDP growth, and th e longer-run unemployment rate.  Over the 
remainder of the period, investors further mark ed down their expected path for short-term 
interest rates in response to weaker-than- expected domestic economic data, with the 
disappointing March employment report garnering particular attention. 
On balance since the March FOMC meeting, the federal funds rates at the end of 
2016 and end of 2017 implied by OIS quotes have each fallen about 35 basis points.  According to the Desk’s surveys of dealers a nd market participants, investors now see the 
September 2015 meeting as the most likely date for the first increase in the federal funds 
rate target range, and the probability of liftoff at the December 2015 meeting was larger 
than that at the June meeting.   
Nominal Treasury yields out to around 10 years decreased somewhat, consistent 
with the more-accommodative-than-expected FOMC communications and generally weak tone of the economic data.  On net,  2-, 5-, and 10-year yields moved down 15, 21, 
and 13 basis points, respectively.  However, 20-  and 30-year yields we re relatively little 
changed.  
Over the intermeeting period, TIPS yields  declined more than their nominal 
counterparts, as did their asso ciated implied forward rates.  Consistent with the shift in 
monetary policy expectations, in creases in oil prices, and hi gher-than-expected February 
and March CPI reports, the 5-year measure of inflation compensation based on TIPS  moved up 19 basis points.  The 5-to-10-year TIPS-based forward measure of inflation compensation rose 9 basis points.  Changes in inflation compensation measures based on 
inflation swaps were similar.

  weak tone of the incoming economic data.  This move was reinforced by positive 
economic data in the euro area.  However, the dollar stabilized later in the period.  On net 
over the intermeeting period, the broad nominal dollar index declined about 2 percent.  
After appreciating significantly last year and early this year, the real value of the broad 
U.S. dollar is close to its historical average since 1973.  
AFE sovereign yields were modestly lower during the period.  Ten-year yields in 
the United Kingdom fell in tandem with thos e on U.S. Treasury securities, largely 
because of a similar shift in expectations  toward later removal of monetary policy 
accommodation.  German sovereign yields also decreased modestly amid ECB purchases 
of sovereign debt, despite relatively strong eu ro-area macroeconomic data releases.  In 
addition, Swedish and Swiss yield curves declined and are currently  negative out through 
5 years and 10 years, respectively. 
AFE equity markets, particularly those in the euro area and Japan, slightly 
outperformed equities in the United States.  A widespread increase in EME equity prices 
was reinforced by market perceptions of reduced  EME risks, with the recent rise in oil 
prices appearing to play a ro le for the major oil exporters.  Equity prices in China and 
Hong Kong moved significantly higher, buoyed in part by monetary policy 
accommodation and recent deregulation allowi ng greater flows between the Chinese and 
Hong Kong stock markets. 
Although the Greek government made a tim ely payment to the IMF on April 9, 
Greek sovereign spreads continued to widen, as the Greek government struggled to reach an agreement with official creditors ahead of  upcoming obligation date s.  Concerns about 
Greece led Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish s overeign spreads to edge wider, although 
they remain quite narrow.  
U.S.  EQUITY PRICES AND CORPORATE BOND YIELDS  
Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. e quity price indexes increased slightly, 
on net, as market expectations of more acco mmodative monetary policy and stabilization 
of oil prices were partia lly offset by the on-balance weaker-than-anticipated 
macroeconomic news.  Stock prices for ener gy firms, which account for about 10 percent 
of the S&P 500 index, retraced a small porti on of their substantial drop since mid-2014.  
One-month option-implied volatility on th e S&P 500 index decreased slightly and 
remained at about the middle of its range over the past year.

  With about 20 percent of earnings reports  for firms in the S&P 500 index on hand 
and equity analysts’ forecasts for the rest, the staff estimates that earnings per share in the 
first quarter decreased notably over the previ ous quarter.  Even s o, a larger-than-usual 
fraction of firms has reported earn ings above forecasts.  In March,  equity analysts 
continued to revise down their forecasts for y ear-ahead earnings per share for firms in the 
S&P 500 index, though noticeably less than in th e previous two months.  The moderation 
of the downward revisions likely reflects, in part, the stabilization of the dollar and oil 
prices (see the box “Effects of Dollar A ppreciation on U.S. Corporate Profits”).  
Yields on corporate bonds generally fo llowed Treasury yields down over the 
intermeeting period.  Spreads of 10-year triple-B-rated corporate bond yields over 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities we re about unchanged, while yield spreads on 
speculative-grade corporate bonds  narrowed somewhat.  The narrowing was due, in part, 
to lower spreads for speculative-grade energy firms, but spreads for those firms remained above their historic al median levels. 
BUSINESS FINANCE  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial bus inesses continued to be accommodative, 
and businesses raised substantial amounts of  funds in bond, equity, and loan markets, 
particularly for M&A and leveraged buyout activities.  Inve stment- and speculative-grade 
corporate bond issuance was strong in the first quarter.  Seasonally adjusted domestic 
nonfinancial CP outstanding rebounded in recent weeks after having declined slightly in 
the first quarter.  Public equ ity issuance rose in the first quarter, supported by a surge in 
seasoned offerings.  Growth of C&I loans on banks’ books was 12 percent at an annual 
rate over the same period, consistent with reports from banks in the April SLOOS that 
they had experienced increased loan demand from large and middle-market firms and 
reduced loan pricing.  In the syndicated leve raged loan market, issuance of new money 
loans slowed in the first quarter relative to  its pace over the past  year but remained 
strong.  However, gross issuan ce of leveraged loans was co nsiderably smaller over the 
past two quarters than earlier in 2014, as refinancing activit y dropped to its lowest level 
in a few years.  Even so, CLO issuance in  February and March rebounded to near the 
robust pace registered during most of  the second half of last year.  
Financing for commercial real estate ( CRE) remained broadly available for large 
and small loans and the full range of property types.  CRE loans on banks’ books expanded appreciably in the first quarter, and, in the April SLOOS, banks reported a

 Effects of Dollar Appreciation on U.S. Corporate Profits 
U.S. corporate profits fell about 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  In 
part, this weakness reflects a decline in profits of the energy sector, which have 
been hurt by the decline in oil prices.  The strength of the U.S. dollar has also had 
an effect .  Dollar appreciation lowers the profits of some U.S. corporations 
through two channels:  (1 ) If unhedged, profits earned by foreign subsidiaries 
translate into fewer
 U.S. dollars, and (2) U.S. exports become less competitive 
compared with goods produced in other countries.   
Over the past several months, equity investors have been factoring the effects of 
dollar appreciation into their expectations for corporate earnings and portfolio 
allocation decisions .  The blue line in figure 1 shows the difference between the 
stock returns of firms with high foreign sales (that is, firms with at least 
50 percent of revenue earned abroad, directly or through exports) and low 
foreign sales (that is, firms with less than 20 percent of sales abroad).1  While the 
shares of firms with
 high foreign sales underperformed in 2013, their relative 
performance worsened as the dollar began to appreciate last summer.   Also, a s 
shown in figure 2,
 S&P 500 firms with high foreign sales have experienced 
relatively large downward revisions to earnings expectations over the past 
six months .  
The earnings of U.S. foreign subsidiaries, which account for about 25 percent of 
the overall profits of U.S. nonfinancial corporations, declined 7 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2014 and are estimated to have declined another 5 percent in 
the first quarter of 2015.  To gauge how much of th is recent decline in foreign 
profits can be accounted for by the strength of the dollar, we use the staff’s  
 
                                                 
1 Firms with high foreign sales tend to be larger and account for almost 75 percent of S&P 
500 nonfinancial earnings excluding oil and utilities.  We exclude oil firms to isolate the effect 
of the U.S. dollar.  We also exclude utilities firms because they typically pay high dividends and 
so their stock returns are typically closely tied to movements in bond markets.

 forecast model for direct investment receipts, which are roughly equivalent to 
the income of foreign subsidiaries .  The model depends on the exchange value of 
the dollar, the foreign output gap, and the relative price of imported oil. 
Figure 3 shows the evolution of direct investment receipts, including the forecast 
for 2015.  Direct investment receipts fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2014 and 
are projected to fall further in the first quarter of 2015.  Our model attributes 
about half of the estimated 12 percent decline in direct investment receipts over 
these two quarters to the appreciation of the dollar and about half to the decline 
in oil prices.  The modes t recovery in receipt s projected over the remainder of 
2015 is due in large part to somewhat higher oil prices and a slight narrowing of 
the foreign output gap.   
Overall, we find that the recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar is having a 
significant effect on U.S. firms’ profits, especially for firms with high foreign 
sales, and explains 
roughly half of the recent decline in profits earned from 
foreign subsidiaries .

  further easing of standards on such loans and another strengthening of demand.  In 
addition, survey respondents indicated that th ey eased some CRE loan terms over the past 
year, and they largely pointed to more aggressive competition, as well as improving 
outlooks for vacancy rates and property pri ces, as reasons for doing so.  Indeed, CRE 
prices continued to rise th rough the fourth quarter of 2014, supported in part by rising 
rents and declining vacancy rates as well as by accommodative financing conditions.  Meanwhile, CMBS issuance was about 50 percent higher than in the first quarter of last 
year, and spreads of CMBS rates over Tr easury swap rates remained narrow.   
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Credit conditions for reside ntial mortgages were generally little changed over the 
intermeeting period, and lending volumes stayed light.  In the April SLOOS, some large 
banks reported having eased standards on GSE-eligible, government-guaranteed, and 
jumbo mortgage loans in the fi rst quarter.  Alth ough house prices rose moderately again 
in February, the downtrend in the share of mortgages in a negative equity position has 
flattened somewhat in recent quarters; at 11 to  17 percent, depending on the source, this 
share remained elevated relative to pre-crisis levels.   
On balance over the intermeeting period, fi nancing conditions in consumer credit 
markets stayed generally accommodative, and the latest readings on credit performance 
of consumer debt were little changed.  According to the April SLOOS, bank lending 
standards on consumer loans were about unc hanged in the first quarter.  Outstanding 
balances of auto and student loans con tinued to expand at a robust pace through 
February, as such credit remained widely ava ilable, including to borrowers with subprime 
credit scores.  In contrast, borrowing thr ough credit card accounts appeared to have 
slowed noticeably.  Nonethele ss, the April SLOOS indicated that demand for credit cards 
had strengthened further, c onsistent with confidential s upervisory data through January 
showing growth in new accounts an d increases in credit lines. 
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
Over the intermeeting period, the equity prices of large bank holding companies 
slightly underperformed broad equity price indexes, though CDS spreads for such institutions edged down.  The majority of large banks that have reported earnings 
exceeded analysts’ profit forecasts for the fi rst quarter on gains in noninterest income.

  However, compressed net interest margins reportedly continued to limit overall 
profitability. 
M2 expanded at an average annual rate of 7 percent over February and March, 
reflecting strong growth in liquid deposits and U.S. currency, while small time deposits 
and retail money funds continued to run off.  The monetary base, on net, was about flat 
over the past two months, as increases in currency were partially offset by declines in 
reserve balances.   
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Testing of the Federal Reserve’s overnight  and term reverse repurchase agreement 
(ON RRP and term RRP, respectively) opera tions continued over the intermeeting 
period.2  In March, the Desk auctioned two te rm RRPs that covered quarter-end.  The 
first operation, on March 19, attracted bids just  in excess of the $75 billion offer amount 
and was allocated at 9 basis points. The second operation, on March 30, offered 
$125 billion but was undersubscribed and allo cated at the maximum rate of 10 basis 
points.  In total, take-up of the Federal Reserve’s term and overnight RRP programs on 
this quarter-end ($378 billion) was similar to that on year-end 2014 ($397 billion).3  
Overall, the ON RRP and term RRP operati ons continued to pr ovide a soft floor 
on unsecured money market rate s during the intermeeting peri od, even over quarter-end.  
The federal funds and Eurodollar rates generally  stayed within a range of 11 to 13 basis 
points, although they dipped to 6 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, at the March quarter-end.
4  Quarter-end effects in other unsecured funding markets were also 
fairly muted.  However, foreign banking or ganizations’ reserve ba lances temporarily 
fluctuated by $300 billion ar ound quarter-end, continuing a patte rn reportedly associated 
with the introduction of the Basel III minimum leverage ra tio requirement in foreign 
jurisdictions. 
In secured markets, temporary funding pressures also were evident at quarter-end. 
Overnight GCF repo rates for Treasury secu rities increased more than expected, 
especially in the interdealer GCF market.  The one-day jump in GCF repo rates could 
                                                 
2 Twenty-five new counterparties became eligible to participate in RRPs on  March 16, 2015.  So 
far, their participation has been limited, representing just over $23 billion of the $378 billion take-up at 
quarter-end. 
3 At the September 2014 quarter-end, when there were no term RRP operations, $407 billion in 
bids were received for the $300 billion capped ON RRP operation. 
4 The effective federal funds rate averaged 12 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 4 basis points.

due in part to balance sheet adjustments at quarter-end.  Over the in termeeting period as a 
whole, the expected path of  the overnight GCF repo rate implied by futures contracts 
moved about in line with the OIS- implied federal funds rate path. 
TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury and MBS markets remained stable over the 
intermeeting period.5  The average bid-asked spread, on-the-run premiums, and fails-to-
deliver were little changed.  The daily bid size  and (interdealer) trading volume were also 
about unchanged but remained at the historical ly low levels that have prevailed since 
2009.  More broadly, however, market particip ants continued to express concerns about 
the robustness of market  liquidity during times of increased stress. 
Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $41 billion of MBS under the 
reinvestment program and rolled $2.5 billion in the expected settlements.  In addition, 
prepayment speeds on agency MBS held by the Federal Reserve rose in recent weeks as a 
result of the pickup in the re financing activity in response to  the low level of mortgage 
rates in late January.  The high levels of  repayments will result in increased Desk 
reinvestment purchases in the rest of April and May. 
                                                 
5 Since the March FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned $148 billion of 
Treasury nominal fixed-coupon securities, $13 billion of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and 
$13 billion of two-year Floating Rate Notes.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first 
scenario, aggregate demand is persistently weaker than anticipated in the baseline.  In the 
second, the recent lackluster readings on spending and production prove to be more 
transitory and the underlying pace of economic activity is stronger than assumed in the 
baseline projection, leading to a higher path of inflation.  The third scenario considers the 
possibility that the trajectory of long-term inflation expectations is lower than in the 
baseline, leading to a shallower path of actual inflation in the coming years.  The fourth 
scenario examines the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment is lower, and 
potential output grows faster, than in the baseline.  In the fifth scenario, the exit of Greece 
from the euro-area monetary union causes Europe to plunge into a deep recession with 
severe adverse effects on global financial conditions and confidence.  The final scenario 
considers the possibility that the broad real dollar appreciates 10 percent relative to the 
baseline. 
We generate the first, third, and fourth scenarios using the FRB/US model, while 
the second one uses the EDO model.  The final two scenarios are generated using the 
multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has lifted off from its current 
target range, its movements are governed —as in the baseline forecast —by an inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a 
mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the 
Committee’s recent statements.1  In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of 
the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Persistent Slowdown in Economic Activity  
Recent data on consumer spending, housing construction, business investment, 
and industrial production, as well as the latest employment report, have come in weaker 
than anticipated.  In this scenario, we assume that this softness in economic activity turns 
                                                 
1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a broadly similar policy rule to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations.  One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference betw een actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

 out to be more persistent than projected in the baseline forecast.  In particular, the 
projected acceleration in consumer demand and housing construction is delayed relative 
to the baseline as household confidence in the recovery falters and the pace of household 
formation remains low.  In turn, these conditions adversely affect profits and business 
confidence, causing firms to reduce their investment spending.  
Real GDP rises only ½ percent this year and next and 1¾ percent in 2017, about 
1¼ percentage points less than the baseline on average.  The unemployment rate rises to 
6.5 percent in 2017 before gradually moving back toward its assumed natural rate ; 
inflation is slightly lower than in the baseline projection.  Given this weaker outlook, the 
federal funds rate remains at or below 50 basis points until early 2018.  Th e federal funds 
rate reaches 1½ percent by the end of 2019, about 1¾ percentage points below baseline. 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
While much of the incoming data 
have been lackluster, some forward-looking 
indicators have remained firm.  In particular, initial claims for unemployment insurance 
are very low, job openings are elevated, and consumer sentiment remains upbeat.  In this 
scenario, households ’ and business es’ confiden ce about the underlying strength of the 
economy leads them to be more willing to spend and hire than in the baseline, supporting 
a much faster economic expansion.  We also assume that inflation will be more sensitive 
to reductions in resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO model, consistent 
with the estimates of some other DSGE models.2  
Real GDP growth averages 4 percent in the second half of 2015 and 3½ percent in 
2016, compared with 2½ percent in the baseline projection.  The unemployment rate falls 
below 5 percent by the end of 2015, bottoms out at 4¼ percent at the beginning of 2017 
and then increases slowly for the remainder of the forecast period.  With resource 
utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the baseline, reaching almost 
2½ percent in 2019.3  The federal funds rate lifts off in the third quarter of 2015, as in the 
baseline, but rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in the second half of 2017 
and reaching 5 percent in 2019 .  Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate 
                                                 
2 We make inflation more sensitive to slack by reducing the adjustment cost parameters for prices 
and wages in EDO.  In particular, we use values that are two standard deviations below the EDO point 
estimates of these two parameters. 
3 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for 
wages and prices in this scenario.  Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation 
would have peaked at only a little over 2 percent.

 would eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring 
inflation back down to 2 percent. 
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
I
n the baseline projection, consumer price inflation is projected to increase 
gradually to the Committee’s longer -run target of 2 percent.  A key assumption behind 
this projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for wage and 
price setting is currently 1.8 percent and eventually rises to 2 percent.  However, a wide 
range of uncertainty surrounds this assumption
, and some models the staff consults 
currently point to lower long-term inflation expectations.   
In this scenario, we assume that long-term inflation expec
tations currently stand at 
1.5 percent and that, going forward, households and businesses form their expectations 
adaptively based on past inflation.  The subdued inflation expec
tations a
nd low actual 
inflation in the coming years are mutually reinforcing.  As a result, inflation in this 
scenario runs persistently below the baseline and is onl
y slightly above 1½ percent in 
2019.  The federal funds rate increases more slowly after liftoff because of the lower 
trajectory of inflation, but given the inertial specification of the policy rule, the path of 
real interest rates is roughly unchanged from its baseli
ne trajectory.  As a result, the paths 
of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged as well.  
Room to Grow 
While the unemployment rate has come down substantially over the past few 
years, inflation has not picked up, with core PCE inflation averaging less than 1½ percent 
since 2012.  One reason wage and price gains have remained modest despite falling 
unemploym ent may be that the staff’s estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is 
too high.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has fallen 
faster over the past five years than assumed by the staff, to 4.5 percent in the current 
quarter, and that it continues to fall, reaching 4.2 p
ercent in early 2016, 1 percentage 
point less than in the baseline.  This lower trajectory for
 the natural rate of unemployment 
is also consistent with the rapid decrease in unemployment seen in rece
nt years given the 
modest rates of GDP growth.  In addition, we assume that structural productivity gains in 
recent years have been about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  With these 
assumptions, potential output rises, on average, about ¾ perc
entage point more than in 
the baseline over the 2015 –19 period.  The output gap closes only in the first quarter  
of 2019.

 New Exhibit on “Prediction Intervals Derived from Historical 
Tealbook Forecast Errors”  
This Tealbook round the staff is introducing a set of new measures for 
understanding the uncertainty surrounding its forecast.  This new exhibit touches 
on two broad areas of uncertainty:  first, uncertainty about the current (and past) 
state of the economy, informed by revisions to the data, and second, uncertainty 
about how the economy will evolve, informed by the staff’s historical forecast 
errors. 
 
Emphasizing historical forecast errors has two important benefits.   First, the se 
errors are conceptually closel
y related to the uncertainty we want to capture 
around the current staff forecast.  Second, this procedure requires relatively few 
assumptions —chiefly, that forecast errors across time can be meaningfully 
combined into a single dist
ribution that will be relevant over the projection period. 
 
Another way that the staff characteriz es uncertainty is through stochastic 
simulations of the FRB/US model.  (The model-based uncertainty bands will 
continue to be shown in the exhibit illustrating the alternative simulations.)  
However, these model simulations rely on a specific model that differs in some 
important aspects from the judgmental procedures the staff uses .  In addition, the 
FRB/US model simulations do not incorporate uncertainty about data revisions. 
 
The top four panels of the new exhibit show fan charts for the key variables of our 
projection:  the unemployment rate, GDP growth, and total and core PCE inflation.  
Each fan chart includes revision intervals derived from the historical distribution of 
revisions to the data.   As shown in the fan charts, uncertainty due to data revisions 
varies widely across variables.  For 
example, because the unemployment rate is not 
subject to revision (other than for revised seasonal factors), its revision bands are 
very small, whereas the revision bands around past estimates for real GDP growth 
are much wider. 
 
Over the medium-term forecast period, the fan charts show both the 70 percent 
and 90 percent prediction-interval bands derived from the percentiles of the sizes 
of past staff forecast errors.1  Note that the standard against which the staff 
forecasts are evaluated is the late
st vintage of the data, so this method will also 
take account of the uncertainty resulting from any data revisions following the 
initial estimates.   The prediction  intervals allow us to make a number of 
                                                 
1 Because we have a limited history of Tealbook projections two years ahead, we extend the 
prediction-interval bands into 2017 using information from outside forecasters (the date range 
denoted as “Augmented Tealbook” in the exhibit).  Specifically, we use forecasts from the CEA, 
CBO, and Blue Chip consensus, and we assume that any forecast deterioration from one to two 
years ahead would apply equally to the Tealbook projections.  To reflect that change in 
procedures, we separate the bands for 2016 and 2017 with a second dashed line (and we do not 
extend the band for core PCE inflation because of limited data on outside forecasts of core 
inflation).

 observations about the staff’s historical forecast record.   For example, for the 
unemployment rate, the median staff forecast error one year ahead is negative —
the median lies slightly below the forecast line —because the historical forecasts 
have been too high slightly more often than they have been too low.  However, the 
green band around the same forecast extends much higher above the forecast line 
than below it, because rare large misses to the upside have been much larger in 
magnitude than rare large misses to the downside. 
 
We use Tealbook forecasts from 1980 to 2014 for computing prediction intervals for 
GDP growth and the unemployment rate but the shorter range of 1998 to 2014 for 
our inflation measures .  The shorter range for the inflation measures, during which 
inflation outcomes have fallen in a much smaller range over the past near-two 
decades than previously, reflects our judgment that this is the period that is most 
relevant for assessing the amount of uncertainty surrounding our inflation 
projections.2 
 
To the right of each of the four fan charts is the historical distribution of the 
corresponding series over the time period we deem most useful for assessing 
uncertainty .  Comparing the staff projections in the fan charts with these historical 
distributions can aid in the interpretation of the prediction-interval bands .  For 
example, by 2017 the staff forecast of the unemployment rate is low, and therefore 
the unconditional 90 percent confidence range placed around it dips below the 
lowest reading since 1980.  This result suggests that a 90 percent range conditional 
on other factors, such as the state of the economy, would likely not extend down 
as low as shown in the fan chart. 
 
The results in the upper fan charts rely crucially on the assumption that the 
historical periods chosen for calculating the distribution of forecast errors in the fan 
charts are relevant for the forecast period.  To provide some perspective, at the 
bottom of the exhibit, the distributions of the actual history of the four series are 
shown for three time periods.  A few points jump out.  First, the intervals for 
samples that extend back to 1930 are considerably wider than those based on 
post –World War II data, illustrating that large tail events can fall well outside our 
current estimates of likely outcomes.  Second, the historical realizations of GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate from 1980 to 2014, the period over which we 
compute the staff forecast errors, look roughly similar to the realizations for the 
entire period following World War II.  Finally, as noted previously , the distribution 
of inflation outcomes has been much more compressed in recent years, and while 
we believe this recent period provides the more appropriate guide to the future, 
we cannot be certain that is so. 
                                                 
2 The beginning date of 1998 for this shorter range was chosen based on the availability of 
data on staff forecast errors for core PCE inflation.  The date range used for inflation is too short 
to provide enough data to construct meaningful 90 percent (green) bands for core or total PCE 
inflation, and therefore no 90 percent bands are shown for the inflation measures.

 Inflation rises more slowly than in the baseline, reflecting both greater resource 
slack and faster productivity growth.4  Core PCE inflation reaches only 1¾ percent at the 
end of 2019.  The federal funds rate remains at its current target range for an additional 
year, lifting off in the third quarter of 2016.  The unemployment rate continues falling 
after 2016, reaching its natural rate in the first half of 2019 and moving below it 
thereafter.  As a result of a combination of higher structural productivity and more-
accommodative monetary policy, real GDP growth picks up, averaging about 3 percent 
over the 2016 –19 period.5 
Greek Exit with Severe Spillovers 
Our baseline assumption is that the Europea
n authorities will keep spillovers from 
developments in Greece reasonably contained, even in the event that debt negotiations 
break down completely and Greece’s crisis deepens.  How ever, it is far from assured that 
the firewalls erected during the past few years —and aggressive actions that the 
authorities would presumably take to limit contagion —will succeed in containing the 
crisis to Greece, especially
 if Greece actually leaves the euro area.  In this scenario, we 
consider a more dire outcome in which Greece abandons the euro and causes the euro 
area to plunge into a deep recession with severe adverse effects on global financial 
conditions and confidence.  
Specifically, our scenario assumes that financial conditions in the euro area 
tighten sharply and that confidence plummets amid rising unemployment and heightened 
disinflationary pressures.  Peripheral sovereign spreads rise 400 basis points above 
baseline while euro-area corporate borrowing spreads rise more than 200 basis points.  As 
a result, euro-area real GDP falls about 6 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 
2016.  The euro-area crisis has substantial adverse spillovers to the United States.  U.S. 
corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 100 basis points, while flight- to-safety 
flows cause the trade-weighted dollar to increase nearly 8 percent and depress 10-year 
                                                 
4 A higher path of productivity holds down marginal costs of production, which are a key 
determinant of inflation in FRB/US and many other macroeconomic models. 
5 In this scenario, policymakers are aware of the faster structural productivity growth.  If 
policymakers instead learned about the faster structural productivity growth only gradually, and thus the 
stance of the federal funds rate was tighter than they would have implemented if fully informed, real GDP 
growth would be ¼ percentage point lower and inflation would be 10 basis points lower, on average, 
through 2019 than in the original scenario.  In this case, the unemployment rate would decline to only  
4½ percent at the end of 2019.

 Treasury yields about 25 basis points.  Credit conditions tighten even more in the EMEs, 
and their currencies depreciate substantially against the dollar.  
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  Given that U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the 
baseline as a result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions, U.S. real GDP 
expands only ½ percent in the second half of 2015 and 1 percent in 2016.  Lower 
domestic demand and lower import price inflation cause U.S. core inflation to run at 
about ¾ percent in 2016, about 1 percentage point below baseline.  The inertial Taylor 
rule prescribes a substantially shallower path for the federal funds rate than in the 
baseline. 
Stronger Dollar 
The broad real dollar has depreciated about 2 percent since the March Tealbook, 
and in our baseline we project that the dollar will resume its appreciation going forward, 
rising around 3 percent before flattening out in early 2016.  However, the dollar may rise 
considerably faster for any number of reasons, including a greater-than-expected reaction 
by investors to the prospective normalization of policy rates in the United States or 
heightened concern about the foreign outlook.  In this scenario, we examine the 
possibility that the broad real dollar appreciates 10 percent relative to the baseline in the 
current quarter.6   
The stronger dollar reduces U.S. real net exports substantially and also pushes 
down inflation as a result of lower import prices and greater resource slack.  
Consequently, even though the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound 
at the same time as in the baseline, U.S. monetary policy accommodation is removed 
more gradually going forward, with the federal funds rate in 2016 about 50 basis points 
below the baseline path.  The more accommodative policy stance provides a boost to U.S. 
domestic demand and helps reduce the adverse effect of the stronger dollar on real 
activity.  Even so, U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of only 2 percent in 2016 —about 
½ percentage point below the baseline —and the unemp loyment rate remains at 
5½ percent.  Lower import prices and greater resource slack cause core PCE inflation to 
run about ½ percentage point below baseline in the second half of this year before 
gradually reverting to the baseline thereafter. 
                                                 
6 This scenario is identical to the one presented in the box “The Effect of the Dollar on U. S. Core 
Import and Consumer Prices” in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for t
he two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

1900 –1954 ,” in National Bureau of Economic Research, The Measurement and Behavior of Unemployment  
(Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press), pp. 213 –41.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. 
HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
