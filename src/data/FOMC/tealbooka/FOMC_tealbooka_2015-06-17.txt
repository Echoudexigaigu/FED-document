Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook   
The economic expansion appears to have downshifted modestly:  After increasing 
2½ percent last year, real GDP looks to be on track to rise at an annual rate of only 
1 percent over the first half  of this year, even assuming—as we do—that some of the 
factors that weighed on spending early in the year have already unwound.  Over the 
second half, we expect real GDP growth will step up to a 2 percent annual rate.  Such a 
pace would exceed our assumption for th e economy’s potential growth rate by 
½ percentage point, but it would also be a fe w tenths slower than we anticipated in the 
April Tealbook, as we have become more guarded in our assessment of the outlook for 
household spending. 
One reason we have not reacted more strongly to the recent slowdown in 
spending is that conditions in the labor market  have continued to improve.  After slowing 
some in the first quarter, payroll employment posted stronger gains in April and May.  
Meanwhile, the employment-to-population ratio  has continued to converge toward our 
estimate of its trend at the same pace that  we anticipated in the April projection. 
Beyond the near term, we expect that r eal GDP growth will be 2½ percent in 2016 
before edging down to 2¼ percent in 2017.  A ll told, the growth that we anticipate is 
sufficient to close the output gap by the end of 2017, much as in the April Tealbook.  The 
unemployment rate is expected  to edge down from 5.5 percen t in the second quarter of 
this year to 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016—in lin e with our estimate of its 
natural rate—and to remain there through the e nd of the medium term.  As in previous 
forecasts, we continue to expect that an  unwinding of the current unusual weakness in 
labor force participation will attenuate the sp eed at which the jobless rate declines going 
forward. 
Our outlook for inflation is little revised.  As in the April Tealbook, we have core 
inflation gradually moving up from 1¼ percent this year to 1¾ percent in 2017 as import 
prices turn back up, resource utilization tightens, and the effe cts of earlier sharp declines 
in energy prices wane.  Over most of the me dium term, we expect total PCE inflation to 
run roughly in line with core inflation.  The recent data provide some evidence that 
compensation is accelerating; smoothing through the quarterly volatility, we continue to 
expect that compensation growth, as measur ed by the employment cost index (ECI), will

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP 
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, 
following the March FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current 
economic projection with the one we presented in the March Tealbook. 
Since the March projection, we have revised down our forecast for real GDP growth this 
year, primaril y reflecting the weaker than expected incoming data on aggregate 
spending. Our forecast for real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 is slightly higher than in 
March, mostly because our projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dollar is 
lower. Altogether, these revisions leave our projection for the GDP gap next year and in 
2017 weaker than in the March forecast. The unemployment rate has declined a little less 
than we expected in March and is projected to average 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter 
of this year. Reflecting both the recent labor data and our lower projected path for 
aggregate output, the unemployment rate is revised up a little at the end of 2017 to 
5.2 percent, equal to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate. 
The staff’s projection for headline PCE inflation has been revised up somewhat in the first 
half of this year, mostly reflecting recent higher than expected readings for consumer 
energy prices, and projected core PCE inflation is essentially unchanged. Given our 
assumptions that longer run inflation expectations will remain stable over the medium 
term, the earlier declines in energy prices were transitory, and core import prices will 
start to rise after this year, our forecasts for headline and core inflation in 2016 and 2017 
are little changed. We continue to project that inflation will run somewhat below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective through 2017.

Since the March Tealbook, our assumption for the date of liftoff of the federal funds rate 
from its effective lower bound was changed from the second quarter to the third quarter 
of this year. Reflecting both the later assumed liftoff date and the softer GDP gap in the 
current forecast, the projected path for the federal funds rate is around ½ percentage 
point lower at the end of next year and in 2017 than in March. 
Because FOMC participants are providing additional information about their expectations 
of the economic conditions that will exist at the time they anticipate it will first become 
appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, we include the table 
below providing quarterly information from the staff projection. In the third quarter of 
this year—the quarter when our baseline projection assumes liftoff of the federal funds 
rate will occur—we forecast the unemployment rate to average 5.4 percent and the 
trailing four quarter chang e in real GDP to be 1.5 percent. We project the trailing four
quarter change in core PCE inflation to be 1.2 percent, and the four quarter change in 
headline PCE prices to be only 0.2 percent because of earlier decreases in energy prices. 
(We do not anticipate that these energy price declines will fall out of the four quarter 
change in headline inflation until early next year.) Of course, even the preliminary 
versions of these readings on economic performance will not become available until after 
the close of the quarter in question.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff ’s projection for re al GDP growth is, on balance, a little lower than the 
most recent Blue Chip Consensus outlook and the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF) median projection (note that the latter survey dates from 
mid- May ).  The staff’s forecast of the unemployment rate is a little higher than 
those of the outside forecast ers; the staff’s inflation projection is a bit lower.

move up from last year’s pace of 2¼ percent to  2¾ percent this year and 3 percent next 
year. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We continue to assume that the fede ral funds rate will lift off from its 
effective lower bound after the Septembe r meeting.  As in our previous 
projections, the post-liftoff tr ajectory of the federal funds rate is assumed to be 
governed by an inertial version of th e Taylor (1999) policy rule.  The 
projected path of the federal funds rate  is a touch lower than in the April 
Tealbook—mainly because the output gap is slightly weaker in this forecast— 
and reaches an average of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Other Interest Rates 
 Our forecast continues to call for th e 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
significantly.  The projected increase in the Treasury yield reflects the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates, as well as an increase in term premiums that is 
partly attributable to the waning of th e effects of the FOMC’s balance sheet 
policies.  Compared with the April T ealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield is a 
little higher over the next couple of quar ters due to the recent increases in 
market rates, but it is a touch lower thereafter.   
 Our forecasts for corporate bond yields and mortgage rates in the medium term have been revised essentially in lin e with the changes to the path for the 
Treasury yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are projected to rise 4½ percent per year over the forecast period, a somewhat slower pace than in the April Tealbook.  We continue to 
expect a notable decline in the equity risk premium; however, at the end of 
2017 the level of the premium is somewhat higher than what we had assumed in April, which better aligns it with historical norms. 
 Incoming data on house prices for the firs t quarter led us to boost our forecast 
for house price appreciation in 2015 to 5 percent, compared with 3¾ percent

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

in the April Tealbook.  We continue to e xpect house prices to decelerate to an 
average pace of 3 percent per year in 2016 and 2017. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.  
We continue to anticipate that, afte r having been a small drag on real GDP 
growth in 2014, fiscal policy actions at all levels of government will provide a 
small stimulus in 2015 and over the re mainder of the medium term.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign real GDP growth sl owed a little more than expected in the first 
quarter, to a 1½ percent annual rate, a nd—at 2¼ percent—is projected to be a 
bit weaker in the current quarter than in our previous forecast.  For 2015 as a 
whole, projected foreign growth is  down a little from the April Tealbook, 
reflecting the softer-than-expected tone of recent data, the lower path for U.S. 
GDP, and—in the advanced economies—some restraint from recent increases in long-term interest rates.   We continue to expect foreign GDP growth to rise 
to 3 percent by early next year, supp orted by accommodative monetary policy 
abroad, depreciated currencies, and still- low oil prices, and to remain at that 
pace through 2017. 
 The broad nominal dollar is down a touc h relative to the April Tealbook.  We 
project that the dollar will appreciate  2 percent through th e remainder of 2015 
as investors intensify their focus on th e divergence between monetary policies 
in the United States and abroad.  Th ereafter, as foreign monetary policy 
begins to normalize and as tail risks for the euro-area economy diminish, the 
dollar is projected to weaken.  Our for ecast leaves the level of the broad real 
dollar at the end of the medium term slightly lower than in the previous 
Tealbook. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent cr ude oil is up nearly $3 pe r barrel since the time of 
the April Tealbook; however, prices for futures contracts with delivery at the end of 2017 are unchanged, continuing the tr end of flattening futures curves.  
We expect the price of imported o il to move up from $57 per barrel this 
quarter to about $62 per barrel by the end of the forecast period.  Relative to

the April Tealbook, the projec tion is about unchanged th is year and is down 
about $1 per barrel at the end of 2017. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As we discuss in the box “Special Fact ors Contributing to Weakness in GDP in 
the First Quarter,” we believe that a portion of the weakness in first-quarter aggregate 
demand reflects a variety of identifiable tem porary factors whose effects will be largely 
reversed in coming quarters.1  But early indications are that second-quarter real GDP will 
only rise enough to leave average growth over the first ha lf of this year in the 
neighborhood of 1 percent.  As in previous Tealbooks, we attribute much of the first-half 
slowdown in GDP to the stronger dollar and the drag on drilling and mining investment 
from sharply lower oil prices.  Relative to the April Tealbook, the slightly more subdued 
GDP picture for the first half is more th an accounted for by weaker-than-anticipated 
indicators of household spending and net exports.2 
We continue to expect, however, that the economy will expand at a moderate pace 
over the projection period.  In particular, despite the generally disappointing news on 
consumer spending, we still view the f undamentals underpinning household demand as 
sufficient to support an acceleration in real  PCE going forward.  Likewise, we expect 
drilling and mining investment to bottom out re latively soon as the effects of the declines 
in oil prices recede.  In total, we expect real GDP growth to average about 2 percent in 
the second half of this year, ¼ percenta ge point lower than our April projection. 
 As noted, the recent data on real PCE ha ve been weaker than we expected 
overall despite a surge in light motor ve hicle sales in May.  As a result, we 
have lowered our projection for second-quarter real PCE growth 
1½ percentage points relative to our previous forecast, to 2¾ percent.3 
Moreover, the recent disappointment ex tends a tendency during each of the 
past several years for consumer spendi ng to come in on the low side of our 
expectations.  Hence, while we still anticipate a near-term acceleration in real 
1 Note that real gross domestic income (GDI), which aims to measure the same economic concept 
as real GDP, is reported to have increased at a 1½ percent annual rate in the first quarter.  
2 The table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q2 Real GDP Growth” prov ides forecasts 
of second-quarter output growth from other near-term forecasting approaches used within the System. 
3 The Quarterly Services Survey for the first quar ter of 2015, released as the Tealbook projection 
was closing, was not incorporated in our estimate of first-quarter real PCE growth.  In addition, the May 
retail sales report is scheduled to be released on June 11, 2015, the day after the Tealbook is published.

Special Factors Contributing to Weakness in GDP in the First Quarter 
A number of transitory factors appear to have restrained aggregate spending in the first quarter, 
and the unwinding of their effects is expected to provide a boost to spending this quarter. The 
staff’s estimates of the effects of these factors on real GDP are shown in the table below. While 
we discuss point estimates here, there is, of course, considerable uncertainty around the 
magnitude of these estimates, and other analysts—including from within the Federal Reserve 
System—have judged some of these effects to be larger than the staff’s estimates. 
Residual seasonality is estimated to have subtracted 0.8 percentage point from the change in real 
GDP last quarter (line 2). Residual seasonality appears evident in real spending for exports, state 
and local government construction, and private sector nonresidential construction, along with 
the change in inventory investment. The staff assumes that much of the first quarter residual 
seasonality will be unwound in the second quarter, with the rest showing up in the second half. 
Unusually severe winter weather is estimated to have subtracted 0.2 percentage point from the 
change in real GDP in the first quarter, as PCE and construction spending were held down 
temporarily (line 3). The bounceback in spending from this weather effect is assumed to raise 
second quarter real GDP growth by a similar amount. 
Numerous reports suggested that the West Coast port labor dispute restrained international 
trade and disrupted some manufacturing supply chains. The staff estimates that the port labor 
dispute shaved 0.2 percentage point off the change in real GDP in the first quarter and assumes 
that a comparable amount will be added to second quarter real GDP growth as activity returns to 
normal (line 4). 
Finally, the large declines in retail gasoline prices early this year likely caused some measurement 
error in the BEA’s translation to real PCE of nominal retail sales by some bigbox stores that also 
sell gasoline (line 5). The staff estimates that this measurement error reduced real GDP growth 
0.2 percentage point in the first quarter but that it is unlikely to reverse in the near term, as 
gasoline prices are not projected to return to their earlier levels. 
In total, these identifiable transitory factors are judged to have reduced the change in real GDP 
1.4 percentage points last quarter (line 6). The corresponding bounceback in spending as these 
factors disappate is projected to boost real GDP growth 1 percentage point this quarter.

consumer spending supported by robust gains in real disposable income, 
previous increases in household wealt h, and upbeat consumer sentiment, we 
have taken our forecast for second-half real PCE growth down about 
¾ percentage point relative to April, to an average annual rate of 3½ percent. 
 The decline in oil prices over the past  year has resulted in a sharp drop in 
drilling and mining investment that subt racted ½ percentage point from first-
quarter real GDP growth a nd looks set to take a similar amount off of growth 
in the current quarter.  We expect the declines in drilling and mining 
investment to slow markedly over the s econd half of the year, and, indeed, we 
think we see early signs of such a bo ttoming out in the weekly data on rig 
counts.  
 Housing starts rebounded strongly in Apr il from the weak readings seen in 
February and March, while permits edged up.  We interpret the April strength 
in starts as largely refl ecting payback from the earlier weakness and so have 
left our forecast for starts essentially unrevised going forward.  This contour 
of starts leaves our estimate for the le vel of residential investment somewhat 
higher in the current quarter relative to  our previous forecast but not much 
different at the end of 2015. 
 We now estimate that net exports subtra cted nearly 2 percentage points from 
real GDP growth in the firs t quarter, a considerably larger drag than we had 
projected in the April Tealbook.  The revi sion is almost entirely due to import 
data for March coming in much stronge r than we had anticipated, as inbound 
shipments snapped back following the reso lution of the labor disputes at West 
Coast ports.  For the first quarter as a w hole, the port disputes seem to have 
had little net effect on imports, which rose at an above-average 6¾ percent 
pace.  In contrast, exports declined sharply in the first quarter; we attribute a 
sizable portion of this weakness to the port disruptions and to residual 
seasonality in the export data.  We expect  some payback in the growth rate of 
exports in the current quar ter—an expectation that is supported by the April 
trade data—and now have the external sector making a less negative second-
quarter contribution to real GDP gr owth than in the April Tealbook.  
Reflecting the continued drag from past  dollar appreciations , net exports are 
expected to subtract ¾ pe rcentage point from real GDP growth in the second 
half of 2015, nearly unchanged from the April Tealbook.

 Total industrial production continued to decline through April, and the 
available indicators, including manufact uring production-worker hours, point 
to a further decline in May.  As with  first-quarter GDP, we think that a 
combination of transitory factors (suc h as supply-chain disruptions arising 
from the labor disputes at West Coast ports) and longer-lived influences (such 
as the stronger dollar) have wei ghed on manufacturing output; similarly, 
production at both factories and mines has been affected by the sharp declines 
in drilling activity noted pr eviously.  We expect ma nufacturing production to 
rise at a subdued pace over the remai nder of the near term, as the stronger 
dollar and the upstream effects of lower oil and gas prices continue to damp 
demand for factory output.  The mixe d tenor of the national and regional 
manufacturing surveys seems consis tent with such an outcome.   
With conditioning factors that are broadly unrevised relative to April, projected 
real GDP growth over the medium term is quite  close to our previous forecast:  In 2016, 
we expect real GDP to rise 2½ percent before edging down to a 2¼ percent pace in 2017.  
Actual GDP growth is expected to outpace our estimate of potential growth in coming years, resulting in a stead y narrowing of the output gap. 
 We expect above-trend growth in aggregate demand to be led by gains in consumer spending.  As labor market conditions continue to improve, real 
personal income should rise faster than potential output; in addition, over much of the medium term, high wealth-to-income ratios and increasing confidence about the durability of the expansion should lead spending growth 
to modestly exceed income growth.  (F or a discussion of risks stemming from 
a consumer-led expansion, see the bo x “Alternative View:  The Risk of 
Significant Macroeconomic Imbala nces over the Medium Term.”) 
 In broad terms, the relatively flat contour of real GDP growth over the 
medium term reflects the interplay of two forces.  First, the ongoing 
normalization of monetary policy is expected to weigh more heavily on 
aggregate demand growth going forward.  Ho wever, as the effects of previous 
increases in the exchange value of  the dollar wane—a nd with the dollar 
expected to begin depreciating later in  the forecast period—we anticipate that

Alternative View: The Risk of Significant Macroeconomic 
Imbalances over the Medium Term 
The U.S. economy is approaching a state in which inflation and unemployment are about as 
close to the FOMC’s current objectives as has been true at virtually any point over the past half-
century.  Despite these conditions, the risk of growing macroeconomic imbalances in the U.S. 
and global economy is substantial.  In particular, the relatively stronger growth outlook and 
higher interest rates in the United States may spur domestic asset prices and contribute to a 
global recovery that is overly reliant on U.S. consumption.  Such developments would imply low 
national saving and a large U.S. current account deficit despite inflation and unemployment 
running reasonably close to their objectives over the next couple of years .  A state of affairs in 
which the global economy is overly reliant on U.S. household demand would echo aspects of 
the economic conditions in the mid-2000s, when the combination of low U.S. savings and large 
current account imbalances contributed to the financial excesses that precipitated the crisis. 
Although overreliance on U.S. household demand may be a concern even along t he path 
envisioned in the staff projection, a starker illustration of the risks can be seen by considering an 
alternative pro jection. In this alternative , strong demand for U.S. assets, in part due to low 
global interest rates, leads the low level of term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities to persist 
for several more years.  Low interest rates contribute to more rapid growth in equity and house 
prices than in the staff projection. Moreover, the gains in U.S. asset prices and the higher level 
of U.S. interest rates (relative to those in Europe and Japan) draw capital to the United S tates 
and cause the dollar to appreciate roughly 20 percent from its level early this year, bringing its 
value back to the level of the early 2000s .1 
While the higher level of equity and house prices and lower term premiums boost aggregate 
demand, the strong dollar offsets this boost, and the unemployment rate remains close to its 
natural rate ov er the next couple of years.  However, core inflation remains stuck near 
1¼ percent over this period, reflecting the effects of dollar appreciation, and short-term interest 
rates are lower than in the staff projection , with the federal funds rate remaining below 
1 percent until early 2017 (according to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule) . 
Domestic and global imbalances are substantial in this alternative view .  The higher level of 
household wealth contributes to a more rapid increase in personal consumption expenditures 
than expected in the staff outlook, and the personal saving rate falls to 2½ percent later this 
decade (figure 1). Global imbalances reemerge on a scale similar to that seen in the mid-2000s , 
with the U.S. current account deficit falling to 5½ percent of nominal GDP (figure 2). 
Note:  This alternative view was prepared by Michael Kiley. 
1 Although th is alternative view uses an FRB/US model simulation to illustrate the effects of shocks to term 
premiums, house prices, and the dollar, the key elements of this alternative view are not tied to the FRB/US 
model’s structure or the precise quantitative results from such a simulation.

These large domestic and international imbalances could create several challenges for the U.S. 
and global economy.  First, the stretched position of U.S. households leads them, over time, to 
attempt to rebuild their savings , placing a drag on both consumption and investment and hence 
upward pressure on unemployment by 2017 .  A weak rate of investment and elevated 
borrowing from abroad lower U.S. potential output and national income, placing a persistent 
drag on U.S. living standards.  And the limited savings buffer of U.S. households and the 
elevated level of U.S. asset prices imply some risk of a painful retrenchment , as households may 
have limited ability to weather adverse shocks and elevated domestic asset prices could 
collapse when unexpected adverse developments materialize. 
Monetary policy is not well suited to address these challenges : A more accommodative 
monetary policy stance would only marginally boost inflation (given the flat Phillips curve) and 
would likely further depress household saving, borrowing from future aggregate demand and 
leaving households even more vulnerable to adverse shocks .  In principle, fiscal policy 
adjustments that boost domestic saving while supporting domestic productive investment 
would alleviate these imbalances. More direct tools to alleviate g lobal imbalances would 
consist of coordinated international adjustments in fiscal and monetary policy (and related 
structural reforms), including increases in spending in countries with current account surpluses. 
While the unsustainable pace of U.S. consumption in the scenario above is importantly due to 
an alternative perspective on the possible effect of low global interest rates on U.S. asset prices 
over the next couple of years, these forces are only one set that could lead to similar 
macroeconomic imbalances.  For example, some staff models project that the household saving 
rate will decline more rapidly than in the staff projection, or the appreciation of the dollar that 
has already occurred may lead to a wider U.S. current account deficit than anticipated. 
Alternatively, the global economy would be even more reliant on U.S. household demand if 
growth among foreign economies were to fall substantially short of expectations, which could 
also contribute to a stronger dollar and lower U.S. interest rates.

the contribution of net exports to overall output growth will become 
noticeably less negative by the end of the projection period.4 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
Taken together, the two employment reports that we have received since the April 
Tealbook indicate that conditions in the labo r market have improved in recent months— 
albeit at a slower pace than last year—and were close to our expect ations in the April 
forecast.  Thus, we have made only small revisions to our near-term outlook for the labor 
market.  
 Payroll employment growth averaged 250,000 per month in April and May, 
about 30,000 more than our previous projection.   
 The unemployment rate was 5.5 percent in May, 0.1 percentage point higher 
than expected.  However, the labor force participation rate also came in 0.1 percentage point higher than expected last month, leaving the 
employment-to-population ratio in lin e with our previous forecast. 
 For the first five months of this y ear, payroll gains have averaged 217,000 per 
month, down from 260,000 per month in 2014;  in addition, the pace of decline 
in the unemployment rate has slowed this year.  The staff’s labor market 
conditions index also indicates that the pace of improvement in labor market conditions has slowed relative to 2014. 
 We expect payroll employment to rise  215,000 in June and to increase at a 
similar average monthly pace over the second half of this year—about the 
same as in the April Tealbook. 
 We expect the unemployment rate to aver age 5.5 percent in the current quarter 
(0.1 percentage point above our April fo recast) before declining to 5.3 percent 
in the fourth quarter (unrevised relative to April). 
4 As noted, the expected depreciation in the do llar—which occurs even as U.S. monetary policy 
continues to tighten—reflects both a reversal of earlie r safe-haven flows and the eventual move to a less 
accommodative policy stance on the part  of foreign monetary authorities.

The medium-term outlook for the labor market is also little changed relative to 
our previous forecast, consistent with the relatively small revisions we have made to the 
projected path of output. 
 We expect monthly payroll gains to slow to 175,000 in 2016 and 140,000 in 
2017 as productivity moves back up toward its trend. 
 The unemployment rate is projected to  edge down from 5.3 percent in the 
fourth quarter of this year to 5.2 percent by the end of 2016 a nd then to remain 
at that level throughout 2017. 
 As in previous Tealbooks, we think that the unemployment rate gap currently 
understates the amount of slack remaining in the labor market because the labor force participation rate is unus ually low and the level of involuntary 
part-time employment is unusually hi gh.  As the economy improves further, 
we expect additional individuals to be drawn into the labor market and the rate of involuntary part-time employment to move down.  As a result, the decline 
in the unemployment rate is slower than it would otherwise be, yielding a 
projected path for the unemployment rate  that is basically flat over much of 
the medium term despite output continui ng to rise moderately faster than 
potential. 
 As shown in the exhibit “Alternative M easures of Slack,” output gaps from 
the Philadelphia Fed’s PRISM model a nd—to a lesser degree—the New York 
Fed’s DSGE model currently suggest  more slack than the staff’s 
unemployment rate gap.  The Nationa l Federation of Independent Business 
measure of jobs that are hard to fill  and the JOLTS job openings rate suggest 
somewhat tighter labor market conditions.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
After declining at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter, headline PCE 
prices are expected to rise 2 percent in the second quarter.  The turnaround is  attributable 
to a large swing in energy prices and a pickup in core PCE inflation from ¾ percent in the

first quarter to 1½ percent in the second.  Du ring the second half of the year, both total 
and core PCE inflation are expected to step down slightly from the second quarter, 
reflecting a deceleration in energy prices a nd a continuation of th e pattern in which 
residual seasonality in  core prices tends to boost infl ation in the second quarter and 
reduce it in the second half. 
 Our forecast for second-quarter total PCE inflation is ½ percentage point 
higher than our April projection.  The re vision is largely at tributable to an 
upward surprise to gasoline prices that we expect to be unwound in coming quarters as margins return to a more normal level. 
 Consumer food prices have come in a li ttle lower than expected (to date, we 
have seen little evidence that drought c onditions in California are materially 
affecting retail food prices).  We exp ect consumer food prices to accelerate 
over the near term to a pace that is roughly in line with core PCE inflation. 
 The most recent readings on core PCE inflation have come in a little below our April Tealbook projection:  The nonmarket  component of the index was 
distinctly weaker than we had expected, with this surprise only partly offset 
by a stronger reading on market-based  core PCE prices.  As usual, we have 
taken little signal from the miss on nonmarket inflation, which tends to be 
quite erratic.  For market-based infl ation, the miss was concentrated in 
categories that we believe are particular ly affected by residual seasonality.  In 
response, we slightly revised up our es timate of the contribution that residual 
seasonality will make to market-based  inflation over the next couple of 
months, and made a corresponding downward revision to our inflation 
projection later in the ye ar.  In total, our forecast for overall core PCE 
inflation in the second quarter and over  the remainder of the year averages 
1½ percent at an annual rate, unchanged relativ e to April. 
We continue to project that core PCE price inflation will rise from 1¼ percent this 
year to 1¾ percent in 2017, as import prices tu rn back up, the effects on core inflation of 
previous large declines in energy prices diss ipate, and resource uti lization tightens further 
in an environment of well-anchored infla tion expectations.  With consumer food and 
energy prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices after this year, we expect 
total PCE inflation to run at about the same pace as core inflation throughout most of the 
medium term.

 Core import prices are expected to de cline at an average annual rate of 
4 percent in the first half of this year , reflecting the apprec iation of the dollar 
during the past year, net declines in  nonfuel commodity prices, and low 
foreign inflation.  With our projection th at the dollar will peak early next year 
and that foreign CPI inflation will pi ck up, core import price inflation is 
expected to turn positive by the star t of 2016 and to move up to 1½ percent 
in 2017. 
 Readings on longer-term in flation expectations have remained stable.  The 
final May estimate of expected inflati on over the next 5 to 10 years from the 
Michigan survey was 2.8 percent, clos e to the middle of the range within 
which this measure has fluctuated in recent years.  In the second quarter, 
expected PCE price inflation over the next 10 years from the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters remained essent ially unchanged at 2 percent for the 
10th quarter in a row.  Finally, TIPS-ba sed measures of longer-term inflation 
compensation are little changed, on ba lance, since the April Tealbook, though 
they remain below levels that  prevailed until  last summer. 
The recent data provide some evidence th at labor compensation is accelerating, as 
we have expected for some time.   
 The employment cost index for private indu stry workers rose at an annual rate 
of 3 percent over the first quarter; over the past 12 months, the ECI increased 
2¾ percent, noticeably above the 2 per cent average pace seen over the past 
few years.  Business-sector hourly compensation from the Productivity and 
Costs release rose at an annual rate of  3 percent in the first quarter; in 
addition, the fourth-quarter growth rate  was revised up 1½ percentage points, 
to 3 percent. 
 As labor markets tighten further ove r the forecast period, we expect an 
additional slight acceleration in hou rly compensation, with the 12-month 
change in the ECI reaching 3 percent in 2016.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Tayl or (1999) rule.  This polic y rule assumes a long-run 
equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3½ percent. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities will continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The 
process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed by 2021. 
 The natural rate of unemployment is 5.2 percent, and potenti al GDP rises at a 
rate of about 1.8 percent per ye ar, on average, from 2018 to 2020.  
 As monetary accommodation continues to be withdrawn, real GDP growth 
eases to 1.9 percent in 2018.  Thereafter , real GDP rises at a pace just below 
the growth rate of potential output.  The unemployment rate declines slightly 
below 5.2 percent in 2018 and 2019 before edging up to its natural rate.   
 PCE price inflation remains below the long-run objective of the Committee at 
the end of 2017 but gradually moves up to 2 percent by 2019.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign real GDP growth slowed by almost 1 percentage point in the first quarter 
to 1½ percent, a rate about ¼ percentage point lower than previously estimated.  A 
0.6 percent contraction in the Canadian economy, where investment has been hard-hit by 
earlier declines in oil prices, accounted for much of both the slowdown and the 
downward revision, although there was a significant step-down in growth in several of the emerging market economies (EMEs) as well. Recent indicators of foreign economic 
activity, including data on PMIs and trade, suggest that total foreign growth is picking up in the second quarter, although not quite as much as we had anticipated, to a rate of 
2¼ percent. 
Beyond the current quarter, we expect foreign GDP growth to increase to 
3 percent by early next year as the Canadian economy shakes off the effect of the lower 
oil prices and the euro area continues on its moderate recovery path, supported by 
expansionary monetary policy.  W e also expect some acceleration in activity in EMEs, 
supported by policy stimulus in China and stronger demand in the advanced economies.  Many foreign economie s should also benefit from depreciated currencies.  This 
projection has been revised down slightly since April, reflecting the softer-than-expected 
tone of recent data, the lower path for U.S. GDP, and some restraint from recent increases 
in long-term interest rates in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). 
Despite indications that the pace of foreign activity is picking up, there is still a 
significant risk that growth will not recover as projected, which might also prompt the 
dollar to appreciate more than we are assuming.  We explore the effects of such a 
scenario on the U.S. economy in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  The situation in 
Greece continues to represent another important risk to our outlook.  Our baseline forecast assumes that negotiations between Greece and its creditors will continue to be contentious, and it encompasses the possibility that Greece might be forced to impose 
capital controls and miss some debt payments.  However, it assumes that spillovers to other peripheral countries will remain contained.  In the alternative scenario “Greek Exit 
with Severe Spillovers, ” we examine the possibility that the situation in Greece 
deteriorates much more than in the baseline, resulting in a disruptive Greek exit from the 
euro area that roils global financial markets and pushes Europe back into recession.

Equilibrium Interest Rates in the Advanced Foreign Economies 
The equilibrium interest rate the real interest rate consistent with output at potential and 
inflation at its target plays a central role in assessing the stance of monetary policy, with policy 
expansionary (contractionary) if the short-term real interest rate lies below (above) this 
benchmark.  Estimates of the equilibrium interest rate, however, can vary greatly over time as 
both cyclical and structural developments affect its level, with implications for the path of the 
policy rate that would be consistent with achieving the objectives of monetary policy .  Here we 
discuss estimates of equilibrium interest rates in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) based 
on two alternative approaches. 
Our first empirical framework is an estimated dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) 
model.  This model consists of a Phillips curve equation (which relates inflation to output gaps), 
an IS equation (which relat es output gaps to the deviation in the real policy interest rate from the 
equilibrium interest rate), and a Taylor rule (which describes monetary policy). The estimation 
technique assumes t hat output growth, inflation, and the policy rate all fluctuate around stable 
averages, thus helping to identify cyclical fluctuations in potential output and the equilibrium 
interest rate fro m those data.1 
Figure 1 on the following page shows the evolution of the AFE aggregate equilibrium interest rate 
estimated using this approach.  According to our DSGE model, the aggregate AFE equilibrium 
interest rate declined by an outsized and unprecedented amount during the global financial crisis 
and the European debt crisis ; the rate currently stands about 4 percentage points below its 
steady-state value of nearly 2 percent .  Moreover, the effects of the recession are deemed to be 
very persistent: Absent additional shocks, the AFE aggregate equilibrium interest rate in 2020 is 
still projected to be more than ½ percentage point below its nearly 2 percent steady-state value. 
Thus, this evidence suggests t hat the slow recovery in AFE aggregate demand should lead to only 
a very gradual normalization of AFE policy rates toward pre-crisis average levels. 
As previously noted, the DSGE-based approach imposes a constant steady-state value on the 
equilibrium interest rate and abstracts from trend changes in its path.  However, Laubach and 
Williams (2003) provide econometric evidence indicating that the long-run value of the 
equilibrium interest rate in the United States has drifted down considerably over the past several 
decades.2 Their approach is somewhat different, as starting from an empirical framework that 
includes an IS equation and a Phillips curve equation they focus on estimating the link between 
slow-moving changes in the equilibrium interest rate and t he trend growth of output. 
Figure 2 pre sents estimates of this trend concept of the equilibrium interest rate that are based 
on applying a methodology very similar to that in Laubach and Williams (2003) to data from the

AFE economies.3 According to this approach, the AFE equilibrium interest rate (shown by the red 
line) has fallen steadily over the past 15 years and is currently negative .  A number of possible 
structural factors have been put forward to account for this decline in the long-run value of the 
equilibrium interest rate. For example, potential output growth appears to have stepped down, 
part ly reflecting demographic trends and the effects of the global financial crisis on financial 
intermediation and productivity.  In addition, from an open-economy perspective, the sizable 
upward shift in global savings in the early to mid-2000s may have contributed to lower world 
interest rates. 
The estimates based on the Laubach and Williams (2003) methodology suggest that, absent 
developments that would push the long-run equilibrium rate back up , aggregate demand and the 
associated neutral policy rates in the AFEs are likely t o be much lower than in the early 2000s and 
will not return to pre-crisis levels, as in the first appr oach. An implication is that, going forward, 
even shallow recessions may take policy rates in the AFEs to the zero lower bound constraint. 
All told , both cyclical and trend estimates suggest that equilibrium interest rates in  the AFEs are 
currently low and will likely remain so for many years. However , the degree to which the decline 
is due to cyclical versus s tructural factors in other words, how low the equilibrium rate will be in 
the long run remains difficult to disentangle with confidence .  Moreover , in either approach, 
confidence intervals ar ound estimates of the equilibrium interest rate tend to be very large .  
Finally, some of the structural factors that may have contributed to lower long-run equilibrium 
interest rates over the past d ecade may still unwind.  For instance, global savings could 
conceivably fall going forward, as Asian economies rebalance toward domestic demand 
somewhat, thus putting upward pressure on global interest rates. Choosing an appropriate path 
of policy rates over time in AFEs will thus require important judgments related to these 
uncertainties. 
3 Our m ethodology differs from Laubach a nd Williams (2003) in two re spects.  First, we use staff estimates of 
potential output for the AFEs rather th an treat this variable as unobserved. Second, we construct real policy rates 
using survey-based measures of inflation expectations rather th an construct inflation expectations using an 
autoregressive process on estimated inflation data, as these authors do. When w e apply our methodology to U.S. 
data, however, we obtain e stimates very similar to th e original article, suggesting that these changes have a 
modest effect on the results.

Quarterly foreign inflation appears to have bottomed out along with oil prices in 
the first quarter, and it is expected to turn positive in all of the major AFEs in the current 
quarter.  Inflation is projected to reach central bank targets of 2 percent in Canada and the United Kingdom by 2017, and to pick up but remain below the 2 percent objective in both the euro area and Japan at the end of the forecast period.  Inflation rates in EMEs 
also appear to be increasing and are expected to average about 3 percent over the forecast 
period. 
We continue to expect monetary policy to remain quite accommodative in most 
foreign economies.  We assume that both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan will keep rates constant and continue to implement their plans for further 
quantitative easing over much of the forecast period. We anticipate that the Bank of 
England (BOE) will begin to increase its policy rate in early 2016 and that the Bank of 
Canada (BOC) will do so a quarter later.  Nonetheless, even for the BOE and the BOC, 
we expect only modest increases in policy rates over the forecast period, consistent with 
the view that equilibrium interest rates in the AFEs will remain low for many years (see 
the box “Equilibrium Interest Rates in the Advanced Foreign Economies”). Central 
banks of some major EMEs, including China and India, have loosened monetary policy since the most recent FOMC meeting. A prominent exception is Braz il, where policy 
rates have been tightened further to contain inflation. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
 Euro area. Real GDP grew 1.5 pe rcent in the first quarter as domestic 
demand strengthened, and recent indicators, including PMIs and retail sales, are consistent with our estimate of an expansion at about the same pace in the 
current quarter.  We expect GDP growth to rise to 2 percent in 2016 and 
2¼ pe rcent in 2017.  This forecast is a touch weaker than our April Tealbook 
projection, reflecting the tightening of financial conditions in recent weeks: As noted in the Financial Developments section, government bond yields in the euro area have risen substantially, and the euro has appreciated about 
4 percent in nominal effective terms. 
Twelve-month inflation rose further to 0.3 percent in May, the first positive reading since last November.  We expect quarterly inflation to jump to 2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from negative 1½ percent in 
the first quarter, with energy prices contributing positively to total inflation for

the first time since mid-2013.  Inflation should settle around 1½ percent by the 
end of the year and then gradually pick up to 1¾ percent over the remainder of 
the forecast period as the output gap narrows.  We continue to expect ECB 
asset purc hases to total about €1.2 trillion by September 2016 and the ECB’s 
main policy rate to stay near zero through the end of 2017. 
Although Greece averted default on its obligations to the IMF in early May, 
its situation remains precarious.  Greece and its creditors continue to disagree 
over the terms of official financial assistance, even as two deadlines for a deal 
approach.  First, after postponing several debt repayments to the IMF due earlier in the month, the Greek government faces a June 30 deadline to repay 
the IMF about €1.6 billion.  Second, the Greek government’s eligibility to 
receive financial assistance from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) is currently set to expire at the end of the month.  
Greece and its creditors are working on a deal to extend Greece’s EFSF 
program and to release some of its funds. There is some chance these talks 
will fail, in which case the Greek government may well miss a debt 
repayment, the ECB could curtail liquidity support to Greek banks, and 
Greece might have to impose capital controls.  Even in this instance, however, our baseline forecast assumes that the associated financial and political 
tensions will ultimately motivate Greece and its creditors to put the existing 
financial assistance program back on track and, subsequently, to cover 
Greece’s medium -term financing needs with a new multiyear program. In 
addition, our baseline forecast assumes that financial spillovers to the rest of the euro area are contained.  However, we cannot rule out the possibility that 
the Greek situation will spiral out of control, resulting in a Greek exit from the euro area and broader turmoil in global financial markets.  
 Japan. Real GDP growth picked up to 3.9 percent in the first quarter, almost 
3 percentage points above our estimate in the April Tealbook.  However, the 
surprise was partly due to a substantial contribution from inventory 
investment.  Thus, we expect GDP growth to slow to a still above-trend pace of 1½ percent in the current quarter and to remain at about that rate through 
2016 before a second hike to the consumption tax rate stalls the expansion in 
2017.  Consumer prices edged down further in the first quarter, reflecting a 
drop in energy prices and a slowdown in core price increases.  With oil prices

turning up, inflation should increase to ½ percent in the second quarter.  
Thereafter, as the output gap narrows and inflation expectations rise, we see 
inflation (excluding the direct effect of the consumption tax hike) rising to 
almost 1½ percent by the end of 2017. 
 Canada. Real GDP declined 0.6 percent in the first quarter, as earlier declines 
in oil prices took a toll on investment in the energy industry.  The first-quarter 
growth rate was considerably weaker than expected, reflecting surprisingly soft private consumption that was due, in part, to the severe winter weather. 
Recent data point to a modest rebound in economic activity starting in the 
second quarter; the manufacturing PMI picked up in May, although it 
remained slightly contractionary.  W e now expect growth to bounce back to 
nearly 1½ pe rcent in the second quarter and to increase further to about 
2½ percent by the end of the year, supported by the BOC ’s accommodative 
monetary policy, a weak Canadian dollar, and firming U.S. grow th.  This 
projection has been revised down a little for 2015, as we have carried forward 
some of the recent weakness in consumption.  With oil prices having turned 
around and projected to move up a little further, we see inflation bouncing 
back to 1¾ percent in the second quarter and reaching the BOC’s 2 percent 
target by 2017.  
 United Kingdom. Real GDP growth slowed to a 1.2 percent pace in the first 
quarter, nearly 1 percentage point below the April Tealbook projection.  
Domestic demand growth picked up, but exports declined after surging in the 
fourth quarter, and import growth remained high.  With readings on economic 
sentiment remaining solid and retail sales growth increasing, we expect GDP 
growth to bounce back to a 2½ percent pace in the second quarter and to 
maintain that pace through 2016.  After falling at a 1.6 percent rate in the first quarter, consumer prices are estimated to have risen nearly 1 percent in the second quarter, reflecting stabilizing energy prices.  With labor market slack 
projected to dissipate slowly and inflation projected to rise only gradually to 
the BOE’s 2 percent target, we continue to expect the BOE to wait until the 
first quarter of 2016 before raising its policy rate.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
 China.  Chinese real GDP growth is estimated to have picke d up from just 
5.1 pe rcent in the first quarter to a still-subdued 6 percent in the second.  The 
estimate for the second quarter reflects mild improvement across a range of 
indicators.  Industrial production and exports strengthened in April following 
a weak first quarter, and exports rose further in May.  The pace of house price declines has lessened while sales have increased recently, suggesting that the 
drag on activity from the property sector is diminishing.  Meanwhile, retail 
sales continued to rise at a healthy rate.  W e expect GDP growth to increase to 
a 7¼ pe rcent pace in the second half of the year, supported by recent and 
further monetary easing as authorities seek to keep growth near their 7 percent 
target for this year.  Financial conditions have become more accommodative 
in recent weeks, as the interbank rate has declined 2 percentage points 
following the 100 basis point cut in banks’ reserve requirement ratios in April.  Economic activity should also be supported beyond the current quarter by a 
strengthening of exports as demand in China’s trad ing partners improves and 
as the drag from last year’s appreciation of the real trade-weighted renminbi 
lessens.  Over the medium term, we continue to see growth moderating to 
6½ pe rcent, in line with our estimate of declining potential growth.  
We expect consumer price inflation to come in at an annual rate of 1½ percent 
in the current quarter after having dipped below zero in the first quarter in 
response to falling food and fuel prices.  We expect inflation to rise further to 
2½ pe rcent by the end of the year and to remain around that rate over the rest 
of the forecast period. 
 Other Emerging Asia.  First-quarter growth was surprisingly weak in several 
emerging Asian economies, due primarily to plummeting exports.  The 
disappointing first-quarter outcomes, along with the mixed tone of more recent indicators, including exports and PMIs, prompted us to lower our 
estimate for GDP growth in the current quarter by ½ percentage point to 
3¾ pe rcent, up only slightly from the first-quarter rate.  Nevertheless, we 
continue to expect growth in the region to move up to 4¼ percent in the 
second half of the year, in response to improved activity in China and in the 
advanced economies, and to remain at roughly that rate, supported by low oil prices and accommodative monetary policies.  We judge that, for now, the

outbreak of MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ) in Korea will have 
little effect on the region ’s growth, although it poses downside risks.  Inflation 
in the region, which was slightly negative in t he first quarter as a result of 
falling energy prices, is expected to turn positive this quarter and move up to 
3¼ pe rcent by 2016. 
 Latin America.  Mexican real GDP growth dropped to 1.6 percent in the first 
quarter, a little below our April Tealbook estimate. Demand-side components 
will be released later this month, but monthly data indicate weakness in 
external demand for manufactured goods (in line with the contraction in U.S. 
production) and in fixed investment, particularly residential housing.  In 
addition, oil production has continued to decline.  A rebound in U.S. auto 
production, along with more-upbeat recent data on exports and PMIs, are 
consistent with our projection of a pickup in GDP growth to 2½ percent in the current quarter, and we expect further improvement to 3¼ percent over the 
forecast period.  Headline inflation is expected to move up to 3¼ percent later 
this year fr om just ¼ percent in the first quarter as the influence of earlier 
declines in energy and administered telecommunication prices fades. 
In Brazil , real GDP contracted at an annual rate of ½ percent in the first 
quarter, a considerably smaller drop than we had expected, as a sharp decline 
in private domestic demand in response to tighter monetary policy and weak 
confidence was partly offset by a surprisingly large jump in exports.   
However, much of the rise in exports was reversed in April and May, and 
other recent indicators, including the manufacturing PMI and industrial 
production, also have been weak.  As a result, we now expect GDP to contract 
3¼ pe rcent in the current quarter.  Despite the weak economy, the substantial 
depreciation of the real and increases in administered prices have kept 
inflation stubbornly high, at an estimated 9¼ percent annual rate in the current 
quarter. To restrain inflation, the central bank has raised its policy rate by a 
cumulative 275 ba sis points since October 2014, including an in crease of 
50 ba sis points on June 3.  We expect these moves to support the real and 
bring inflation down to 5¾ percent by the end of this year and to 5½ percent 
by 2017, allowing policy to begin to ease by mid-2016.  The loosening in 
policy should contribute to an increase in real GDP growth to a still-sluggish 
1¾ pe rcent next year and to 2¼ percent in 2017.

Financial Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, longer-term Treasury yields increased notably amid 
heightened volatility, eviden tly boosted by rising core eu ro-area sovereign bond yields 
and, to a lesser extent, stronger-than-anticipat ed domestic labor market news late in the 
period.  The sharp rise in core  euro-area yields, though difficu lt to fully explain, appeared 
to reflect an increase in expected future short-term rates following some positive 
European economic data releases, as well as  a notable rise in term premiums from 
significantly compressed levels.    
 On net, 10-year nominal Treasury an d German bund yields rose 43 basis 
points and 79 basis points, respectivel y.  TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation were little changed over the period.  
 Results of the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market 
participants indicated that September remained the most likely time of liftoff, 
with the expected pace of normalizati on after the liftoff little changed.  The 
path of the federal funds rates im plied by OIS quotes shifted up beyond 2015, 
likely reflecting in part an increase in term premiums.  
 The S&P 500 index moved slightly lowe r, and the VIX remained near the 
lower end of its historical range.   
 Financing conditions for businesses and households stayed generally 
accommodative, even as residential mortga ge and revolving credit availability 
continued to be tight for borrowers with lower credit scores. 
TREASURY YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, longer-term Tr easury yields rose substantially amid 
significant volatility.  Market participants linked the yield movement primarily to the 
sharp rise in core euro-area sovereign bond yields, which many anecdotal reports 
attributed to investors abandoning their views about the profitability of the so-called QE 
trade, a set of positions designed to benefit from a further decline in core euro-area yields. Treasury yields also rose notably following the stronger-than-expected May 
employment report.  On net, the nominal Tr easury yield curve steepened appreciably over

  the intermeeting period, with 2- , 5-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury  yields increasing about 15, 
34, 43, and 50 basis points, respectively.  The changes for the 10- and 30-year Treasury 
yields stand at the 90th and 95th percentiles, respectively, of the distributions for changes 
over intermeeting periods since 1990.  (For a more detailed discussion of Treasury yield 
movements, see the box “U.S. Treasury Yi elds and Global Factors during the 
Intermeeting Period.”)   
Most of the increase in nominal yields was attributable to a rise in real yields, as 
5-year inflation compensation was little cha nged and 5-to-10-year inflation compensation 
rose only a bit.   
 Federal Reserve communications foll owing the April FOMC meeting were 
characterized by investors as generally in line with expectations and elicited limited 
market reaction.  With respect to the FOMC statement and the minutes, market 
participants reportedly focused on the cha nges to the Committee’s assessment of the 
economy—in particular, the language that the slower economic growth  during the winter 
months “in part” reflected “transitory factors.”   
On net, the path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes steepened 
markedly beyond 2015, with some portion of the increase coming on the heels of the May 
employment report.  A significant portion of the pickup, however, may reflect higher 
term premiums.  Indeed, the modal forecasts of the federal funds rate through 2018 from 
the Desk’s June surveys of dealers and market  participants were little changed since the 
April survey, and respondent s again saw the September 2015 meeting as the most likely 
date for the first increase in the federal funds rate target ra nge.  The probability of liftoff 
at or after the September meeting increased somewhat, with the probability of liftoff at 
the June 2015 meeting falling to near zero.  The expected pace of tightening after the 
liftoff was little changed relative to the April survey. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Since the April FOMC meeting, foreign sovereign bond yields increased, 
especially at longer maturities, and forei gn stock prices generally moved down.  The 
nominal exchange value of the dollar st rengthened, on net, over the period.  
Benchmark sovereign bond yields in the advanced foreign economies rose sharply 
starting in late April.  After falling back somewhat in late May as Greek concerns became

 U.S. Treasury Yields and Global Factors during the  
Intermeeting Period 
Longer-term U.S. Treasury yields rose notably, on net, amid heightened volatility during 
the intermeeting period.  The 10-year Treasury yield (the black line in figure 1 on the next 
page) increased 30 basis points over the first two weeks of May and reach ed 2.35 percent 
on May 13, its highest level since December.  After retracing somewhat toward the end of 
May , Treasury yields again increased sharply in June, leaving the 10-year yield higher by 
43 basis points, on net, since the April FOMC meeting.   TIPS yields increased nearly as 
much as nominal yields, leaving inflation compensation little changed on net.  Available 
evidence points to developments in the euro area as the main driver of the rise in 
Treasury yields, as sharp increases in German yields appeared to spill over into the  
U.S. Treasury market; by contrast, domestic developments appear to have played a 
limited role.  
The rise in U.S. yields coincided with similar increases in foreign yields (figure 1), and, in 
particular, the sharp rise in German yields (the green line).  The correlation between U.S. 
and euro-area yields has historically been high, but as shown in figure 2, the correlation 
between far-forward rates in both countries appears to have increased over the past 
year.   Furthermore, results from a Granger causality test (shown in figure 3) provide some 
evidence 
that the probability that movements in far-forward German yields can help 
predict movements in their U.S. counterparts has increased again recently (the red line), 
with the probability moving closer to levels last seen during the euro-area debt crisis .  
Finally, figure 4 shows that staff models attribute the increases in both U.S. yields and 
German bund yields largely to higher term premiums. 
The sharp increase in German term premiums appears to have been mostly the result of a 
reassessment among market participants of the substantial decline in German yields that 
began in early 2014 .  That decline—perhaps predicated on investor perceptions of 
sign
ificant tail risks such as protracted deflation associated with the sharp decline in oil 
prices and a further worsening of the global growth outlook —gained further momentum 
when the ECB began its purchase program of euro-area sovereign bonds in March, and 
pushed German yields with maturities up to eight years below zero.  It is possible that the 
decline in German yields and term premiums was subsequently viewed as excessive, 
resulting in the rise in yields and premiums we saw during the intermeeting period, 
although what triggered the revision in investors ’ views is not entirely clear. 
Although the rise in both German and U.S. yields can be primarily attributed to increases 
in term premiums, the expected rate component rose as well.   Some better-than-
expected eu
ro-area economic data —in particular, the release of the euro-area CPI for 
May, as wel
l as some stabilization of oil prices —appear to have boosted primarily the 
ex
pected rate component of German yields (the red dashed line in figure 4).  Meanwhile, 
although the expected rate component in U.S. yields (the blue dashed line) initially 
remained stable amid an absence of significant changes in the U.S. economic and 
monetary policy outlook, the more recent and pronounced increase in expected rates

 appeared to be supported by some better-than-expected domestic economic news, such 
as the ISM data and the May employment report .  Nonetheless, increases in U.S. yields in 
June again appeared in large part to be driven by the sharp increase in German yields, as 
the selloff of German bunds resumed, particular ly following ECB communications that 
were interpreted as lacking concern about the recent increase in market volatility.      
In summary, the increase in U.S. yields over the intermeeting period does not seem to 
reflect major changes in the domestic economic or monetary policy outlook but rather a 
rise in term premiums that was closely linked to yield developments in the euro area, 
which in turn appeared to be largely driven by investors reassessing the level of valuation 
in the German bund market.1  This reassessment appears to have initiated an unwinding 
of wide ly 
held positions in euro-area sovereign bonds, particularly by momentum-driven 
investors, which may have exacerbated the rise in yields. 
 
                                                 
1 In response to a special question in the June Desk survey, the median dealer attributed more than 
two-thirds of the 36 basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield between late April and early June 
to higher term premiums.  The selloff in core European sovereign bond markets was the most cited 
factor behind the rise in Treasury yields.

  more prominent, yields resumed their clim b following stronger-than-expected euro-area 
inflation data and comments by ECB President Draghi suggesti ng that the ECB was 
willing to tolerate some of th e recent volatility in yields.  On net, sovereign bond yields 
are up 79 basis points in Germany since the April FOMC meeting.  Some of the move 
reflects higher expected policy rates; the market-implied pol icy rate for the euro area 
three years ahead increased 35 basis points.  Howe ver, most of the move is attributed to a 
rise in the term premium, which appears to be  a partial correction of  an earlier decline.  
Foreign yields also rose, along with U.S. Treasury yields, following the release of the 
U.S. labor market data in June and are 15 basis points higher, on net, in Japan and 
40 basis points higher in the United Kingdom. 
Early in the period, peripheral soverei gn spreads narrowed, re flecting a somewhat 
improved outlook for Greek program negotiations .  Subsequently, spreads widened after 
Greek officials announced they would postpone several debt repayments to the IMF until 
June 30.  On net, spreads for Italy and Sp ain rose slightly, whereas Greek spreads 
declined.  Nonetheless, continuing difficu lties in program negotiations have raised 
concerns that the Greek government may miss this June 30 payment, and that the ECB 
could curtail liquidity support to Greek banks (for more details, see the International 
Economic Developments and Outlook section). 
After falling during the first couple of weeks of the period, the foreign exchange 
(FX) value of the dollar began rising agai n in mid-May, reflecting higher-than-expected 
CPI data for April, the strong May employme nt report, and perhaps some step-up in 
market concerns over Greece.  On net over the period, the dollar gained against most 
currencies, with the broad dollar index up 1½ percent.  However, the dollar declined 
slightly, on balance, against the euro, which may have refl ected the solid incoming data 
for the euro area and the especially pronounced increase in euro-area yields. 
Against the backdrop of rising yields, e quity prices in the advanced foreign 
economies generally moved lower over the peri od.  Stock prices in Canada and Europe 
declined 4 to 6 percent, with the Canadian market reacting in part to the release of 
disappointing data for employment in April a nd GDP in the first quarter.  EME equity 
prices declined substantially, as macroeconom ic data in several EMEs came in weaker 
than had been expected and as global yields moved up sharply.

  CORPORATE ASSET PRICES  
Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. e quity price indexes moved down a bit, 
on net, amid mixed macroeconomic news and little earnings news.  Option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index at th e one-month horizon—the VIX—edged up, on 
balance, but remained near the lower end of  its historical range.  Yield spreads on 
corporate bonds stayed near their historical median levels outside of recessions.  Spreads 
on 10-year triple-B-rated cor porate bonds over comparable-mat urity Treasury securities 
widened somewhat, on balance, while spre ads on speculative-grade corporate bonds 
narrowed slightly.   
BUSINESS FINANCE  
In April and May, financing conditions for large nonfinancial businesses 
continued to be accommodative.  Firms raised a substantial volume of funds in debt 
markets, particularly for the refinanci ng of existing debt and the funding of M&A 
activity.  Gross corporate bond issuance remained quite strong, and institutional 
leveraged loan issuance picked up signifi cantly.  The growth of C&I loans on banks’ 
balance sheets also continued to be soli d.  Meanwhile, financing conditions for small 
businesses continued to improve, though the growth of small business loans on banks’ 
books remained subdued, reflecting in part still-tepid demand for credit from small 
business owners. 
CRE prices continued to rise at a fa st pace through the first quarter of 2015, 
supported in part by rising  rents and declining vacan cy rates as well as by 
accommodative financing conditions.  CMBS issuance continued to be robust, and the 
spreads of CMBS rates over Treasury swap rates remained narrow.  The growth of CRE 
loans on banks’ books slowed in April and May, reportedly driven by sales of loans 
secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties into CMBS pools.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Credit availability for residential mortga ges continued to ease gradually over the 
intermeeting period.  Nevertheless, credit rema ined tight for borrowers with lower credit 
scores.  Interest rates on 30-y ear fixed-rate mortgages incr eased 37 basis points, in line 
with MBS yields and othe r longer-term rates.

  Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally 
accommodative in March and April.  Outstanding balances of auto and student loans 
expanded further at a robust pace through April,  as such credit continued to be widely 
available, including to borrowers with subprim e credit scores.  Revolving credit picked 
up in March and April after a slow start at the beginning of the year.  However, overall, 
revolving credit lending continued to be tight for borrowers with less-than-pristine credit 
records:  In the first quarter, the distribu tion of credit scores on new revolving accounts 
moved sideways, offered credit card interest rates continued to trend up, and credit card 
limits per capita for nonprime borrowers re mained mostly flat at subdued levels. 
The credit quality of consumer loans re mained mixed on balance.  Delinquency 
rates on credit card loans con tinued to decline from alrea dy low levels, those on student 
loans moderated somewhat but remained el evated, and those on auto loans remained 
low.  In contrast, delinquency rates on recen tly originated subprime auto loans continued 
to edge up, likely reflecting the expansion of lending and easing of standards to such 
borrowers.  
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY  
Bank credit decelerated slightly in Apr il and May, as somewhat slower business 
loan growth was partially offset by a resu rgence in consumer lending.  Meanwhile, the 
growth rate of holdings of secu rities was about in line with it s first-quarter pace, as large 
banks continued to acquire Treasury and government-backed MBS securities. 
In the first quarter of 2015, the profitability of BHCs increased slightly but 
remained well below the levels observed in the decade prior to the financial 
crisis.  Declining net interest margins continue d to be a key factor for the relatively low 
profitability of large banks (see the box “Why Are Net Intere st Margins of Large Banks 
So Compressed?”).  In cont rast, the trading and invest ment banking subcomponents of 
noninterest income increased.  Finally, credit quality continued to improve across most 
major loan types in the first quarter of 2015, and standard measures of reserve adequacy 
increased modestly.  
Stock prices of large domestic BHCs outperformed the broader indexes, 
reportedly in part because of the steepeni ng of the yield curve, which tends to boost 
banks’ net interest margins.  News that three large domestic BHCs had reached

 Why Are Net Interest Margins of Large Bank s So Compressed? 
The extraordinarily low interest rate environment that has prevailed in the wake of the financial 
crisis has put downward pressure on the net interest margins (NIMs) of all bank holding 
companies (banks), but especially the largest ones.  In particular, over roughly the past five years , 
NIMs of large banks have fallen about 80 basis points, while NIMs of small banks have decreased 
approximately 20 basis points (left panel).1   
The more pron
ounced decline in NIMs at large banks is driven by two main factors related to the 
low interest rate environment .  The first factor accounts for the majority of the difference in the 
behavior of NIMs at the two bank groups and arises from the liability side of banks’ balance 
sheets, namely from a more pronounced decline in deposit costs at small banks.  In general, 
deposit rates tend to move with short-term interest rates and are typically lower at large banks .  
With the federal funds rate at the zero lower bound since late 2008, the degree to which large 
banks have been able to boost their profitability by reducing their deposit rates has been more 
limited relative to small banks .  For example, the arithmetic effect of the decline in deposit rates 
at small banks has pushed up NIMs about 60 basis points, while the corresponding effect of 
declining rates at large banks has increased NIMs roughly 20 basis points  (red portions of the 
bars, right panel).   So far, at least, large domestic banks have been reluctant to charge negative 
deposit rates, a 
step that banks in foreign jurisdictions have been more willing to take.2   
The second fact
or stems from the asset side of the balance sheet :  Large banks have experienced 
a somewhat bigger decline in the interest income they earn on “ other ” assets, which includes 
assets held for trading purposes .  Interest income on such assets has declined notably since 2010, 
and large banks hold more of these assets relative to small banks .  This factor explains why 
interest income fell about 1 50 basis points at large banks while it moved down roughly 130 basis 
points at small banks (gray portions of the bars, right panel).    
These empirical findings have implications for assessing the monetary transmission mechanism 
around the time of liftoff.3  At that time, for example, large banks could try to boost their 
profitability in 
the short term by delaying the increase in deposit rates relative to previous 
tightening cycles.  If that happens, more deposits than usual could leave the banking system, 
putting some downward pressure on the level of short-term interest rates.   However, with 
interest on ex
cess reserves higher than many deposit rates, banks may act to preserve this 
funding source, accelerating the pass-through to market interest rates relative to previous 
tightening cycles.  That said, this latter effect may be damped because many large banks face 
balance sheet constraints in light of the new regulatory environment.    
 
                
                                                 
1 Large banks are defined as those with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets.   
2 Some custodial banks in the United States are reportedly currently charging negative rates on 
nonoperational deposits denominated in euros.  Such reports are more common in foreign jurisdictions.

FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Testing of the ON RRP operations conti nued over the intermeeting period.  Daily 
take-up averaged about $105 billion, with money funds accounting for the majority of 
participation.2   
Overall, the ON RRP operations conti nued to provide a soft floor on money 
market rates during the intermeeting period.  Overnight federal funds and Eurodollar 
rates stayed above the ON RRP rate, although both rates fell severa l basis points on the 
April and May month-ends.3  The overnight triparty re po rate for Treasury collateral 
averaged 7 basis points.  The overnight GCF repo rate continued to be above the 
overnight triparty rate. While both rates incr eased several basis poi nts on the April and 
May month-ends, in line with expectations, the GCF rate increased more noticeably (for 
more information about the spread betw een these two rates,  see the box “Market

2 The Desk announced term RRP operations over th e June quarter-end.  Specifically, there will be 
a seven-day operation on June 25 and a two-day operation on June 29, with a combined offer amount of at 
least $200 billion.  The Desk also conducted two small-value repo operations with primary dealers on May 19 and 20 to test operational readiness.  Both operations proceeded smoothly.

 Market Segmentation  in the Treasury  Repo  Market 
Since late 2014, the spread  between the  overnight Treasury  general collateral  
repo rate observed  in the interdealer GCF market  and general Treasury  triparty 
repo rate has widened (see the figure on the following  page). 1  Here we discuss 
the segmentation  between  these two markets, recent  regulatory  changes that 
have led to the spread  widening,  and quarter‐end dynamics.   The behavior  of this 
spread provides  evidence  that new bank regulations  could be having an effect  on 
money markets and highlights  that these changes may differentially  affect 
various aspects of markets for similar money  market instruments.   
 
Analysis of supervisory data  collected  from the two  major clearing banks 
suggests that the GCF rate is higher than the general triparty rate due  to market  
segmentation;  this results from differences  in counterparty  credit quality, which 
limits the markets in which some participants  can borrow.  Specifically,  some 
small dealers  with low or no credit rating predominantly  use the GCF market to 
borrow Treasury  repo in the triparty  market. In contrast,  large dealers with high  
credit ratings tend to supply  funds to the GCF market and are the primary 
borrowers  in the general triparty market, so they can  earn the spread between 
rates in the GCF and general triparty  markets.   
 
While this segmentation  has been present  for some  time, recent regulatory  
changes may have contributed  to a widening  of the rate spread.  For  example,  
market participants  have commented  on the reduced attractiveness  for large 
dealers to intermediate  repos as the Basel III leverage  ratio reportedly  provides  a 
disincentive to engage  in low‐yield, balance‐ sheet‐ intensive activities.   This 
regulatory  shift has  likely contributed  to decreasing  repo volumes  since 2013.   
The combination  of reduced supply  from large dealers and stable demand from 
dealers that depend on the GCF market for funding  has contributed  to the recent 
widening  of the spread.   
 This segmentation  and widening  of the spread becomes  particularly  noticeable  
on quarter‐ends.  Specifically,  there have  been sharp  increases  in GCF market 
rates on recent quarter ‐ends, especially  the December  2014 and March 2015  
quarter‐ends, as U.S. primary dealers reduce their net GCF lending on those dates  
relative to the rest  of the year (see the table on the following  page).  At the same  
time, nonprimary  dealers, many of which rely on the GCF market for funding, 
increase their  net borrowing  and represent  a larger share of overall borrowing.
2  
This increase in  borrowing  may be in response  to a contraction  in GCF‐dependent 
dealers’ alternative  funding options on these dates  and provides  further 
evidence  of GCF‐dependent dealers’  need to use the GCF market for funding  
even at higher rates.   
                                                 
1 The General Collateral  Finance (GCF)  repo market is an interdealer  market 
within the overall triparty repo market.  It  is blind‐brokered  with a central 
counterparty,  which reduces counterparty  risk,  making it an attractive  funding 
market for less creditworthy  borrowers.  
2 Foreign primary dealers borrow less on net, which could put downward  
pressure on rates.  However,  it appears not to be the dominant  effect.

  Desk’s MBS settlements to gross issuance of these securities picked up again in May to

TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING  
Various liquidity metrics for Treasury a nd MBS markets were little changed over 
the intermeeting period, and they have genera lly pointed to relatively stable market 
functioning over the past several years.4  However, the majority of the June SCOOS 
respondents indicated that, over the past five years, liquidi ty and functioning in these 
markets, especially in Treasury markets, ha ve deteriorated.  Res pondents attributed the 
deterioration primarily to securities dealer s’ decreased willingness to provide balance 
sheet resources for marketmaking purposes as  a result of both regulatory changes and 
changes in internal risk-management practices.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  However, we continue to view the risks to our forecast 
for real GDP growth as tilted somewhat to the downside.  Importantly, neither monetary nor fiscal policy appears well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  
By contrast, we continue to view the risks around our unemployment projection as 
roughly balanced, with the risk of a higher unemployment rate from adverse demand-side 
developments roughly offset by the possibility that the surprisingly steep declines in the 
unemployment rate of recent years will continue. 
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, we 
continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside. 
Despite some recent increases, TIPS-based inflation compensation remains well below its level of a year ago and core PCE price inflation remains below the Committee’s target 
despite a declining unemployment rate and other signs of labor market tightening.  One 
factor that has likely held down U.S. inflation recently has been the increase in the 
exchange value of the dollar.  With other major central banks conducting aggressive policies to fight their own inflation shortfalls, the dollar may be stronger than in the 
baseline, leading to continued downward pressure on U.S. inflation.  
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities of the U.S. 
financial system to adverse shocks as moderate overall.  This assessment reflects low 
levels of leverage and maturity transformation in the banking sector, moderate use of 
leverage in most parts of the nonbank financial sector, and overall modest debt growth in 
the private nonfinancial sector.  That said, there are pockets of concern:  Some indicators 
suggest stretched valuations in equity and bond markets, and borrowing by lower-rated 
firms has been quite strong.  Commercial real estate valuation pressures, while still moderate, have risen amid weakening underwriting standards.  As best as we can 
determine, leverage in margin accounts employed by hedge funds appears somewhat

elevated.  Structural vulnerabilities in the mutual fund sector persist, particularly for U.S. 
money market funds and funds that invest in illiquid assets.  And bond market liquidity is 
reported by some market participants to be more likely to dissipate in the presence of market stress than has historically been the case. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario, aggregate demand is persistently weaker than in the baseline, such that the long-
run equilibrium real interest rate is lower.  The second scenario also features weaker 
aggregate demand than in the baseline; in this case, however, the weakening is more pronounced in the near term but is of shorter duration.  The third scenario considers the 
possibility that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than in the baseline. In the 
fourth, recent softness in the incoming data proves to be more transitory and the 
underlying pace of economic activity stronger than a ssumed in the baseline projection, 
leading to a higher path of inflation. In the fifth scenario, foreign economic growth is 
significantly weaker than in our baseline outlook, while the dollar appreciates markedly.  
In the final scenario, a disorderly exit of Greece from the euro-area monetary union 
causes Europe to plunge into a deep recession with severe adverse effects on global 
financial conditions and confidence. 
We generate the first, second, and third scenarios using the FRB/US model, while 
the fourth one uses the EDO model.  The final two scenarios are generated using the 
multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds rate has risen above its current 
target range, its movements are governed as in the baseline forecast by an inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the 
Committee’s recent statements.
1 In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of 
the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations. One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate 
Thus far in the recovery, aggregate demand has been weak, likely reflecting both 
domestic and global factors.  In the baseline, these factors are expected to dissipate, so 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate is assumed to rise over time.  However, some have 
argued that the factors that have depressed aggregate demand are essentially permanent ; 
accordingly, in this scenario, we assume that the current weakness in aggregate demand 
continues such tha t the equilibrium real federal funds rate rises 1 percentage point less 
over the next decade than in the baseline.  We assume that policymakers immediately 
recognize the lower trajectory of the equilibrium interest rate. 
As a result of the lower level of aggregate demand, output expands more slowly 
than in the baseline until the end of 2017.  However, monetary policy is able to offset a significant portion of the shortfall, and real GDP growth in 2016 is just ¼ percentage 
point lower than in the ba seline.  The path for the unemployment rate is slightly higher 
than in the baseline.  Because the lower value for the long-run equilibrium federal funds 
rate is known from the start of the simulation, it affects the setting of monetary policy in the near term, and the initial increase in the federal funds rate is delayed until the first 
quarter of 2016.  Thereafter, the difference between the alternative and the baseline 
widens, and by 2018, the federal funds rate is 1 percentage point lower than in the 
baseline. 
Near-Term Slowdown in Economic Activity 
In the first scenario, the weakness in aggregate demand is assumed to be 
permanent but modest in magnitude.  In this scenario, we assume that the softness in aggregate demand turns out to be less pe rsistent, but much sharper, than in the first 
scenario.  Relative to the baseline, the projected acceleration in consumer demand and housing construction falters.  The resulting weaker economy adversely affects profits and 
business confidence, causing firms to reduce their investment spending. 
Real GDP rises only ½ percent in 2016. In 2017, real GDP grows 1½ percent, 
½ percentage point less than the baseline.  The unemployment rate rises to 6¾ percent at the end of 2017 before gradually moving back toward its assumed natural rate.  The path 
for inflation is lower than in the baseline projection.  Given this weaker outlook, liftoff is delayed until the first quarter of 2016 and the federal funds rate remains at or below 50 basis points until early 2018.  The federal funds rate reaches 1½ percent by the end of 
2019, about 1¾ percentage points below baseline.

Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment 
While the unemployment rate has come down substantially over the past few 
years, inflation has not picked up, with core PCE inflation averaging less than 1½ percent 
since 2012.  One reason inflation has remained subdued despite falling unemployment may be that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than generally thought.  A lower trajectory for the natural rate would also help reconcile the rapid decrease in 
unemployment seen in recent years with the modest increases in GDP.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has fallen faster over the past five years 
than assumed by the staff, to 4.2 percent in the current quarter, 1 percentage point less than in the baseline. 
The higher level of potential output in this scenario implies that the output gap is 
initially wider than in the baseline and that the first increase in the federal funds rate is 
delayed until the last quarter of 2015. As a result of more-accommodative monetary 
policy, real GDP growth picks up, averaging about 2¼ percent over the 2015 19 period, 
about 15 basis points higher than in the baseline.  The unemployment rate declines faster than in the baseline and does not approach its natural rate until the end of 2019.  Given 
that the Phillips curve is very flat, the path for inflation is essentially unchanged. 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
While some incoming data have been soft, other indicators have been more 
encouraging.  Real GDI rose 1½ percent in the first quarter, auto sales surged in May, and 
some indicators of residential investment have been more positive.  Job openings are elevated, and initial claims for unemployment insurance are at historical lows. In this 
scenario, households and businesses are more confident about the underlying strength of the economy, and that greater confidence leads them to be more willing to spend and hire 
than in the baseline, supporting a much faster economic expansion.  We also assume that 
inflation is more sensitive to reductions in resource slack than in the standard version of 
the EDO model, consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE models.
2 
Real GDP growth averages about 3¼ percent in the second half of 2015 and 
4 percent in 2016, compared with 2 percent and 2½ percent, respectively, in the baseline 
projection.  The unemployment rate falls below 5 percent by early 2016, bottoms out at 
2 We make inflation more sensitive to slack by reducing the adjustment cost parameters for prices 
and wages in EDO. In particular, we use values that are two standard deviations below the EDO point 
estimates of these two parameters.

4½ percent at the beginning of 2017, and then increases slowly for the remainder of the 
forecast period.  With resource utilization running tighter, inflation rises faster than in the 
baseline, reaching 2¼ percent by the end of 2017 . The federal funds rate lifts off at the 
same time as in the baseline but rises more steeply thereafter, passing 4 percent in 2018 
and approaching 5 percent by the end of 2019.  Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent. 
Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar 
In our baseline forecast, we project that foreign output growth will pick up 
noticeably from its languid pace over the past two years, especially in the EMEs, and that 
this pickup in foreign growth will contribute to a modest depreciation of the broad real 
dollar in 2016 and 2017.  However, foreign growth may continue to disappoint for a 
number of reasons:  China could experience a more pronounced slowdown than in our baseline if the property market weakens further and lending conditions tighten; growth in 
EME exports and investment spending may remain subdued rather than bounce back as 
in our baseline; or the BOJ’s and ECB’s large -scale quantitative easing programs may 
fail to deliver much of a boost to output and inflation.  In this scenario, we assume that a 
weakening of household and business confidence abroad and a modest tightening of 
credit conditions cause foreign GDP growth to run 1 percentage point below the baseline 
over the forecast period, with the negative growth surprises somewhat more concentrated 
in the EMEs.  Given the heightened divergence between monetary policy abroad and in 
the United States, the gradual removal of policy accommodation in the United States is 
assumed to generate substantial flows toward dollar-denominated assets, causing the 
broad real dollar to appreciate 7 percent relative to baseline.  
The slower foreign growth and stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands by less than 2 percent in 2016, 
about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate remains 
above 5½ percent until 2019.  Weaker U.S. economic activity and lower import price 
inflation hold core inflation to about 1¼ percent through 2016.  The federal funds rate

lifts off at the same time as in the baseline, but U.S. monetary policy removes 
accommodation more gradually going forward.3 
Greek Exit with Severe Spillovers 
Our baseline assumption is that spillovers from developments in Greece will be 
contained, even in the event that debt negotiations break down completely and Greece’s 
crisis deepens.  However, it is far from assured that the firewalls erected during the past 
few years and actions that the authorities would presumably take to limit contagion will succeed, especially if Greece actually leaves the euro area.  In this scenario, we consider a direr outcome in which Greece abandons the euro and the related disruptions cause the euro area to plunge into a deep recession, with severe adverse effects on global financial 
conditions and confidence. 
Specifically, our scenario assumes that financial conditions in the euro area 
tighten sharply and that confidence plummets amid rising unemployment and heightened 
disinflationary pressures.  Peripheral sovereign spreads rise 400 basis points above 
baseline, while euro-area corporate borrowing spreads rise more than 200 basis points.  
As a result, euro-area real GDP falls about 6 percent relative to the baseline by early 2017.  The euro-area crisis has substantial adverse spillovers to the United States.  U.S. corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 100 basis points, while flight- to-safety 
flows help push the trade-weighted dollar up nearly 8 percent and depress 10-year 
Treasury yields about 25 basis points. 
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the baseline as a result of lower confidence and tighter credit conditions, and U.S. real GDP nearly stalls 
in the second half of 2015 and expands only ¾ percent in 2016.  Lower domestic demand and lower import price inflation cause U.S. core inflation to run at ¾ percent in 2016, 
about 1 percentage point below baseline.  The inertial Taylor rule prescribes a 
substantially shallower path for the federal funds rate than in the baseline. 
3 The box “Alternative View: The Risk of Significant Macroeconomic Imbalances over the 
Medium Term” in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section considers a scenario in 
which the broad real dollar appreciates by 20 percent, and raises the possibility that the much lower path of 
the federal funds rate prescribed by the inertial Taylor rule in this scenario (relative to the staff’s baseline) 
could pose financial stability risks.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
