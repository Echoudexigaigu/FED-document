Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook   
The basic dimensions of the economic situa tion are little change d from the time of 
the June Tealbook:  After having averaged just 1 percent in the first half  of this year, real 
GDP growth still looks poised to step up to  an annual rate of 2 percent in the second 
half.1  Second-half growth along those lines would be unimpressive but nonetheless 
sufficient to generate some further narrowi ng of the remaining gap between actual and 
potential output.  Labor market conditions also continue  to improve, with payroll 
employment running noticeably above the pace required to absorb new entrants into the 
workforce, and inflation continues to run well below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective. 
We now project that real GDP will rise 2¼ percent in 2016 before edging down to 
2 percent in 2017.  This forecast is slightly w eaker than in June, reflecting small changes 
to a number of conditioning assumptions—most notably, a higher exchange value of the 
dollar.  All else being equa l, the combination of the surprisingly low reading on the 
unemployment rate in June and the slight degradation in our forecast for aggregate 
demand would have led us to project no furt her decline in the unemployment rate over 
the forecast period, a projection th at did not seem to balance th e risks adequately in light 
of the significant and consistent declines seen  over the past few years.  Consequently, as 
we describe in greater detail later, we made sufficient adju stments to the supply side of 
the projection to bring the une mployment rate down to 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter  
of 2017.   
As for inflation, we continue to fores ee core inflation gradually moving up from 
1.3 percent this year to 1.7 percent in 2017, as import prices  turn back up, resource 
utilization tightens, and the e ffects of the earlier sharp dec lines in energy prices wane.  
The recent fall in crude oil prices damps h eadline inflation over the next few quarters 
relative to core, but we expect total PCE in flation to run roughly in line with core 
inflation next year and in 2017.  
As always, numerous risks attend our outlook.  We view the uncertainty around 
our projection for real GDP gr owth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in

revision to the national income and product accounts on July 30, the day after the FOMC meeting.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is somewhat lower than the most 
recent Blue Chip Consensus outlook (from early this month) and the median 
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (from mid May). The 
staff’s forecast of the unemployment rate is a little higher than those of the 
outside forecasters; the staff’s inflation projection is a bit lower.

line with the average over the past 20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility.  
We have maintained our assessment that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted 
somewhat to the downside, largely reflecting our view that neither monetary nor fiscal 
policy appears well positioned to offset la rge adverse shocks to the economy.  By 
contrast, we still see the risks around our outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly 
balanced, as the downside risk s to real activity are offset by the possibility that the 
unemployment rate could continue to decline mo re rapidly than we expect.  Our concerns 
with respect to the inflation outlook remain mostly on the downside, given the still-muted 
readings on TIPS-based measures of inflati on compensation and hints from surveys of a 
small decline in longer-term  inflation expectations. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We continue to assume that the fede ral funds rate will lift off from its 
effective lower bound after the Septem ber meeting.  As in previous 
projections, the trajectory of the fe deral funds rate following liftoff is 
determined by the prescriptions of an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) 
policy rule.  The projected path of the fe deral funds rate is similar to that in 
the June Tealbook, rising an average of about 20 basis points per quarter after 
liftoff and reaching an average of 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield is  little changed, on net, since the June Tealbook.  
As before, we expect this rate to increase significantly over the forecast 
period, reflecting both the movement  of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates and an increase 
in the term premium toward its historically normal level.    
 Similarly, we made only small adjustment s to our projections for the 10-year 
triple-B corporate bond yield and 30-year mortgage rates. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 We project stock prices to rise at an average pace of  4.2 percent per year.  As 
in our previous forecast, we expect the equity risk premium to decline notably

over the next few years, consistent w ith the benign economic outlook in the 
staff forecast and the associated rise in 10-year Treasury yields.   
 With the incoming data on house prices cl ose to our expectations, we continue 
to expect house prices to rise about 5¼ percent in 2015 and then to decelerate 
to an average growth rate of 3 percent per year in 2016 and 2017.  Our 
assessment is that house prices are not fa r out of line with their historical 
relationship to rents; we expect valuations to remain within the range 
predicted by this relationship over the medium term. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We have slightly downgraded our assessm ent of the fiscal position of state 
and local governments.  The net hiri ng of these governments has stalled out 
this year, and proposed state governm ent budgets for fiscal year 2016—which 
started on July 1 in most states—point toward somewhat less spending growth 
than expected.  Moreover, the need to  shore up pension funding appears likely 
to impose greater restraint on budgets in at least some stat es and localities 
than we had previously expected.  Acco rdingly, we anticipate that the state 
and local sector will provide a bit less impetus to aggregate demand in this 
projection.  Nonetheless, we continue to expect that fiscal policy actions at all 
levels of government will provide a small stimulus to GDP growth during the 
next few years.     
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that foreign real GDP growth remained subdued in the second 
quarter, rising at an estimated a nnual rate of 1¾ percent, which is 
½ percentage point weaker than in our previous forecast.  Much of the revision reflects a greater-than-expected decline in Canadian GDP, as drilling 
and mining investment in Canada has fallen sharply in response to lower oil 
prices.  We continue to expect forei gn GDP growth to step up to an annual 
rate of 3 percent by early next year and to  remain at that pace over the rest of 
the projection period, supported by acco mmodative monetary policy abroad, 
depreciated currencies, and still-low oil prices.  
 The broad nominal dollar is somewhat higher than expected in the June 
Tealbook.  We project that the dollar will appreciate 1¾ percent further

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

through the remainder of 2015 as investors continue to focus on the 
divergence between monetary  policies in the United States and abroad.  
Thereafter, the dollar is projected to weaken as monetary  policy in several 
foreign economies begins to normalize a nd as downside risks to the economic 
expansion abroad diminish.  Our forecas t leaves the level of the broad real 
dollar up 1¼ percent at the end of 2017 relative to  the previous Tealbook. 
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $8 per barrel since the time 
of the June Tealbook, and prices for futu res contracts with delivery at the end 
of 2017 are down about $6 per barrel.  Th ese declines reflect anxieties about 
global growth, continued strong oil production in the United States and 
OPEC, and improved prospects for Irania n oil exports related to the Iranian 
nuclear agreement.  We expect the pr ice of imported oil to move up from 
$53 per barrel in the second half of this  year to about $57 per barrel by the end 
of 2017.  
 Concerns about weak demand also we ighed on metals prices, which moved 
down sharply in early July and remain depressed.  In contrast, the forecast for agricultural prices is higher in resp onse to weather-induced worries about 
supply, especially for corn and soybeans. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Real GDP appears to have increased in th e second quarter at an annual rate of 
about 2½ percent, supported in part by the reversal of some of the temporary factors that 
we think restrained activity in the first quarter.2  Even so, GDP growth over the first half 
of the year looks to have averaged only a bout 1 percent at an annual rate, somewhat less 
than our estimate of potential growth.  As in  previous Tealbooks, we  attribute much of 
this subdued performance to the effects of both the stronger dollar on net exports and the 
sharply lower oil prices on dril ling and mining investment.    
We continue to expect that the economy will expand at a moderate pace over the 
remainder of this year.  The fundame ntals underpinning household demand should

support continued solid growth in real PCE,  and we anticipate that drilling and mining 
investment will bottom out relatively soon as the effects of the declines in oil prices 
recede.  Thus, despite the lik elihood that past dollar apprec iation will continue to weigh 
on net exports in coming quarters, we expect re al GDP growth to average 2 percent at an 
annual rate in the second half of this year. 
 After having averaged 2½ percent in the first half of the year, real PCE growth 
is projected to step up to a 3 per cent pace in the sec ond half, supported by 
robust real DPI growth, a high wealth-to-income ratio, and upbeat consumer 
sentiment.  That said, the June read ing on retail sales was weaker than we 
expected, and we have lowered our proj ection by a few tenths relative to our 
previous forecast. 
 The decline in oil prices over the past  year has resulted in a sharp drop in 
drilling and mining investment that we now estimate reduced real GDP 
growth in the first half of the year by  nearly ¾ percentage point, on average, a 
slightly bigger drag than in our June projection.  We expect the declines in 
drilling and mining investment to slow markedly over the second half of the year, consistent with the recent bottoming out in the weekly data on rig counts.  
 Outside of drilling and mining, investme nt in nonresidential structures has 
been moving up at robust clip over the past year.  Construction spending 
growth in May is estimated to have b een considerably stronger than we had 
expected, and spending in previous m onths was revised up.  We took some 
signal from the strong incoming data and marked up our projection for 
nondrilling structures investment by a moderate amount throughout the 
medium term.  
 We estimate that net exports subtracted  1 percentage point from real GDP 
growth, on average, in the first half of  the year.  Given the effects of the 
earlier appreciation of the dollar, we expect the drag on growth from net 
exports to be only a little smaller in the second half—roughly ¾ percentage 
point on average.  This projection is l ittle changed from the June Tealbook.

 Total industrial production dec lined 1 percent at an annual rate in the first half 
of the year.3  We continue to think that manufacturing output was restrained 
earlier this year by a combination of transitory factors (s uch as supply-chain 
disruptions arising from the labor disputes at West Coast ports) and longer-
lived influences (such as the sharp declines in drilling activity and the stronger 
exchange value of the dollar).  We exp ect manufacturing production to rise in 
the second half of the year, though only at a subdued pace, consistent with the 
recent readings of the national and regional manufacturing surveys.   
In broad-brush terms, the medium-term GDP projection is much the same as it 
was in the June Tealbook:  We continue to  expect the pace of real GDP growth to 
average roughly 2¼ percent over the forecast period, ¾ percentage point faster than 
potential GDP growth.  Accommodative mone tary policy (even though progressively less 
so) plays the key role in our  projection in helping to s upport above-trend growth.  Our 
forecast for real GDP is more subdued than that  of many outside analysts.  The reason for 
this difference, in part, may be because we  expect a larger and more prolonged drag on 
domestic activity from the appreciation of the dollar over the past 12 months.   
Turning up the magnification on the microscope, our current forecast for the level 
of real GDP at the end of 2017 is revised down ¼ percent in light of the slightly stronger 
path for the exchange value of  the dollar, slightly weaker foreign output growth, and the 
somewhat downgraded assessment of the fis cal position of state and local governments. 
These effects are partly offset by the lower path of oil prices in this projection. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
The incoming data indicate that labor market conditions have continued to 
improve, although a bit less quickly on the whol e than we had anticipated in the June 
Tealbook.   
3 The Board published its annual revision to the index of industrial production and related 
measures of capacity utilization on July 21.  Taking on board newly available source data, total IP is now 
estimated to have returned to its pre-recession peak in May 2014, seven months later than was stated 
previously.  In addition, capacity utilization rates for total industry and for manufacturing are now lower 
than reported earlier; the operating rate for manufacturing in June 2015 is now 75.8 percent, a rate 
1.4 percentage points below its previous estimate and 2.7 percentage points below its long-run (1972–2014) 
average.

 Payroll employment growth averaged 220,000 per month in the second 
quarter, about 20,000 less than we expect ed in the June Tealbook but still a 
solid pace.  Most of the shortfall relative to our for ecast was in employment at 
local governments.     
 The unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point in June—one-tenth 
more than we had expected—putting it at  5.3 percent.  However, the labor 
force participation rate also declin ed more than we had expected, to 
62.6 percent, and as a result, the em ployment-to-population ratio edged down. 
 Going forward, we have made only mi nor adjustments to our near-term 
forecast.  We expect payroll employment gains to average 210,000 per month 
in the second half of the year.  In addition, we expect th e unemployment rate 
to edge down to 5.2 percent by the fourth  quarter, one-tenth lower than in the 
June Tealbook.  And we project the part icipation rate to average 62.7 percent 
in the fourth quarter, unrevised from June. 
Had we made no other adjustments, the J une decline in the unemployment rate, 
combined with the slightly weaker prospects for the growth of real GDP, would have led us to project no further reduction in the unemp loyment rate between June and the end of 
2017—an outcome that would not, in our judgm ent, have balanced the risks around the 
unemployment rate forecast.
4  We therefore made two sma ll changes to our supply-side 
assumptions (in advance of a more comprehe nsive reassessment following receipt of the 
annual revision to the national income and product accounts). 
 We now assume that the natural rate  of unemployment continued to edge 
down through the end of last year rather  than flattening out around midyear, as 
in our previous projection.  As a result, the natural rate is now projected to be 
5.1 percent through the projection period, 0.1 percentage point lower than in 
the June Tealbook.  We were encouraged to make a minor adjustment in this direction by some recent research sugges ting that, despite an  outward shift in 
4 The June forecast showed the unemployment rate ending 2017 at 5.2 percent; the weaker GDP 
performance in this forecast, all else being equal, would have caused that fi gure to revise up to 5.3 percent, 
the same as the actual reading in June.

the Beveridge curve, the natural rate may nonetheless be unchanged from or 
lower than prior to the recession.5 
 We also trimmed our assumption for the growth of potential GDP by about 
0.1 percentage point per year.  This adju stment reflected two partly offsetting 
changes: 
o On the downside, we took a bit of forward signal from the recent 
disappointing U.S. productivity performance and cut our forecast of 
structural productivity growth ¼ percentage point per year to 
1½ percent per year, roughly its average pace from 2005 to 2014.  (For 
a more optimistic interpretation of productivity developments, see the 
box “The Recent Slowing in High-Tech  Equipment Price Declines.”)   
o On the upside, we incorporated s lightly stronger projections for 
population growth from 2015 to 2017.   
 With downward revisions to both aggregate demand and aggregate supply, the 
GDP gap in this projection is unrevised from the June Tealbook and is closed 
by the end of 2017.  
Given all of these adjustments, the medi um-term outlook for the labor market is 
little changed relative to our previous forecast. 
 We expect monthly payroll gains to slow to 170,000 in 2016 and 140,000 in 
2017, much as in the June Tealbook.   
 The unemployment rate is projected to  edge down from 5.3 percent in the 
current quarter to 5.1 percent by the end of 2017, one-tenth lower than in the 
June forecast despite the slightly weak er growth of actual real GDP.  (For

 The Recent Slowing in High‐Tech Equipment  Price Declines 
The marked  step‐down in the staff’s estimate of  structural  labor productivity  growth 
from 2 percent per year between 2005  and 2009 to 1 percent between 2010  and 2014 
partly reflects a shrinking  contribution  from high‐tech  capital deepening  (figure 1).1  The 
slowing of measured  real investment  in high‐tech equipment is  largely attributable to a 
slackening  in the pace of computer  price declines in the NIPAs (figure 2).  However, 
recent research suggests  that measured  computer  investment  prices have increasingly  
suffered from biases that have attenuated  the estimated  pace of declines.2  These biases  
have not led to a material  understatement of  measured  growth of real GDP or  
productivity  in recent years, as these computers  are now largely imported.  However,  
they imply that high‐tech capital  accumulation  has been understated,  which, depending  
on the implications  for multifactor  productivity  (MFP), may signal a stronger outlook for 
structural  productivity  growth. 
Import substitution  bias.  The BEA deflates  computer  investment  with an average  of BLS 
price indexes for domestic producer  prices (PPI) and  import prices (IPI) (also shown in 
figure 2).  This method may capture the  broad trends in  domestic and  import prices, 
respectively, but it  omits the discount  associated  with businesses  shifting their purchases  
from domestic  to imported  equipment;  that discount  has been estimated  to be 
20 percent or more.  The effect  of this omission  has been acute  in recent years, as import 
penetration  for computer  investment  jumped from 40 percent in 2009 to 90 percent  by 
2011, a development  that coincides with the slowing  of the declines in high‐tech prices. 
New goods bias.  After a new category  of equipment appears  in the marketplace, prices  
often decline rapidly for items  in that category  as adoption  rises quickly, so a delay in the 
inclusion of such products  in price indexes can overstate  price inflation.   For example,  
tablet personal  computers  (PCs) appeared  in 2010 but were  not introduced  in the IPI until

 late 2012, when they  already accounted  for one‐fourth of the PC market.  Because  tablet 
PCs are largely imported,  this delay likely led to an understatement  of import price declines.  
Quality‐adjustment  bias.  When a new model enters the PPI or IPI samples,  the BLS adjusts 
the item’s price to account  for the estimated  value of any new or improved features.  
These adjustments  are intended  to provide  an “apples  to apples”  comparison  with similar 
models already in the index.  However,  in the case of imports, often  too little detailed  
information  is provided  by survey respondents  to allow for a proper  adjustment.   
Consequently,  the IPI tends to fall more  slowly as new waves of imported  goods are 
treated as more expensive  than the imports they succeed rather than as more feature 
rich.  The recent sharp  shift toward  imports has likely further slowed the pace of declines 
in the investment  price index (as shown in figure 2). 
The magnitudes  of these biases  are unknown,  but if the five‐year average  inflation rate 
for high‐tech  capital had held steady at the  rate observed in  2009, as shown in  figure 3, 
overall real nonresidential  private fixed investment  would have been 2½  percent higher.  
The greater high‐tech capital  deepening  would be equivalent  to 0.3  percent on the level 
of structural  productivity  at the end  of 2014 and  would raise its growth rate 0.1 to  
0.2 percentage point per year between 2015  and 2017 (see the crosshatching  in figure 1).   
The outlook for MFP is more uncertain.   Because the measurement difficulties  are 
centered  on imports, overall  labor productivity  has been largely  unaffected  by these 
biases, and greater capital  accumulation  in recent years would  have been offset  by an 
overstatement  of measured  MFP growth.  Extrapolating  forward,  that may imply weaker 
future MFP growth as well.  On  the other hand, MFP growth has historically  been 
positively  correlated  with earlier gains  in capital deepening.  (For  example,  Paul David 
famously  noted that the transition  from the steam engine to the electric dynamo  
spawned  decades of process renovation,  as shop floors were reengineered  to take full 
advantage of  the new technology.)   This positive correlation  suggests  that structural  
productivity  growth could be boosted by higher trend MFP growth as investments  in 
business proc esses and other intangible  capital are undertaken  to complement  
investments  in high‐tech capital.

Projection.”) 
 In our accounting, the out put gap represents the most comprehensive measure 
of resource utilization.  At the moment , we see the unemployment rate gap as 
understating the amount of slack remaini ng in the economy.  In particular, we 
estimate that, in the current quarter, ou tput is 1¼ percent below potential, 
while the unemployment rate is only 0.2 percentage point above our estimate 
of its natural rate.  In contrast, a dynamic simulation of Okun’s law would 
imply an unemployment rate gap of 0.5 percentage point.   
o In our analysis, the Okun’s law er ror reflects three additional sources 
of cyclically abnormal weakness.  Fi rst, the labor force participation 
rate is below our estimate of its trend by more than one would expect 
based on its usual relationship with the GDP gap.  Second, the level of 
involuntary part-time employment is unusually high.  Third, 
productivity currently lies well below our estimate of its trend. 
o As the economy continues to improve, we expect the unemployment 
rate to decline further.  But in a ddition, we anticipate more individuals 
to be drawn into the labor market and the rate of involuntary part-time 
employment to move down, in both cases by more than the cyclically 
normal amount.  We also expect pr oductivity to move up to its trend 
over the projection period.   
o Together, the behavior of the labor force participation rate, involuntary 
part-time employment, and productivity  should attenuate the decline in 
the unemployment rate relative to th e improvement in the output gap.  
By design, at the end of the medium term, the output and unemployment gaps are back in normal cyclical alignment.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Headline PCE prices are expected to incr ease at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in 
the third quarter and only 0.2 per cent in the fourth.  The dip in  inflation late in the year 
occurs as the recent fall in crude oil prices passes through into retail energy prices and as 
currently elevated gasoline margins decline.  Core PCE prices are estimated to have risen 
1.7 percent in the second quarter but are projec ted to rise a bit more  slowly in the second

half.  This pattern is mainly due to residua l seasonality that we think boosts core PCE 
inflation in the second quarter and holds it down some in the third quarter and a bit more 
in the fourth.   
 Our forecast for total PCE inflation in the second half of 2015 is 
0.6 percentage point lower than in our June projection, reflecting the 
downward surprise in crude oil prices.   
 Consumer food prices declined modestly during the first half  of the year but— 
consistent with available readings from futures markets—still are projected to 
accelerate by the end of this year to a pace that is roughly in line with core 
PCE inflation.  
 The most recent readings on core inflation have come in about as expected, 
and our forecast for core PCE inflati on for the remainder of the year is 
essentially unchanged from June.   
 Core import prices appear to be stabili zing.  After declining at an annual rate 
of 4.4 percent in the first quarter, core  import prices are estimated to have 
declined 3 percent in the second quart er—1 percentage point less negative 
than in the June Tealbook.  For the second half of 2015, we expect these 
prices to decline only 0.8  percent at an annual rate .  With the dollar peaking 
early next year and foreign CPI in flation picking up, core import price 
inflation is expected to turn positive by the start of 2016 and to move up to 
1.4 percent in 2017. 
 Readings on longer-term in flation expectations have  changed little over the 
intermeeting period.  That said, some of these measures seem to have edged down during the past handful of years.  Although none of these changes are large, collectively they s uggest a downside risk to our maintained assumption 
that expectations will remain well anchored. 
o The median estimate of expected infl ation over the next 5 to 10 years 
from the Michigan Surveys of Cons umers has averaged 2.7 percent so 
far this year.  This level is a touch lower than the average annual readings on this measure over the past several years, which have 
bounced between 2.8 percent and 2.9 pe rcent.  Going back to 2007 and

 Employment and Unemployment in the Staff Projection 
In the current staff projection , payroll employment gains are expected to average 165,000 
per month through the end of 2017.  During this same period, we project that the 
unemployment rate will edge down only 0.2 percentage point to 5.1 percent .  These two 
projections may appear at odds , as the pace of payroll gains may seem to point to a 
considerably steeper decline in the unemployment rate.  Here we highlight two aspects of 
the staff’s labor market outlook that help reconcile the healthy pace of payroll gains with the 
nearly flat unemployment rate projection.  First, as shown in figure 1, we project payroll 
employment to rise faster over the forecast period than employment as measured in the 
current population survey (CPS), similar to the pattern observed in most previous periods of 
economic expansion.   Second, we expect that, as the labor market tightens, the labor force 
participation rate will move back towards its (declining) trend over the projection period , 
which will attenuate the decline in the unemployment rate.     
As shown in figure 1, the ratio of payroll employment to CPS employment has been trending 
upward over time and tends to be pro-cyclical.   Several factors help explain the movements 
in payroll employment relative to CPS employment.  The payroll survey is limited to nonfarm 
wage and salary jobs, which have been rising as a share of total employment, while groups 
outside the scope of the payroll survey have seen their shares declining; these groups 
include self-employed individuals, private household workers, and farm workers.   Other 
factors contributing to the rise in payroll employment relative to CPS employment during 
expansions include increases in short-duration jobs, which are less likely to be reported to 
the CPS, and decreases in “off the books” jobs, which are not captured by the payroll survey.   
Finally, the CPS counts employed individuals, while the payroll survey counts jobs; implicitly, 
our forecast assumes an increase in multiple job holding that could be associated with a 
reduction in CPS respondents reporting themselves as working part time for economic 
reasons.

The staff’s projection of a further increase i n the ratio of payroll employment to CPS 
employment is consistent with recent historical experience.  However, t o isolate the 
influence of this aspect of our projection on the evolution of the unemployment rate, we 
show in figure 2 a counterfactual thought experiment in which CPS employment increases at 
the same rate as the number of payroll jobs but all other details of the staff’s projection 
(including monetary policy) are unchanged from the baseline. In particular, we assume
unrealistically that the labor force is the same as in the baseline so that the faster gains in 
CPS employment in this experiment are matched by faster declines in the number of 
unemployed individuals. Under these assumptions, the unemployment rate falls 
1¼ percentage points by the end of 2017 (dotted line) r ather than the ¼ percentage point 
decline shown in the current baseline forecast (solid line). 
The second relevant aspect of the staff labor market projection is the behavior of labor force 
participation. From 2010 to 2013, the labor force participation rate fell more than would have 
been expected given our assessment of its trend and its usual behavior over the business 
cycle .  One possible explanation for this unusual weakness in the participation rate is that 
the severity of the Great Recession and, especially, the sluggishness of the recovery resulted 
in an extended period of e specially poor job prospects that induced some individuals to drop 
out of the labor force and others to not enter. 
More recently, however, the participation rate has been moving sideways, which, when 
viewed against its declining (demographically driven) trend, suggests that the ongoing 
tightening in labor market conditions has begun to draw individuals back into the labor 
force. Indeed, the flattening of the participation rate since early 2014 reflects a marked 
increase in the transition rate from out of the labor force to employment. Going forward, 
we expect more individuals to be drawn back into the labor force as job prospects continue 
to improve and wage gains pick up , which will slow the decline in participation relative to 
its trend .  
As a second illustrative counterfactual, we maintain the staff’s forecast for CPS employment 
but assume that the participation rate declines from its level in 2015:Q2 at its trend pace of 
0.3 percentage point per year. Thus, i n contrast to the staff’s projection, this counterfactual 
assumes no cyclical improvement in participation. In this case, as shown by the dashed line 
in figure 2, the unemployment rate would decline nearly ¾ percentage point more than in 
the baseline projection.

2008, the average reading was 3.0 pe rcent, though that may have 
reflected some sensitivity to energy price increases. 
o The 10-year-ahead median expectation for PCE inflation among 
respondents to the Survey of Profe ssional Forecasters was 2 percent in 
2015:Q2—essentially the same as it ha s been for the past two years— 
while the median 5-year-forward measure from this survey has drifted down roughly 25 basis points since the beginning of this decade.   
o TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation are little 
changed, on balance, since the June  Tealbook, but they remain below 
levels that prevailed until last summer.   
We project that core PCE pr ice inflation will rise from  1.3 percent this year to 
1.5 percent next year and 1.7 pe rcent in 2017, as import prices  turn back up, the effects 
on core inflation of the previ ous large declines in energy pr ices dissipate, and resource 
utilization tightens further in an environment of well-anchor ed inflation expectations.  
With consumer food and energy prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices 
after this year, we expect total PCE infla tion to run at about the same pace as core 
inflation throughout most of the medium term.  
 The slight downward revision to our medium-term forecast for core PCE price inflation in this forecast reflects two influences:  First, we have assumed, to a 
greater extent than before, that the sl owdown in health-care services prices 
during the past few years will persist.  Second, the downward revision to energy price inflation during the second ha lf of this year passes through with a 
small coefficient into core inflation ne xt year.  Together, these influences 
shave one-tenth off our projection for core inflation in both 2016 and 2017.       
We received little information about labor compensation during the intermeeting 
period and continue to expect a modest pickup going forward.   
 Average hourly earnings increased 2 percent over the 12 months ending in 
June, ¼ percentage point less than we projected in the previous Tealbook.   
 As labor markets tighten further ove r the forecast period, we expect the 
increases in the productivity and cost  measure of compensation to step up

from about 2½ percent last year to 2¾ percent this year and to 3¼ percent in 
2016 and 2017. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Tayl or (1999) rule.  This polic y rule assumes a long-run 
equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3½ percent.  
 The federal funds rate rises further after 2017 and reaches its long-run value 
by 2020.  
 As monetary policy tightens sufficiently to reverse a slight overshooting of 
output relative to its poten tial, real GDP growth slow s to 1.7 percent in 2019 
before gradually returning to its long- run growth rate of 1.9 percent.  The 
unemployment rate remains close to its natural rate of 5.1 percent. 
 PCE price inflation remains below th e Committee’s long-run objective at the 
end of 2017.  The slight overshooting of out put relative to potential speeds the 
convergence of inflation to the 2 percent objective.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Recent indicators suggest that foreign real GDP growth remained quite subdued 
in the second quarter, at an estimated 1¾ percent.  This estimate is ½ percentage point 
lower than we anticipated at the time of the June Tealbook.  The disappointment in growth was broad based, but it was particularly sizable for Canada, where the energy sector experienced disruptions and the drop in oil-related investment has been more protracted than we had expected.  Weak U.S. manufacturing activity likely held down 
Mexico’s r ecovery from a mediocre first quarter, and the economic contraction in Brazil 
appeared to be deeper than we had predicted.  Finally, the weakness in global trade 
continued to weigh on activity in many countries.  On the brighter side, Chinese real 
GDP growth was surprisingly strong in the second quarter, and activity in the euro area 
continued to show signs of being on the mend despite the crisis enveloping Greece.  
We expect real GDP growth to step up in the current quarter to about 2½ percent, 
driven importantly by a rebound in the Canadian economy.  We have foreign growth 
improving further in the second half of the year before settling in at a 3 percent pace 
thereafter.  Although the Greek crisis and stock market turmoil in China commanded considerable attention over the intermeeting period, these developments have left little 
imprint on our baseline forecast.  We assume that Greece will continue to struggle to 
achieve sustainable adjustment, but that it will remain in the euro area.  Furthermore, we 
assume that spillovers from the Greek turmoil to the rest of the euro area will continue to 
be contained, reflecting strong financial backstops and a firm commitment by European authorities to support the monetary union.  (See the box “Recent Developments and Prospects in Greece.”)  We also do not expect the turmoil in the Chinese stock market to weigh on overall activity.  (See the box “Chinese Equity Markets:  Recent Developments 
and Implications” in the Financial Developments section.)  Overall, growth abroa d 
should be underpinned by accommodative monetary policies, an improvement in global 
trade, depreciated currencies, and still-low oil prices. 
Nevertheless, the Greek crisis and the financial fragilities in China continue to 
present important risks.  In th e alternative scenario “Greek Exit with Sizable Spillovers” 
in the Risks and Uncertainty section, we explore the effects of a Greek exit from the euro 
area that leads to a severe recession in the region and generates large global spillovers.  In 
another al ternative scenario, “China Driven EME Slump with Stronger Dollar,” financial

Recent Developments and Prospects in Greece 
Since the previous Tealbook , Greece’s negotiations with its official-sector creditors have taken 
center stage .  Although a Greek exit from the euro area was an imminent possibility at times, the 
period ended on a more positive note, with the groundwork laid for a new three-year aid 
program and with bridge financing in place to service debt for one month.  However , Greece’s 
economic and financ ial situation has deteriorated dramatically, and questions about the resilience 
of the monetary union have arisen . Even so, broader euro-area financial markets have so far 
remained relatively insensitive to developments in Greece . 
After tense and unsuccessful attempts early in the intermeeting period to agree on program 
conditionality and debt restructuring, renewed negotiations over the Greek program in late June 
were derailed when Greek Prime Minister Tsipras unexpectedly called a referendum on the EU-
IMF proposals a nd urged Greek citizens to vote No. This call intensified tensions between 
Greece and its creditors and triggered an even more rapid flight of deposits from Greek banks 
(figure 1).  With the outlook for Greek banks growing increasingly precarious, the ECB suspended 
its earlier practice of accommodating deposit flight through increases in emergency liquidity 
assistance (ELA) to Greek banks; instead, it announced a freeze on the ELA ceiling.  As a result, an 
acute liquidity shortage loomed, forcing the Greek government to declare a bank holiday, limit 
deposit withdrawals to €60 per day, and restrict payments and transfers of funds abroad. Soon 
afterward, with its resources dwindling and its relationship with its creditors unravelling, Greece 
defaulted on a €1½ billion debt repayment to the IMF on June 30. 
Tensions escalated further in early July.  After the Greek referendum decisively rejected the EU-
IMF proposals, the Greek government continued pressing for more favorable loan terms.  In 
response, other European authorities hardened their position, threatening to withdraw financial 
support for Greece’s government and banks—which could trigger a Greek exit from the euro 
area if an agreement was not reached by July 12 .   
Greece and its creditors finally reached an agreement on July 13.  European authorities agreed to 
consider a three-year financial assistance program from the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) 
as well as further extensions of t he maturity of their loans (albeit without principal reductions 
and only after Greece complet es a review of its program) .  In exchange, t hey demanded Greek 
commitments that were far stricter than previously proposed. As a precondition to begin formal 
program negotiations, Greece pass ed significant increases in value-added taxes, cuts in pension 
benefits, and institutional reforms; it is also expected to reform its legal system in order to 
facilitate bank restructuring and property foreclosures .  Finally, Greece also agreed to ambitious 
fiscal objectives a nd to European oversight of its public administration and legislative process es. 
Based on Greece’s recent progress , European governments received domestic approval to begin 
formal negotiations on the new ESM program and arranged €7.2 billion in bridge financing, which 
will help cover the Greek government’s sizable debt service through mid-August and its arrears to 
the IMF (fig ure 2).  In addition, the ECB raised the ceiling on ELA to Greek banks fo r the first time 
in more than three weeks .  Many hurdles remain, however, and the political environment in 
Greece and the rest of the euro area makes co mpromise and implementation difficult.

 Notwithstanding these risks, financial markets have responded positively to the rapprochement 
between Greece and its creditors.  As shown in figure 3 , Greek 10-year sovereign bond spreads 
have plummeted since the Greek parliament endorsed a more conciliatory stance in mid-July .  
Spreads of other peripheral countries, which had risen only somewhat in response to earlier 
tensions, fell by much less .  
Greek economic activity has been severely disrupted in recent weeks .  Although Greek banks 
have reopened, they remain liquidity constrained and undercapitalized, and capital controls and 
transaction limits remain in place .  Households and businesses are largely operating on a cash 
basis, foreign trade and tourism have been severely curtailed, and even basic services have been 
hard to provide.  Although forecasting in such a situation is quite difficult, we judge that Greek 
output likely will contract at a double-digit rate this quarter and will be slow to recover 
thereafter.   Greek public debt may rise above 200 percent of GDP and is regarded by many 
(including the IMF) as unsustainable unless substantial debt relief, beyond the extension of 
maturities contemplated by European authorities, is provided. 
Our baseline scenario assumes that Greece remains in the euro area and that spillovers from 
Greek tensions to broader European financial markets remain contained, reflecting enhanced 
financial backstops and a firm commitment by European authorities to safeguard the monetary 
union.  That said, we expect Greece to have considerable difficulty restarting growth and fulfilling 
its commitments, with pronounced tensions flaring periodically.  Accordingly, a Greek exit that 
sparks broader financial market turmoil remains a significant risk.  The Risks and Uncertainty 
section examines that alternative scenario in more detail.

and economic conditions and consumer confidence in China deteriorate sharply, 
generating adverse spillovers to EMEs and a flight to quality that leads to an appreciation 
of the dollar.  Finally, the continued weakness in foreign growth in the second quarter 
reinforces our concern that the underlying momentum in global activity could be weaker 
than we thought. 
Quarterly foreign inflation turned positive in the second quarter as the effects of 
last year’s decline in oil prices waned.  The more recent and much smaller decline in oil 
prices should push inflation down again in the near term, but only temporarily.  We continue to expect inflation to reach central bank objectives of 2 percent in Canada and the United Kingdom by 2017 and to pick up but remain below the 2 percent goal in the 
euro area and Japan.  Inflation in the EMEs is expected to average about 3 percent over 
the forecast period. 
In response to the continued weakness of activity in their economies and still-low 
inflation rates, the central banks of Canada, Korea, and Sweden cut their policy rates over 
the intermeeting period.  The Swedish Riksbank expanded its asset purchase program as 
well.  China’s central bank also cut banks’ bench mark lending and deposit rates to 
support economic growth and the stock market. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
 Euro Area. Based on solid readings on retail sales, PMIs, economic 
sentiment, and manufacturing production, we estimate that GDP continued to 
expand 1½ percent in the second quarter.  We expect output to expand at a 
similar pace in the third quarter, as a pickup in growth in most euro-area 
economies is offset by a sharp contraction in Greece.  Thereafter, we expect 
euro-area growth to rise to about 2 pe rcent in 2016 and 2¼ percent in 2017, 
supported by ongoing monetary stimulus and easing credit conditions as well as by currency depreciation and lower oil prices.  This forecast is about 
¼ pe rcentage point lower in the third quarter of 2015 than in the June 
Tealbook, as the plunge in Greek activity will be even steeper than we 
previously thought, and about ¼ percentage point higher in 2016, reflecting 
support from lower energy prices and a depreciated euro.  Our projection 
assumes that current and prospective spillovers to other countrie s from 
developments in Greece remain limited, but much more dire outcomes 
are possible.

Inflation rebounded from negative 1½ percent in the first quarter to positive 
2½ pe rcent in the second quarter, reflecting the fading effects of last year’s 
fall in energy prices as well as a firming in core inflation.  We expect inflation 
to average about 1¼ percent during the second half of the year, somewhat 
lower than our June Tealbook forecast, owing to the recent decline in oil prices.  As the output gap narrows and oil prices stabilize, inflation is 
expected to rise to 1¾ percent by 2017. 
We continue to assume the ECB will purchase assets totaling about 
€1.2 trillion by September 2016 and keep its main policy rate near zero through the end of 2017. 
 Canada. We estimate that real GDP contracted again in the second quarter, 
falling ¼ pe rcent, a pace that is 1½ percentage points below the J une 
Tealbook projection. Energy exports were disrupted by wildfires and 
maintenance shutdowns.  Moreover, disappointing imports of machinery and 
equipment suggest that the adverse effects of lower oil prices on investment 
have been more protracted than we had thought. June manufacturing PMI 
edged up to expansionary territory for the first time since January, however, 
so as disruptions to the energy sector dissipate, we expect GDP growth to 
rebound to 2  percent this quarter. We see GD P growth reaching 2½ percent 
by 2016, supporte d by accommodative monetary policy, currency 
depreciation, and moderate U.S. growth, before edging down to a near-
potential pace of 2 percent by 2017 as the output gap closes. 
Inflation jumped to 2.5 percent in the second quarter, partly driven by the 
pass-through of currency depreciation to retail prices.  We expect that lower 
oil prices will bring inflation down to 1½ percent in the third quarter.  The waning influence of the decline in oil prices and narrowing output gap should 
bring inflation up to the Bank of Canada’s (BOC) 2 percent target by 
2017. Given the recent economic weakness, the BOC cut its policy rate by 
25 ba sis points to ½ percent in mid-July. With inflation remaining low, we 
expect the BOC to start raising its main policy rate in the third quarter of 
2016, one quarter later than in our previous projection. 
 Japan. We estimate that real GDP growth declined from 3.9 percent in the 
first quarter to only ½ percent in the second quarter, partly owing to a

normalization of inventory investment.  This slowdown is more pronounced 
than projected in the previous Tealbook, as recent data on exports and 
industrial production were surprisingly weak.  Nevertheless, business confidence rose to its highest level in more than a year and manufacturing 
firms plan to ramp up production, suggesting that the second-quarter softening was short-lived.  Accordingly, we see GDP growth picking up to 1½ percent in the current quarter and remaining near that pace through 2016 before a 
second hike in the consumption tax stalls the expansion in 2017.  Consumer 
prices appear to have rise n 1 percent in the second quarter, led by a rapid 
increase in food prices.  However, with oil prices declining, inflation should fall to ¼ percent in the current quarter.  Thereafter, as oil prices stabilize, we 
project that inflation (excluding the direct effect of the consumption tax hike) will edge up to ¾ percent in early 2016 and, as the output gap narrows and 
inflation expectations rise, will reach almost 1½ percent by the end of 2017. 
 United Kingdom. Strong incoming data such as on retail sales, industrial 
production, exports, and economic sentiment suggest that real GDP growth 
accelerated to 2½ percent in the second quarter from a modest 1½ percent rate 
in the first quarter.  We project that GDP growth will edge up to 2¾ percent in 2016, about ½ percentage point higher than previously projected, as the new fiscal budget calls for less consolidation in the coming years than the budget 
that was unveiled in March.  Growth then moves back down to 2½ percent in 
2017.  Consumer prices rose 1.1 percent in the second quarter, as retail energy prices stabilized.  We expect inflation to continue rising in coming quarters, albeit a touch more slowly than we wrote down in June on account of the 
recent fall in crude oil prices, and to reach the Bank of England’s (BOE) 
2 percent target by 2017. In response to the higher path for economic growth 
and despite the slightly lower rise in inflation in the near-term, we expect the 
BOE to normalize monetary policy a bit more rapidly than previously 
assumed following liftoff in the first quarter of 2016. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
 China .  Real GDP growth was volatile in the first half of the year, surging to 
7¾ pe rcent in the second quarter, 1¾ percentage points above our June 
Tealbook estimate, after falling to an unusually low pace of 5 percent in the

first quarter.1 Exports and industrial production rebounded sharply in the 
second quarter, but fixed-asset investment growth continued to moderate, led 
by a further slowing of real estate investment.  We expect growth to average 
7 percent in the second half of the year, a little stronger than the 6½ percent 
average in the first half, as exports continue to recover and recent monetary 
policy stimulus kicks in.  We expect GDP growth to edge down a bit further 
thereafter, to 6½ percent by 2017, in line with declining potential growth.  
Although the sharp fall in Chinese stock prices since mid-June has garnered significant attention, we do not expect the declines to weigh on activity.  
Chinese stock market movements have traditionally had little effect on the 
economy because the vast majority of Chinese do not own stocks and beca use 
equity financing accounts for a small share of overa ll financing in China’s 
bank-dominated economy. (For further details, see the box “Chinese Equity 
Markets:  Recent Developments and Implications” in the Financial 
Developments section.) 
Inflation picked up to a 2½ percent rate in the second quarter from negative 
½ pe rcent in the first quarter, as food and fuel prices rebounded and core 
inflation edged up, suggesting that the risk of deflation has likely subsided. We expect inflation to remain at about this level throughout the forecast 
period. 
 Other Emerging Asia. We now estimate that the region’s GDP growth 
stepped down from an already subdued 3½ percent pace in the first quarter to about 3 percent in the second, 1 percentage point lower than in the June 
Tealbook.  The revision is broad based across countries and reflects the 
weaker-than-expected tone of recent indicators, particularly exports.  In 
Korea , the downward revision to second-quarter growth also reflects our 
assessment that the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) will have a larger effect on the economy than initially envisioned. To support 
activity, the Bank of Korea cut its policy rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent 
and the government ratcheted up fiscal stimulus. Exports from the region 
improved late in the quarter, supporting our view that growth will move up in the second half of the year in response to stronger activity in China and in the

quarter- on-quarter growth rates based on the official data releases that report four-quarter changes.

advanced economies.  Growth should settle at about 4¼ percent thereafter. 
Inflation in the region rebounded from negative ¼ percent in the first quarter 
to 3 percent in the second, supported by the stabilization of energy prices after 
earlier declines.  We expect inflation to edge up to 3¼ percent in 2016 and 
2017. 
 Latin America. We estimate that Mexican real GDP growth stepped up from 
a meager 1½ percent in the first quarter to a still-subdued 2¼ percent in the 
second, ¼ pe rcentage point below our previous forecast.  Incoming data for 
the second quarter were mixed.  Although fixed investment was weak and 
exports fell through May, manufacturing output was up and private 
consumption appears to have continued to improve, supported by solid credit 
and job growth.  We expect the pace of growth to step up to 3 percent by the 
end of this year, thanks to a pickup in U.S. manufacturing output, and to 
remain at that pace through 2017.  After dipping to only ¼ percent in the first 
quarter, headline inflation rebounded to 2¾ percent in the second, reflecting 
the waning effects of earlier declines in energy prices and administered prices 
of telecommunications.  
In Brazil , recent indicators including  industrial production, retail sales, and 
consumer and business confidence continue to disappoint and suggest that 
the economy contracted sharply in the second quarter.  As a result, we now 
see GDP having fallen 4¼ percent last quarter, 1 percentage point more than 
the June Tealbook estimate. Despite the weak economy, the depreciation of 
the real and increases in administered prices have kept inflation elevated at a 
10¾ pe rcent annual rate in the second quarter.  To restrain inflation, the 
central bank has raised its policy rate 275 basis points since October 2014, and 
we expect more tightening in the near term.  Tighter monetary policy and the 
fading influence of increases in administered prices should bring inflation 
down to 5¾ percent by the end of this year and to 5½ percent by 2017. We 
expect growth to pick up to a still-sluggish 1½ percent pace next year and to 
2¼ pe rcent in 2017 as the authorities ease monetary policy and as global 
growth firms.

Financial Developments 
U.S. financial market conditions were buffeted by developments abroad over the 
intermeeting period but were li ttle changed outside of a somewhat stronger dollar on 
balance.  The expected path of policy rate s moved down a bit, re portedly reflecting in 
part the more-accommodative-than-expected path  for the federal funds rate in the June 
SEP and some weaker-than-expect ed data on economic activity.   
 Negotiations between the Greek government a nd its official creditors and, separately, 
a plunge in Chinese equity prices generated volatility in global financial markets at 
times.  (See the box on Greece in the intern ational section and the box on Chinese 
equity markets later in this section.)  
 The federal funds rate at the end of 2016 implied by OIS quotes decreased about 
10 basis points.  September remained the mo st likely time of liftoff in the Desk’s 
surveys of primary dealers and market participants, with the expected pace of 
normalization after liftoff little changed.   
 The nominal Treasury yield curve was nearly unchanged on net.  The TIPS-based 
measure of inflation compensation over the next five years moved lower amid a 
decline in oil prices.  
 The S&P 500 index ended the period up about 1 percent, while the VIX settled back 
to the lower end of its range  in recent years af ter rising in response to developments 
abroad.  
 Amid some monetary easing abroad, the br oad index of the do llar increased about 
2 percent over the period. 
 Financing conditions for households stayed generally accommodative, and businesses 
continued to raise substantia l funds amid robust M&A activity.  Moderate numbers of 
banks reportedly eased lending standards and experienced increased loan demand 
during the second quarter on balance.1 
 The broader municipal market was gene rally unaffected by the announcement that 
Puerto Rico might seek to restructure at least part of its debt  (see the box later in 
this section).

EFFECTS OF GREEK DEBT NEGOTIATIONS ON FINANCIAL MARKETS 
For most of the intermeeti ng period, market participants around the globe were 
focused on negotiations between the Greek gove rnment and its official creditors.  (See 
the box “Recent Developments and Prospect s in Greece” in the International Economic 
Developments and Outlook section.)  In contra st with the sizable ma rket reactions during 
negotiations between Greece and its  creditors in previous years, asset price movements 
outside of Greece were quite modest in recent weeks.  For example, although the Greek 
10-year sovereign spread to German government bonds soared more than 600 basis 
points at one point during the current epis ode, contemporaneous moves in Spanish and 
Italian spreads were muted.  In additi on, although flight-to-quality flows were 
occasionally evident in the yields and curre ncies of the United States and safe-haven 
AFEs, these moves were not especially shar p or of long duration.  Several factors may 
help explain this modest reaction, including s ubstantially reduced pr ivate-sector exposure 
to Greece, confidence that Eur opean authorities have the t ools and the willingness to stem 
the spread of financial market disruption, and investors’ belief that Greece would 
ultimately receive some form of additional financial assistance.2 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 
Amid the temporary volatility stemming from the developments in Greece and 
China, Federal Reserve communications and incoming economic data put some 
downward pressure on the implied path of po licy rates and nominal Treasury yields along 
the curve.  In particular, investors re portedly focused on participants’ downward 
revisions in the June SEP to the appropriate target range for the fede ral funds rate at the 
end of 2015 as suggesting that policy firming could commence later than previously 
expected.  In contrast, the release of the June FOMC meeting minutes and the Chair’s 
semiannual Monetary Policy Report  in July were interpreted by investors as largely 
consistent with earlier FOMC communications  and elicited little reaction in financial 
markets.  Economic data releases over the intermeeting period were somewhat weaker 
than expected, on net, with the path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes 
shifting down noticeably after the release of the employment situation report and retail 
2 Three-fourths of Greek debt is currently held by official creditors.  In particular, U.S. prime 
money funds do not hold any Greek debt, and U.S. banks have a negligible direct exposure to Greek debt.

sales data for June.  All tol d, over the intermeeting period, th e federal funds rate implied 
by OIS quotes at the end of 2016 and the end of 2017 declined about 10 basis points.   
According to the Desk’s surveys of dealer s and market participants, a majority of 
respondents to both surveys c ontinued to view the Septem ber 2015 meeting as the most 
likely date of liftoff, with little change to the expected pace of ti ghtening following liftoff 
relative to the June surveys.   Although the median respondents now expect some or all 
securities reinvestments to cease a bit later than the six- to seven-month post-liftoff 
horizon reported in the Desk’s June surv eys, they continued to anticipate that 
reinvestments will most likely be phased out when the time comes. 
Swings in risk sentiment were evident in longer-term nominal Treasury yields.  
The 10-year yield drifted up notably early in the intermeeting period on optimism over 
the Greek debt negotiations, then subsequently  declined, at one point  sliding as much as 
30 basis points over several days amid safe-hav en flows before retracing much of this 
decline.  On net, both shor ter- and longer-term nominal Tr easury yields were nearly 
unchanged.  The 5-year measure of inflati on compensation based on TIPS fell 15 basis 
points, likely reflecting a notable decline in oil prices, while 5-to-10-year inflation 
compensation was about unchanged.  Liquidity  conditions in fixed-income markets 
remained stable over the intermeeting period.3 
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS 
Swings in risk sentiment were also evid ent in U.S. corporate asset markets at 
times, and broad U.S. equity price indexes e nded the period up about 1 percent on net.  
Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 i ndex at the one-month horizon—the VIX— 
increased for a time before falling back to the lower end of its range over recent years.  
Spreads of yields on 10-year triple-B-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities were  also volatile but ende d the period slightly 
wider on net.  Overall, spreads on triple-B -rated bonds remained slightly above their 
historical median levels, wh ile those on speculative-grade bonds stayed somewhat below 
their historical median.  
3 Since the June FOMC meeting, the Treasury De partment has auctioned $148 billion of Treasury 
nominal fixed-coupon securities, $7 billion of TIPS, and $13 billion of two-year Floating Rate Notes.

Based on reports for about 20 percent of  the firms in the S&P 500 index and 
equity analysts’ forecasts for the rest, earnings  per share are projecte d to have declined 
somewhat last quarter.  However, the index of  year-ahead revisions to analysts’ earnings 
forecasts for all firms in the S&P 500 index—which was deeply negative earlier in the 
year—stayed close to zero in mid-June. 
OTHER FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
The U.K. 10-year bond yield rose sligh tly, supported in part by stronger-than-
expected macroeconomic data and a shift up in the path of expected future policy rates.  
In contrast, comparable benchmark yields d eclined in most other AFEs, weighed down to 
varying degrees by weaker-than-expected m acroeconomic data and monetary easing.   
The central banks of Canada, Norway, and Sweden all lowered policy rates, and 
Sweden’s Riksbank also increased the size of  its QE program.  In addition, the Swiss 
National Bank (SNB) appears to have intervened to counter upward pressure on the 
Swiss franc during the period, with Chairman Jo rdan of the SNB stating in a speech that 
the franc was significantly overvalued.  In c ontrast, comments by the Bank of England’s 
Governor Carney led market participants to exp ect an earlier initiation of rate hikes in the 
United Kingdom. 
Partly because of the generally more accommodative actions of foreign central 
banks, the broad index of the U.S. dollar e nded the period about 2 percent higher, with 
the dollar appreciating 3½ percent, on average, against AFE currencies.  The dollar strengthened about 5 percent ag ainst the Canadian dollar and Swedish krona, while it was 
only slightly stronger against the British pound, consistent with the relative movements in 
policy expectations.  In add ition, the dollar gained about 2½ percent against the euro, as 
market participants’ focus on differentials  between U.S. and euro-area policy rate 
expectations appeared to reem erge after concerns about Gree ce had lessened.  The dollar 
appreciated only ½ percent against the yen.   
AFE equity prices rose in all countrie s but Canada, supported to varying degrees 
by diminished concerns about Greece, st ronger macroeconomic data in the United 
Kingdom and the euro area, and actual or ex pected monetary accommodation elsewhere.  
Headline stock indexes in the euro ar ea increased more than 5 percent.

By contrast, stock prices in China de clined steeply duri ng the period.  After 
having risen 150 percent between mid-2014 and its peak on June 12, the Shanghai 
Composite index tumbled more than 30 percen t.  The index subsequently retraced some 
of that decline and ended the period about 20 percent lower than its mid-June peak.  (See 
the box “Chinese Equity Markets:  Recen t Developments and Implications.”)  
Developments in China also appeared to cont ribute to a net decline over the intermeeting 
period of almost 4 percent in Hong Kong equ ity prices, but spillovers to other markets 
were limited. 
Asset prices in other EMEs exhibited no clear signs of distress in response to the 
events in Greece, the plunge in Chinese e quity markets, or the approaching policy 
firming in both the United States and the Un ited Kingdom.  EMBI spreads over Treasury 
securities edged lower, and the performance of stock indexes across EMEs was mixed.  
Notably, stocks in some of the countries seen as vulnerable during th e taper tantrum, such 
as India, South Africa, and Turkey, ended th e period up between 2 and 6 percent.  Most 
emerging market currencies outperformed AF E currencies, with the dollar firming only 
about 1½ percent, on average, against the EME currencies.  
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE 
Meanwhile, financing conditions for U. S. nonfinancial businesses remained 
accommodative, particularly for the largest corporations.  Corporate bond issuance was 
brisk in June for both investment- and speculative-grade firms, moderating somewhat 
from its torrid pace in May.  Borrowers conti nued to report planning to use most of their 
proceeds to refinance existing debt and f und M&A activity rather than incremental 
capital investment.  Early indications suggest that investment-grade bond issuance stayed 
strong in the first few weeks of July, wh ile high-yield issuance slowed notably, 
reportedly reflecting in part the heightened market volatility. 
Strong growth of C&I loans on banks’ books persisted in June, and the SLOOS 
continued to indicate that demand from  large firms for C&I loans strengthened, 
particularly reflecting the need to fina nce M&A activity.  In addition, although banks’ 
lending standards for C&I loans have reporte dly changed relatively little in recent 
quarters, they stand somewhat easier than the midpoint of their range over the past 
10 years.  Institutional leveraged loan issuan ce picked up noticeably in the second quarter 
relative to earlier in the year, as tighter loan spreads supported refinancing.  Financing

Chinese Equity Markets: Recent Developments and Implications 
After an 11month rally, during which the Shanghai composite index rose roughly 
150 percent, Chinese equity prices have fallen more than 20 percent since midJune 
(figure 1). Spillovers to other markets from this plunge in Chinese stock prices have been 
limited: While Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has fallen 9 percent since midJune and 
copper prices have declined 7 percent over the same period, most other markets seemed 
largely unaffected. Nonetheless, the sharp decline of Chinese equities has raised 
concerns about financial stability and potential disruptions to the real economy. 
What explains the recent runup and subsequent correction? On the upswing, retail 
investors, who account for the vast majority of the trading of Chinese equities, had 
reportedly been shifting their savings away from Chinese property markets and bank 
deposits amid falling house prices and growing expectations of further monetary easing 
in China. In addition, margin financing, which was officially authorized in 2010, increased 
rapidly as retail investors sought to magnify their equity gains by taking on leverage as 
the market kept rising (figure 2). These factors led to over stretched valuations for most 
Chinese stocks; in midJune, P/E ratios of companies listed in the Shanghai exchange 
averaged 26, whereas those of companies listed in the ChiNext—China’s equivalent of 
Nasdaq—reached 146. 
With bubble like conditions, the market was ripe for a correction. Several factors may 
have triggered or exacerbated the selloff, including attempts by the Chinese authorities 
to curb margin lending, the selling of stocks by investors to free up requisite funds to 
subscribe to a growing volume of IPOs this year, and the decision by MSCI—a provider of 
benchmark stock indexes—to delay the inclusion of China’s mainland shares in its 
emerging markets indexes. As levered trades unwound, falling stock prices triggered 
margin calls, which resulted in further selling of stocks. 
Chinese authorities have undertaken aggressive measures to try to stem the selloff. 
These actions include relaxing margin requirements, freezing IPOs temporarily, banning 
the sale of stocks by large shareholders, and creating a fund to be used to purchase 
shares of the largest companies. Moreover, recently the China Securities Regulatory 
Commission has allowed companies to voluntarily suspend trading of their stocks to 
prevent further price declines. In the first week of July, nearly half of the stocks listed on 
mainland exchanges had voluntarily suspended trading, but most have since resumed. 
Altogether, these measures appear to have helped stabilize stock markets. 
We expect the recent stock market correction to have only a limited effect on China’s 
economic growth and, in turn, negligible spillovers to the United States and the global 
economy. First, notwithstanding its recent losses, the Shanghai composite index is still 
up 97 percent since mid2014. Second, the correlation between economic activity and 
stock prices in China is generally weak. In 2006 and 2007, Chinese stock prices increased 
425 percent, before reversing almost three quarters of those gains in 2008, but the 
economic impact of this decline is thought to have been limited. Chinese households 
hold only a small share of their wealth in stocks and the vast majority of households own 
no stocks at all; indeed, the runup in stock prices from mid2014 to mid2015 did not 
appear to boost household consumption. Similarly, China’s market capitalization as a

 share of GDP is also small relative  to other countries  (figure 3).1  We also do not expect 
the decline in equity markets to weaken  investment,  as most investment  is financed  by 
bank lending; in 2014, for example,  equity financing  constituted  only about 2½ percent of 
total net financing.   Third, stock markets compose a small part  of China’s financial system.  
Although  some Chinese  securities  firms and mutual funds have experienced  losses on 
their equity holdings, their  assets make up a small portion of  total financial system assets.  
Moreover,  there is little evidence  that Chinese banks have meaningful  exposure  to stock 
markets.  Finally,  the official sector has the resources  to provide  liquidity assistance to 
financial institutions,  if needed.   
We cannot rule out the possibility,  however,  that market volatility  triggers serious 
economic  deterioration  in China.  One concern is that, unlike the 2006–07  episode,  the 
recent run‐up was largely fueled by leverage, reportedly  including  non‐traditional  forms 
of leverage  such as consumer  loans and trusts, which are less regulated  and less 
transparent than  the traditional  margin financing  provided  by securities  trading firms.  
The use of leverage  can magnify  losses and destabilize markets  when it is unwound  in a 
disorderly fashion.   Of greater  concern is the possibility  that the unwinding  of leverage  
produces  wider and  unforeseen reverberations  in the shadow banking system, resulting  
in a financial  crisis and a sharp slowdown  in growth.  Such a crisis may be more likely 
against the background  of the ongoing strains in property  and credit markets, a factor  
that may have motivated  the authorities’  recent aggressive  response.   And such a crisis—
which is explored  in more detail in the Risks and Uncertainty  section of this Tealbook—
could have adverse spillovers  t0 the U.S. economy.

conditions for small businesses improved further,  with loan originations maintaining their 
gradual upward trend.    
Financing for commercial real estate ( CRE) remained broadly available, including 
for large- and small-sized loans and for the full range of property types.  CRE property 
prices rose at a fast pace  through April, supported in pa rt by rising rents, declining 
vacancy rates, and accommodative financing conditions.  CRE loans on banks’ books 
expanded through June; according to the SLOOS, moderate numbers of banks again 
reported stronger demand for CRE loans in the second quarter, wh ile few reported any 
further easing in lending st andards.  CMBS issuance stayed robust, and the spread 
between investment-grade CMBS and the sw ap rate was little changed, on net, an 
indication that strong issuance was met with investor demand.   
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets were stable despite the 
announcement that Puerto Rico might seek to restructure at least part of  its debt.  (See the 
box “Assessing the Risks of a Puerto Rico De fault for the Broader Municipal Market.”)  
The pace of issuance of long-te rm municipal bonds remained robust in June, as issuers 
reportedly continued to take advantage of lo w yields to refinance existing debt.  In 
addition, spreads of yields on 20-year general obligation municipal bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities changed little.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE 
Residential mortgage credit remained  accessible for many consumers, although 
individuals with less desirable underwriting characteristics, such as low credit scores, undocumented income, or high debt-to-income ra tios, still faced diffi culties in obtaining 
loans.  Although banks reported in the SL OOS that their lending standards for 
GSE-eligible and government-insured mortga ges were little changed in the second 
quarter, they also reported th at these standards are less tight  than they were a few years 
ago.  Standards for other types of residentia l real estate loans re portedly stayed quite 
tight.   
Meanwhile, interest rates on 30-year fixe d-rate mortgages to highly qualified 
borrowers were little changed at around 4 per cent, on net, in line with MBS yields and 
other longer-term interest rates.

Assessing the Risks of a Puerto Rico Default for 
the Broader Municipal Market 
The risk that Puerto Rico (PR) will be unable to repay its lenders has grown notably in recent 
weeks, as i ts government stated in an interview with the New York Times published on June 
29, that its debt (estimated at $76 billion) is not payable and significant concessions from its 
creditors would be necessary.1 Subsequently , yields and credit default swap ( CDS) spreads on 
PR general obligation bonds both spiked . However, CDS spreads for the broad municipal 
bond market (as indicated by the MCDX index) were little changed, suggesting that the events 
in PR have left, thus far, no material imprint on the overall market (figure 1) . Even so, the risk 
remains that a PR default could increase borrowing costs and reduce funding for other 
municipal bond issuers, possibly through its adverse effects on investors or muni bond 
insurers. Here we assess the risk of these possible spillovers using available data on tax-
exempt mutual funds , money market funds (MMFs), and monoline insurers. 
Tax-exempt mutual funds are some of the main investors in PR debt . However, the likelihood 
that the tax-exempt mutual fund industry could experience significant and widespread strains 
due to PR default appears low, since PR bonds represent a small percentage of total holdings 
for the majority of exposed funds. The fund family with the largest PR exposure holds about 
$5 billion at market value or 20 percent of their muni investments i n PR ( figure 2). While this 
fund family is vu lnerable to extreme investor outflows and may have to sell securities issued 
by other states to satisfy sudden redemptions, the potential price impact exerted by forced 
sales is likely limited and temporary, as this fund family holds less than 1 percent of the total 
bonds outstanding of other more highly indebted U.S. states (such as California , New York, 
and New Jersey).2 
SEC filings indicate that MMFs hold a very small amount of PR’s debt—$21 million as of the 
end of June, down from $1.1 billion in December 2013.  This exposure is particularly small when 
compared with the $3 trilli on in MMFs’ assets under management . In addition, all MMF 
holdings of PR obligations are pre-refunded (that is, backed by Treasury securities).  Hence, 
the direct risk for MMFs of a PR default is negligible. 
Although detailed data on direct exposure of other investors to PR debt are not available, 
market contacts estimate that the majority of the outstanding debt is held by hedge funds, 
mutual funds, and retail investors, with a large share of retail investors accounted for by 
Puerto Rican residents and banks. The significant exposure of local investors to PR debt is 
likely to exert additional strains on the local economy in the event of a default. 
As nearly 25 percent of PR debt is insured, a PR default could in principle imperil the ability of 
monoline bo nd insurers to conduct new business.  However, several indicators suggest that 
1 See Michael Corkery and Mary Williams Walsh (2015), “In Puerto Rico, Debt Is Called ‘Not Payable,’ ” 
New York Times, June 29 (also available online at www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/business/dealbook/puerto-
ricos-governor-says-islands-debts-are-not-payable.html?_r=0 ). 
2 Preliminary data suggest that, while this fund family has experienced significant outflows in recent 
weeks, aggregate redemptions in th e overall tax-exempt muni fund industry have been s mall.

 these risks are limited.  While a few bond insurers have significant exposure to PR debt as a 
percentage of their qualified statutory capital, upon default, financial guarantors are obligated 
to make principal and interest payments only as they come due, which would be over a period 
of many years.  Staff estimates suggest that if PR defaults, the financial guarantors with the 
largest near-term exposure are expect ed to pay at most 25 percent of their statutory capital 
within the next year (figure 3) .  Furthermore, the majority of monolines with exposure to PR 
appear to have stopped writing new financial guarantees on municipal bonds in recent years, 
which further limits potential knock-on effects on the broader municipal bond market.3 
Although no state or local issuer is as embattled as Puerto Rico, a default may adversely affect 
the broad municipal bond market for other reasons.  In particular, a default by PR may remind 
investors that repayment by the more fiscally troubled municipalities poses risks.  This 
realization could prompt a temporary outflow from muni funds and briefly reduce the ability 
of states and municipalities to issue new debt.  In addition, a PR default may lead investors to 
reassess the recovery rate of bondholders’ claims against defaulting states, which could 
increase future borrowing costs for local governments.  
 
                                                 
3 While data on individual entities writing CDS contracts on PR debt are not available , aggregate 
estimates suggest that no more than $600 million gross notional of CDS is linked to a PR default.

Outstanding balances of auto and student loans kept expanding at a robust pace 
through May, and consumers appeared to rely on  credit to finance vehicle purchases more 
than they did a year ago.  The gradual reco very in revolving credit that started in early 
2014 appeared to stay broadly on track.  Banks indicated in the SLOOS that the level of 
their lending standards for credit card loans has eased somewhat relative to a few years 
ago.  Nevertheless, a range of indicators sugge st that standards and terms of credit card 
loans likely remain tight, part icularly for subprime borrowers. 
Amid robust issuance in the second quarter,  spreads in the consumer ABS market 
widened a bit toward the upper edge of their na rrow range seen after the financial crisis.  
Demand for ABS appeared to remain solid, with deals reporte dly oversubscribed.  
OTHER BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY 
Bank-intermediated credit co ntinued to expand during the second quarter.  The 
rapid rise in banks’ Treasur y holdings largely ceased, as  most large banks are now 
compliant with the liquidity coverage ratio.  During the first half of the intermeeting 
period, bank stock prices declin ed as risk sentiment deterior ated, but they subsequently 
recovered with the broader market.  Banks’ stock prices were further supported by 
generally positive earnings reports; bank profitability was reported to have improved in 
the second quarter, primarily as a result of somewhat higher net in terest margins that 
resulted from loan growth and expense containment.4 
M2 expanded at a moderate pace in June amid a continuation of recent trends in 
the growth of its major individual component s, and liquid deposits as a share of M2 
stayed at an all-time high.   
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS 
Short-term funding markets remained stable, and the Federal Reserve’s RRP 
testing operations continued to provid e a soft floor on money market rates.5  The Desk 
4 The Federal Reserve Board’s approval of the final rule on risk-based capital surcharges 
applicable to U.S. global systemically important banks on July 20 induced no apparent reaction in banks’ 
equity prices. 
5 The effective federal funds rate averaged 13 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averag ing 4 basis points.  The announcement that the calculation of the 
effective federal funds rate would change next year to a volume-weighted median in conjunction with the

auctioned two term RRPs covering June qua rter-end, each with an offered amount of 
$100 billion and a maximum bid rate of 8 basis points.  Both operations were slightly 
oversubscribed, with awards allocated at 7 basi s points.  Similar to previous quarter-ends, 
counterparties generally substituted from ON RRP into term RRP, with limited apparent 
substitution out of private term reverse repo positions into term RRP.  Moreover, at 
$393 billion, total take -up of term and ON RRPs on June  30, as well as the pattern of 
take-up at the counterpart y level, was consistent with recent quarter-ends.6 
Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $36 billion of agency MBS 
under the reinvestment program and rolled  $0.1 billion in expected settlements. 
6 The monetary base contracted in June because of temporary factors, including the greater take-up 
at the Federal Reserve’s RRP operations over quart er-end and an increase in the Treasury’s General 
Account.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first two 
scenarios illustrate risks associated with the possibility that labor productivity could turn 
out weaker than in the staff projection. In both of these scenarios, the economy suffers an 
adverse shock to aggregate supply.  In the first, aggregate demand moves down in line with aggregate supply, while in the second, aggregate demand continues along its 
baseline trajectory, resulting in a stronger labor market and tighter resource utilization.  
In the third scenario, economic activity is significantly stronger than in the baseline and 
inflation turns out to be more sensitive to cyclical pressures.  In the fourth scenario, we 
explore the risk that losses within the financial sector could weaken economic activity more materially if their effects were amplified by high leverage in the financial system.  
In the fifth scenario, a disorderly exit of Greece from the euro-area monetary union 
causes Europe to plunge into recession with substantial adverse effects on the global 
economy.  In the final scenario, a deterioration of financial conditions and confidence in 
China triggers spillovers to other emerging markets and a flight to quality that appreciates the dollar. 
We generate the first and second scenarios using the FRB/US model, while the 
third uses the EDO model.  The fourth scenario uses a model similar in spirit to EDO but 
explicitly models the behavior of leveraged financial intermediaries.  The final two 
scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once the federal funds 
rate has risen above its current target range, its movements are governed as in the 
baseline forecast by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The date of liftoff in 
each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended to be broadly consistent with 
the guidance provided in the Committee’s recent statements.
1 In all cases, we assume 
that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations. One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

Weaker Labor Productivity, Slow er Output Growth 
Labor productivity growth has been quite weak over the past few years. In the 
baseline, we assume that productivity growth rebounds to a pace in line with its average 
over the past 10 years.  Here we present two alternative scenarios in which productivity 
growth is weaker than in the baseline (though still somewhat stronger than the mea ger 
½ percent growth over the past four years).  Specifically, in both we assume that labor 
productivity growth is 50 basis points below baseline in 2016 and 2017.  However, the 
weakness occurs in two different environments, with differing policy implications. 
In the first scenario, we assume a slowdown in structural productivity growth that, 
through permanent income effects, also reduces spending and, hence, actual output 
growth, leaving the output gap and unemployment rate broadly unchanged relative to the 
baseline.  The weakness in structural productivity raises core inflation around 15 basis 
points relative to baseline in 2016 and 2017; this increase is because weaker productivity 
growth implies a faster rise in unit labor costs, which has a direct role in determining 
inflation in the FRB/US model.2 The prescription for policy is therefore largely 
unchanged from the baseline and, in fa ct, is marginally tighter in response to the 
higher inflation. 
Weaker Labor Productivity, Strong er Labor Market 
In the second scenario illustrating risks to the labor productivity forecast, the 
slow er growth in output per hour again reflects weakness on the supply side of the 
economy, but this time we assume that household and business spending continues along 
its baseline trajectory.  In effect, the adverse aggregate supply shock is counterbalanced 
by a favorable aggregate demand shock.  As a result, actual output growth is broadly 
unchanged compared with the baseline, but employment grows more rapidly and the 
unemployment rate falls more steeply.  With a more rapid take-up of slack than in the 
first scenario, inflation is higher still.  
In this scenario, the output gap closes in 2016 and moves up to 1 percent in 2017, 
about 1 percentage point above the baseline.  With resource utilization noticeably tighter 
2 The staff’s judgmental appara tus does not have a direct role for unit labor costs in determining 
inflation. As such, under the staff’s judgmental apparatus the lower productivity would have little effect on 
price inflation but would instead lower wage inflation. The resulting prescription for monetary policy in 
this scenario using the judgmental apparatus would be even closer to the baseline.

and inflation higher, the policy prescription is for a markedly steeper funds rate path, and 
the policy rate reaches 4¼ percent by the end of 2019.   
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
Labor market indicators continue to be relatively strong:  Overall payrolls rose an 
average of 210,000 per month over the first half of the year, for example, and the 
unemployment rate declined 0.3 percentage point despite measured GDP growth 
averaging only 1 percent at an annual rate.  One plausible interpretation is that the 
underlying state of the economy is, in fact, considerably more robust than assumed in the 
baseline.  In this scenario, households’ and businesses’ confidence about the underlying 
strength of the economy leads them to be more willing to spend and hire than in the 
baseline, supporting a much faster economic expansion. We also assume that inflation is 
more sensitive to reductions in resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO model, consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE models.
3 
As a result, real GDP growth averages about 3¼ percent in the second half of 
2015 and 3¾ percent in 2016, compared with 2 percent and 2¼ percent, re spectively, in 
the baseline.  The unemployment rate falls to near ly 4¼ percent early in 2017 before 
rising back slowly toward the natural rate.  With resource utilization tighter and the 
Phillips curve steeper, inflation rises faster than in the baseline, reaching 2¼ percent by the end of 2017.
4 The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the baseline, reaching 
5 percent by the end of 2019.  Given enough time, tighter monetary policy would 
eventually return output to a sustainable trajectory a nd bring inflation back to 2 percent. 
Adverse Credit Shock with High Leverage 
The most recent QS Assessment of Financial Stability notes that lenders ’ risk 
appetite for nonfinancial business sector credit remains elevated, presumably spurred, in part, by “reach for yield” in the context of the prolonged period of low interest rates.  
Although the staff’s baseline outlook does not envisage a marked deterioration in credit 
3 We make inflation more sensitive to slack by reducing the adjustment cost parameters for prices 
and wages in EDO. In particular, we use values that are two standard deviations below the EDO point 
estimates of these two parameters. 
4 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the smaller adjustment costs for wages and 
prices in this scenario. Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation would have 
peaked at 2 percent.

performance, this alternative scenario assumes that a large fraction of that risky credit

The model used to generate this scenario includes a lever aged financial sector 
with sizable credit risk exposure that serves as an important amplification mechani sm.  
In particular, higher leverage leaves the system more vulnerable to adverse shocks that 
reduce the net worth of financial firms.  In the aftermath of an adverse shock to financial

drag on economic activity.5 
We suppose that effective leverage in the financial system moves by early next 
year to a level as high as that observed pre-crisis. Losses at financial institutions are then 
assumed to spike significantly.  As a result, real GDP contracts in 2016 and the unemployment rate climbs back to almost 6¼ pe rcent.
6 The tightening of policy called 
for in the baseline by the inertial Taylor rule in late 2015 is halted, and the federal funds 
rate hovers around ½ percent in 2016 and early 2017 until economic conditions improve.  Inflation in the scenario moves little from the baseline in part because the model assumes a flat Phillips curve, but also because the deteriorat ion of banks’ balance sheets leads to a 
reduction in investment, which reduces the marginal productivity of labor and so limits the decline in marginal cost.  
Greek Exit with Sizable Spillovers 
Despite recent actions by the Greek government and its official-sector creditors 
laying the groundwork for a new three- year aid program, Greece’s continued membership 
in the euro area is far from assured.  In particular, given substantial political uncertainty within Greece, dire economic conditions, and the unpopularity of the austerity measures, 
there is some risk that negotiations with creditors over the new bailout may break down completely; alternatively, even if a new bailout is agreed upon, there is risk that the 
Greek government may fail to adhere to its terms, leading the European authorities to 
5 This scenario is conditioned on the financial system being fairly highly leveraged: Given the 
currently s trong capital position of the banking sector, the scenario might best be thought of as reflecting 
risks e manating from the nonbank financial sector, where leverage is challenging to comprehensively 
measure in real time. 
6 In contrast, the same adverse shock without the additional leverage would cause unemployment 
in the model to reach only 5¾ percent. The notion that lower leverage implies less amplification of the 
macroeconomic effects of losses within the financial system was also discussed in simulations of a related 
DSGE model in the box “CCAR/DFAST Trends” in the April QS Assessment of Financial Stability, 
pages 2628.

withdraw financial support.  While we think that the firewalls erected during the past few 
years would keep spillovers from a possible Greek exit from the euro area largely 
contained, this scenario considers a more adverse outcome in which a Greek exit causes 
both a severe recession in the euro area and broader financial market turmoil. 
Specifically, our scenario assumes that euro-area real GDP falls about 4 percent 
relative to the baseline by early 2017 as peripheral sovereign bond spreads rise sharply 
above baseline and euro-area confidence tumbles.  These developments have substantial 
adverse spillovers to the United States.  U.S. corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise 
about 50 basis points, while flight- to-safety flows help push the trade-weighted dollar up 
nearly 7 percent.7 
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  U.S. domestic demand also declines relative to the baseline as a result of tighter credit conditions, and U.S. real GDP expands only 1½ percent in 2016.  Lower U.S. output and lower import price inflation slow U.S. core inflation to 1 percent in 2016, about ½ percentage point below baseline.  The inertial Taylor rule prescribes a 
considerably shallower path for the federal funds rate than in the baseline. 
China -Driven EME Slump with Stronger Dollar 
China’s economy faces important financial -sector vulnerabilities, as suggested by 
its weakened property market, high credit- to-GDP ratio, and, most recently, the plunge in 
its stock market following its earlier run-up.  Our baseline projection assumes that the 
stock market correction has little effect on the Chinese economy and financial system.  
But in this scenario, we assume that a further plunge in equity prices interacts with other weaknesses in the financial system to trigger a more generalized crisis and recession.  
Specifically, China’s GDP falls about 7 percent below baseline by the end of next year, 
and there are marked spillovers to other EMEs that reduce their GDP about 3½ percent. 
In addition, considerable flight- to-quality flows into dollar-denominated assets contribute 
to an appreciation of the broad real dollar of 8 percent. 
7 The adverse spillovers from a Greek exit in this scenario are smaller than those featured in the 
June 2015 Tealbook scenario “Greek Exit with Severe Spillovers.” The surprising resilience displayed by 
financial markets in recent weeks even as tensions between Greece and its creditors mounted has given 
us a bit more confidence that a Greek exit would not generate a 2008-style global financial crisis. That 
said, the possibility that more severe spillovers could ensue following Greek exit along the lines 
considered in the June Tealbook, or even worse should not be entirely discounted.

The weaker foreign economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar cause 
U.S. real net exports to fall relative to baseline.  As a result, U.S. real GDP growth slows 
to only 1¼ percent at an annual rate in 2016, and the unemployment rate increases to 
5½ percent, about ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation declines to slightly less than 1 percent in 2016 as a result of both the dollar’s appreciation 
and lower resource utilization.  As a result, the federal funds rate rises more gradually going forward.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
