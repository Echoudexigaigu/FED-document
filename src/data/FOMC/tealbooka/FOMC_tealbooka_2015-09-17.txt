Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook   
The incoming information on real activity has been stronger, on net, than we 
expected in the July Tealbook.  Real GDP is  now estimated to have increased at an 
annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of the year , 1 percentage point faster than in our 
July projection, and we continue to expect th at aggregate output will rise at a 2 percent 
pace in the second half.  Moreover, we view  labor market conditions as having improved 
by more than we anticipated:  The unempl oyment rate moved down to 5.1 percent in 
August, 0.2 percentage point below our previous  projection and equal to our estimate of 
its natural rate.  Payroll gain s are reported to have averag ed 220,000 per month from June 
through August. 
In contrast, the key background factors shaping our medium-term forecast have 
become somewhat less supportive of economic  growth since the time of the July 
Tealbook, as equity prices have declined, the dollar has appreciated further, and prospects 
for foreign economic growth have weakened.  Accordingly, real GDP is now projected to 
increase 2 percent in both 2016 and 2017 and then ease to a 1¾ percent pace in 2018, 
nearly ¼ percentage point lower per year, on average, than in the previous Tealbook.  By 
the end of 2017, the slower projected pace of output growth unwinds the upward surprise 
to GDP growth in the first half of 2015.  
Even with the upward revision to GDP growth  in the first half of this year, the 
unemployment rate has moved down more than  could be explained by our usual Okun’s 
law relationship given the supply assumptions that we had in place in the July 
Tealbook.  Accordingly, we made several adju stments to allow a little greater downward 
tilt in our projection for the unemployment rate .  In particular, we further degraded our 
assumptions about potential output growth a nd prevented our forecast of GDP growth 
from weakening over the medium term as much as the deterioration of the key 
background factors otherwise would have indi cated.  As a result, we now project the 
unemployment rate will fall more in line wi th the improvement in the GDP gap over the 
next few years, reaching 4.8 percent by the end of 2017, 0.3 percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate.  At that time, act ual GDP is expected to exceed its potential 
by ¾ percent.  By contrast, we had previously expected output to equa l its potential in the 
final quarter of 2017.

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  most recently published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections,  or SEP, following  the 
June FOMC meeting.   The table  below compares  the staff’s current economic  projection with  the 
one we presented  in the June Tealbook.  
Since the June  projection,  we have revised up  our forecast for real GDP growth this year,  as 
stronger‐than‐expected  data for the first  half of the year more than offsets our slightly weaker 
projection  for the second half.  Our forecast  of real GDP growth for  2016 through 2018 is a little 
slower than in June, mostly because our  projected  path for the foreign  exchange  value of the 
dollar is higher and the path for equity  prices is lower.  We  also have reduced  somewhat  our 
trajectory  for potential  GDP over the  medium term.  Altogether,  these revisions  leave our 
projection  for the GDP gap over the projection  period stronger than in the June forecast.  The 
unemployment  rate has declined  more than we expec ted in June and is projected  to average  
5.0 percent  in the fourth quarter  of this year.  The unemployment  rate is forecast to gradually  
decline to 4.7 percent at the end  of 2018, below  the staff’s estimate  of its natural rate—which is  a 
bit lower than  in the June forecast.   
The staff’s projection  for headline  PCE inflation has been revised down  in the second half of this 
year, largely  reflecting  declines in crude oil prices that are expected  to pass through to consumer  
energy prices;  core PCE inflation is expected  to be a little softer than in the June projection,  as the 
prices of core imported  goods are anticipated  to decline  at a faster  pace than  in June with the 
further appreciation  of the dollar.  Given  our assumptions  that longer‐run inflation expectations

 will remain  stable over the  medium term, the declines in energy prices  will be transitory,  and core 
import prices will start to rise by the middle of next year, our  forecasts  for headline  and core 
inflation in 2016 through 2018 are little changed.  We  continue  to project  that inflation will run 
somewhat  below the Committee’s  2 percent objective  through 2018. 
We maintained  our assumption  that the federal funds rate will lift  off from its effective  lower 
bound in the third quarter of this year, but we  adjusted  down our assumptions  about long‐run 
equilibrium  interest rates.   Specifically,  we lowered our assumed  longer‐run no minal value of the 
federal funds  rate ¼ percentage point,  to 3¼ percent.   Even with the downward  revision to our  
assumption  for longer ‐run equilibrium  interest rates, the  stronger  GDP gap in the current forecast, 
along with an inflation projection  that is little changed, leaves  the projected  path for the federal 
funds rate a little above the one  in the June forecast—around  0.2 percentage point higher  at the 
end of next year and  in 2018. 
Because FOMC participants  are providing  additional  information  about their  expectations  of the 
economic  conditions  that will exist at the time  they anticipate  it will first beco me appropriate to 
increase the  target range for the federal  funds rate, we include the  table below providing  quarterly  
information  from the staff projection.   In the third quarter of  this year—the quarter  when our  
baseline projection  assumes  liftoff of the federal funds  rate will occur—we  forecast the 
unemployment  rate to average 5.2 percent and the trailing four‐quarter change in real GDP to  be 
2.1 percent.   We project the trailing  four‐quarter change in core PCE inflation to be 1.3 percent,  and 
the four‐quarter change  in headline PCE prices to be only 0.2 percent because of  decreases  in 
energy  prices over the  past year.

The staff’s  projection  for real GDP growth is somewhat  lower than  the most recent 
Blue Chip  Consensus  Outlook and the Survey of Professional  Forecasters  (SPF) 
median projection.   The staff’s  forecast of the unemployment  rate  is a little lower  
this year and  a little higher  next year relative  to those  of the outside forecasters;  the 
staff’s inflation projection  is lower.  However,  the SPF projection  was completed  in 
the first half of August and therefore  does not reflect the effects  of the recent 
turbulence in  financial markets.

  The main news in our inflation projecti on pertains to the decline in commodity 
prices and appreciation of the dollar since the July Tealbook; these factors impart a little 
greater restraint on consumer price inflation in  the near term.  Othe rwise, our outlook for 
price inflation is little revised from the Ju ly Tealbook.  We have core inflation gradually 
moving up from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2018, as import prices turn back 
up, the effects of earlier sharp declines in energy prices wa ne, and resource utilization 
tightens.  Total PCE price inflation is expected to run roughl y in line with core inflation 
beyond the near term.  The incoming data on compensation has generally been a good bit 
softer than expected and sugge sts that wages have continued to rise at the same modest 
pace we have seen over the past several years. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 We continue to assume that the fede ral funds rate will lift off from its 
effective lower bound after the Septem ber meeting, and that it will be 
governed thereafter by an inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) policy rule.1  
However, we lowered our assumption for the longer-run real federal funds rate by 25 basis points.
2  Even so, the projected path of the federal funds rate 
                                                 
1 If we had instead assumed that the federal fu nds rate would lift off after the December meeting 
and be governed (as in the baseline) by the inertial Ta ylor rule thereafter, the FRB/US model projects that, 
relative to our curr ent forecast, the level of real GDP would be 0.1 percent higher at the end of 2018, the 
unemployment rate would be less than 0.1 percentage point lower at the end of 2018, core consumer 
inflation would be 1 basis point higher in 2018, and the federal funds rate would be 5 basis points higher at the end of the medium term. 
2 In this Tealbook, we lowered our assumption for the longer-run nominal value of the federal 
funds rate and the 10-year Treasury yield by ¼ percentage point each, to 3¼ percent and 4 percent, 
respectively.  Because inflation in  the longer run remains unchanged  at the Committee’s objective of 
2 percent, these reductions in nominal interest rates reflect a reduction in long-run equilibrium real interest 
rates.  These adjustments were motivated partly by the decline in far-forward intere st rates.  For example, 
5- and 10-year forward rates on 10-year Treasury notes are 60 basis points lower than a year ago; we had 
previously adjusted down our assessment of the longer-run real federal funds rate by only 25 basis points.  
Even with the latest adjustment, our estimate of the real longer-run funds rate (1¼ percent) remains well 
above the point value that comes out of the model by Laubach and Williams (2005)—see 
www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john-williams for current estimates—and slightly above the 
midpoint of the range cited in Hamilton and others (see James Hamilton, Ethan Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth West (2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Ra te:  Past, Present and Future,” unpublished paper).  
For a broad description of factors influencing the trend in interest rates over recent decades, see Long-Term 
Interest Rates:  A Survey  (2015), a report by the Executive Office of the President of the United States, 
accessible via a link in a July 14, 2015, blog post, “The  Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates,” by Maurice

  is steeper than in the July Tealbook, as the upward impetus from tighter 
resource utilization in this projection more than offsets the decrease in the 
longer-run real federal funds rate.  All told, the nominal federal funds rate is 
projected to reach an average of 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, 
0.3 percentage point higher th an in the July projection. 
 The SOMA portfolio is assumed to rema in at its current size until about two 
quarters after the federal funds rate is  raised above its effective lower bound, 
at which point the portfolio begins to  contract as maturing assets are not 
reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates  
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
significantly, reflecting the movement  of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates as well as an 
increase in the term premium toward its historically normal level.  Compared 
with the July Tealbook, the rise in the Treasury yield is a bit steeper, as the 
path of expected short-term rates over the valuation window is higher.  
 We revised up the path for the 30-year mo rtgage rate and the 10-year triple-B 
corporate yield about in line with  the revision to Treasury yields. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 After dropping around 7 percent, on net,  since the July Tealbook, equity 
prices are expected to rise roughly 4 percent per year over the projection 
period, somewhat faster than in the Ju ly Tealbook.  Even so, the level of 
equity prices at the end of 2018 is 3½ pe rcent lower in this projection than in 
the July Tealbook.  Thus, we judge that the considerations that have pushed 
equity valuations downward since July w ill prove partly transitory and partly 
persistent.   
 The data on house prices have come in a bit stronger than we had anticipated, 
and we now expect house prices to incr ease 6¼ percent in 2 015; thereafter, we 
continue to expect house prices to rise 3 percent per year.  Our assessment is

  that house prices are not far out of line  with their historical relationship to 
rents, and we expect valuations to re main within the range predicted by this 
relationship over the medium term. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.  
We continue to anticipate that, afte r having been a small drag on real GDP 
growth in 2014, fiscal policy actions at all levels of government will provide a 
small stimulus in 2015 and over the medium term.   
 The federal government faces multiple fiscal deadlines over the remainder of 
the year.  The main items requiring acti on are that spending legislation must 
be enacted by October 1 or the govern ment will shut down, and the federal 
debt limit is expected to bind sometim e in the fourth quarter.  We assume 
these deadlines will be navigated such that there are no significant disruptions 
to government operations or financial markets.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign real GDP now is estimated to ha ve expanded at an annual rate of only 
about 1 percent in the second quarter of  this year, ½ percentage point below 
our projection in the July Tealbook.  In addition, we marked down our 
projection for growth in the second ha lf by about ½ percentage point, to a 
2¼ percent pace; this downward adju stment reflects weakness in recent 
indicators, most notably for China, as well as the financial turbulence 
associated in part with concerns abou t the Chinese economy.  We continue to 
expect foreign growth to pick up an d average about 3 percent between now 
and the end of 2018.  The advanced foreign economies should continue to 
recover, importantly supported by accommodative monetary policy; in turn, 
the emerging market economies should be  helped by a rebound in exports to 
the advanced foreign economies and th e United States.  Nevertheless, this 
projection is slightly weaker than in the previous Tealbook, mainly because we lowered our medium-term projection for China’s economic growth rate by ½ percen tage point, and that reassessment spills over into lower projected 
growth in other foreign econom ies, especially those in emerging Asia.

   The broad nominal dollar has appreciated  2¼ percent on net since the time of 
the July Tealbook.  The dollar rose against most emerging market currencies, 
notably including the Chinese renminbi, but  fell against the euro and the yen.  
We expect the nominal dollar to rise a bit further through the end of this year, 
pushed up by monetary policy actions in the United States, some further rise 
against the renminbi, and by concerns a bout the global outlook, and then to be 
little changed on net over the remainder of  the medium term.  This trajectory 
is above our previous forecast and leaves  the broad real dollar about 4 percent 
higher at the end of the forecast period than in the July Tealbook. 
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 After a month of dramatic price swings, the spot price of Brent crude oil is 
about $8 per barrel lower relative to the time of the July Tealbook.  Prices for futures contracts with delivery at  the end of 2018 are down about $6 per 
barrel.  These declines appear to primar ily reflect anxieties about the prospects 
for global demand, especially in Chin a, against a backdrop of continued 
strength in global oil pro duction.  As the recent declines in spot crude prices 
pass through to import prices, we expect  the price of imported oil to move 
down from $51 per barrel this quarter  to $46 per barrel next quarter.  
Thereafter, we forecast that the price of  imported oil will move up slowly to 
about $54 per barrel by the end of 2018, in line with quotes from futures 
markets. 
 Concerns about weak global demand have also weighed on metals prices, with 
an index of these prices falling about 5 percent since the previous Tealbook.  Agricultural prices edged down over this period, largely in response to 
positive supply-side developments.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
As noted earlier, the most recent information suggests that growth in aggregate 
output in the first half of this year was more robust than we had projected in July.3  We 
now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 2¼ percent over that period, 
                                                 
3 The upward revision to real GDP in the first half of this year was primarily due to stronger-than-
projected construction spending in both the private and public sectors, a faster-than-expected pace of 
inventory accumulation, and a smaller-tha n-expected drag from net exports.

  1 percentage point more than we thought prev iously.  We continue to expect aggregate 
output to rise at an annual rate of 2 percen t in the second half of the year, a pace of 
growth sufficient to further narrow the remaining gap between actual and potential 
output.4   
 After having averaged 2½ percent in the first half of the year, real PCE growth 
is projected to average 2¾ percent in  the second half, supported by moderate 
growth in real disposable personal in come, upbeat consumer sentiment, and a 
wealth-to-income ratio that remains high even after the recent fall in the stock 
market.  That said, the lower equity prices and a more muted trajectory of 
labor income led us to lower our projec tion for real PCE growth in the latter 
part of this year. 
 Overall investment spending is projected to rise at a moderate pace over the 
second half of this year.  Recent data on housing starts and sales suggest that 
residential investment remains on a gradual upward trend.  In the business sector, we anticipate that the earlier sh arp decline of inve stment in oil and 
drilling structures will ease substantially this quarter and next, and that investment elsewhere will proceed at a rate consistent with the projected 
modest pace of sales growth.  In all, private fixed investme nt is projected to 
rise at an annual rate of 4¾ percent in th e second half; this projection is a little 
stronger than in the July Tealbook, refl ecting the more positive tone of the 
incoming data across a range of cat egories, including nonresidential 
construction and investment in equipment and intangibles.   
 Net exports, which subtracted almost 1 percentage point from GDP growth in 
the first half of the year, are projected to  take ¾ percentage point off growth in 
the second half.  This projection is sl ightly less negative than in the July 
Tealbook, as better-than-expected trade data  from July is mostly offset by the 
negative impetus from the higher do llar and weaker foreign growth. 
 The direct and upstream effects of lower oil and gas prices and the 
appreciation in the dollar are also expect ed to continue to restrain oil drilling 
activity and to damp demand for factor y output.  As a result, industrial 
                                                 
4 As noted in the table “Federal Reserve System  Nowcasts of 2015:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” the 
staff’s judgmental projection for real GDP growth for th e third quarter, at 2 percent, is about equal to the 
median of the projections generated by the near-ter m forecasting approaches used within the System.

  production, which fell at an annual rate of  1¼ percent in the first half of the 
year, is projected to only eke out a sma ll gain in the second half, an outcome 
that seems consistent with the very subdued tone of the national and regional 
manufacturing surveys.  This projection is little changed, on balance, from the 
previous Tealbook. 
Real GDP is projected to rise about 2 percent in both 2016 and 2017 and then ease 
to a 1¾ percent pace in 2018.  Over this peri od, actual GDP growth is expected to run 
modestly above our estimate of potential gr owth, supported by monetary policy that 
remains accommodative, albeit decreasingly so.   
 Compared with the July Tealbook, aggreg ate output growth is, on average, 
nearly ¼ percentage point lower pe r year over the medium term.  The 
downward revision reflects the higher path  for the dollar, the lower path for 
equity prices, and the more subdued ou tlook for foreign output growth.   
 We expect above-trend growth in aggreg ate demand to be led by further gains 
in consumer spending, as continued imp rovements in labor market conditions 
support additional increases in real persona l income and consumer confidence.   
 We continue to assess the current level of residential construction as 
unsustainably low.  We therefore project a significant increase in starts over 
the medium term supported by the stre ngthening job market, low mortgage 
rates, and our expectation that household formation will move up from its 
currently low level. 
 Government purchases are expected to rise only sluggishly over the medium 
term at a pace well below that seen in  past economic expansions.  Although 
we expect state and local governments to  increase their purchases moderately 
as the expansion in economic activ ity continues to push up their tax 
collections, purchases at the federal leve l are expected to drift lower because 
of both continued adherence to sequ estration spending levels and the 
drawdown of spending on overseas military operations.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
Taken together, the two employment reports that we have received since the July 
Tealbook were more positive, on net, than we had expected.   
 Total nonfarm payrolls are reported by the BLS to have risen an average of 
220,000 over the three months ending in  August, in line with our July 
Tealbook projection.  However, we think the odds are that subsequent estimates will show a somewhat larger  gain in August than is currently 
reported.
5   
 The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent in August, 0.2 percentage point 
below our July Tealbook projection.  However, the particip ation rate also 
came in lower than we had projected,  leaving the empl oyment-to-population 
ratio in line with our  previous forecast. 
 Looking ahead, we continue to expect payroll employment to rise at an 
average monthly pace of 205,000 in the fourth quarter.  We expect the 
unemployment rate to edge down to 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter, 
0.2 percentage point lower than in our previous projection. 
Even with the upward revision to real GDP growth in the first half of this year, 
the sizable downward surprise in the unemp loyment rate in Augus t left the tension 
between the unemployment rate gap and the output gap uncomfortably large.  
Accordingly, to bring the two gaps into better  alignment at present and allow for a steeper 
decline in our medium-term forecast for the unemployment rate, we took steps to widen 
the differential between actual and potentia l output growth, all else being equal. 
 On the potential output side of the equa tion, we took a little signal from the 
disappointing news about productivity implied by the NIPA annual revision 
                                                 
5 In 10 of the past 12 years, the first estimate of the change in August payroll employment has 
been revised up, and we expect another upward revision, of about 60,000, to occur this year.  As a matter of 
internal housekeeping, we have lumped the expected upward revision to August employment in with the 
anticipated September gain.

  and trimmed our assumption for structur al productivity growth by a bit less 
than 0.1 percentage point per year, on average, from 2015 through 2018.6 
 We also adjusted our assumptions for trend labor force participation and the 
trend workweek in recent years, reducing the level of potential GDP a further 
¼ percent in 2015.7 
 To achieve the remainder of the de sired widening between actual and 
potential GDP growth, we reduced our  forecast for actual GDP growth over 
the projection period by 0.1 percentage point per y ear less than what the 
deterioration in conditioning factor s alone would have warranted.   
 All told, actual GDP is now projected to be ¾ percent above the level of 
potential at the end of 2017; in the Ju ly Tealbook, the gap at the end of 2017 
was essentially zero.   
The medium-term outlook for labor market utilization is stronger, on net, than in 
our previous projection. 
 The unemployment rate is projected to  edge down from 5.0 percent in the 
fourth quarter of this year to 4.8 percent by the end of  2017, 0.3 percentage 
point lower than in the July forecas t, and to reach 4.7 percent by the end 
of 2018. 
 Monthly payroll gains are projected to slow gradually from 215,000 in 2015 
to 105,000 in 2018, as the level of pr oductivity moves back toward its 
structural trend. 
 Although the unemployment rate in August was at our estimate of its natural 
rate, we believe that a small amount of slack—but less than in previous 
Tealbooks—remains in the labor market .  This judgment reflects our view 
that the labor force particip ation rate is stil l unusually low relative to its trend 
                                                 
6 The BEA’s annual revision to real GDP, published at the end of July, put the level of real GDP in 
the final quarter of 2014 nearly 1 percent lower than in  the previous vintage of NIPA data.  Consistent with 
our usual practice, we adjusted our estimates of potential output in line with the revisions to actual GDP.  
This downward revision in potential output growth manifests in slower trend productivity growth than we had previously assumed. 
7 Trend labor force participation is now assumed to  be 0.1 percentage point lower in the fourth 
quarter of this year and thereaft er relative to the July Tealbook.

  and that the level of i nvoluntary part-time employment is unusually high.  As 
the economy improves further, we expect  additional individuals to be drawn 
into the labor market and the rate of involuntary part-time employment to 
move down. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Total PCE prices are expected to rise at an annual rate of  1.2 percent in the 
current quarter and then to fall 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter.  The projected decline in 
the headline price index at the end of this year largely re flects the pass-through of the 
drop in crude oil prices this summer into consumer energy prices and the narrowing of 
temporarily elevated gasoline margins.  Core  PCE price inflation is projected to step 
down from 1.8 percent in the second quarter to 1.2 percent in the sec ond half of the year, 
reflecting further declines in core import prices, some pass-through into core prices of the 
earlier steep declines in energy prices, a nd a continuation of some tendency for core 
inflation to run a little high in  the second quarter and then a little low in the second half 
of the year (a manifestation of residual seasonality).   
 Our forecast for fourth-quarter headline  PCE inflation is ½ percentage point 
lower than in our previous projection, la rgely due to the downward surprise in 
crude oil prices since the July Tealbook.   
 We expect core import prices to fall at  an annual rate of about 1¾ percent over 
the second half of 2015 and decrease 1 percent in the first quarter of 2016.  
Relative to the July Tealbook, this forecast has been revised down 
1¼ percentage points, on average, in these three quarters because of recent 
dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices.   
 The projection for core PCE inflation in  the second half of  this year is 
0.2 percentage point lower than in th e July Tealbook, reflecting slightly 
softer-than-expected incoming data and the downward adjustment to our 
near-term path for core import prices.   
 The gap between core CPI and core PC E inflation has been unusually wide 
recently.  For further discussion, see the box “The Recent Gap between Core 
CPI and Core PCE Price Inflation Measures.”

 The Recent Gap between  Core CPI and Core PCE Price Inflation Measures  
Headline measures  of consumer  prices provide the best metric for changes  in the cost of living, but 
core inflation,  which excludes  changes in food and energy prices, tends  to be more useful when trying 
to distinguish the  inflation signal from the transitory  noise.  However,  different core  measures  can 
provide conflicting  signals about inflation.   For example,  the core CPI increased  1¾ percent over the  
12 months ending in July, very similar to its  pace over the  preceding  12 months, while core PCE prices 
increased  only 1¼ percent over the  same period, a step down from the pace over the prior 12 months.  
As a result, the gap  between the  core CPI and the core PCE measures  of price inflation (the black  line 
in figure 1) is currently  more than ½ percentage  point, notably wider than the average  gap over the  
past 15 years (the red line).  However,  as shown in  figure 1, the difference  between  core CPI and core 
PCE price inflation has varied over time,  and the current gap  is not unprecedented.1 
 
The CPI and the PCE price index differ for many reasons,  including  different aggregation  formulas,  
different prices  for some  items, different  weights used in aggregating  items, and a broader scope  of 
coverage  for the PCE  index.  In combination,  these methodological  differences  cause some categories  
of expenditure  prices to make a notably larger or smaller contribution  to CPI inflation than  to PCE 
price inflation.   Figure 2 (next page) shows contributions  of some expenditure  price categories  to the 
gap between core  CPI and core PCE price inflation over the  past 12 months (the black bars) compared  
with their  average contribution  over the  past 15 years (the red bars).  This chart suggests  that the 
recent behavior  of prices for housing  services and for medical  services can more  than explain  why core 
CPI inflation is currently  markedly higher  than core PCE price inflation.  
                                                 
1 In contrast to the difference  in the core measures,  over  the 12 months ending in July, both the total CPI and total PCE 
price  index increased  at about  the same pace—¼  percent.   Currently,  there is no gap between  the headline measures

In particular,  both the CPI and PCE price index for housing  services increased  about 3 percent  over the  
12 months ending in July.2  But because  housing services have a much larger weight  in the core CPI 
than in the core PCE price index, this  increase in  housing services prices contributed  1¼ percentage 
points to core CPI  inflation over the  past 12 months but only ½ percentage point  to core PCE price 
inflation.  The ¾ percentage point difference  between  the two contributions  (shown by  the second 
black bar in figure 2) is larger than the average contribution  over the past 15 years (the corresponding  
red bar) because housing  services prices have increased  more rapidly over the  past year than  over the 
past 15 years. 
Another key difference  between the  CPI and PCE price index is the treatment of  medical services.  The  CPI 
focuses on household  out‐of‐pocket expenditures,  while the PCE price index tries to capture all  
household  medical consumption,  regardless  of the payer.  For  example,  the PCE index includes medical 
services paid for by Medicare  and Medicaid,  which are largely excluded  from the CPI.3  Consequently,  
medical services  have a much smaller weight in  the CPI than in the PCE price index, and  thus the rapidly 
rising medical services prices over the  past 15 years contributed  less to core  CPI inflation than to core PCE 
price inflation (shown by  the negative  middle red bar in figure 2).  However,  a substantial  slowing of 
medical services  price inflation (driven, in large part, by the administered  Medicare  and Medicaid  
reimbursement rates  used in PCE prices) has led the contribution  of total medical services  to be roughly 
the same for both the core CPI and the core PCE price index in the most recent 12 months (the middle  
black bar in figure 2). 
 
In the Tealbook  baseline forecast,  we project that  the gap between core  CPI and core PCE price inflation 
will edge  down by 2017 but will still be  about ¼ percentage point  above the current 15‐ year average,  as 
relatively  high housing services price inflation and low PCE medical services  price inflation are anticipated  
to persist  for some  time. 
                                                 
2 For this analysis, we define housing services prices  as tenants’ rent and owners’ equivalent  rent. 
3 As a result, many of the PCE price  components  are based on PPI, not CPI, series. -0.4-0.3-0.2-0.1-0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8Percentage points

  Beyond the near term, core PCE price inflat ion is projected to edge up gradually 
from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2018, as import prices turn back up, the 
effects on core inflation of th e previous large declines in energy prices dissipate, and 
resource utilization continues to tighten in  an environment of we ll-anchored inflation 
expectations.  With consumer food and energy prices projected to rise roughly in line 
with core prices after this year, total PCE in flation is expected to run at about the same 
pace as core inflation th roughout the medium term.  
 Survey-based measures of longer-run in flation expectations have generally 
remained stable over the intermeeting period.  The final August estimate of 
expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey was 
2.7 percent—at the lower end of the narrow range of values seen in recent 
years.  Expected PCE price inflation ove r the next 10 years from the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters for the current quarter was 2 percent—essentially the 
same as it has been for the past 2 years.   
 In contrast, TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation fell 
substantially amid the turbulence in fi nancial markets and the decline in oil 
prices.  However, staff models attributed  little of this decline in inflation 
compensation to lower expected inflation.   
Overall, the incoming data on compensation were weaker than our expectations in 
the July Tealbook and suggest that recent wage  gains have continue d to be subdued.   
 Average hourly earnings of all em ployees were up 2.2 percent in the 
12 months through August, broadly in lin e with the increases seen over the 
past several years. 
 After increasing at an annual rate of  3 percent in the first quarter, the 
employment cost index (ECI) for priv ate industry workers was unchanged in 
the second quarter, as the wages and salaries component of the index 
decelerated and the benefits component declined.  The 12-month change in the 
ECI as of June was 1.9 percent, very cl ose to the pace of the preceding 3 years 
but ½ percentage point less than projected in the July Tealbook. 
 The four-quarter change in hourly compensation from the Productivity and 
Costs release was 2¼ percent in the s econd quarter, about ½ percentage point

  below our previous projection.  Nonetheless, with labor and product markets 
tightening over the projection period, we expect this measure of hourly 
compensation to step up to an aver age pace of around 3 percent over the 
medium term. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) rule.  However, as in the near- and 
medium-term portions of the forecast, the policy rule now assumes a long-run equilibrium level of the nominal federal funds rate of 3¼ percent rather than 
the 3½ percent used in the previous Tealbook. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is projected to ha ve returned to a normal size by 2021. 
 The federal funds rate rises furthe r after 2018.  With the economy running 
above its potential level and inflation having nearly reached the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, the fe deral funds rate moves above its long-run value in 
2019 and 2020.  
 The natural rate of unemployment rema ins at 5.1 percent, and potential GDP 
rises about 1¾ percent per ye ar, on average, in 2019 and 2020. 
 As monetary policy continues to tigh ten, real GDP decelerates further and 
rises 1.6 percent in 2020.  The unemployment rate remains at 4.7 percent until 
2020 and moves back up toward its assumed natural rate thereafter. 
 PCE price inflation remains below th e Committee’s long-run objective at the 
end of 2019 but moves up to 2 percent at the end of 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economic growth appears to have remained quite weak in the second quarter at 
only 1 percent, down from an already sluggish 1½ percent in the first quarter.  This second-
quarter estimate is more than ½ percentage point lower than we had forecast at the time of the 
July Tealbook, with sizable downward revisions to the estimates for Brazil, Japan, and emerging 
Asia.  We expect growth to step up to 2¼ percent in the second half of this year, in part as 
temporary factors holding down activity in Canada let up and Brazil begins to pull out of its 
steep contraction.   
This second-half pace for the foreign economies is almost ½ percentage point below our 
July forecast.  Early third-quarter indicators for many economies have come in softer than 
expected, most notably in China.  In addition, the depreciation of the renminbi, the continued 
slide in Chinese equity prices, and inconsistent responses of Chinese authorities have shaken 
global financial and commodity markets, putting a damper on global growth, especially in 
EMEs.  The decline in oil prices since July, in part associated with concerns about weaker 
Chinese growth, should eventually prove to be a net positive for global growth, but in the near 
term it is likely to depress activity among oil exporters more than it boosts demand in oil 
importers.   
Beyond the near term, we still project a further pickup in growth in the foreign 
economies, to 3 percent by the second half of 2016, a bit above its trend pace.  AFE growth 
should continue to firm, reflecting accommodative monetary policy and a further healing in 
credit markets.  EME growth should be helped by a rebound in exports to the advanced 
economi es.  Nevertheless, we revised down our outlook by ¼ percentage point next year and by 
a little less thereafter.  This revision reflects weaker momentum in many economies, somewhat 
tighter financial conditions, and, most importantly, a markdown in longer- term prospects for the 
Chinese economy, where potential growth appears to be decelerating a bit more rapidly than 
previously estimated.   
Moreover, as underscored by the turbulence in global financial markets, the risks to our 
projection for foreign growth a re skewed a little more to the downside.  Financial and economic 
conditions in China could deteriorate much more sharply than we have seen to date, triggering a 
severe recession in the EMEs and substantial economic spillovers to the global economy.  (See 
the alternative scenarios on China in the Risks and Uncertainty section.)  Additionally, a

worsening of financial and economic conditions in EMEs in response to the liftoff in U.S. 
interest rates remains a significant concern.  Although conditions in Greece appear quiescent at 
the moment, the situation there could deteriorate at any time.  Finally, against the background of 
repeated shortfalls in foreign growth relative to our forecast, it is possible that the trend growth 
of foreign GDP is weaker than we have assumed.   
Inflation rates continue to be quite low in the AFEs, and market-based measures of 
inflation expectations have recently moved down in the euro area and Japan.  The sharp drop in 
oil prices since the previous Tealbook led us to revise down our projection for headline 
consumer price inflation by almost ½ percentage point in the second half, to ¾ percentage point.  
As the effects of lower oil prices wane and economic slack narrows, AFE inflation should move 
up to around 1¾ percent in 2018.  In the EMEs, we estimate that inflation picked up to around 
3½ percent in the current quarter, partly because of higher food prices in China and currency 
depreciation in many EMEs.  Inflation should move back down to around 3 percent by next year, 
as the effects of higher food prices wane.  
Along with our weaker forecasts for both economic activity and inflation, we now 
assume somewhat easier macroeconomic policy.  China has already taken steps to ease financial 
conditions, and several other EMEs have loosened fiscal policy or are expected to do so .  We 
also expect the Bank of Canada (BOC) to wait longer than we had previously assumed to begin 
raising rates, and we now anticipate that the European Central Bank (ECB) will extend its asset 
purch ase program beyond its earlier-anticipated end date of September 2016. 
EMERGING M ARKET E CON OMIES  
 China.   We e
xpect real GDP growth to edge down from its average pace of 
6½ percent in the first half to 6¼ percent in the current quarter.  Recent data on 
industrial production, exports, and P
MIs all point to a significant loss of momentum 
in China’s manufacturing sector.  The surprise change in China’s exchange rate 
policy on August 11, which resulted in a 3 percent devaluation of the renminbi, 
should provide only a modest offset.  We project that growth should decline further to 
about 6 percent by 2018, as slower growth in the labor force and rebalancing from 
manufacturing to services production contribute to a decline in potential growth.   
Compared with the July Tealbook, this forecast is about 1 percentage point lower in 
the third quarter.  Moreover, a s described in greater detail in the box “Recent  
Developments in China and Their Implications for Our Forecast ,” we have lowered

Chinese growth ½ percentage point over the remainder of the forecast period.  The 
accumulation of weaker data led us to bring down our (admittedly uncertain) estimate 
of potential growth.  In addition, the authorities’ clumsy response to the stock market 
crash and poorly communicated change in exchange rate policy likely hurt confidence 
and raised  questions about the authorities ’ ability to tackle the considerable economic, 
financial, and structural vulnerabilities in the Chinese economy.  Our sense is that the 
authorities are willing to tolerate a somewhat faster transition to lower growth than 
we previously thought rather than undertake stimulative policies that would 
exacerbate these vulnerabilities. 
Inflation picked up in the past few months, largely reflecting a rise in pork prices that 
is expected to persist for several months.  However, inflation should dip again toward 
the end of the year as the recent decline in oil prices passes through to lower domestic 
fuel prices.  We see inflation settling at 2½ percent by the middle of next year. 
 Other Emerging Asia.  Second-quarter real GDP growth fell unexpectedly sharply to 
1½ percent from 3½ percent in the first quarter.  Weak exports contributed to 
negative growth surprises in Singapore  and Taiwan , while growth in Korea  was 
held down by the effects of the MERS epidemic.  We see growth rebounding to 
3¼ percent in the second half as the effects of the MERS epidemic abate and exports 
pick up.  Growth is expected to average 4 percent thereafter.  Weaker-than-expected 
economic da ta, as well as the recent financial market stress, led us to mark down our 
second-half forecast for the region by a little more than ½ percentage point.  Further 
out, growth is revised down a little from the July Tealbook in response to reductions 
in the China forecast.  We expect inflation to slow to 2 percent in the current quarter 
from 3 percent last quarter, as a result of lower oil prices as well as a weather-related 
fall in food prices in India .  As these effects pass, inflation should move up to 
3¼ percent in 2016. 
 Latin America.  Mexican  real GDP growth edged up to a still-subdued 2 percent in 
the second quarter from 1¾ percent in the first.  Exports remain ed weak, reflecting 
lackluster U.S. demand and a decline in oil shipments.  By contrast, private 
consumption continued to improve, supported by job creation and credit growth.  
Moreover, investment in machinery and equipment was robust.  We see growth 
improving, moving up to 2¼ percent in the current quarter and reaching 3 percent by 
early 2016.  This rebound is supported by a pickup in U.S. demand, the 15 percent 
real depreciation in the peso over the past year (driven in part by lower oil prices),

 Recent Developments in China  
and Their Implications for Our Forecast 
In China, weak incoming data, an unexpected devaluation of the renminbi, and a 
further collapse of equity prices led to a pronounced heightening of concerns 
about the Chinese economy during the intermeeting period, which in turn led to 
steep downdrafts in global commodity and financial markets.   Investors appear 
focused on the possibil
ity that Chinese economic activity is slumping, that the 
renminbi may depreciate substantially further, and that these developments could 
lead to a global economic slowdown.  These are indeed downside risks, but they 
are not the most likely scenario in our view.  
Although recent data do suggest a lower growth trajectory in China , we see little 
evidence that China is in the midst of a financial or economic crisis.  The stock 
market has few linkages to the real economy , because few households own stocks 
and equity financing accounts for a small share of firms’ overall financing .  
Although industrial production growth (the black line in figure 1) and exports (not 
shown) both fell in July, the declines were not dramatic .  Other indicators offer 
grounds for optimism.  In particular, China’s housing market, which has exerted a 
sign
ificant drag on the economy since the middle of last year, appears to have 
bottomed out, with prices and sales rising.  Job growth has also been strong and 
running well ahead of the authorities’ target , as growth in the more labor-intensive 
service sector has outpaced growth in manufacturing.  And retail sales (the blue 
line in figure 1) have been robust, pointing to solid consumption growth.  Taken 
together, the i
ndicators paint a picture of an economy that is rebalancing, not 
crashing.    
Many market participants believe that China’s economy is slowing more sharply 
than its GDP statistics suggest, but we have found little evidence to support this 
view.  As seen in figure 2, the staff indicator model —which relates Chinese GDP to 
industrial producti
on, imports, and retail sales —generally tracks the GDP data very 
well.  We have also estimated models using electricity production data and data 
from other countries’ exports to China, neither of which suggests that economic

 activity has been slowing significantly more in recent quarters than is indicated by 
the GDP data. 
Nonetheless , we took some signal from recent developments and marked down 
our projection for China’ s growth over the forecast period.  In addition to the 
weaker-than-expected data, the downward revision reflects our view that rising 
uncertainty about the ability of policymakers to manage an orderly rebalancing, 
particularly in light of the authorities’ ineffective and costly interventions in 
response to the stock market crash, has likely diminished the confidence of 
households, firms, and investors.  For their part, notwithstanding some recent 
policy easing, policymakers appear focus ed on rein ing in financial vulnerabilities, 
and this could constrain their willingness to provide significant fiscal or monetary 
stimulus.   We now see growth hovering around 6¼ percent through 2016 and 
falling gradually to 6
 percent by the end of 2018.   Even with this downward 
revision— averaging about ½ percentage point —to our growth outlook, we see 
risks in China as more tilted to the downside than we did in the previous Tealbook.    
We also revised our path for the renminbi.   Instead of staying flat against the dollar 
over the rest of 
the year, the renminbi is now expecte d to depreciat e a modest 
2 percent .  The People’s Bank of China is currentl y intervening to support the 
renminbi, but in the face of heightened capital outflows associated with weaker 
growth, it will probably allow some further de cline in the currency’s va lue, though 
it would likely act to prevent a sharp er and more destabilizing depreciation .  
Eventually, we expect the renminbi to resume appreciating, given China’s higher 
productivity growth relative to its trading partners and the continued need to 
rebalance its economy.  Nonetheless, the level of the renminbi exchange rate at 
the end of 2018 is about 6 percent weaker than our July Tealbook path .  In light of 
heightened uncertainties about growth and investor confidence, we see some risk 
that the currency will be weaker than we are forecasting. 
The modest slowing of Chinese growth and limited further depreciation of the 
renminbi in our baseline forecast are expected to have a relatively small effect on 
the global economy.   We marked down EME growth by ¼ percentage point on 
average over the forecast period , and we also increased the expected pace of 
depreciation of emerging Asian currencies relative to the dollar this year , in part to 
help maintain competitiveness against the renminbi .  Given China’s relatively sm all 
share of U.S. exports (about 7½ percent), the direct effect of slower growth in 
China on U.S. economic activity in our baseline forecast is small.   The main channel 
of transmission occurs
 indirect ly through lower EME growth and especially a 
stronger dollar.  Indeed, simulations using our SIGMA model suggest that even the 
downside risk of a severe slump in China would have little effect on U.S. growth in 
the absence of spillovers to other EMEs .  But, as discussed in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section, we estimate that in scenarios where financial and economic 
disruptions in China do spill over to other EMEs, the effects on U.S. and global 
economic growth could be significant.

and a small boost from the country’s  energy reform.  We revised down our estimate 
for the second half of this year by ½ percentage point given the further decline in the 
price of oil as well as the downward revision to U.S. manufacturing output.     
We penciled in a rise in inflation to 3¼ percent in the current quarter from 2¾ percent 
in the second, reflecting the waning effect of declines in energy and other 
administered prices earlier this year.  We expect inflation to remain at that rate over 
the rest of the forecast period.  Bank of Mexico (BOM) officials have expressed 
concern that the peso’s depreciation will stoke inflationary pressures, but given the 
economic slack, we now expect that the BOM will not begin to raise its policy rate 
until the fourth quarter of this year.   
Brazilian real GDP plunged 7¼ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, 
3 percentage points more than we had expected, following a 3 percent decline in the 
first quarter.  Private domestic demand, especially investment, fell sharply in response 
to very weak consumer and business confidence.  With the political situation 
worsening, commodity prices remaining low, and global growth weaker, we now 
expect that the recession will be deeper and longer than we did previously.  
Accordingly, we have the economy contracting 1¾ percent in the second half of this 
year, 1½ percentage points more than in the July Tealbook.  Growth should turn 
positive next year and pick up further to a still-sluggish 2 percent in 2017, as 
monetary policy begins to ease by mid-2016 and business confidence improves. 
Despite the weak economy, the substantial depreciation of the real and increases in 
administered prices have kept inflation stubbornly high, at an estimated 10 percent 
annual rate in the current quarter.  To restrain inflation, the central bank has raised its 
policy rate 325 basis points since October 2014.  We expect past policy tightening, 
lower pressure from administered prices, and economic slack to bring inflation down 
to 5½ percent by 2017.   
The fall in commodity prices is also restraining economic activity in other Latin 
American countries.  In Chile, real GDP remained about flat in the second quarter, 
down from 4½ percent growth in the first quarter.  The downturn was broad based 
and led by weak domestic demand, particularly investment.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro Area.  Real GDP grew 1.4 percent in the second quarter, slightly below our July 
Tealbook estimate.  More recent indicators, such as the composite purchasing 
managers index (PMI), suggest that output is expanding a touch faster in the current 
quarter.  We expect GDP growth to rise to 2 percent next year and remain at that pace 
over the rest of the forecast period, supported by ongoing monetary stimulus, lower 
oil prices, and easing credit conditions.  Compared with the July Tealbook, this 
forecast is slightly weaker throughout the projection period, as the drag from a 
stronger euro, a weaker global outlook, and lower stock prices is only partly offset by 
a boost from lower oil prices and expected additional monetary policy 
accommodation.   
Headline inflation is on track to fall to ¼ percent in the third quarter (from 2.3 percent 
in the second quarter), reflecting a sharp decline in energy prices; however, core 
inflation appears to be holding steady at around 1¼ percent.  We expect inflation to 
step up to 1¾ percent by the end of 2018 as the effect of lower energy prices wanes 
and the output gap narrows.  This projection is a bit weaker than in the July Tealbook, 
largely due to lower energy prices and a stronger euro.  Given the weaker outlook for 
growth and inflation, we now expect the ECB to continue its asset purchases beyond 
September 2016, and we revised our forecast of total purchases up by €100 billion to 
about €1. 2 trillion.  We expect the ECB to leave its main policy rate unchanged until 
the second half of 2018. 
Although financial stresses emanating from Greece moderated since the previous 
Tealbook, the Greek government stepped down, and Greek authorities scheduled 
another national parliamentary election for September 20.  Political instability and 
domestic opposition to austerity will likely continue to fuel financial tensions in 
Greece, but we still expect that spillovers to other European countries will remain 
limited.           
 Japan .  Following a strong expansion in the first quarter, real GDP unexpectedly 
contracted at a 1.2 percent pace in the second quarter, as exports and private 
consumption declined.  However, data on exports and household spending for July 
and PMI data through August suggest that econom ic activity is rebounding in the 
current quarter, with GDP estimated to rise 1 percent.  We see growth remaining near

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

that pace through 2016 before a hike in the consumption tax stalls the expansion in 
2017.  Given the markdown to global growth and a substantial appreciation of the 
yen, we lowered our Japanese growth forecast by ½ percentage point in the second 
half of 2015  and by a small amount in 2016 and 2017.   
Inflation rose to 1.7 percent in the second quarter, led by a rapid increase in food 
prices.  However, with the stronger yen and lower oil prices, consumer prices should 
decline a bit in the second half of the year.  Thereafter, as energy prices begin to rise 
and the output gap narrows, we project that inflation (excluding the direct effect of 
the consumption tax hike) will recover to 1¼ percent in 2017. 
 Canada .  Real GDP fell 0.5 percent in the second quarter, a bit more than we 
estimated in the previous Tealbook, but a rebound in monthly GDP in June and strong 
export growth in June and July point to recovery.  We now expect growth of nearly 
2 percent in the second half of this year, as the temporary factors that had been 
holdi ng back growth, including wildfires that disrupted energy production, come off.  
Growth should average around that rate over the rest of the forecast, supported by 
accommodative monetary policy and rising oil prices.  This forecast is a little lower 
than in the July Tealbook, as recent declines in commodity prices and the weaker 
outlook for U.S. growth are expected to weigh on Canadian growth, more than 
offsetting the boost from recent currency depreciation.   
Lower energy prices should cause inflation to slow to 1½ percent in the second half 
of this year.  By 2017, we see inflation edging up to the BOC’s 2  percent target as the 
output  gap closes.  We expect weaker growth prospects and contained inflation 
pressures to lead the BOC to postpone its first rate hike until the first quarter of 2017, 
two qua rters later than previously assumed. 
 United Kingdom .  Real GDP expanded 2.7 percent in the second quarter, up from 
1.5 percent in the first quarter.  Recent indicators, including PMIs, consumer 
confidence,  and retail sales, have been strong, but the weaker global outlook and 
somewhat tighter financial conditions are expected to offset this added momentum.  
Thus , we continue to project growth at close to 2½ percent in the second half of the 
year and throughout the projection period.   
Inflation in the third quarter is projected to increase to 1¾ percent, despite the fall in 
energy prices, as a sharp rise in core prices in July suggested a reversal of their

disinflationary trend over the past year.  After edging down in the fourth quarter, 
inflation is expected to increase in 2016 toward the 2 percent target of the Bank of 
England (BOE), as the effect of energy price declines dissipates and slack in the 
economy is eliminated.  This forecast is slightly weaker in the near term on account 
of the recent decline in energy prices.  In line with the rise in inflation and the 
tightening labor market, we continue to expect the BOE to begin raising its policy 
rate in the first quarter of 2016.

Financial Developments 
Concerns about global growth  prospects, centered on China, contributed to an 
increase in financial market volatility and a de terioration in risk sentiment in the United 
States and abroad during the intermeeting period.  Although incoming news on domestic 
economic activity generally met market expectations, the volatility in financial markets 
boosted uncertainty about the tim ing of liftoff.  That said, short- and long-term nominal 
Treasury yields were litt le changed on net.  
 Market- and survey-based probabilities fo r an initial increase in the federal 
funds rate in September moved down, on balance, while the probability of 
liftoff in 2016 increased.  The probabi lities of liftoff occurring at the 
September or December meeting are on the order of 20 to 30 percent.      
 The expected path of the federal funds  rate implied by OIS quotes flattened 
over the intermeeting period.  The implied federal funds rate is about 
0.3 percent at the end of 2015 and 0.8 percent at the end of 2016. 
 The U.S. dollar appreciated about 2 percent, rising against most emerging market currencies but declining against the euro and the yen.
 
 TIPS-based measures of inflation co mpensation moved lower, on balance, 
amid a decline in oil prices, a strengthe ning of the dollar, and slightly weaker-
than-expected readings on  realized inflation.  
 The S&P 500 index fell about 6 percen t, on net, corporate bond spreads 
increased modestly, and the VIX—which shot up dramatically in the middle 
of the intermeeting period—ended the period above its historical median level. 
 Liquidity in foreign exchange, Treas ury, equity, and corporate bond markets 
deteriorated at times dur ing the period, but effect s on market functioning and 
pricing appear to have been  limited and short lived.   
 Financing conditions remained genera lly accommodative, but the increase in 
financial market volatility resulted in  a modest tightening of conditions for 
businesses.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
On net, the probability for a September liftoff implied by federal funds futures 
moved down over the intermeeting period.1  Early in the period, the market-based 
probability for a September liftoff firmed as incoming data showed some further 
improvement in the labor market and as some policymakers’ comments appeared to be 
supportive of an imminent liftoff.  Subse quently, market participants revised down 
significantly the odds they placed on a Septem ber tightening amid turbulence in global 
equity and foreign exchange markets, perhap s in part because the minutes pointed to 
financial and international developments as factors in the FOMC’s evaluation of progress 
toward their objectives.  Comments from so me FOMC members were seen as supporting 
this view.  The odds of a September liftoff reboun ded slightly, on net, la te in the period as 
domestic equity markets calmed, incoming data on economic activity generally met 
market expectations, and statements by polic ymakers suggested that a September liftoff 
was still on the table.  
The uncertainty around the date of liftoff de rived from federal funds futures rose 
notably as the probabilities of liftoff at the September a nd December meetings fell and 
the probability of liftoff in October and 2016 rose.2  Moreover, the expected path of the 
federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes fl attened, on balance, over the intermeeting 
period:  The implied federal funds rate at  the end of 2015 was down about 5 basis points 
to 0.3 percent, and the rate implied at the end of 2016 declined about 17 basis points to 
0.8 percent. 
According to the Desk’s surveys of dealers and market participants, the average 
of respondents’ probability distributions shifte d toward later liftoff dates relative to the 
July surveys.  Respondents are now about ev enly split between those viewing September 
and December as the most likely date of liftoff.  The expected pace of tightening 
                                                 
1 The Board’s staff used the following assumptions to compute liftoff probabilities from quotes on 
the federal funds futures contract ex piring at the end of September 2015:  The average federal funds rate 
between September 1 and September 17 equals its 30-day average; the federal funds rate after September 
17 equals 12.5 basis points if there is no liftoff or 37 .5 basis points if there is liftoff.  Popular alternative 
assumptions generate implied probabilities for a September liftoff that range from 20 percent to 35 percent. 
2 Positions held by unhedged investors in federal funds and 90-day Eurodollar futures—which are 
thought to reflect speculative invest ors’ expectations of future intere st rate developments—are currently 
near neutral, suggesting that these investors’ policy expectations are roughly in line with those implied by 
the market-based measures.

  following liftoff is little changed, but the median  estimate of the federal funds rate at the 
end of 2016 is down 25 basis points.  Dealers an d market participants pushed out slightly 
the expected timing of the end of the FOMC’s reinvestments. 
TREASURY YIELDS AND TREASURY FINANCE  
Despite the decline in global equity mark ets and the downshift in the expected 
path of the federal funds rate, yields on nomi nal Treasury securities were up a bit at short 
horizons and down a touch at the 5- and 10-ye ar horizons.  Swap rates and some other 
benchmark yields declined noticeably across the maturity structure.  Some market 
participants cited the selling of Treasury secu rities by foreign central  banks as a possible 
factor putting upward pressu re on Treasury yields.   
The 5- and 5-to-10-year measures of  inflation compensation based on TIPS 
declined 14 basis points and 27 basis points, respectively, an d are now back near their 
historical lows.  The decreases were reportedly driven in part by declines in oil prices, the 
strengthening of the dollar, and slightly weaker-than-expe cted readings on realized 
inflation.  The 5-to-10-year measure of in flation compensation de rived from inflation 
swaps—which is typically not affected by technical factors in Treasury markets—
declined a little less over the period but also  fell to near its historical lows.   
Liquidity conditions in the Treasury market  remained largely stable over most of 
the intermeeting period.3  Treasury markets saw high trading volumes and somewhat 
reduced market depth in late August amid turbulence in global financial markets, but 
normalized quickly.   
On July 30, Treasury Secretary Lew ex tended the “debt issuance suspension 
period” through October 30, which allows the Treasury Department to use extraordinary 
measures to remain under the debt limit while issuing new securities.4  Staff and private-
sector projections suggest that these measures  should allow federal debt to stay below its 
statutory ceiling at le ast into November.   
                                                 
3 Since the July FOMC meeting, the Treasury Department has auctioned $243 billion of Treasury 
nominal fixed-coupon securities, $16 billion of  TIPS, and $28 billion of two-year FRNs. 
4 The accounting measures available to the Treasury include suspending daily reinvestment of the 
Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund, redeeming existing investments 
and suspending new investment in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, and suspending the 
daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilization Fund into Treasury securities.

  FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Global financial markets have been volat ile since the July FOMC meeting, as 
investor concerns about a sl owdown in global growth were amplified by thin summer 
trading and skittishness as U.S. liftoff approaches .  Much of this volatility emanated from 
China, where weak manufacturing and expor t data exacerbated wo rries about slowing 
growth.  (See the box “Recent Developments in China and Their Implications for Our 
Forecast” in the International Economic De velopments and Outlook section.)  These 
worries were intensified when the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) unexpectedly 
changed its exchange rate policy, resulting in  a 3 percent devaluat ion of the renminbi 
over the next week.  Subsequently, the PBOC  undertook other actions to reduce further 
depreciation pressure on the renminbi, reportedly selling reserve asse ts and increasing the 
specific reserve requirements for Chinese ba nks selling the U.S. dollar in the forward 
market.  Later in the period, a sharp decline in Chinese stock prices, which occurred a 
few days after reports that  policymakers would withdraw  credit support for equity 
purchases, rattled global markets and appeared to threaten confidence in China’s ability 
to manage its economy.  In part to support the stock market, Chinese authorities cut 
benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points a nd the reserve requireme nt ratio by 50 basis 
points.  Along with an appare nt reversal on credit support for equity purchases, these 
actions seemed to calm equity markets, which ended the period down by about 13 
percent.  
Concerns about potential spillovers from a slowdown in China to the global 
economy, along with an impending policy liftoff in the United States, contributed to a 
sharp decline in the prices of  global risk assets.  Foreign stock indexes were down up to 
15 percent over the intermeeting period, a nd emerging markets equity and bond funds 
recorded unusually large outflows.  
The U.S. dollar appreciated against most currencies during the heightened market 
volatility, and the broad inde x of the dollar ended the in termeeting period 2¼ percent 
higher.  Asian EME currencies moved in sympathy with the renminbi and are down 3 to 
6 percent against the dollar.  Mexico’s and Brazil’s cu rrencies fell 3½ percent and 
14 percent, respectively, because of commodity  exposures and, in Brazil, deteriorating 
economic and political conditions.  Mexico a nd Brazil increased their foreign exchange 
interventions to support their respective currencies, and th e Brazilian central bank raised 
its benchmark policy rate 50 basis points.

  Movements in the dollar were mixed ag ainst the currencies of the advanced 
foreign economies (AFEs).  The British pound is down about 1½ pe rcent against the 
dollar, with most of the ch ange occurring following the August policy meeting of the 
Bank of England, at which there were fewer votes  in favor of raising rates than had been 
expected.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 2¼ percent against the dollar, reflecting the 
effect of declining oil prices  on prospects for the Canadian  economy.  In contrast, the 
Japanese yen appreciated 3 pe rcent against the dollar on flight-to-safety flows and the 
unwinding of carry trades funded in yen.  The eu ro appreciated in August, consistent with 
lower market expectations for U.S. policy rates and an unwinding of euro-funded carry 
trade positions.  The euro pa rtially retraced this increas e following the release of a 
weaker-than-expected ECB staff eco nomic outlook and communication by ECB 
President Draghi that signaled the ECB’s willingness to expand its quantitative easing 
program in the future.     
AFE sovereign yields ended the period so mewhat lower, in part because of a 
markdown in expectations for future policy rates.  The decline was most pronounced in 
the United Kingdom, where the 10-year yiel d is down about 10 basis points on net.  
Greek sovereign spreads narrowed by about  320 basis points over the period, as Greece 
and the euro area finalized Greece’s third bailo ut package.  In contrast, concerns about 
the global slowdown and falli ng commodity prices widened spreads on EME dollar-
denominated debt by about 20 to 30 basis points. 
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS  
Broad U.S. equity price indexes were highl y correlated with foreign equity price 
indexes over the intermeeting period and posted net declines of about 6 percent.  While 
concerns about global growth lik ely played a role, stock prices  of firms with relatively 
high exposures to foreign mark ets decreased only slightly more than those with low 
foreign exposures.  Another factor depressing domestic stock pr ices was reportedly a 
reassessment of equity market risk and appr opriate valuations.  I ndeed, the decline in 
stock prices was broad based, and the market was very volatile over the period, especially 
in late August and early September, when  the one-month-ahead option-implied volatility 
on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—reached levels last seen in 2011.     
Bid-asked spreads in equity markets tem porarily increased during the days of the 
sharpest stock price declines, and trading halt s were triggered for certain stocks.  Some 
ETFs experienced pricing tr oubles that were resolved within a few days.

  Spreads of yields on BBB-rated and speculative-grade co rporate bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities have  both widened, on net, 12 basis points since 
the July FOMC meeting.  Spreads on BBB-rated bonds ended the period somewhat above 
their historical medians, while those for specu lative-grade bonds rema ined close to their 
historical medians.  Speculative-grade issu ers in the energy sector experienced more 
notable increases in spreads than did firms in  other industries.  M easures of liquidity 
conditions suggest that corporate bond markets functioned fa irly well, even during the 
peaks of market volatility. 
With most firms in the S&P 500 having re ported earnings for the second quarter, 
the staff estimates that earnings per share for these firms increased slightly relative to first-quarter levels.  Through th e end of August, private-sect or equity analysts revised 
down slightly their projections for year-ahead earnings. 
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial bus inesses tightened m odestly over the 
summer, although the effects on business finance of the declines in equity prices and 
increases in bond spreads are difficult to di scern given data lags and typical summer 
slowdowns in financing activity.  Corporate bond and institutional leveraged loan issuance remained solid through July but mode rated in August.  Public equity issuance 
also stayed solid, though it slowed for fi rms conducting initial public offerings.  
Similarly, the growth of C&I loans on ba nks’ books moderated in July and August, 
mostly for banks with a higher concentration of  exposures to oil and gas firms.  Financing 
conditions for small businesses continued to improve slowly in the second quarter.  
Financing for commercial real estate (CRE) remained broadly available through 
the summer, with CRE loans on banks’ books expanding and CMBS issuance staying 
robust in July and August.  Spreads on i nvestment-grade CMBS widened noticeably in 
August, which analysts attributed to heavy issuance as well  as increased volatility in 
broader financial markets.    
During the intermeeting period, Puerto Ri co suspended setting aside money for 
general obligation debt due in January 2016 and defaulted on $58 million of “moral

  obligation” bonds.5  Despite these events, yields on Puerto Rico’s general obligation 
bonds were little changed, on net, and overall credit conditions in municipal bond 
markets remained stable.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Credit conditions for reside ntial mortgages continued to  improve slowly over the 
intermeeting period.  Nevertheless, credit re mains tight for borrowers with low credit 
scores, hard-to-document income, or high debt-t o-income ratios.  Interest rates on 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages declined 6 basis points, in line with changes in agency MBS yields.     
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally 
accommodative over the summer, and the perf ormance of outstanding consumer loans 
was largely stable.  Credit card balances expa nded further in July against the backdrop of 
gradually easing lending standards, and student  and auto loans continued to be broadly 
available, even to borrowers with subprime credit scores.  Delinquency rates on credit 
card loans and auto loans stayed low through the second quarter.  That said, delinquency 
rates on recently originated subprime auto lo ans continued to edge  up, partly reflecting 
increased lending activity to the riskiest borro wers.  Indeed, average credit scores among 
borrowers purchasing both new and used vehi cles continued to trend down slightly.  
Delinquency rates on student loans remained elevated.  
Conditions in consumer ABS markets were  little changed over the intermeeting 
period.  Student loan ABS spreads remained particularly wide, apparently because rating agencies announced that they are going to revi ew for downgrade securities collateralized 
with legacy loans originat ed under the discontinued Fede ral Family Education Loan 
Program (FFELP).  The rating agencies attri buted their concerns to low repayment rates 
for the underlying loans, due in part to the in creased availability and use of structured 
repayment programs.

BANKING DEVELOPMENTS   
Growth of business loans on banks’ books remained robust, and bank lending to 
consumers continued to improve in July and August.  However, aggr egate credit provided 
                                                 
5 “Moral obligation” bonds are backed by a nonlegally binding pledge by a local legislature to 
appropriate the funds for repayment.  Bondholders have no legal right to compel payment.

  by commercial banks decelerated a bit, driven by a decline in the growth of securities.  
Holdings of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA)  decreased in the second quarter at banks 
subject to the standard liqui dity coverage ratio.  The d ecrease in HQLA, however, has 
likely had a minimal effect on banks’ liquidity  coverage ratios, as it has been coupled 
with a reduction in non-opera tional deposits provided by fina ncial institutions at a few 
global systemically importan t banking organizations.   
Profitability at BHCs increased slightly in the second quarter but remained below 
the levels observed in the decade prior to the financial crisis.  Net interest margins 
improved modestly last quarter , and noninterest income rose on increases in investment 
banking revenue and a pickup in mortgage activit y.  More recently, stock prices of large 
domestic BHCs declined about 8 percent, a b it more than the broade r stock market.  CDS 
spreads for the these BHCs moved up less than they did for other investment-grade firms, 
suggesting that global developments have ha d only a modest effect on perceived bank 
solvency.   
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
The Federal Reserve continued to te st RRP and TDF operations during the 
intermeeting period.7  Daily ON RRP take-up averaged about $83 billion, with money 
market funds continuing to account for most of  the participation.  Averages for overnight 
federal funds and Eurodollar rates were sl ightly higher than th ey were during the 
previous intermeeting period, although both rate s fell several basis points on the July and 
August month-ends.8  Rates in secured markets we re somewhat higher over the 
intermeeting period, while measures of funding pressure in short-term unsecured markets 
remained low. 
The Desk purchased $39 billion of agen cy MBS under the reinvestment program 
during the intermeeting period and did not ex ecute any dollar rolls.  The ratio of   
                                                 
7 The Federal Reserve offered a series of two overlapping TDF operations in August, with a total 
take-up of nearly $125 billion, slightly lower than the take-up at operations in May.  The FRBNY added 
5 new RRP counterparties, bringing the total number of  eligible nonprimary dealer counterparties to 146, 
just shy of the 150-counterparty limit.  In addition, the Desk announced two term RRP operations over the 
September quarter-end:  a seven-day operation on September 24 and a two-day operation on September 30, with a combined offer amount of at least $200 billion.   
8 The effective federal funds rate averaged 14 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 4 basis points.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  As before, we see the risks to our forecast for real GDP 
growth as weighted to the downside because neither monetary nor fiscal policy appears 
well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.  This downside skew is 
increased by the recent turbulence in financial markets as well as by the possibility of 
even greater weakness in the Chinese and other emerging market economies than we 
have assumed in our baseline projection.  Consistent with these downside risks to 
aggregate demand and with the further adjustments we introduced this round to the 
supply side of the projection, we now view the risks around our unemployment rate 
projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to the upside.  
(Previously, in light of the tendency of the unemployment rate to move lower than we 
expected, we viewed the risks around our unemployment projection as balanced —and 
thus not aligned in the intuitive manner with the GDP risks.)  
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, we 
continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.  TIPS-
based five-year forward inflation compensation has declined significantly and is back 
near its historic low.  Moreover, core PCE price inflation remains below the Committee’s 
target, raising the odds that we may be underestimating the degree of slack in the 
economy.  Furthermore, in light of the turmoil in China and elsewhere, major foreign 
central banks may continue to conduct aggressive policies to fight their own shortfalls in 
aggregate demand and cause the dollar to be stronger than in the baseline, leading to 
greater downward pressure on U.S. inflation than we have anticipated.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities of the U.S. 
financial system as moderate.  This assessment reflects low levels of leverage and 
maturity transformation in the banking sector and only modest growth in household debt.  
That said, borrowing by lower-rated nonfinancial firms has grown rapidly and leverage

 among these firms is near record highs.  Further, hedge fund leverage has risen.  And 
commercial real estate valuation pressures have continued to rise, with several of the 
leading price indexes moving back up to their pre-recession nominal peaks.  Finally, 
bond prices may be more volatile in response to stress than in the past given recent 
changes in the structure of bond market s. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first 
scenario illustrates potential consequences of increased financial volatility on the 
economy.  The second scenario looks at the possibility that productivity growth may pick 
up substantially as firms learn to take full advantage of new information technology.  In 
the third scenario, we examine the risks to our inflation outlook that stem from lower 
long-term inflation expectations.  The fourth and fifth scenarios consider the 
consequences either of a slowdown or of a full-blown crisis in the EMEs triggered by 
financial turmoil in China.   
We generate the first scenario in consultation with staff from the Federal Reserve 
Bank of New York using a DSGE model they developed that explicitly incorporates 
financial frictions.  The second scenario uses the EDO model.  The third scenario uses the 
FRB/US model.  The final two scenarios are generated using the multicountry SIGMA 
model.  The date of liftoff in each scenario is set using a mechanical procedure intended 
to be broadly consistent with the guidance provided in the Committee’s recent 
statements.  Once the federal funds rate has risen above its current target range, its 
movements are governed —as in the baseline forecast —by an inertial version of the 
Taylor (1999) rule.1  In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA 
portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
                                                 
1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations.  One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference betw een actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.  The policy 
rule in the New York Fed model also responds to such a measure of slack.

 Increa sed Financial Turbulence 
Measures of financial market volatility such as the VIX have spiked in recent 
weeks.  The spread of Baa-rated corporate bonds over Treasury securities, another 
measure of financial market turbulence, has risen about 75 basis points since the 
beginning of the year.  In this alternative scenario, we explore the consequences of a 
larger increase in the Baa spread.  The DSGE model underlying the scenario explicitly 
models risk spreads and is estimated using data on spreads.  In the scenario, we assume 
that the spread rises 200 basis points in the fourth quarter and then gradually returns to a 
more normal level. 
We attribute the source of the rise in spreads to an increase in household and 
investor risk aversion, resulting in a drop in aggregate demand and higher financing cost s 
for firms ’ capital expenditures.  Under these circumstances, the economy contracts 
sharply in the fourth quarter and the unemployment rate rises to 5½ percent by the end of 
the year before a gradual recovery gets under way in the middle of 2016.  Core PCE 
inflation is slightly below baseline for the entire simulation period.  The federal funds 
rate path is substantially lower. 
Productivity Growth Speeds Up 
Productivity growth in the recent past has been slower than its long-run average.  
This scenario considers the possibility that the current slowdown is only temporary and is 
in fact the harbinger of higher productivity gains in the future.  In particular, new forms 
of IT investment in cloud computing and mobility-enhancing technologies such as tablets 
and smartphones, as well as increased use of big data, may initially be difficult for firms 
to utilize efficiently.  Indeed, in the initial transition phase, implementing these 
innovations may actually impede gains in productivity.  Similar to the wave of IT-based 
productivity that began slowly in the 1980s and accelerated through the late 1990s, the 
payoffs for today’s IT may accelerate in future years.  This simulation assumes that 
productivity growth over the next five years will be around 2 percent per year, 
1 percentage point faster than in the baseline. 
The higher productivity growth causes output growth to pick up to above 
3 percent by 2017.  The unemployment rate is slightly lower than in the baseline starting 
in 2017, falling to 4.3 percent by the end of 2019.  The path for inflation is significantly 
lower, running at about 1 percent beyond 2015, as the product ivity shocks reduce firms’

 marginal cost of production and, hence, price pressure.  The federal funds rate takes a 
shallower path, reaching 50 basis points below baseline by the end of 2019, reflecting the 
net effects of substantially lower inflation readings and greater resource utilization. 
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
The extended period of below-target inflation experienced while at the zero lower 
bound could affect the long-term inflation expectations that are relevant for wage and 
price setting.  If beliefs about long-term inflation are formed adaptively based on realized 
past inflation, achieving convergence of inflation to the 2 percent target will be 
substantially more difficult.  This simulation assumes that consumers currently see long-
term inflation as equaling 1.5 percent (the average inflation rate of the past seven years) 
and form their long-term inflation expectations adaptively throughout the simulation.2 
The subdued inflation expectations and low actual inflation in the coming years 
are mutually reinforcing.  Inflation falls to 1.2 percent at the end of 2016 and does not 
rise above 1.5 percent until after 2019.  The overall path of the federal funds rate is 
significantly lower than in the baseline and increasingly so as the simulation continues.  
The paths of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged.  
China -Driven EME Slowdown 
Although our baseline forecast projects that growth in China will be reasonably 
solid, averaging about 6 percent over the next few years, downside risks to the outlook 
for China and the EMEs appear to have risen markedly.  Any number of developments —
including a bond default, a property market bust, or loss of confidence in the ability of the 
Chinese authorities to stabilize the economy —could interact with and amplify China’s 
many underlying financial vulnerabilities and possibly trigger a broad-based crisis.  In 
this scenario, we assume that China experiences a financial meltdown that also 
significantly weakens growth in other EME economies.          
  
                                                 
2 Long-term inflation is defined as the rate to which actual inflation would converge once resource 
utilization is at its maximum sustainable level and other shocks have washed out of the system.

 Specifically, our scenario assumes that China’s GDP falls about 7  percent below 
baseline over the next two years.  In response to the effects of this slump on trade, 
commodity prices, and financial conditions, GDP in other EMEs declines about 
3½ percent relative to baseline, in line with staff regression estimates of the effects of 
changes in Chinese GDP growth on other EMEs.  In addition, flight- to-quality flows into 
dollar-denominated assets contribute to an 8 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar 
and cause term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities and AFE government bonds to 
decline slightly. 
In response to weaker foreign economic growth and the appreciation of the dollar, 
U.S. real net exports decline relative to baseline and real GDP growth falls to only 
1¼ percent in 2016.  The unemployment rate climbs above 5 percent by late 2016, about 
¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Given the stronger dollar and lower 
resource utilization, core PCE inflation declines to less than 1 percent in 2016.  The 
federal funds rate follows a somewhat shallower path than in the baseline. 
China -Driven EME Crisis 
 This scenario builds on the previous scenario but assumes that China’s financial 
meltdown hits other EMEs much harder, triggering deeper financial disruptions that spill 
over to the rest of the global economy, including the United States.  Our scenario 
assumes that EME borrowing costs soar and that EME business and household 
confidence collapses.  EME real GDP —for both China and other EMEs —declines 
7 percent relative to baseline by the end of 2016, while EME currencies depreciate more 
than 20 percent against the dollar.  The effect on aggregate EME growth roughly parallels 
the growth slowdown that occurred during the Asian and Russian crises of the late 1990s, 
though the EME currency depreciation in the scenario is a little larger.  
In response to stresses in EMEs, corporate and household borrowing spreads rise 
sharply and equity prices sink in both the United States and AFEs, while flight- to-safety 
flows push down term premiums on government bond yields.  Commodity prices tumble 
and, partly because commodity currencies fall sharply, the broad real dollar appreciates 
17 percent above baseline.  With policy rates constrained by the zero lower bound in 
many AFEs, aggregate foreign GDP falls nearly 6 percent below baseline in 2016.  
In this environment, U.S. real net exports decline sharply relative to baseline in 
response to weaker foreign economic growth and the appreciation of the dollar.

 Moreover, tighter financial conditions and lower confidence reduce U.S. aggregate 
demand.  All told, U.S. real GDP contracts at an annual rate of about 1 percent in 2016, 
and the unemployment rate increases to 6½ percent in 2017, 1¾ percentage points higher 
than in the baseline.  The appreciation of the dollar and greater resource slack push down 
U.S. core PCE inflation to around zero in 2016.  The progressive widening of resource 
slack and subdued inflation imply that the federal funds rate returns to the zero lower 
bound in 2016 and remains there for about two years.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges f
or the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.
