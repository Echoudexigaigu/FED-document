Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook   
The information that we received since the previous Tealbook was mixed and left 
our outlook little changed on balance.  Indi cators of consumption and investment 
spending came in stronger than expected a nd point to solid growth in real private 
domestic final purchases in th e third and fourth quarters.  By contrast, we estimate that 
inventory investment, which was elevated in  the first half of the year, fell back 
significantly more than we ha d anticipated last quarter, and net exports continued to 
decline.  Moreover, the news on the la bor market and industrial production was 
disappointing, and these indicators seem consistent with some slowing in activity.  
Altogether, we now project that real GDP will expand at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in 
the second half of this year, a step-down from  the 2¼ percent pace in the first half of the 
year and a bit lower than in our September forecast. 
We have not taken signal from the recent data for activity beyond this year, and 
with our key conditioning assumptions little revised, on net, our medium-term projection 
is similar to that in September.  We e xpect real GDP growth to edge down from 
2¼ percent in 2016 to 1¾ percent in 2018.  By the end of the medium term, actual GDP 
is projected to exceed its poten tial by 1.0 percent, just 0.1 percentage point more than in 
the September Tealbook, and the unemployment ra te is projected to fall to 4.7 percent, 
the same as in our previous forecast. 
As for inflation, the CPI for September cam e in a little higher than we expected.  
In response, we raised our forecast for core inflation in both the third and fourth quarters 
by about 0.2 percentage point to 1.4 percent.  We also slowed the pace of the pass-
through of the summer’s oil price declines in to consumer energy pr ices based on recent 
readings on gasoline prices.  As  a result, headline PCE price in flation is now expected to 
be 0.4 percent in the current quarter, about ¾ percentage point higher than projected in 
September.  Beyond the near term, our inflation forecast is little cha nged:  We continue 
to project that both total and core inflation will gradually move up to 1.9 percent in 2018, 
as energy prices bottom out and start to incr ease moderately, import prices turn back up, 
and resource utilizati on tightens further.   
As always, numerous risks attend our outlook. We view the uncertainty around 
our projection for real GDP gr owth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is a little lower than the most recent Blue 
Chip Consensus Outlook and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) median 
projections. The staff’s forecast of the unemployment rate is a bit higher in 2016 
and the staff’s inflation projections are lower. Note that the SPF projection was 
completed in the first half of August and therefore does not reflect the effects of 
recent data releases and the volatility in financial markets since then.

line with the average over the past 20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility.  
We have maintained our assessment that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted 
somewhat to the downside and that the risk s to our unemployment rate projection are 
tilted to the upside, largely reflecting our view that neither monetary nor fiscal policy are well positioned to offset large adverse shocks to the economy.  Our concerns with respect 
to the inflation outlook remain mostly to the downside, given the risks to the real outlook 
as well as the low levels of market-based measures of inflation compensation and the 
hints of lower longer-term inflation expectations from some surveys. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We now assume that the federal funds ra te will lift off from its effective lower 
bound following the December meeting, and we continue to assume that it 
will be governed thereafter by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy 
rule.  The change to the timing of our liftoff assumption is broadly consistent 
with the responses to the “flash” Survey of Primary Dealers conducted 
following the September FOMC meeting as  well as expectations derived from 
the federal funds futures market, as both sources suggest that market 
participants see very low probability  of liftoff immediately following the 
October meeting.1  Despite the later liftoff assumption, by the end of 2018, the 
nominal federal funds rate is projected to be 3.1 percent, 0.1 percentage point 
higher than in our previous projection, largely reflecting the slightly tighter 
resource utilization in this projection. 
 The SOMA portfolio is assumed to rema in at its current size until about two 
quarters after the federal funds  rate is initially raised  above its effective lower 
bound, at which point the portfolio begins  to contract as  proceeds from 
maturing assets are not reinvested. 
1 Model simulations can provide a sense of the sens itivity of the outlook to the liftoff assumption. 
For example, if we had assumed that the federal funds rate would lift off two meetings later (that is, after 
the March 2016 meeting), the FRB/US model projects that the level of real GDP would be 0.2 percent 
higher by the end of 2018, the unemployment rate would be less than 0.1 percentage point lower, core 
inflation would be 2 basis points higher, an d the federal funds rate would be 8 basis points higher.  One 
reason for these very small deviations is that the simulation implicitly assumes that the public does not take 
signal from the delayed liftoff for either the monetary policymakers’ reaction functio n or for the outlook for 
economic activity or inflation.

Other Interest Rates 
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
significantly, reflecting the movement  of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates as well as an 
increase in the term premium toward its historically normal level.  Compared 
with the September Tealbook, the 10-y ear Treasury yield is a bit lower 
through 2016, mostly reflecting the recen t decline in market quotes, but is 
similar to the previous path thereafter.  
 We revised the paths for the 30-year mo rtgage rate and th e 10-year triple-B 
corporate bond rate mostly in line wi th the revision to Treasury yields. 
Compared with the September Tealbook, our projection implies a slightly 
wider spread of the 10-year triple-B corporate bond yield over those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securiti es, reflecting increases in market 
spreads for corporate bonds. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Our projection for equity prices is near ly unrevised as equity prices have 
increased, on net, about in line with our  previous projection.  After the current 
quarter, stock prices are proj ected to rise about 4 per cent per year on average.  
As before, by the end of the medium term  the equity premium is projected to 
be somewhat below its historical average. 
 We continue to expect house prices to rise about 5½ percent this year and then 
to increase 3 percent per year over the medium term.  One valuation metric 
that we monitor—the price-to-rent ra tio—suggests that housing is currently 
overvalued by 6 percent, compared with more than 40 percent a decade ago.  
Our forecast has rents rising slightly faster than house prices, bringing this 
measure back toward neutral. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We have made no changes to our fiscal policy assumptions in this forecast.  
We continue to anticipate that, afte r having been a small drag on real GDP 
growth last year, fiscal policy actions at all levels  of government provide a 
small boost to aggregate demand this year and over the medium term.

 The federal government faces multiple fiscal deadlines over the remainder of 
this year.  The two key items requiring action are lifting the federal debt limit, 
as the Treasury will reportedly exhaust its extraordinary measures no later 
than November 3, and enacting legi slation to fund the government by 
December 11, when the current continuing resolution expires.  We assume these deadlines will be navigated such that there are no significant disruptions to government operations or financial markets.
2 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 After expanding at an annual rate of  only 1 percent in the second quarter, 
foreign real GDP is estimated to have  risen at a still subdued 2¼ percent pace 
in the third quarter.  Although recent indicators of economic activity have 
been a touch weaker than expected  in a number of emerging market 
economies and in Japan, these disappoint ments have been offset by stronger-
than-expected growth in Canada and China.  We continue to expect foreign 
economic growth to pick up to just under 3 percent by the middle of 2016 and 
to remain close to that pace through 2018.  This projection reflects our expectation that the advanced economies  will continue to recover, supported 
by accommodative monetary policy, which in turn boosts exports and growth in the emerging market economies.  Ov erall, this outlook is little changed 
from our September projection. 
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated  around 1 percent, on net, since the 
time of the September Tealbook.  The dolla r fell against most currencies, as 
market participants shifted out the exp ected date for liftoff of the U.S. policy 
rate.  We expect the nominal dollar to rise a bit through the first quarter of 
next year—pushed up by monetary policy actions in the Un ited States and by 
concerns about the global economic ou tlook—and then to be little changed, on 
2 A short-term shutdown of the federal government would have only minor implications for the 
outlook.  For example, the staff estimates that the 16-day shutdown in October 2013 reduced real GDP 
growth by ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that year and boosted it by an equal amount in the 
following quarter.  This calculation embodies our judgment that there were no material effects on private 
investment or consumption owing to reduced confidence or increased uncertainty.  The consequences of a 
failure to lift the debt ceiling are not well understood and could potentially be large.  To date, the possibility 
of a failure to lift the debt limit has made only a small imprint on Treasury markets.  (See the box “Debt 
Ceiling Update and Review of 2013 Episode” in the Financial Developments section.)

net, over the medium term.  Our path  for the broad real dollar is about 
1 percent lower than in  the previous Tealbook. 
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 Oil markets have been relatively stab le since the September Tealbook.  Both 
the spot price of Brent crude oil and pri ces for futures contracts with delivery 
at the end of 2018 are down about $1 pe r barrel relative to the previous 
projection.  Consequently, our  forecast for the price of imported oil is also 
little changed.  We forecast that the pri ce of imported oil will move up slowly 
from about $45 per barrel this quarter to  about $53 per barr el by the end of 
2018, supported by a continued slow ing in U.S. oil production. 
 Our index for nonfuel commodity prices is  also little changed, on net, since 
the September Tealbook.  Over the forecast period, we expect nonfuel 
commodity prices to remain about fl at, in line with quotes from futures 
markets. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
After rising at an annual rate of 2¼ percen t over the first half of the year, real 
GDP is projected to increase 1¾ percen t in the second half .  Although spending 
indicators for the third quarter indicate solid growth in private domestic final purchases, GDP appears to have been held down by a sharp pullback in the pace of inventory 
accumulation and by a continued drag from net e xports.  As a result, we estimate that real 
GDP increased at an annual rate of just 1½ percent last quarter.
3  We expect growth to 
move up to a 2 percent pace in the current quarter. 
 Although the retail sales figures for Sept ember were disappointing, the recent 
data on consumer spending, taken as a whole, have been more upbeat than expected.  Data for spending on services and motor vehicles were particularly 
strong.  We now estimate that real PC E increased at an annual rate of 
3¼ percent in the third quarter—½ percentage point faster than in the 
3 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the system, at 
2 percent, is ½ percentage point higher than the staff’s judgmental projection.

September Tealbook.4  We expect real PCE growth to slow to 2¾ percent in 
the current quarter, largely reflecting an easing in motor vehicle purchases 
after two quarters of robust gains. 
 The incoming data on housing activity we re close to our expectations and 
continue to indicate a slow recovery in the sector.  The readings on housing 
starts point to solid growth in residen tial investment in the third quarter, but 
the more modest readings for permits are consistent with a much smaller 
advance in the current quarter. 
 Business fixed investment appears to ha ve posted a solid gain in the third 
quarter, with notable cont ributions both from equipment and intangibles and 
from structures outside of the drilling and mining sector.  We expect to see a 
more moderate increase in the fourth quarter, as outlays for transportation 
equipment drop back after an outsized gain  in the third quar ter.  In addition, 
drilling and mining investment app ears to be softening further.  
 A correction in inventory investment ha s occurred more rapidly than we had 
anticipated.  The data in hand indicate an abrupt step-down in stockbuilding in 
the third quarter, which we now estimate  subtracted nearly 1½ percentage 
points from GDP growth, a 1 percentage  point greater drag than in the 
September forecast.  In the fourth quarter, we assume that inventory 
investment will pick up somewhat and add ½ percentage point to real GDP 
growth. 
 Declines in net exports subtracted almost 1 percentage point from GDP 
growth in the first half of  the year and are projected to take ¾ percentage point 
off output growth in the second half.  This  projection is little changed from the 
September Tealbook.  Partly reflecting the lagged effect of past dollar 
appreciation, imports are expected to accelerate in the four th quarter after a 
couple of quarters of modest increases and export growth is expected to remain weak. 
 Industrial production conti nues to be held down by the effects of dollar 
appreciation as well as by the effects of low oil and gas prices on the energy

½ percentage point faster than in September.

sector and its upstream suppliers.  We now  estimate that total IP rose at an 
annual rate of just 1¾ percent in the thir d quarter, 1 percenta ge point less than 
in our previous projection, and we forecast that it will decline 2¼ percent in 
the current quarter.  The manufacturing portion of IP is expected to expand 
only a meager amount over the second half  of the year, consistent with the 
generally weak readings from the na tional and regional manufacturing surveys 
and despite solid gains in motor vehicle assemblies. 
Beyond the near term, real GDP is projected  to rise modestly faster than our 
estimate of potential.  But, largely becau se monetary accommodation wanes over time, 
GDP growth is projected to slow gradually, from 2¼ percen t in 2016 to 2 percent in 2017 
and to 1¾ percent in 2018.   
 We revised up our medium-term outlook for real GDP growth a touch in response to the lower projected path for the dollar. 
 As in previous Tealbooks, we expect above-trend growth in aggregate demand 
to be led by further solid gains in consumer spending.  As labor markets 
improve further, we project real personal in come to continue to rise faster than 
potential output; in addition, lagged effects of earlier increases in the wealth-
to-income ratio are anticipated to lead  to spending growth that modestly 
exceeds income growth.   
 As policy tightens and interest rate s rise, both consumer and business 
spending are expected to decelerate; this  deceleration is partially offset by a 
diminishing drag from net exports on GDP growth as the effects of the past 
appreciation of the dollar wane.  
 We have made no material changes to our supply-side assumptions in this 
projection.  We now expect that output will exceed its potential by 1.0 percent at the end of the medium term, just 0. 1 percentage point more than in the 
previous Tealbook.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The incoming data suggest that the pace of improvement in the labor market has 
slowed somewhat in recent months.   
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 140,000 in September, which was less than we 
had anticipated, and the figures for July and August were revised down.5  All 
told, payrolls are now estimated to have increased 170,000 per month in the third quarter, somewhat below the 210,000 pace in the first half of the year.  In response, we cut our projection for employment gains during the fourth 
quarter by 25,000 to 180,000 per month, similar to the third-quarter pace.   
 The unemployment rate held steady at 5.1 percent in September and averaged 
that rate for the third quarter as a whol e.  We continue to expect that the 
unemployment rate will edge down to  5.0 percent in the fourth quarter. 
 After holding steady at around 62.8 percen t for about a year and a half, the 
labor force participation rate has falle n surprisingly quickly in recent months, 
reaching 62.4 percent in September.  We suspect that a portion of the decline is statistical noise and project the participation rate  to edge up to 62.5 percent 
this quarter, still 0.1 percen tage point less than in our previous projection.  
Likewise, the employment-to-population ratio moved down in September to a level that we think is transitorily low,  and we expect to see an uptick this 
quarter.   
 The staff’s labor market conditions index was unchanged in September and 
indicated that labor market  conditions continued to improve only slowly in the 
third quarter. 
Given the small revisions to the GDP projection, the medium-term outlook for the 
labor market is little changed, on net, from our previous projection. 
 With output increasing faster than potential, the unemployment rate gradually 
moves down to 4.7 percent by 2018, unchanged from the September 
Tealbook.  (See the box “Alternative View :  Reconsidering Okun’s ‘Law’ ” 
5 By contrast, we had expected August payrolls to be revised up by an amount consistent with the 
revisions to August that we have seen in recent years. Altogether, the level of payroll employment in 
September was reported to be about 190,000 lower than we had projected.

for a different view of the relationship between output growth and changes in 
the unemployment rate.)  
 Monthly payroll gains are projected to slow from about 200,000 in 2015 to 
roughly 110,000 in 2018, as the pa ce of output growth eases. 
 Although the unemployment rate in the third quarter was at our estimate of its 
natural rate, we believe that some slack  remains in the labor market.  This 
judgment reflects our view that the labor  force participati on rate is still 
unusually low relative to its trend and th at the level of involuntary part-time 
employment is unusually high.  As the economy improves further, we expect 
additional individuals to be drawn into the labor market and the rate of involuntary part-time employment to m ove down, slowing the decline in the 
unemployment rate relative to th e improvement in the output gap. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Total PCE price inflation is projected to slow from an annual rate of 1.3 percent in 
the third quarter to 0.4 percen t in the current quarter, re flecting a sharp decline in 
consumer energy prices.  Core PCE price inflat ion is now anticipated to be 1.4 percent in 
both the third and fourth quarter s, restrained by further decr eases in core import prices, 
some pass-through into core prices of the earli er steep declines in energy prices, and the 
effects of residual seasonality.   
 The projection for core PCE price inflati on in the second half of this year is 
0.2 percentage point higher than in th e September Tealbook, as the CPI data 
for September were above expectations. 
 Our forecast for fourth-quarter headline PCE price inflation is ¾ percentage 
point above our previous projection, reflecting a slower-than-expected 
unwinding of the abnormally wide marg ins between retail gasoline and crude 
oil prices observed this past summer as well as the upward revision to core 
inflation. 
 Prices for core goods imports are expect ed to decline at an annual rate of 
2¼ percent over the second half of 2015, pushed down by the earlier rise in 
the dollar and declines in commodity prices.  This projection is slightly more 
negative than in the September Tealbook, reflecting recent trade price data.

Alternative  View:  Reconsidering  Okun's  “Law ”
Okun's  law  has  played  an important  role  in monetary  policymaking.  Because  potential  
output  is not  observable,  it is difficult  to directly  measure  the output  gap  (defined  as the 
deviation  of output  from  its potential).  In 1962,  Arthur  Okun  devised  a shortcut  to estimate  
potential  output  based  on a mapping  between  the unemployment  gap  (defined  as the 
difference  between  the actual  unemployment  rate  and  the natural  rate  of unemployment)  
and  the output  gap. *  1 Starting  from  the following  identity
Stability, ”JournaloftheEuropeanEconomicAssociation , vol. 7 (June),pp.  671-96.  Y H E L[math ][math]
Okun  found  that  a 1 percent  change  in output  (Y) relative  to its potential  level  (Y*) can  be 
decomposed  into  deviations  of these  components  from  their  respective  trends,  with  roughly  
1/3 of the  movement  showing  in labor  productivity  (Y/H), 1/6 in change  in hours  per employee  
(H/E), 1/3 in the employment  rate  (E/L), and  the remaining  1/6 in the labor  force  participation  
rate  (L/N). This  decomposition  implied  a linear  mapping  between  the output  gap  and  the 
gap of the unemployment  rate (U=1-E/L)  from  its natural  rate (U*), a relationship  that  
became  known  as Okun's  law:
U-U*  = -1/3  x(Y-  Y*)/Y*.
Givenanestimateofthenatural  rate anddata  on output  andthe  jobless  rate, onecan  easily  
back  out an estimate  of the level of potentia l output.  However,  the law relies  on the strong  
assumptions  that  the natural  rateismoreeasilymeasuredthanpotential  output,  andthat  
theothercomponents —such  as laborforce  participation,  the workweek  of labor,  and 
productivity —have  a stable  relationship  with  the state  of the business  cycle,  as summarized  
by the output  gap.
There  is, however,  evidence  pointing  to instability  in the statistical  relationships  underlying  
Okun's  law. Among  others,  productivity  has become  noticeably  less procyclical  than  in 
Okun's  era. Figure  1 shows  that  starting  in the early  1990s,  labor  productivity  has had 
negative  correlationswithoutputandhoursworked. 2 This  change  could  imply  that  the 
Okun's  law  coef ficient  is now  larg er in absolut e magnitude  than in the  orig inal formulation  
(the “1/3”intheequationabove),  as larger chang es in the  emp loyment  rate are  needed  to 
offset  the countercyclical  variation  in productivity.  The correlation  change  also implies  that,  
all else  being  equal, total hours  worke d shoul d now  vary  more  than output.  Figure2,  
showing  the ratio  of the standard  deviations  of hours  and output,  confirms  this greater  
variance  in hours  worked:  Before  the early  1990s,  outputwasmorevolatilethanhours,but  
since  then,  hours  have  become  more  volatile  than  output.
Unless  they  were  completely  offsetting,  changes  in the cyclical  properties  of the various  
components  of the Okun's  law identity  would  cause  the Okun's  law coefficient  itself  to be

However,theinstitutionalfeaturesunderlyingtheoriginalOkun'slawhavechanged.  The

This  concl usion  has  pract ical importance.  To high light  the  risk  associated  with  the  use  of 
Okun'slawformonetarypolicystrategy,let  us assume  that  the  rece nt plung e in the  Okun' s 
law coefficient  is persistent.  Consider  the Taylor(1999)rule,which  recommends  to move  
the  nominal  interest  rate  as much  as change s in the  output  gap. In the  absenc e of a direc t

become  too  tight if unem ployment  moves  below  the  curr ent estima te of the  natur al rate.

We expect import prices to flatten out in the first half of 2016 and to begin 
increasing at a 1 percent pace in the second half, consistent with moderate 
foreign inflation and the relatively flat trajectories for the dollar and 
commodity prices.   
Beyond the near term, core PCE price inflat ion is projected to edge up gradually 
from 1.4 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2018, as import prices turn back up, the 
effects on core inflation of th e previous large declines in energy prices dissipate, and 
resource utilization continues to tighten in  an environment of we ll-anchored inflation 
expectations.  With consumer food and energy prices projected to rise roughly in line 
with core prices after the firs t quarter of next year, total PC E inflation is expected to run 
at nearly the same pace as core inflation throughout the medium term.  
 The medium-term projection for inflation is almost identical to that in the September Tealbook.  
 Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable over the intermeeting period but at  the lower end of the ranges seen in 
recent years.  (The box “Survey Measures of Longer-Term Inflation 
Expectations” reviews this survey evidence.)  Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation have moved down appreciably since 
August 2014 and edged down further, on net, during the intermeeting period.  
(See the box “The Recent Declin e in Longer-Horizon Inflation 
Compensation” in the Financial Developm ents section for further discussion.) 
We have received little information on labor compensation since the previous 
Tealbook.  Average hourly earnings rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in 
September, similar to the increase over the prior12 months.  Over the medium term, we 
expect a gradual acceleration in compensa tion as the labor market tightens.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The federal funds rate continues to be se t according to the prescriptions of an 
inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) rule.  As in the previous Tealbook, the 
policy rule assumes a long-run equilibriu m level of the nominal federal funds 
rate of 3¼ percent.

 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.  
The SOMA portfolio is projected to  return to a normal size by 2021. 
 The federal funds rate rises furthe r after 2018.  With the economy running 
above its potential level and inflati on reaching the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective, the federal funds rate moves above its long-run value in 2019 and 2020.  
 In 2019 and 2020, the natural rate of unemployment remains at 5.1 percent 
and potential GDP rises about 1¾ percent per year on average. 
 As monetary policy continues to tighte n, real GDP growth gradually slows to 
1½ percent by 2020 and the unemployment rate remains at 4¾ percent. 
 PCE price inflation reaches the Committee’s long-run objective of 2 percent 
in 2019, reflecting tight resource utiliza tion along with our assumption that 
longer-run inflation expectations will ev entually edge up from current levels.

Survey Measures of Longer-Term Inflation Expectations 
An important assumption underlying the staff’s inflation forecast is that 
longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored and that they will 
remain so over the projection period . The staff tracks a number of measures 
of longer-term inflation expectations, including surveys, to monitor potential 
shifts in inflation expectations.  Measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations from five surveys are shown in the exhibit on the next page.1 
These surveys encompass different types of respondents and different 
measures of inflation.  Three sets of respondents are represented in the 
exhibit: professional forecasters and financial industry participants (the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Consensus Outlook, and the 
Survey of Primary Dealers), households (the Michigan Surveys of Consumers), and businesses (the Atlanta Fed Survey of Business Inflation Expectations).  
Additionally, the surveys capture different inflation concepts: The surveys of 
professionals explicitly reference expectations of CPI or PCE price index 
inflation, while the Michigan survey does not reference a specific price index 
but instead asks households about prices generally. The Atlanta Fed survey, 
instead of asking about prices, asks businesses in the Sixth District about 
their expectations for growth of their own overall u nit costs.  
In general, the se survey measures suggest that longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained fairly stable over the course of the recession and 
recovery and are little different than they were prior to the recession.  This 
result is consistent with the staff’s assumptio n of anchored longer-term 
inflation expectations , and it may be somewhat surprising given the 
considerable changes in the unemployment rate over the past eight years , 
the volatility in financial markets, and the decline in oil prices since mid-2014 . 
Some of the survey measures could be interpreted as drifting down in recent 
years; however, given the usual volatility o f these surveys, it is difficult to 
distinguish noise from the beginning of a downward drift. For example, 
nearly all measures that appeared to have edged down earlier this year have 
ticked up in their recent readings (the Michigan survey is an exception). 
1 Surveys of inflation expectations over s horter h orizons —such as the New York Fed’s 
Survey of Consumer Exp ectations, which asks about expectations over th e next three years
are not shown.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign real GDP growth appears to have picked up from a tepid 1 percent annual 
rate in the second quarter to a still modest 2¼ percent in the third quarter, a touch above 
our September Tealbook projection.  Much of this pickup reflects a rebound in Canada, 
where energy production recovered from previous disruptions by wildfires and 
manufacturing exports were boosted by past currency depreciation.  In addition, GDP 
contractions that held down overall growth in the second quarter are expected to 
moderate in Brazil and Taiwan and to turn to a slight expansion in Japan. Third-quarter 
Chinese GDP growth came in surprisingly strong. 
We continue to expect foreign growth to rise to nearly 3 percent in 2016 and to 
remain around that pace through 2018.  Accommodative monetary policy and low oil 
prices should support continued recovery in the advanced economies, which in turn boosts exports and growth in the emerging market economies (EMEs). 
The projected rate of foreign growth is quite modest by historical standards. Even 
so, it is possible that we have overestimated the strength of the foreign recovery. Indeed, 
over 2015 our forecasts for a pickup in for eign growth have repeatedly been too 
optimistic, as growth initially weaken ed to 1¾ percent in the first quarter of this year 
before dropping further in the second quarter.  In addition, global trade, one indicator of 
global growth, remains subdued after falling sharply earlier in the year.  Hence, the pace 
of the foreign expansion could well continue to fall short of our baseline projection.  That 
said, we cannot rule out the possibility that extraordinarily accommodative monetary 
policy, very low oil prices, and balance sheet repair could boost activity in the advanced 
economies more than we currently anticipate, which would in turn support EME growth ; 
such a scenario, “ Faster Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar ,” is described in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section. 
We still view the risks as tilted to the downside, however.  In particular, 
notwithstanding the easing in market pressures in recent weeks, we cannot discount the 
possibility of an EME financial crisis.  EMEs remain vulnerable to shifts in investor

sentiment against the background of subdued growth and reduced commodity prices (see 
the box “Emerging Mar ket Stresses and Vulnerabilities ”). An adverse shock, such as a 
financial crisis in Brazil or a sharp slowdown in China, could trigger a resurgence of 
financial turbulence in EMEs that spills over to the rest of the global economy.  (See the 
scenario “Emerging Market Economy Slump” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.) We 
do not expect the tightening of U.S. monetary policy itself to precipitate an EME crisis, 
but rising interest rates and some further appreciation of the dollar could exacerbate 
stresses on some EMEs. 
Falling retail energy prices will likely hold down headline inflation in the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs) in the current quarter.  We have marked down our 
fourth-quarter inflation forecast for these economies by nearly ½ percentage point to 
½ percent.  We expect AFE inflation to remain low in the near term, especially in the euro area and Japan, and to then rise to 1¾ pe rcent by 2018 as the effects of past oil price 
declines wane and economic slack diminishes.  Fading drag from energy prices should also result in a pickup of inflation in emerging Asia, from 2 percent in the current quarter 
to 2¾ percent over the rest of the forecast period.  In South America, the decline in commodity prices since mid-2014 has triggered sizable currency depreciations, which in 
turn have temporarily boosted import prices and inflation.  As these effects fade, inflation in the region should decline from 8¼ percent in the current quarter to 6 percent in 2017 
and 2018.   
In light of pe rsistently low inflation and elevated uncertainty about global growth 
prospects, we now assume easier macroeconomic policy abroad.  We expect the Bank of 
Japan (BOJ) to expand its asset purchases, and we anticipate that the Bank of England 
(BOE) will wait longer to begin raising rates. In addition, Taiwan, India, and Singapore 
eased monetary policy during the intermeeting period, and we expect some further policy 
easing in emerging Asia. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES

1 percentage point higher than we had expected at the time of the September 
Tealbook.1 Although industrial production and exports were soft for the 
quarter as a whole, they turned up in September, and the economy was also 
supported by surprisingly strong growth in services. In response to these 
signs of stronger momentum, we raised our projection for the current quarter 
by ¼ percentage point to 6½ percent.  W e continue to see growth gradually 
edging down to 6 percent by the end of the forecast period, in line with a 
decline in China’s potential growth.  Inflation rose to 3¼ percent in the third 
quarter, owing mostly to a rise in pork price inflation that we expect to be 
short li ved.  We expect inflation to fall back to 2½ percent by next year. 
Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that growth in the region rose from a 
mere 1½ pe rcent rate in the second quarter to a still weak 2½ pe rcent pace in 
the third quarter, about ½ percentage point less than predicted.  Growth in the 
second quarter was held down by the adverse effect of MERS ( Middle-East 
Respiratory Syndrome) in Korea, as well as sharp declines in exports and manufacturing in Singapore and Taiwan.  Recent data suggest that these drags 
diminished somewhat in the third quarter.  In Korea, rebounds in the service 
industry, tourism, and consumer and business confidence since June point to a 
quick recovery from the MERS outbreak.  In Singapore, preliminary third-
quarter GDP data indicate that manufacturing activity stabilized and growth 
improved.  Similarly, in Taiwan, a reduced pace of contraction in the 
manufacturing sector suggests that GDP fell at a slower pace in the third 
quarter. 
We expect growth in the region to rise further to 3½ percent in the fourth 
quarter and to 4 percent in 2016, supported by a firming of external demand 
and accommodative policies.  Indeed, central banks in India, Singapore, and Taiwan eased monetary policy during the intermeeting period, and several 
countries, including Korea and Taiwan, have announced fiscal stimulus 
1 The release of a new quarterly GDP series by the Chinese authorities led to a downward revision 
of about ½ percentage point in our estimate of second-quarter growth and an upward revision by a similar 
amount in first-quarter growth.

Emerging Market Stresses and Vulnerabilities 
Since midMay, and particularly following China’s surprise devaluation on August 11, emerging 
market economies (EMEs) have come under increased financial stress, with EME focused 
mutual funds experiencing large outflows (the bars in figure 1), and many EMEs suffering sharp 
currency depreciations and rising CDS premiums on their sovereign bonds (the red line). As 
shown in the table, EME asset prices have fallen sharply since midMay, with declines 
reminiscent of the 2013 “taper tantrum,” notwithstanding some recent improvement. 
Although financial stresses worsened over the summer, concerns about emerging market 
vulnerabilities had been building for some time, reflecting a combination of slowing econo mic 
activity, declining commodity prices, and rising levels of emerging market corporate debt. 
These concerns were exacerbated by developments in China, where a string of disappointing 
data releases in August, a renewed plunge in the stock market, and the unexpected decision to 
devalue the renminbi led to fears regarding the outlook for the Chinese economy. Given China’s 
importance as a consumer of commodities, this devaluation led to renewed worries regarding 
the outlook for major commodity exporters, as well as for China’s major trade partners. 
Anticipation of U.S. monetary policy normalization have likely also played a role, raising 
concerns about capital outflows, further currency depreciations, and debt servicing burdens of 
EME corporate borrowers, especially those who have borrowed heavily in U.S. dollars. Indeed, 
the modest rally in EME assets in recent weeks, as markets have pushed out expectations for a 
U.S. rate hike, suggest that this has been a contributing factor. But the role of U.S. monetary 
policy in contributing to the increases in EME stress appears to be smaller than during the taper 
tantrum. In 2013, CDS spreads rose in tandem with the increase in U.S. Treasury yields (line 4 in 
the table), and as shown in line 5, the correlation between these two variables was 0.9. During 
the recent episode, by contrast, this correlation has reversed: U.S. Treasury yields have 
declined since midJune, while CDS spreads have risen considerably. 
The importance of concerns over Chinese and global growth, and the related decline in 
commodity prices, can be seen in the greater deteriora tion in financial conditions for 
commodity exporters relative to other vulnerable EMEs. Figure 3 presents the evolution of the 
EME vulnerability index we constructed during the taper tantrum, calculated separately for 
commodity exporters and commodity importers, with higher values indicating greater 
vulnerability.1 According to our index, there has been a large increase in vulnerability since 2012 
for commodity exporters (the red line), while for the majority of commodity importers the 
vulnerability ranking has fallen (the blue line). As shown in figure 4, net commodity exporters 
have also suffered larger currency depreciations. For example, since midMay, the currencies of 
Korea, India, and the Philippines (all commodity importers) have remained relatively stable, 
while those of commodity exporting Brazil, Russia, Colombia, and Malaysia have depreciated 
1 The vulnerability index is composed of six key macroeconomic and financial indicators: (1) the ratio of the 
current account to GDP, (2) the ratio of public debt to GDP, (3) the average inflation rate over a three year 
window, (4) the ratio of reserves to GDP, (5) the change in the ratio of domestic credit to GDP in the past five 
years, and (6) the ratio of external debt to total exports (capturing, in part, the risks presented by dollar 
liabilities). Countries are ranked annually according to these indicators, from “1” (low vulnerability) to “5” (high 
vulnerability). The index is calculated from 1980 to 2015.

15 percent or more. Idiosyncratic factors have also played an important role in some high
profile EMEs. Political concerns have contributed to the financial market stresses in Malaysia, 
while the corruption scandal involving the government owned oil company Petrobras has 
added to Brazil’s stresses. However, many of Brazil’s current difficulties are due to structural 
problems and policy mismanagement, which have resulted in high inflation, excessive credit 
growth, and high debt levels and have led to its current status as the most vulnerable EME in 
our sample. 
In sum, investor concerns over EMEs appear to reflect a host of factors, including weaker than
anticipated data releases for EMEs and China, in particular, declines in commodi ty prices, 
concerns over emerging market corporate borrowers, and anticipation of U.S. policy 
normalization. However, the particular strain faced by commodity exporters suggests that 
concerns over China’s growth prospects and those of the global economy more broadly, and 
over the strength of global commodity demand, likely played the dominant role in driving the 
recent bout of stress. Going forward, any number of developments could result in additional 
strains in EMEs, but we are not anticipating a fullblown crisis. That said, we do expect EME 
growth to remain subdued throughout the forecast, with financial conditions fragile and risks of 
more disruptive events elevated.

measures in recent months.  We have inflation in the region dipping to 
1½ pe rcent in the third quarter, reflecting lower retail energy prices and lo wer 
food prices in India due to a good harvest.  As these effects subside, we expect 
inflation to rise to around 3¼ percent by the middle of next year. 
 Latin America. We estimate that in Mexico, real GDP edged up to 
2¼ percent in the third quarter from 2 percent in the second quarter, as a 
pickup in U.S. manufacturing production lift ed Mexican exports.  Indicators 
of domestic demand were mixed, with vehicle sales strengthening and 
employment growing despite a continued deterioration in consumer 
confidence. Overall, we expect growth to remain at 2¼ pe rcent in the fourth 
quarter and then rise to 3 percent by mid-2016, supported by further growth in 
U.S. manufacturing, the lagged effects of past currency depreciation, and the 
2013 energy-sector reforms.    
Mexican inflation edged up to 3 percent in the third quarter, and we expect it 
to rise a touch further to 3¼ percent by early next year.  Given the weak tone 
of the incoming macro data and subdued inflation, we now expect the Bank of 
Mexico to wait until the first quarter of 2016 (one quarter later than previously 
assumed) to hike its policy rate, which currently stands at 3 percent, and we 
have reduced the pace of tightening thereafter. 
In Brazil , depressed prices of commodity exports, monetary policy tightening, 
persistent political tensions, and the associated uncertainty about the fiscal 
outlook continued to weigh on economic activity. While exports and the PMI 
improved somewhat late in the third quarter, industrial production, retail sales, and consumer and business confidence fell further. Accordingly, we estimate 
that real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 4 percent in the third quarter 
following a 7¼ percent decline in the second quarter.  We expect growth to 
turn positive next year and to pick up to a still sluggish 2 percent in 2017, as 
the weaker real and firming global growth boost exports and moneta ry policy 
begins to ease by mid-2016.  Despite the weak economy, the substantial depreciation of the real and increases in administered prices kept inflation at a

10 percent annual rate in the third quarter.  We expect inflation to decline to 
5½ percent by mid-2017, reflecting past policy tightening and lower pressure 
from administered prices. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
 Canada. Earlier this year, real GDP contracted as low oil prices weigh ed 
heavily on investment in the energy sector and wildfires temporarily disrupted energy production.  More recently, energy production rebounded and manufacturing activity picked up, leading July monthly GDP to surge at a 
4 percent annual rate.  Accordingly, w e now estimate that GDP grew at a 
2½ percent pace in the third quarter, stronger than in the September Tealbook.  
Looking ahead, we expect growth to average a bit more than 2 pe rcent 
through 2016, as investment recovers, exports are supported by past currency 
depreciation, and monetary policy remains accommodative.  Thereafter, 
growth should edge down to a near-potential pace of 1¾ percent by the end of 
2017.  
We estimate that inflation held steady at 2½ percent in the third quarter, as 
past currency depreciation boosted core inflation, offsetting the drag from 
falling retail energy prices.  We expect inflation to moderate to 1½ percent in 
the fourth quarter and then rise to th e Bank of Canada’s (BOC) 2 percent 
target by 2017 as the output gap closes and energy prices pick up. With 
inflation pressures contained, we continue to anticipate that the BOC will not 
start raising rates until the first quarter of 2017. 
On October 19, Canada’s Liberal Party was elected to a majority government, 
ending nearly a decade of Conservative Party rule.  Prime Minister designate 
Justin Trudeau’s platform included stimulating the economy by boosting 
infrastructure spending and running modest deficits.  However, the extent and 
timing of any additional fiscal stimulus is unclear at this stage.

 Japan. We project that real GDP rose ½ percent in the third quarter following 
a contraction in the second quarter.  Consumption bounced back in August, 
and the BOJ’s Tankan survey indicated that business confidence held up 
relatively well.  However, we marked down our third-quarter growth estimate 
by ¾ percentage point relative to the September Tealbook, as industrial 
production unexpectedly declined in August for a second consecutive month. 
Looking ahead, we continue to expect that GDP growth will rise to 1 percent in 2016, supporte d by ongoing monetary easing and low oil prices, before a 
second hike in the consumption tax stalls the expansion in 2017. 
The consumer price index appears to have remained flat in the third quarter, 
and we forecast mild deflation in the current quarter.  However, these low inflation readings largely reflect falling retail energy prices.  As the effects of 
past declines in oil prices dissipate and the output gap narrows, we project that 
inflation (excluding the direct effect of the consumption tax hike) will rise to 
1 percent in 2016 and to 1¼ pe rcent in 2017 and 2018.  With inflation 
persisten tly below the BOJ’s 2 percent inflation target, we now anticipate that 
the Japanese central bank will further expand its asset purchase program in 
early 2016 and continue to accumulate assets through the end of 2017, one 
year longer than previously assumed.  However, since 10-year sovereign 
yields have already fallen to about 30 basis points, it is unclear how much 
scope remains for additional asset purchases to compress yields and boost 
inflation. 
 Euro Area. Our GDP forecast for the euro area is little changed.  Recent 
indicators suggest that growth edged up to just above 1½ percent in the third 
quarter, supported by firming domestic demand.  We expect GDP to grow at 
about a 2 percent pace over the next three years, supported by ongoing 
monetary stimulus, past currency depreciation, low oil prices, and easing credit conditions.  Headline inflation dropped from 2¼ percent in the second 
quarter to negative ¼ percent in the third quarter, reflecting a sharp decline in 
retail energy prices ; core inflation remained stable at 1¼ percent.  As the drag

from energy prices moderates and the output gap narrows, w e expect headline 
inflation to rise to a ¼ percent pace in the fourth quarter and then to 
1¾ pe rcent by the end of 2018.  This projection is about ½ percentage point 
lower for the fourth quarter and little changed thereafter.  We continue to 
expect the European Central Bank to pur chase assets for at least a few months 
beyond September 2016, the originally intended end date for the asset 
purchase program, and to keep its main policy rate near zero until the second 
half of 2018.2 
In Greece , Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras’ s Syriza party won national 
parliamentary elections by a surprisingly large margin and formed a new 
government.  Subsequently, the Greek government legislated a new package 
of fiscal consolidation measures and began preparing a new legal framework 
for bank recapitalization.  Both are important steps toward unlocking another 
disbursement of off icial financing, but negotiations over the disbursement 
have not yet concluded. 
 United Kingdom .  Recent economic indicators have been mixed, with 
industrial production growing robustly while the services PMI and consumer 
confidence have weakened.  All told, we estimate that GDP growth remained 
at a 2½ percent pace in the third quarter, and we expect growth to continue 
near that pace throughout the forecast period.  Consumer prices rose at a 
1 percent pace in the third quarter, ¾ percentage point below our September 
Tealbook projection, as retail energy prices fell more sharply than expected.  
Given recent declines in retail energy prices, we project inflation to slow to 
½ percent in the fourth quarter.  Inflation should rise to th e BOE’s 2 percent 
target by 2017, as the effects of past oil price declines dissipate and slack in 
the economy is eliminated.  With recent improvements in productivity

2 When President Draghi announced the expanded asset purchase program on January 22, 2015, he 
said asset purchases “are intended to be carried out until end -September 2016 and will in any case be

Financial Developments 
Continued concerns about the globa l growth outlook weighed on market 
sentiment early in the intermeeting period, bu t sentiment improved somewhat in recent 
weeks.  Following the weaker-than-expect ed September employment report, market 
participants shifted their expectations toward a later timing of policy rate liftoff as well as 
a more accommodative path for monetary policy further out.  Financing conditions for 
most businesses and households remained generally accommodative but tightened somewhat for businesses with lower credit quality. 
 The odds that market participants assigned to an initial increa se in the federal 
funds rate target range occurring by year-end declined notably, and the 
expected path of the federal funds rate over the next few years implied by OIS 
quotes flattened. 
 TIPS-based measures of inflation co mpensation declined on net.  The 
5-to-10-year measure of TIPS-base d inflation compensation hit a new 
post-crisis low early in the period but bounced back somewhat in recent weeks 
(see the box on inflation compensa tion later in this section). 
 The staff’s broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar declined 
about 1 percent on net. 
 The VIX moved down, on balance, and ende d the period near the middle of its 
range over the past few years.  The S&P 500 index was up slightly on net.   
 Spreads on investment-grade bonds rose a bit, while those on speculative-
grade bonds increased notably, reaching near the top of their range since mid-
2012. 
 On net, banks reportedly eased lending standards for several categories of 
loans to households and experienced increased loan demand across most 
major loan portfolios during the third quarter.
1 
 Reflecting the possibility of the Tr easury Department exhausting its 
extraordinary measures and cash in mid-November, Treasury bill yields for 
securities maturing around the estimated  breach date have begun to increase 
(see the box on the debt ceiling la ter in this section).

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 
Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases over the 
intermeeting period appeared to have led investors to scale back th eir expectations of 
liftoff before year-end.  September FOMC communications were viewed by market 
participants as more accommodative than e xpected.  Although the FOMC’s decision to 
retain the target range of 0 to ¼ percent for the federal funds rate was largely consistent 
with investors’ modal expectations, materi al odds had been att ached to a September 
liftoff.  Investors also appa rently interpreted the statement as signaling increased 
concerns among FOMC members about downs ide risks to the U.S. economic outlook 
associated with recent global and financial developments.  Although market participants 
took note of comments by several policymakers over the intermeeti ng period, including 
the Chair’s remarks on September 24, that a firs t interest rate increase remained likely by 
year-end, the weaker-than-expe cted employment report and retail sales release for 
September and subsequent communications by FOMC members led i nvestors to further 
revise down expectations for an in terest rate hike this year.  
According to federal funds futures quot es, investors now see about a 30 percent 
chance of liftoff occurring before year-end, dow n from about 65 percent just prior to the 
September FOMC meeting, while  the likelihood of liftoff occurring at or after the March 
2016 meeting rose.  The expected federal funds  rate path implied by OIS quotes flattened 
notably over the intermeeting peri od, with the expected rate at the end of 2016 and at the 
end of 2017 declining 27 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively. 
Similar to financial market quotes, the average probability distribution from the 
Desk’s October surveys of prim ary dealers and market participants shifted toward later 
liftoff dates relative to the September survey s.  The average probability assigned to a 
December liftoff increased to 35 percent from 27 percent, and the average probability 
assigned to liftoff in March or later increased to 50 percent from 21 percent.  The average 
pace of tightening in the first two years fo llowing liftoff, conditioned on not returning to 
the zero lower bound, declined somewhat.  
Nominal Treasury yields fell further ove r the intermeeting period, reflecting the 
overall more-accommodative-than-anticipated FOMC communications, global growth 
concerns, and the generally w eaker-than-expected economic da ta releases.  Yields on 2-, 
5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securiti es declined 18, 21, and 22 basis points,

respectively.  Near-term uncer tainty about longer-term interest rates, measured by 
6-month-ahead swaption-implied volatilitie s on the 10-year swap rate, edged down. 
The 5- and 5-to-10-year measures of TIPS-based inflation compensation posted 
further declines on net.  Early in the inte rmeeting period amid global growth concerns, 
the 5-to-10-year measure hit a new post-cr isis low before bouncing back somewhat, 
together with risk asset prices.  (See th e box “The Recent Decline in Longer-Horizon 
Inflation Compensation.”)  Inflation comp ensation measures based on inflation swaps 
posted similar changes.   
MBS yields declined about in line with  the 10-year Treasury yield, while option-
adjusted spreads on production-coupon MBS pos ted somewhat mixed changes.  Liquidity 
conditions in the Treasury and MBS market s remained stable over the intermeeting 
period.2 
Market participants were attentive to Treasury Secretary Lew’s announcement 
that the Treasury expects to exhaust extraord inary measures that al low it to operate under 
the statutory debt limit no later than November  3, at which point it anticipates having less 
than $30 billion in cash on hand.  The staff anticipates that the Treasury can continue 
operations with these funds until mid-Novemb er without breaching the debt ceiling.  At 
present, Treasury bill yields for securities maturing around that time have begun to 
increase.  However, CDS spreads on U.S. government debt have been little changed, and the gross notional amount of U.S. governme nt CDS outstanding has continued to edge 
down.  Even so, the Treasury’s reduction in bill issuance to keep under the debt ceiling 
has reportedly put some downward pressure on secured money market rates.  Moreover, 
considerable uncertainty remains as to the resolution of the deba te and its potential 
effects on financial markets.  (See the box “Debt Ceiling Update and Review of 2013 
Episode.”) 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
The dollar waxed and waned over the inte rmeeting period as markets alternately 
focused on concerns about growth abroad a nd changing expectations for U.S. monetary 
policy.  On net, the dollar depreciated 1 per cent against the currencies in the staff’s broad

The Recent Decline in Longer‐Horizon Inflation Compensation 
Measures of 5to10year inflation compensation from TIPS and from inflation swaps have 
declined notably, on net, since August 2014. After rebounding somewhat earlier this year, they 
have fallen further since early July and reached new historic lows in late September. Similar 
movements are observed for longer horizon inflation compensation in the euro area (figure 1). 
Over the same period, the price for oil declined more than 50 percent, and the dollar 
strengthened significantly (figure 2). 
The positive comovement between the price for oil and longer horizon inflation compensation 
and the negative relationship between inflation compensation and the dollar are puzzling, as one 
would expect lower energy or import prices to affect near to intermediate term inflation 
expectations but not those further out. One explanation is that these correlations may reflect a 
common factor—risk sentiment—that drives all three asset prices.1 Indeed, a closer look at the 
daily price movements since mid2014 indicates that the positive correlation between oil prices 
and inflation compensation occurred mostly on days when oil and equity prices and Treasury 
yields showed large declines and the dollar appreciated, likely reflecting deteriorating risk 
sentiment.2 In addition, a regression of daily changes in longer horizon inflation compensation on 
daily changes in oil prices and in the VIX—a popular proxy for time varying risk aversion—shows 
that changes in the VIX have significant explanatory power for changes in inflation compensation, 
and the estimated sensitivity of inflation compensation to oil price changes is substantially 
reduced once the VIX is included.3 
1 According to some market participants, another possible reason for the pass through from lower oil prices 
and a stronger dollar to longer horizon inflation compensation is that, in response to changes in the near term 
inflation outlook, investors are more likely to adjust their positions in the more liquid longer term TIPS, resulting in 
changes in inflation compensation further out. 
2 Alejandro Perez Segura and Robert Vigfusson’s October 15, 2015, staff memo, “The Relationship between Oil 
Prices and Inflation Compensation,” refers to oil price changes on days when oil, stock, and metal prices move in 
the same direction as those that are “demand induced.” 
3 Use of daily S&P 500 returns instead of the VIX leads to qualitatively similar results. Moreover, the correlation 
between VIX/equity prices and inflation compensation has gotten stronger lately amid ongoing concerns about 
the global outlook, especially China.

There are two mechanisms through which shifting risk sentiment could affect 5to10year 
inflation compensation. First, safe haven flows into nominal Treasury securities amid rising risk 
aversion could push down nominal Treasury yields and inflation compensation. This effect would 
be captured as a decline in the “other risk premium” component of inflation compensation, 
reflecting mostly technical factors such as the relative liquidity of, and the relative supply of and 
demand for, nominal and TIPS securities. Second, episodes of deteriorating risk sentiment may 
also be accompanied by increasing concerns about the tail risk of persistent deflation, which 
could be associated with declines in inflation expectations and inflation risk premium. 
To disentangle these two channels, we estimate a structural vector autoregression (VAR) model 
on measures of the macroeconomic outlook for the United States and for emerging market 
economies (EME), the VIX, and inflation compensation from the United States and euro area.4 A 
decomposition based on the model suggests that shocks to the EME economic outlook and flight
tosafety shocks each explain about onefourth of the decline in 5to10year U.S. inflation 
compensation since August 2014. Residual shocks to U.S. and euro area inflation compensation 
also explain a sizable portion, possibly reflecting, in part, global deflationary pressures weighing 
on inflation expectations and inflation risk premiums.5 These assessments seem largely 
consistent with results from the staff’s standard term structure model, which indicate that three 
basic components of 5to10year inflation compensation—inflation expectations, inflation risk 
premiums, and other risk premiums—declined about 11, 20, and 42 basis points, respectively, 
since August 2014. 
On balance, both the empirical analysis reported here and the staff’s standard term structure 
model suggest that long term inflation expectations embedded in asset prices may have edged 
down modestly over the past year. Other factors such as changes in risk sentiment seem to 
account for the bulk of the observed decline in inflation compensation over this period. 
However, conclusions on this score can be sensitive to model assumptions. In particular, the 
staff’s standard term structure model assumes that inflation will ultimately revert to its average 
value during the period over which the model is estimated, thereby constraining the degree to 
which long horizon inflation expectations can decline. An alternative version of the staff’s term 
structure model that allows some of the shocks to have permanent effects on inflation produces 
estimates of a decline in longer term inflation expectations since August of 2014 of around 50 
basis points—much larger than the 11 basis point decline from the standard model. While this 
estimate should probably be regarded as an upper bound on the decline in the “true” underlying 
longer term inflation expectations embedded in asset prices, the results suggest that the decline 
in longer term inflation compensation observed over recent quarters could reflect a larger 
decline in inflation expectations than many other model or survey based measures would 
suggest. 
4 The variables are the Citigroup Economic Surprise indexes for the United States and the BRIC countries (Brazil, 
Russia, India, and China), the log of VIX, and 5to10year inflation compensation for the United States and the 
euro area. The VAR is estimated using weekly data from January 2009 to October 2015 and includes one lag of 
each variable. We assume that the VAR is driven by three structural shocks—shocks to both the domestic and 
emerging economy economic outlooks, and a flight tosafety shock—as well as two shocks reflecting fluctuations 
in U.S. and euro area inflation compensation not explained by the structural shocks. For example, the residual 
shock to euro area inflation compensation might reflect revisions in the euro area growth and inflation outlook as 
well as ECB monetary policy shocks. 
5 The staff’s March 2015 memorandum to the FOMC, “Recent Declines in Long Term Interest Rates: Causes and 
Possible Implications,” also finds evidence that flight tosafety shocks and concerns about global growth were 
important contributors to the decline in U.S. nominal long term rates in 2014.

Debt Ceiling Update and Review of 2013 Episode 
The U.S. Treasury is operating under a debt issuance suspension period (DISP) and 
using extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the statutory debt limit of 
$18.1 trillion.1 The Treasury has announced that it expects to exhaust extraordinary 
measures on November 3.  According to Board staff estimates, the Treasury can 
continue operations with the cash it has on hand without breaching the debt ceiling 
until mid-November. However, forecasts for the breach date are inherently 
uncertain, in part reflecting difficulties in predicting the issuance of nonmarketable 
Treasury debt.2 
Strains in the Treasury bill market may be starting to emerge, with yields of Treasury 
bills maturing around mid- to-late November moving up roughly 10 basis points this 
week.  Other signs of stress are not yet evident ; in past debt limit episodes, stresses 
in broader markets did not emerge until around one to two weeks before the debt 
limit breach appeared imminent. Financial market effects observed i n the 2013 
episode included the following: 
 Treasury bill yields of at-risk securities rose; notably, those securities 
maturing a few weeks after the projected debt-breach date of October 17, 
2013 , saw yields spike almost 50 basis points.  Treasury bill auctions saw 
reduced demand, and liquidity in the T-bill market reportedly deteriorated. 
 In secured dollar funding markets , overnight and term general collateral repo 
rates on Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) collateral 
rose markedly. Rates on unsecured commercial paper (CP) rose sharply as 
well, and financial CP outstanding declined in the days immediately before 
the deadline. By contrast, federal funds and Eurodollar markets showed little 
reaction to debt ceiling concerns. 
 U.S. sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads increased notably, and the 
gross notional amount of U.S. CDS outstanding rose. 
 Outflows from institutional taxable money market funds (MMFs) accelerated 
in the two weeks before the deadline, amounting to $70 billion in aggregate.  
Market participants noted that the sharp rise in short-dated T-bill yields likely 
was due in part to MMFs offloading at-risk securities. MMFs’ ag gregate 
1 On March 16, 2015, the Treasury declared a five-month DISP that was extended by three months on 
July 30, 2015. The Treasury is allowed to use extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the statutory 
debt limit.  The Treasury has announced that the measures include suspending daily reinvestment of the 
Treasury securities held by the Government Securities Investment Fund ($194 billion), redeeming existing 
investments and suspending new investment in th e Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund 
($170 billion), suspending the daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange Stabilization 
Fund ($23 billion), and suspending new investment in th e Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund 
($5 billion). 
2 Nonmarketable debt includes the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (Social 
Security) and the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.

holdings of Treasury securities declined notably leading up to the deadline; 
MMFs also pared back their holdings of CP.  
 Consistent with these MMF outflows, deposit and reserve balances rose 
sharply at custodian banks, as custodian bank deposits appeared to serve as 
a temporary investment vehicle during this time. 
 With respect to operational issues, reports emerged of market participants , 
including central clearing counterparties, considering amending legal 
documentation to exclude certain at-risk securities from eligibility as 
collateral. Three exchanges announced other margin and haircut changes.3 
In addition, analysts expressed some uncertainties about the eligibility of at-
risk securities at the Federal Reserve’s discount window and in open ma rket 
operations. 
Before an agreement was reached, the FOMC held a videoconference meeting on 
October 16, 2013, to discuss contingencies in the event that the debt limit was not 
raised .  The minutes of this meeting were included in the October 2013 FOMC minutes 
and noted that “Meeting participants saw no legal or operational need in the event 
of delayed payments on Treasury securities to make changes to the conduct or 
procedures employed in currently authorized Desk operations, such as open market 
operations, large-scale asset purchases, or securities lending, or to the operation of 
the discount window. They also generally agreed that the Federal Reserve would 
continue to employ prevailing market values of securities in all its transactions and 
operations, under the usual terms.4 
3 The Hong Kong Exchange increased haircuts on U.S. Treasury bills from 1 percent to 3 percent 
on October 1 0, 2013, while the Intercontinental Exchange raised haircuts on U.S. Treasury notes and 
bonds on October 1 7, 2013.  On October 1 5, 2013, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced a 
temporary increase in m argin r equirements on over-the-counter i nterest rate swaps. 
4 The minutes also noted that Supervisory policy would take into account and make 
appropriate allowance for unusual market conditions.” For the full text, see the October 2 013

dollar index.  The appreciati on of the dollar early in th e period amid global growth 
concerns was more than offset by the deprec iation following the release of the weaker-
than-expected U.S. employment report.  Afte r significant and broa d-based depreciation 
earlier this year, EME curre ncies rebounded against the dollar and ended the period 
1 percent higher.  
Tepid incoming data on output and infla tion led to anticipation of greater 
accommodation in a number of major foreign economies.  Even though the Bank of 
Japan left monetary policy unchanged at its October meeting, expectations for additional accommodation increased following the unexpected decline in August of industrial 
production in Japan.  The Bank of England al so left its policy stance unchanged in 
October, but, against the background of falling inflation, higher productivity, and 
concerns about global growth, policy expect ations in the United Kingdom trended down, 
in tandem with those in the United States.  In flation compensation continued to decline in 
the United Kingdom but, after falling early in the period, was little changed, on net, in the 
euro area.  Ten-year sovereign yields d eclined 21 basis points in Germany, 12 basis 
points in the United Kingdom, and 4 basis points in Japan.  
Consistent with risk-off beha vior of investors amid gl obal growth concerns early 
in the period, prices of foreign equities and commodities generally declined and emerging market sovereign credit spr eads widened further.  But these moves were more than 
retraced later in the period as the U.S. em ployment report led markets to push back 
expectations for U.S. monetary policy lifto ff and as investors became less worried about 
prospects for the Chinese economy and its im plications for the renminbi.  Over the 
period, outflows from emerging market eq uity and bond funds slowed notably, and 
emerging market equities e nded the period 5 percent high er.  Movements in equity 
markets in the advanced economies were mixed. 
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS 
Over the intermeeting period, broad U.S. e quity price indexes were up slightly on 
net.  Equity prices fell in the first few weeks after the Septem ber FOMC meeting but 
recovered after the release of  the September employment re port, which led investors to 
anticipate a flatter path for monetary policy.  The one-month-ahead option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 i ndex—the VIX—moved down, on ne t, and ended the period 
near the middle of its range ove r the past few years.

Spreads of yields on triple-B-rated co rporate bonds over comparable-maturity 
Treasury securities rose sli ghtly, on balance, since the September FOMC meeting, and 
those on speculative-grade corporate bonds wi dened notably across sectors.  Across the 
credit spectrum, spreads reached  their highest levels in several years and ended the period 
above their historical median s, likely reflecting declines in risk tolerance among bond 
investors and somewhat higher concerns about the credit outlook of the corporate sector.  
Indeed, expected year-ahead default rates implied by the Moody’s KMV model increased 
slightly in September, largely because of  higher estimated asset volatility, and the 
aggregate ratio of debt to assets continued to inch up in the sec ond quarter, reaching its 
highest level since 2000.  Spr eads on leveraged loans incr eased in August and have 
moved up, on balance, since the September FOMC meeting. 
With earnings reports of roughly 20 per cent of S&P 500 companies in hand and 
analyst estimates for the rest, aggregate earnings per share in the third quarter are 
expected to have decreased slightly from year-ago levels.  In October, Wall Street 
analysts have downgraded their projections fo r year-ahead earnings somewhat further. 
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE 
Overall, financing conditions for nonfin ancial businesses remained generally 
accommodative but tightened somewhat for lower-rated firms.  Corporate bond issuance rebounded in September from a slowdown in August, with a much larger-than-usual 
share of the issuance co ming from investment-grade firms.  Early indications suggest that 
speculative-grade bond issuance has remained subdued in October.  Public equity 
issuance was modest in the third quarter, in pa rt reflecting heightened  market volatility. 
C&I loan growth on banks’ books moderate d slightly during the third quarter, 
though lending standards were little changed, on net, according to the October SLOOS.  
Financing conditions for small businesses cont inued to improve, with  loan originations 
maintaining their upward trend, although indi cators of small busin ess owners’ optimism 
have declined in recent months. 
CMBS spreads have continued to widen through early Octobe r, suggesting that 
CMBS investors may be reassessing the riskines s of the sector following several years of 
strong demand to purchase these securities .  In addition, respondents in the SLOOS 
reported that standards on CRE loans were litt le changed in the third quarter, marking the 
second quarter in a row of unchanged sta ndards following several years of easing.

broadly available to date, w ith all major categories of CRE loans on banks’ balance 
sheets growing robustly through September, c onsistent with reports of stronger demand 
for such loans in the SLOOS.   
On balance, financing conditions for municipalities remained accommodative.  
Gross issuance of municipal bonds was solid in the third quarter, and declines in yields 
on general obligation municipal bonds roughl y followed those on long-term Treasury 
securities, leaving thei r ratio little changed. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE 
Credit conditions for reside ntial mortgages were little  changed, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  In the third quarter, a moderate net fraction of SLOOS respondents 
continued to ease standards on GSE-eligible and qualified mo rtgage loans, but standards 
on government-backed loans tightened somewhat.  Despite the gradual net easing that has 
occurred for several years, credit remains tight for borrowers with low credit scores, 
hard-to-document income, or high debt-to-inco me ratios.  Meanwhile, interest rates on 
30-year fixed-rate mortgages declined 20 basis points (roughly in line with a decline in 
MBS yields). 
Financing conditions in consumer cr edit markets changed little over the 
intermeeting period and remained accommodative on balance.  Outstanding credit card 
balances expanded further in August, and a m oderate net fraction of banks in the SLOOS 
indicated that standards eased on such loans during the third quarter .  However, credit 
card limits remained mostly flat overall and were fairly tight for subprime borrowers.  
The growth of auto and student loans stayed robust, and both loan t ypes continued to be 
broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime credit histories.  Delinquencies on 
both credit card loans and auto loans remained relatively unchanged over the 
intermeeting period.    
Conditions in the consumer ABS market were largely uncha nged, on net, over the 
intermeeting period.  ABS spreads remained  wide across collateral and credit rating 
categories, with triple-A-rated credit card a nd auto ABS spreads nearing their post-crisis 
highs.  Despite elevated yield spreads and heightened volatilit y in financial markets in the 
summer, ABS issuance in the third quarter softened only a bit.

BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY 
Bank lending continued to expand during th e third quarter amid somewhat faster 
growth in consumer loans.  Meanwhile, ba nks continued to adju st the composition of 
holdings of high-quality liquid assets in response to changes in capital and liquidity 
regulations as well as higher agency MBS yields relative to Treasury yields.  In 
particular, cash assets fell for the second consecutive quarter, while  sales of Treasury 
securities were more than offset by purchases of agency MBS. 
Over the intermeeting period, credit sp reads widened notably for large U.S. 
banks, and their equity prices underperforme d broad equity market indexes, in part 
reflecting concerns about bank profitability amid a shift down in the yield curve and 
concerns about downside risks to the economic outlook.  Third-quarter earnings reports 
for large banks were mixed.  Compressed net interest margins continued to limit bank 
profitability, and trading and mortgage reve nues declined; however,  a number of banks 
reported further reductions in noninteres t expenses to offset lower revenues. 
M2 grew at an average annual rate of around 7½ per cent in September.  The 
monetary base expanded by nearly 13½ percen t in September, primarily reflecting an 
increase in reserve balances of depository institutions that, in turn, stemmed from a 
decline in balances held in the Treasury’s  General Account.  The drawdown in Treasury 
account balances was due largel y to the Treasury’s reliance on cash to make payments in 
light of the constraints on debt issu ance associated with the debt ceiling. 
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS 
Testing of the Federal Reserve’s RRP ope rations continued ov er the intermeeting 
period.  In September, the Desk conducted tw o term RRP auctions that crossed quarter-
end.3  Both auctions were oversubscribed, and the competitively determined award rate at 
each operation was 7 basis points.  Consistent with past quarter-ends, the majority of 
investments in the first term RRP were a s ubstitution from the ON RRP, while the second 
term RRP operation saw more new cash inflows.4  On the September quarter-end, total 
3 The first operation was held on September 24 , with an offered amount  of $100 billion, and 
matured on October 1; the second operation, with an offered amount of $150 billion, was conducted on 
September 30 and matured on October 2. 
4 Of note, the amount of new cash inflows in the first term RRP operation was similar to that 
observed on previous quarter-ends.  However, in contrast to prior experience, total RRP take-up was about

RRP take-up was $450 billion, which marked the highest take-up experienced during 
testing so far.  The larger-t han-usual contraction in Eur odollar borrowing, combined with 
the relative attractiveness of RRP rates over Tr easury bill yields, lik ely contributed to the 
increase in take-up, mostly by money market mutual funds.   
 The effective federal funds and Eurodollar rates stayed within a range of 13 to 
14 basis points, although they dipped to 7 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, on 
the September quarter-end.5  The overnight repo rate for Tr easury collateral, as surveyed 
by the Desk, stayed above the ON RRP offer ra te of 5 basis points.  On quarter-end, the 
survey repo rate increased several basis point s to 17 basis points, while the GCF repo rate 
for Treasury collateral increased 22 basis points to a level of 35 basis points. 
Over the intermeeting period, spreads on A2/P2 nonfinancial CP, a gauge for CP 
credit quality, were little changed on net.  Domestic nonfinancial CP outstanding dropped 
sharply at the quarter-end but has since re bounded, following its typical seasonal pattern.   
The Desk purchased about $26 billion of 15- and 30-year MBS under the 
reinvestment program and rolled $0.6 billion in expected settlements over the period.  
The ratio of monthly settlements for these reinvestment operations relative to gross 
issuance of MBS was about unchanged  in September at 30.4 percent. 
unchanged on September 24 because the inflows of new cash into the term operation were coincidentally 
offset by a significant reduction in ON RRP take-up by one GSE. 
5 The effective federal funds rate averaged 13 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 4.0 basis points.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first 
scenario, the recent better-than-expected readings on consumption and business fixed investmen t signal a stronger pace for the economic expansion and higher inflation over 
the projection period.  In contrast, the second scenario illustrates potential consequences of persistently weaker aggregate demand. In the third scenario, the trajectory of long-
term inflation expectations is lower than in the baseline, leading to a shallower path of 
actual inflation in the coming years. The fourth scenario considers the possibility that 
increased financial strain raises corporate risk premiums and reduces economic activity. 
In the fifth scenario, a broad-based selloff of EME assets severely depresses activity in 
emerging market economies.  The final scenario illustrates the potential effects of faster-than-expected foreign growth and a weaker dollar. 
We generate the first scenario using the EDO model and the fourth scenario usin g 
a DSGE model developed by staff members from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
that explicitly incorporates financial frictions.  Scenarios two and three are generated 
using the FRB/US model, and the final two using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In all 
cases, once the federal funds rate has risen above its current target range, its movements are governed as in the baseline forecast by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) 
rule.
1 In addition, all scenarios assume that the size and composition of the SOMA 
portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
Although some of the recent incoming data have been lackluster, private domestic 
final demand notably, consumer spending and business fixed investment has been 
solid.  In this scenario, these data are a harbinger of greater underlying strength in 
aggregate demand.  We also assume that inflation is more sensitive to reductions in 
1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations. One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference betw een actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices. The policy 
rule in the New York Fed model also responds to such a measure of slack.

resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO model, consistent with the 
estimates of some other DSGE models.  
Real GDP rises 3 pe rcent in 2016, compared with 2¼ percent in the baseline 
projection.  The unemployment rate falls below 4½ percent in 2016; it then edges up over 
the remainder of the forecast period but remains lower than in the baseline.  With 
resource utilization running tight and under the steeper Phillips curve we have assumed, 
inflation rises by more than in the ba seline, reaching 2¼ percent in 2018.2 The federal 
funds rate rises more steeply, passing 4 percent in 2018 and reaching 4½ percent in 2020.  
Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the 
unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 
2 percent. 
Weak Consumer Demand 
Although recent indications have been more positive, household spending has 
been disappointing over most of the past several years.  Gains in personal consumption 
expenditures have been smaller than the staff anticipated, while residential construction 
has remained below levels that we judge to be consistent with population growth and 
other fundamentals.  In this scenario, the recent strength in household spending proves short lived and the earlier pattern of subpar gains reasserts itself.  Specifically, the slow wage growth and high burden of student debt experienced by the millennial generation 
adults currently between the ages of 18 and 34, now the largest cohort in the U.S. 
workforce is assumed to weigh on residential investment and consumer spending to a 
greater degree than is assumed in the baseline.  As a result, residential construction is flat over the medium term and real PCE rises ½ percentage point per year, on average, less than in the staff forecast, before gradually returning to baseline growth rates. 
The reduction in household spending growth implies a significantly weaker 
economy.  Real GDP rises only about 1½ percent per year, on average, over the 2016 18 
period.  Consequently, the unemployment rate remains above 5 pe rcent in 2016 and rise s 
slightly above 5½ percent by the end of 2020. The federal funds rate moves up more 
2 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for 
wages and prices in this scenario, which imply a larger reaction of inflation to changes in resource 
utilization. Had we used our standard coefficients in these equations, inflation would have peaked at 
2 percent, about the same as in the baseline.

gradually than in the baseline, reaching 2 percent by early 2018 and 2½ p ercent by the 
end of 2020. Inflation is a touch below the baseline. 
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
In the baseline projection, consumer price inflation is projected to increase 
gradually to the Committee’s longer -run target of 2 percent.  A key assumption behind 
this projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations is currently consistent 
with PCE inflation of 1.8  percent and that expectations will eventually rise to a level 
consistent with 2 percent inflation.  However, a wide range of uncertainty surrounds this 
assumption, and some models the staff consults suggest that expectations are currently 
consistent with lower inflation.  In this scenario, we assume that long-term inflation 
expectations are currently 1.5 percent and that, going forward, households and businesses 
form the se expectations adaptively based on past inflation.  
The subdued inflation expectations and low actual inflation in the coming years 
are mutually reinforcing. Inflation falls to 1 percent in 2016 and does not rise above 
1½ percent until the second half of 2019.  The path of the federal funds rate is lower than 
in the baseline, while the paths of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are 
roughly unchanged in this scenario.  (Other macroeconomic models for example, 
models with a pronounced “debt deflation” channel—could yield a significant negative 
effect of low inflation on the real economy.) 
Financial Turbulence 
Measures of financial market volatility, such as the VIX, spiked in late summer 
and remain elevated in comparison to the past several years.  Market commentary has cited, among other contributing factors, uncertainty about the economic strength of EMEs 
as well as about U.S. e conomic policy.  The spread of Baa-rated corporate bonds over 
Treasury securities, another measure of financial market stress, has risen about 75 basis points since the beginning of the year.  In this alternative scenario, we explore the 
consequences of a larger increase in corporate bond spreads.
3 We assume that household 
and investor risk aversion rises, pushing up the corporate bond spread a further 200 basis points above baseline in the first quarter of 2016, roughly one-half the observed increase 
3 The New York Fed’s DSGE model has an explicit role for credit spreads and is estimated using 
data on these spreads.

between 2007 and 2008.4 Spreads then gradually return to a more normal level.  The rise 
in spreads raises financing costs for firms’ capital expenditures .  The underlying increase 
in risk aversion also depresses household spending relative to the baseline, further 
reducing aggregate demand. 
Under these circumstances, the economy contracts in the first half of 2016 and the 
unemployment rate rises slightly above 5½ pe rcent by the middle of next year before a 
gradual recovery begins.  Core PCE inflation is only slightly below baseline for the entire 
simulation period because the model has a fairly high estimate of price rigidity.  The path 
of the federal funds rate is substantially lower, remaining roughly 1 pe rcentage point 
below baseline in 2017 and 2018. 
Emerging Market Economy Slump 
Our baseline projection envisions some pickup in EME growth over the next year 
from its current tepid pace.  However, the substantial capital outflows, currency depreciation, and rising credit spreads experienced by a number of these economies over 
the past few months highlight the risks to our outlook.  This scenario considers a more 
broad-based selloff of EME assets that might be triggered by any number of factors, 
including a wave of corporate defaults, deepening difficulties in a major EME such as Brazil or China, or perhaps U.S. policy rate liftoff.  The selloff severely depresses activity and confidence in the EMEs and has sizable spillovers to global financial markets. EME 
GDP declines 5 percent below baseline, while flight- to-safety flows cause the dollar to 
appreciate 8 percent and modestly depress the term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities and AFE government bonds.
5 
U.S. activity declines relative to baseline as the stronger dollar and weaker foreign 
output depress U.S. real net exports and as some tightening of U.S. financial conditions restrains domestic demand.  All told, U.S. real GDP expands at an annual rate of abou t 
1 percent in 2016, a nd the unemployment rate climbs above 5¼ pe rcent by late 2016, 
nearly ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation declines to less 
than 1 pe rcent in 2016 owing to the stronger dollar and lower resource utilization.  
4 In the estimated model, underlying structural shocks of this magnitude or larger have occurred 
roughly once every 20 years. However, estimates of the underlying frequency of such rare adverse shocks 
are highly uncertain. 
5 The broad real dollar appreciated by around 12 percent during the Asian and Russian default 
crises of 1997 to 1998, while EME GDP growth fell more sharply relative to its pre-crisis trend than in this 
scenario.

Greater resource slack and subdued inflation imply that U.S. monetary policy 
accommodation is removed more gradually. 
Faster Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar 
Although we think the risks to the global outlook are predominantly on the 
downside, there are upside risks as well.  In this scenario, we consider the possibility that 
the accumulated effects of accommodative monetary policy, balance sheet repair, and 
lower oil prices generate stronger tailwinds in the AFEs than in our Tealbook projection. 
As a result, the level of AFE GDP rises 2 percent above the baseline by 2018, while EME 
GDP rises 1 percent above the baseline as confidence improves and EME exports 
strengthen.  Diminished concerns about the prospects for the global economy reduce the 
demand for dollar-denominated assets, leading the broad real dollar to fall about 
7 percent relative to the baseline.  
Stronger foreign growth and the weaker dollar lead to greater U.S. real net exports 
relative to the baseline.  Consequently, U.S. real GDP expands 2¾ percent in 2016, about 
½ percentage point more than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate falls to 
4¼ percent by the end of 2018.  The boost to import prices from the weaker dollar and 
heightened resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to rise to above 1¾ percent in 
2016.  The inertial Taylor rule prescribes that the federal funds rate rises more quickly 
than in the baseline, reaching 3¾ percent by the end of 2018.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors 
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
