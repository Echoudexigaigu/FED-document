Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook   
On balance, the news that we have received since the previous Tealbook has 
caused us to modestly upgrade our economic outlook.  In particular, the recent federal 
budget deal now points to a somewhat more expa nsionary stance of fi scal policy than we 
had been assuming.  In addition, the data regarding both labor market conditions and 
manufacturing activity have been  a little better than we antic ipated, and the decline in net 
exports over the second half of the year a ppears less steep than we had previously 
expected.  However, consumption and investme nt appear to have been somewhat softer 
than we had projected.  Changes in interest rates, equity prices, and the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar imply only small adjustme nts to the outlook for real activity.   
All told, we now project that  real GDP will increase a little more than 2 percent 
this year before rising 2½ percent in 2016 and about 2 percent in both 2017 and 2018.  At 
the end of 2018, actual GDP is an ticipated to stand 1½ percent above its potential level, 
½ percentage point more than in the Oc tober Tealbook.  Accordingly, we expect the 
unemployment rate to fall a bit more rapidl y, reaching 4½ percent in 2018, ¼ percentage 
point below our previous forecast. 
Turning to inflation, we ha ve revised down our near-ter m projection a little in 
response to further declines in  crude oil prices and import prices as well as to soft 
incoming data on core PCE prices.  But we pr oject that total PCE inflation will move up 
gradually, reaching 2 percent in 2018, as ener gy prices bottom out a nd start to increase 
moderately, import prices turn back up, and resource utilization ti ghtens further in an 
environment of stable long-term  inflation expectations.   
We address our assessment of the extent a nd balance of risks to the outlook in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP 
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following the 
September FOMC meeting. The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection with 
the one we presented in the September Tealbook. 
Our forecast for real GDP growth in the second half of the year is unrevised from September, but 
our projectio n for 2016 is somewhat stronger, largely reflecting the anticipated boost to real 
activity from the recent federal budget deal. Beyond 2016, our forecast for real GDP growth is little 
revised. Altogether, our projection for the GDP gap over the projection period is stronger than in 
the September Tealbook. The unemplo yment rate has declined as we expected in September and 
is projected to average 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter of this year. The unemployment rate is 
forecast to gradually decline to 4.5 percent at the end of 2018, further below the staff’s estimate of 
its natural rate than in the September forecast. 
The staff’s projection for headline PCE inflation has been revised up in the second half of this year, 
largely reflecting a slower than expected pass through of the summer’s crude oil price declines 
into consumer energy prices; with data through October, core PCE inflation over the second half of 
the year appears to be running just a shade above the September projection. Given our 
assumptions that longer run inflation expectations will remain stable over the medium term, the 
declines in energy prices will be transitory, and core import prices will start to rise by the middle of 
next year, our forecasts for headline and core inflation are little changed beyond the near term. 
We continue to project that inflation will move up toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective very 
gradually.

We now assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound in the fourth 
quarter of this year, one quarter later than in the September forecast. The federal funds rate is still 
assumed to rise gradually, but the stronger GDP gap in the current forecast, along with an inflation 
projection that is little changed, leaves the projected path for the federal funds rate a bit steeper 
than in the September forecast. At the end of 2018, the federal funds rate is assumed to be 
3.5 percent, about ½ percentage point higher than in the September Tealbook and about 
¼ percentage point above the staff’s assumption for its longer run nominal value. 
Because FOMC participants are providing additional information about their expectations of the 
economic conditions that will exist at the time they anticipate it will first become appropriate to 
increase the target range for the federal funds rate, we include the table below providing quarterly 
information from the staff projection. In the fourth quarter of this year—the quarter when our 
baseline projection assumes liftoff of the federal funds rate will occur—we forecast the 
unemployment rate to average 5.0 percent and the trailing four quarter change in real GDP to be 
2.1 percent. We project the trailing four quarter change in core PCE inflation to be 1.3 percent and 
the four quarter change in headline PCE prices to be only 0.4 percent because of decreases in 
energy prices over the past year.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2015 and 2016 is just a little below 
the Blue Chip consensus forecast and the median projection from the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters. The staff’s forecast for unemployment is similar to the 
others. Its inflation projections are somewhat lower, particularly in 2016.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We continue to assume that the fede ral funds rate will lift off from its 
effective lower bound following the December meeting and that it will be 
governed thereafter by an inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) policy rule.1 
Largely reflecting the tighter resource uti lization in this proj ection, the path of 
the federal funds rate is somewhat  higher than in the October Tealbook, 
reaching an average of 3.4 percen t in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
 The SOMA portfolio is assumed to rema in at its current size until June 2016, 
at which point reinvestment of maturing assets is terminated and, accordingly, the portfolio begins to contract. 
Other Interest Rates 
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
significantly, reflecting the movement  of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates as well as the 
increase in the term premium toward its historically normal level.  Compared 
with the October Tealbook, the 10-year Tr easury yield is somewhat higher in 
the medium term, in line with the higher future expected short-term rates over 
the valuation horizon. 
 We revised the paths for the 30-year mo rtgage rate and th e 10-year triple-B 
corporate bond rate approximately in line with the revision to Treasury yields.  
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Although equity prices have risen a littl e more in recent weeks than we had 
anticipated, our projected pa th for equity prices is revised down a bit relative 
to the October Tealbook.  This revisi on mostly reflects th e higher path of 
Treasury yields.  In all, stock prices ar e projected to rise about 2 percent per 
1 Model simulations can provide a sense of the sens itivity of the outlook to the liftoff assumptio n. 
For example, if we assume that the federal funds rate lifts off two meetings later (that is, after the March 
2016 meeting), the FRB/US model would project that the level of real GDP is 0.2 percent higher by th e end 
of 2018, the unemployment rate is less than 0.1 percen tage point lower, core inflation is 2 basis points 
higher, and the federal funds rate is 8 basis points higher.  One reason for these very small deviations is  that 
the simulation implicitly assumes that the public does not draw any inference from the delayed liftoff regarding the monetary policymakers’ reaction function, the outlook for econ omic activity, or inflation.

year on average.  By the end of the me dium-term forecast, the equity premium 
is projected to be close to the histori cal mean of its distribution conditional on 
the unemployment rate. 
 We expect house prices to rise about 5¼ percent this year and around 
2¾ percent per year over the medium  term; we have revised down our 
expectations slightly in light of the news during th e intermeeting period.  One 
simple model of housing valuation that  we monitor suggests that housing is 
currently overvalued by 7 percent, compared with more than 40 percent a 
decade ago.2  Our forecast has rents rising sl ightly faster than house prices, 
bringing this valuation meas ure back toward neutral. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We now assume that fiscal policy will be somewhat more expansionary than 
in our previous projection, largely re flecting the Bipartisan Budget Act of 
2015.  The agreement, which was signed into law in early November, raises the debt ceiling through March 2017 and se ts government spending for fiscal 
years 2016 and 2017 at higher levels than  we had previously assumed.  In 
reaction to the agreement, we have also pushed up our assumptions for the level of federal spending in fiscal  2018 on our expectation that another 
agreement will be reached then.  All told, we now expect fiscal policy actions 
at all levels of government to provid e a moderate stimulus in calendar-year 
2016 as federal spending ramps up to the higher level set by the recent legislation.  In 2017 and 2018, we expect fiscal policy to provide a small boost 
to the growth of real GDP.
3 
 The Congress must still pass appropriat ion bills by December 11 to avoid a 
government shutdown.  We continue to assume that this deadline will be navigated without significant disr uptions to government operations.
4 
2 The model assesses the price-to-rent ratio against costs of housing investment (such as interest 
rates) and a linear trend that may reflect challenges associated with measuring house prices and rents. 
3 Specifically, we now project fiscal impetus to be 0.4 percentage point in 2016 (up from 
0.2 p ercentage point in the October Tealbook) and 0.2 percentage point in b oth 2 017 and 2018. 
4 A short-term shutdown of the federal government would have only minor implications for the 
outlook.  For example, the staff estimates that the 16-day shutdown in October 2013 reduced real GDP 
growth by ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that year and boosted it by an equal amount in the

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that foreign real GDP grow th picked up to an annual rate of 2½ 
percent in the third quarter, a touch highe r than our projection in the October 
Tealbook, from a subdued 1¼ percent p ace in the second quarter.  In 
particular, growth in many emerging ma rket economies stepped up, and real 
GDP in Canada rebounded after a sharp fall in oil-industry investment caused 
GDP to decline in the first half of the year.  We see growth abroad rising to 
about 3 percent by the end of 2016 and th en staying at about that pace through 
2018, supported by accommodative monetary policies, depreciated currencies, 
and low oil prices.  This forecast is l ittle changed from our projection in the 
October Tealbook. 
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated 2¾ percent, on net, since the time of 
the October Tealbook.  The dollar strengthened against most currencies, 
reflecting recent ECB policy actions, firm ing expectations of Federal Reserve 
liftoff, and declines in commodity prices that weighed on commodity 
exporters.  We expect the nominal dollar to rise a bit further through the first 
quarter of next year—pushed up by monetary policy actions in the United 
States and by continued accommodati on by foreign central banks—and then 
to be little changed over the medium term.  Beyond the current quarter, our 
path for the broad real dollar is about 2¼ percent higher than in the previous 
Tealbook. 
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 Oil prices ratcheted down as  crude inventories conti nued to build in the face 
of relatively resilient pro duction and as OPEC reaffirmed its plans to maintain 
robust production.  The spot price of Brent crude oil is down $8 per barrel 
relative to the October Tealbook, while prices for futures contracts with 
delivery at the end of 2018 have fallen about $4 per barrel.  We now expect 
the price of imported oil to  fall early next year to $38 per barrel, a price that 
has not been seen for a decade.  Thereafter, we expect the price of imported oil to rise over the forecast period to  about $50 per barrel by the end of 2018.  
following quarter.  This calculation embodies our judgment that there were no material effects on private 
investment or consumption owing to reduced confidence or increased uncertainty.

 A price index for a broad selection of industrial metals has declined about 9 
percent since the October Tealbook.  Although recent dollar appreciation and 
ample supply have weighed on metals pri ces, the decline in prices likely also 
reflects market participants’ pessimism regarding global metals demand.  In 
line with the futures markets, we project metal prices to be little changed 
going forward.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The latest available information is consistent with real GDP growth averaging 
about 2 percent at an annual ra te in the second half of this year and the first quarter of 
next year—marginally better than we anticipated in the October Tealbook and modestly 
faster than potential GDP growth.  The latest data on consumer and business spending 
have come in below our expectations, on balan ce, but net exports appear to have exerted 
less restraint in the second half of the year than we anticipated.  Meanwhile, the passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 should boost federal spending in the near term.

 The recent data on consumer spending point  to slightly slower growth this 
quarter.6  Although motor vehicle sales in October and November were more 
robust than we had project ed, non-motor-vehicle reta il sales rose less than 
expected in October, and unseasona bly warm weather pushed down our 
forecast of spending on energy services in the current quarter.  Altogether, real 
PCE is projected to rise at an annual ra te of 2½ percent in the fourth quarter— 
about ½ percentage point less than in the Octobe r Tealbook—after increasing 
3 percent in the third quarter.  We expect real PCE growth to step up to 
3½ percent next quarter as spending gains return to levels consistent with 
household incomes, wealth, and consum er sentiment, and as weather is 
assumed to return to normal. 
5 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q4 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at 
1.9 percent, is about ¼ percentage point higher than the staff’s judgmental projection.  By comparison, the 
standard error from the Board staff’s dynamic factor model is nearly 1½ percentage points. 
6 The Quarterly Services Survey (for the third quarter) will be released on December 10, and the 
advance retail sales report (for Novemb er) will be released on December 11.

 The incoming data on housing activit y—particularly information on housing 
starts and permits—indicate that the s ector continues to recover only slowly 
from its very subdued levels of recent years.   
 Business fixed investment looks set to av erage a moderate rate of growth of 
4 percent over the second half of th is year and then decelerate to about 
1½ percent in the first qu arter of next year.  Outlays for transportation 
equipment are projected to decline in  the near term following an outsized 
increase in spending in the third quart er, but spending on other equipment and 
intangibles is expected to rise at a solid pace.  Meanwhile, drilling and mining 
investment continues to decline sharpl y, as depressed energy prices weigh on 
activity.   
 We continue to expect inventory invest ment to subtract roughly ½ percentage 
point from output growth in the seco nd half of 2015 after boosting activity by 
a similar amount during the first half.  Da ta for the third quarter indicate that 
the correction in inventory investment  was somewhat less frontloaded than 
anticipated at the time of the Octobe r Tealbook, leading us to now expect 
inventories to provide a small drag on growth this quarter.  (See the box “The 
Near-Term Outlook for Business Inventories.”)   
 After having subtracted almost 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the 
first half of this year, net exports ar e projected to take a little less than ½ 
percentage point off growth in the sec ond half.  The expected drag from net 
exports in the second half is less ne gative than projected in the October 
Tealbook, as the data on imports in September and October were surprisingly 
weak, particularly fo r imported inputs relate d to oil drilling and 
extraction.  But we view that slowdown in the growth of impo rts as transitory, 
and net exports are expected to be a much larger drag on GDP growth next 
year.  
 Turning to the industrial sector, the su stained and sizable reductions in the 
drilling of oil and gas wells and declines in the extraction of crude oil continue 
to weigh on mining activity; they also are having some negative upstream effects on manufacturing.  Neverthele ss, overall manufacturing production 
was appreciably stronger than we had anticipated in October, and the available 
information for November suggests factory output rose again last month.  As a

result, we now expect manufacturing IP to increase just under 1½ percent in 
the fourth and the first qu arters, a modest pace but more than 1 percentage 
point higher than we had previously projected.  This tepid gain is broadly 
consistent with the subdued read ings of the national and regional 
manufacturing surveys. 
In the medium term, real GDP growth is projected to run modestly ahead of our 
estimate of its potential.  Specifically, we pr oject real GDP to in crease 2½ percent in 
2016 and then step down to a 2 percent pace in 2017 and 2018 as monetary 
accommodation wanes. 
 Our forecast for output growth over the next  three years is slightly faster than 
in the October Tealbook, with the project ed level of real GDP at the end of 
2018 about ½ percent higher than in our  previous forecast.  The upward 
revision largely reflects the more expansionary fiscal policy built into this 
projection. 
 This projection also incor porates upward revisions to personal income and a 
lower path for oil prices, but the small positive impetus from these factors is roughly offset by a higher path for the do llar, weaker equity  prices, and higher 
interest rates.

 Although we still expect housing construc tion to continue to move up toward 
a level more consistent with our estima te of its demographically driven trend, 
we have pushed some of the projected expansion from 2016 into 2017 and 2018. 
 As in previous Tealbooks, we expect above-trend growth in aggregate demand 
to be led by additional solid gains in consumer spending.  As labor markets 
improve further, we project real personal in come to continue to rise faster than 
potential output.  In addi tion, lagged effects of earlie r increases in  the wealth-
to-income ratio are anticipated to lead  to spending growth that modestly 
exceeds income growth.

The Near-Term Outlook for Business Inventories 
In the first half of 2015, inventory investment contributed roughly ½ percentage point 
to the annual rate of increase in real GDP.  Although incoming data show stockbuilding 
as having slowed in the third quarter (and therefore as having been a substantial drag 
on GDP growth), inventory investment remained elevated by recent historical standards 
and was above our projection in the October Tealbook (figure 1).  
We view the near-term outlook for inventories with some unease .  The growth of 
inventory stocks tends to move roughly in line with that of domestic final sales 
(figure 2). For the past several quarters , however, inventories are estimated to have 
increased faster than final demand, giving rise to the concern that at least some of the 
recent buildup in stocks may have been undesired. 
Although the signals from the information the staff uses to assess the state of business 
inventories are mixed, inve ntory imbalances d o not appear to be widespread. To be 
sure , the ratio of manufacturing and trade inventories to final sales has moved up 
noticeably so far this year, and a similarly broad measure from the staff’s flow- of-goods 
(FOG) inventory system , which captures inventory stocks held at all stages of the 
distribution chain , has also risen (figure 3). However, within the FOG system, detailed 
industry estimates indicate that, on net, the rise has been in the energy sector, where 
crude oil stocks have expanded (figure 4). Elsewhere , the days’ supply of inventories 
has remained in the middle of its range since 2010 .  
Other indicators of the inventory situation also paint a varied picture. For example, the 
days’ supply of motor vehicles appears at the low end of its range of recent years 
(figure 5).  The latest readings from the I nstitute for Supply Management’s 
manufacturing survey indicate that a plurality of respondents viewed their customers’ 
inventories as too high, and all previous readings above 50 for this question (dating 
back to 1996) have been associated with inventory corrections (figure 6). Even so, 
manufacturer s already appear to have made progress in aligning their own inventory 
stocks with sales, as in the same survey, the own-inventory diffusion index has 
registered below 50 for five straight months.  
Taken as a whole , we do not see the evidence as portending an abrupt slowing in 
inventory investment, but the elevated pace of accumulation over the past year 
presents some downside risk to our near-term GDP forecast .  Our Tealbook projection 
expects inventory investment to level off and to be a roughly neutral influence on GDP 
growth in the next few quarters .  However, if much of the buildup in recent quarters 
was undesired , the pace of accumulation could slow further and continue to be a drag 
on GDP growth.

 As monetary policy tightens, both consumer and business spending are 
expected to decelerate.  This decelerati on is partially offset by a diminishing 
drag from net exports on GDP growth as the effects of the past appreciation of 
the dollar fade.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Taken together, the two employment repor ts that we have received since the 
October Tealbook indicate that the labor mark et has improved a little more than we had 
projected.  In particular, job gains have come  in above our expecta tions, while readings 
from the household survey were about in line with our October projection. 
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose at an  average pace of 250,000 per month in 
October and November, about 70,000 a bove our previous projection and up 
from the average pace of 170,000 per month in the third quarter.  We now 
project payroll employment to rise 210,000 per month through the first quarter 
of next year—about 35,000 per month faster  than we projected in the October 
Tealbook.   
 The unemployment rate came in at 5.0 percent in October and November.  In light of the greater momentum in the labor market indicated by the payroll 
survey, we now expect the unemployment rate to edge down to 4.9 percent in 
December and to remain there through the first quarter—0.1 percentage point 
lower than in the October Tealbook.   
 The labor force participation rate was little changed in the past two months after having fallen through the summer.  We continue to expect the 
participation rate to hold at 62.5 percent through the near term.   
 Other indicators of labor market sl ack also improved over the intermeeting 
period.  The share of employed indivi duals working part time for economic 
reasons declined 0.2 percenta ge point, on net, over th e past three months and 
has fallen about ½ percentage point over the past year.  In addition, the share 
of long-term unemployed edged down further. 
 The staff’s labor market conditions i ndex (LMCI) provides an alternative, 
strictly mechanical assessment of the ch ange in labor market conditions.  The 
LMCI registered a small gain in Nove mber, chiefly reflecting the increase in

private payroll employment.  The statistical machinery was disappointed by 
the unemployment rate and a variety of readings from consumer and business 
surveys. 
 Since the September Tealbook—the last time we adjusted our supply-side 
assumptions—the participation rate has co me in lower than we expected.  As 
a result, we lowered a little furthe r our estimate of trend labor force 
participation.  Because we saw no puzzl e in the relationship between GDP and 
the unemployment rate, we did not allow this adjustment to show through to 
potential output.   
Given the upward revisions to the GDP projection and with potential output 
unrevised, the medium-term outlook for the labo r market is somewhat stronger than in 
our previous projection. 
 We expect that GDP will exceed its poten tial level by 1½ percent at the end of 
the medium term, ½ percentage point more than in the October Tealbook. 
 With output increasing faster than its potential rate, the unemployment rate 
moves down further, reaching 4½ percent by 2018, roughly ¼ percentage point lower than in the October Tealbook and a little more than ½ percentage 
point below our estimate of its natural rate. 
 At 210,000, the average pace of monthly pa yroll gains this year has been 
surprisingly strong relative to GDP growth.  We expect job gains to slow over the projection period to r oughly 120,000 per month in 2018.   
 Although the unemployment rate in Oc tober and November was slightly 
below our estimate of its natural rate, we continue to believe that a modest amount of slack remains in the labor ma rket.  This judgment reflects our view 
that the labor force particip ation rate is stil l unusually low relative to its trend 
(our small revisions to this  trend estimate notwithstanding), and that the level 
of involuntary part-time employment re mains somewhat elevated.  As labor 
demand improves further, we expect addi tional individuals to be drawn into 
the labor force and the ra te of involuntary part-time employment to move 
down, slowing the decline in the un employment rate relative to the 
improvement in the output gap.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The overall PCE price index is projected to be unchanged both this quarter and 
next, reflecting recent and prospective declines in consumer energy prices.8  Core PCE 
price inflation is anticipate d to step up from 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter to 
1½ percent in the first quarte r of next year, reflecting residual seasonality and an 
anticipated rebound from the recent low readings on nonmarket price inflation. 
 The projection for core PCE price inflati on in the second half of this year and 
in the first quarter is a bit below our  October Tealbook forecast due to the 
lower-than-expected readings on nonmark et prices and downward revisions to 
our projection for core import prices. 
 Our forecast for headline PCE price inflation over the fourth and first quarters 
averages roughly ½ percentage point below our previous pr ojection, reflecting 
further declines in crude oil prices as  well as the small downward revision to 
core PCE inflation. 
 Prices for core goods imports are expect ed to decline at an annual rate of 
3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015, ¾ percentage point more negative than 
in the October Tealbook, as both dollar appreciation and commodity price 
declines were greater than expected.  In the first half of 2016, continued pass-
through of the dollar’s appr eciation and lower commodity  prices are expected 
to result in core import prices declining at an annual rate of 1½ percent, 1½ 
percentage points more negative than in the October Tealbook.  
Over the medium term, core PCE price infl ation is projected to edge up gradually 
from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2018, as import prices turn back up, the 
effects on core inflation of th e previous large declines in energy prices dissipate, and 
resource utilization continues to tighten in  an environment of we ll-anchored inflation 
expectations.  With consumer food and energy prices now project ed to rise slightly faster 
than core prices after the first quarter of next year, total PCE inflation is expected to run a 
touch above core inflation throughout the medi um term and to reach 2 percent in 2018.  
8 The consumer price index for November will be released on December 15, the first day of the 
FOMC meeting.

Overall, the medium-term projection for inflatio n is little changed relative to that in the 
October Tealbook. 
 We expect import prices to rise at a 1¼ percent annual rate beginning in 2017, 
consistent with moderate foreign in flation and relativel y flat projected 
trajectories for the dollar and commodity prices.   
 Quantitatively, the upward move in impor t price inflation contributes about 
0.3 percentage point to the 0.6 percentage point rise in our core PCE inflation 
projection between 2015 and 2018.  Given th at we think the Phillips curve is 
nearly flat and our assumption that inflation expecta tions are anchored and not 
formed adaptively, tightening resource utilization contributes only about 0.15 
percentage point to that pickup. 
 Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained 
relatively stable over the intermeeting period, but they are at the lower end of 
the ranges seen in recent years.  Market-based measures of longer-term 
inflation compensation have edge d up since the October Tealbook but 
remained at low levels. 
The incoming data on labor compensation were stronger than our  expectations in 
the October Tealbook.  Smoothing through the noise in the data , we continue to expect 
compensation gains to pick up gradually over the medium term.  
 Average hourly earnings rose 2¼ pe rcent over the 12 months ending in 
November, a bit above the pace of in creases recorded since 2009.  Taking 
account of prior-year estimates that  will soon drop out of the 12-month 
change, we expect this measure to fl uctuate between 2½ and 2¾ percent in the 
next few months. 
 Incorporating the sizable upward revisions to wages and salaries from the 
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wa ges, the four-quarter change in 
hourly compensation from the Productivity  and Costs release was 3½ percent 
in the third quarter, well above the previously published estimate of 2½ percent.  Nevertheless, mindful of the substantial volatility of these data, we 
expect this measure of hourly compensa tion to step down somewhat next year 
before moving back up to 3½ percen t by the end of the medium term.

 The employment cost index (ECI) for pr ivate workers increased at an annual 
rate of 2½ percent between June and Se ptember after being unchanged in the 
previous quarter.  The 12-month cha nge stood at 1.9 percent—close to the 
average pace of increase over the past several years.  We project ECI growth 
of about 2½ percent through the medium term. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 With the economy running above its pot ential level and inflation having 
reached the Committee’s 2 percent object ive, the federal funds rate moves 
above its long-run value over the 2018–20 period.  
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.  
The SOMA portfolio is projected to ha ve returned to a normal size by 2021. 
 The natural rate of unemployment rema ins at 5.1 percent, and potential GDP 
rises about 2 percent per year , on average, in 2019 and 2020. 
 As monetary policy continues to tigh ten, real GDP decelerates further and 
rises 1½ percent in both 2019 and 2020.  The unemployment rate remains at 
4.5 percent in 2019, but with real GDP  rising less than potential, the 
unemployment rate moves back up toward its assumed natural rate thereafter. 
 PCE price inflation remains near th e Committee’s long-run objective of 
2 percent through 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign real GDP growth picked up to 2½ percent in the third quarter from an 
anemic 1½ percent pace in the first half of  the year.  Growth in the emerging market 
economies (EMEs), which have been the focus of  considerable concern in recent months, 
rebounded more vigorously than we had exp ected despite another large downside 
surprise in Brazil.  The Canadian and Japanese economies also recovered from 
contractions earlier in the year.  In contra st, growth in the euro area and the United 
Kingdom weakened a touch.    
For the foreign economies as a whole, the third-quarter outcome was a little 
stronger than our October projection, reinforc ing our view that the pickup in foreign 
growth that we have been anticipating for so me time is finally occurring.  More recent 
indicators have also been encouraging.  We es timate that the foreign economies grew at a 
2¼ percent pace during the current quarter, a nd we see growth rising to a little under 
3 percent by the end of next year.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), the 
expansion is supported by further moneta ry accommodation, gradually improving credit 
market conditions, and, for Europe and Japan, low oil prices.  Stronger growth in the 
advanced economies should, in turn, boost EME growth, with emerging Asia also 
benefitting from low oil prices and accommodative monetary policies.   
The European Central Bank (ECB) eased pol icy further at its December meeting, 
responding to concerns that infl ation and inflation expectatio ns have been persistently 
below target.  Although the ECB’s cut in deposit rates and expansion of its asset 
purchases fell short of market expectations just prior to the December ECB meeting, the 
ECB’s actions were more aggressive than we had anticipated in October.  Accordingly, 
we have revised our forecast for euro -area inflation and growth up a touch. 
With foreign economies appearing to shake off some of their earlier torpor, it now 
seems easier to imagine that foreign growth will pick up faster than we are currently projecting.  The “Faster Foreign Growth” scen ario in the Risks and Uncertainty section 
explores such a possibility.  Nonetheless, we  continue to view the risks to the foreign 
outlook as tilted to the downside.  In part icular, weak earnings, declining commodity

prices, and increased corporate leverage have  raised financial stability risks in many 
EMEs, and a tightening of U.S. monetary polic y could aggravate these vulnerabilities.  A 
financial crisis and sharp economic slowdown in China remains a significant concern.  
And the situation in Brazil has become increasingly worrisome in recent months. 
We estimate that inflation fell to only ¼ pe rcent in the AFEs in the fourth quarter, 
largely reflecting declines in retail energy pri ces.  The further drop in  oil prices since the 
October Tealbook led us to revise down AFE in flation slightly in the near term.  AFE 
inflation is projected to rise to just under 1 percent early  next year as energy prices 
stabilize and then to increase gradually to 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period as 
economic slack diminishes.  In the EMEs, we estimate that inflation fell to 1½ percent in 
the current quarter, reflecting lower retail energy prices and a reve rsal of earlier food 
price increases in China, but we see it rising back to 3 percent by the second half of 
next year. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
 Canada.  Following a contraction in the first half of this year driven by sharp 
declines in oil-industry investment, r eal GDP growth rebounded as expected 
in the third quarter to 2.3 percent.  The improvement reflected strength in 
exports and a diminishing drag from i nvestment spending.  We expect growth 
to be just above 2 percent through 2016, as investment continues to recover, 
exports are supported by past currency depreciation, and monetary policy 
remains accommodative.  Thereafter, gr owth should edge down to a near-
potential pace of a littl e less than 2 percent by the middle of 2017.   
Third-quarter inflation was 2¼ percen t, in line with our estimate and 
supported by the depreciation of the Canadian dollar.  But, given further declines in oil prices, we expect inflation to moderate to 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter before slowly rising back to the Bank of Canada’s (BOC) 
2 percent target by 2017 as oil prices stabilize.  With inflation pressures 
contained, we continue to anticipate that  the BOC will keep its policy rate at 
0.5 percent until the first quarter of 2017.

 Japan.  GDP rose 1 percent in the third quarter, which is stronger than our 
October Tealbook forecast.  Growth wa s driven by both domestic demand and 
robust exports.  Recent indicators, in cluding October industrial production and 
the November manufacturing PMI, point to  GDP growth of about 1 percent in 
the fourth quarter as well.  We expect  growth to maintain that pace in 2016, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy and low oil prices, before a second hike in the consumption ta x stalls the expansion in 2017. 
As expected, the consumer price index wa s flat in the thir d quarter, and we 
forecast mild deflation in the current quarter.  These low inflation readings largely reflect falling retail energy prices .  As the effects of declines in oil 
prices dissipate and the output gap narrows, we project that inflation 
(excluding the direct effect of the consum ption tax hike) will rise to 1 percent 
by the second half of 2016 and to ju st under 1½ percent by the end of the 
forecast period.  With inflat ion projected to remain below the Bank of Japan’s 
(BOJ) 2 percent inflation target, we c ontinue to anticipat e that the BOJ will 
continue to purchase assets at leas t through the end of 2017, and we place 
some weight on the possibility that the BOJ will ramp up its asset purchase 
program in the future. 
 Euro Area.   Real GDP expanded 1.2 percent in the third quarter, down from 
1.6 percent in the second quarter a nd a little below our October Tealbook 
forecast.  Recent indicators on economic activity suggest that output growth in 
the current quarter also will be a bit lower than anticipated.  Nevertheless, 
given the additional monetary stimulus announced during the intermeeting period, a weaker euro, low oil prices, a nd easing credit conditions, we expect 
GDP growth to rise to 2 percent in 2 016 and to remain near that rate through 
2018, a touch higher than our October Tealbook projection. 
Through November, 12-month inflation re mained at 0.1 percent, but core 
inflation was considerably higher at 1 percent, with falling retail energy prices accounting for most of the difference.  On a quarterly basis, we expect 
headline inflation to stay slightly negativ e in the fourth quarter and then step

up to about 1½ percent next year as  energy prices stabilize, reaching 
1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period.  This forecast is slightly weaker 
in the current quarter due to incoming da ta and recent oil pr ice declines, but it 
is a touch higher over the medium term due to additional monetary stimulus and the depreciated euro. 
In an effort to bring inflation back to  target more quickly, the ECB decided on 
December 3 to extend its asset purchase program by six months, to March 
2017, and to cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to minus 30 basis points.  (See the box “European Experience w ith Negative Policy Rates” for a 
discussion of the recent experience of a number of European countries where 
policy rates have dropped below zero.)  As a result, the ECB’s cumulative 
asset purchases are likel y to reach about 15 perc ent of GDP by mid-2017.  
These additional measures were more accommodative than we had assumed in the October Tealbook.  As such, we booste d the projected le vel of euro-area 
GDP by about ¼ percent and the level of consumer prices about one-tenth of a 
percent over the forecast horizon. 
 United Kingdom.  Real GDP growth slowed to 1.9 percent in th e third quarter 
from 2.6 percent in the second quarter.  This reading is ½ percentage point lower than the October Tealbook project ion, largely reflecting disappointing 
net exports.  As domestic demand remains robust, we forecast GDP growth to bounce back to 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter and to remain near that pace through the projection period.   
Amid lower readings on reta il energy prices in recent months, we project that 
inflation in the fourth quart er will be negative ¼ percen t.  Inflation is expected 
to rise to the Bank of Engl and’s (BOE) 2 percent target  as the effect of past 
declines in energy prices dissipates and the economy continues to strengthen.  
We continue to expect that the BOE will begin raising its policy rate, now at 
0.5 percent, in the second quarter of 2016.  Of note, the BOE indicated in its 
November Inflation Report that it in tends to start reducing the size of its

balance sheet only after the policy rate reaches 2 percent, which we project to 
happen in the second half of 2017. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
 China.  After registering a 7¼ percent pace in  the third quarter, we estimate 
that real GDP growth stepped down to  6½ percent in the current quarter.  
Growth in the past several quarter s has been propped up by an unusually 
elevated contribution of financial services, which we expect will decline in the 
fourth quarter.  We expect this decline to more than offset a modest rebound in manufacturing growth from a very weak third quarter, consistent with recent readings on industrial producti on, PMIs, and exports.  Going forward, 
we see growth falling gradually to 6 percent by the end of the forecast period, in line with our estimate of China’s poten tial growth.  This forecast is little 
changed from the October Tealbook. 
After rising to over 3 per cent in the third quarter, inflation in China is 
estimated to have turned slightly ne gative in the current quarter, primarily 
reflecting a reversal of an earlier surge in pork prices.  We see inflation rising 
back to 2½ percent by the second half of next year and holding at that pace 
thereafter.  Amid low inflation and significant headwinds to growth, the 
People’s Bank of China (PBOC) lowered benchmark interest rates and banks’ 
required reserve ratios in late October,  and we expect the PBOC to provide 
some further stimulus going forward to  help smooth China’s adjustment to 
slower growth. 
 Other Emerging Asia.  Real GDP grew at a he althy 3½ percent pace in the 
third quarter, about 1 percentage poin t faster than in our October Tealbook 
forecast, after increasing a sluggish 2 percent in the second quarter.  Much of the surprise is attributab le to a strong rebound in Korea , as the effect of the 
MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndro me) outbreak dissipated.  Elsewhere 
in the region, the pickup in growth reflected some stab ilization in exports after 
earlier declines.  We expect overall gr owth to remain at 3½ percent in the

European Experience with Negative Policy Rates 
On December 3, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced further monetary stimulus, 
including a sixmonth extension of its asset purchase program and a cut of 10 basis points in its 
deposit rate to minus 0.30 percent (the blue line in figure 1). The ECB’s deposit rate has been 
negative since June 2014, when it was lowered to minus 0.10 percent. In September 2014, 
when the rate was cut to minus 0.20 percent, ECB President Mario Draghi said that “now we 
are at the lower bound.” However, in October of this year he indicated that lowering the 
deposit rate was again under consideration, in part after observing the experience of other 
countries that had cut their policy rates more deeply, including Switzerland, Denmark, 
and Sweden. 
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) moved its policy rate into negative territory in December 2014 
and sharply cut it to minus 0.75 percent in January of this year (figure 2), in part to offset 
considerable appreciation pressure after the SNB abandoned its exchange rate ceiling versus 
the euro. Soon after, speculation that the Danish krone would be forced off its peg to the 
euro prompted the Danish central bank to undertake heavy intervention sales of kroner and 
to cut its deposit rate in rapid steps to minus 0.75 percent. This year, the Swedish Riksbank 
cut its repo rate more gradually to the current rate of minus 0.35 percent (the red line in 
figure 3). 
Negative policy rates generally have not faced the problems that some had anticipated. 
Adverse effects on money market functioning have been limited, and euro area money market 
funds have adjusted by moving into higher yielding investments and toward variable net asset 
value frameworks. Moreover, cash holdings have not risen significantly in these countries, in 
part because of the nonnegligible costs of insuring, storing, and transporting physical cash. 
These favorable outcomes may be partly because not all deposits at central banks in these 
countries are subject to negative rates. Both Switzerland and Denmark, where the policy 
rates have gone most negative, allow large shares of bank reserves to be held at a zero 
interest rate, with exemptions depending on a bank’s size and money market activity. At the 
ECB, required reserves (about €110 billion) earn the 0.05 percent rate on marginal refinancing 
operations, while excess reserves (about €350 billion and rising) are charged the negative 
deposit rate. 
Increasingly negative policy rates appear to have eased credit conditions in much the same 
way as rate cuts in positive territory. As seen in figures 1, 2, and 3, short term money market 
rates declined along with policy rates in the euro area, Switzerland, and Sweden. Moreover, it 
appears that the easing was transmitted to assets of longer maturity and greater risk, 
although the effects of the rate cuts are hard to distinguish from those of concurrent asset 
purchase expansions by the ECB and the Riksbank. Bond yields have declined, as have bank 
lending rates in the euro area (figure 4), and the volume of euro area bank lending to 
corporations and households has picked up notably (figure 5). Additionally, interest rate 
reductions, including cuts into negative territory, exerted some downward  pressures on home 
currencies—a primary motivation in Denmark and Switzerland for lowering rates. Increasingly 
negative rates, along with asset purchases, likely also contributed to a weakening of the euro 
and the Swedish krona. 
Some concern has been voiced over the extent to which negative policy rates lower bank 
profits, potentially lessening their effectiveness as a policy tool. Banks’ interest margins are 
squeezed, as banks generally do not pass on negative rates to retail depositors even if bank

lending rates are falling. Some analysts have viewed the modest rise in Swiss long term 
mortgage rates this year, even as bond yields declined, as an attempt by banks to bolster their 
profits (figure 6). If banks increase lending rates and fees to maintain profits, those actions 
could limit the effectiveness of negative policy rates in transmitting easier credit conditions to 
the general economy. However, the rise in Swiss mortgage rates is the exception, and, 
overall, it appears that moving policy rates into negative territory has contributed to an easing 
of credit conditions in these economies. It is unclear how low policy rates can go before 
problems arise, but the European experience has shown that zero is not the effective 
lower bound.

fourth quarter, unchanged from our pr ojection in the October Tealbook.  We 
see growth rising to 4¼ percent next  year, supported by stronger growth 
abroad, accommodative monetary and fi scal policies, and low oil prices. 
We expect inflation in the region to pick up to 2¼ percent in the current 
quarter from 1½ percent in the third quart er, reflecting in part the removal of 
rental subsidies in Hong Kong  and a reversal of earlie r food price declines in 
India.  We see inflation moving up gr adually to 3¼ percent by 2017. 
 Latin America.  In Mexico , real GDP growth rose to 3 percent in the third 
quarter, up from 2½ percent in the se cond quarter and ¾ percentage point 
above our October projection.  Growth  was supported by a diminution of 
fiscal drag and a pickup in external demand following a weak first half.  We 
expect growth to dip back to 2½ percent in the current quarter, in line with the 
projected slowing of U.S. manufacturing growth.  Grow th then rises gradually 
to 3¼ percent by 2018, boosted by stronger U.S. manufacturing, 
accommodative monetary policy, and past currency depreciation. 
We expect Mexican inflation to edge up to 3¼ percent in the current quarter 
and to remain at that level over the rest of the forecast period.  We now expect 
the Bank of Mexico to hike its policy rate at its meeting the day after the 
December FOMC meeting. 
Brazilian real GDP plunged 6¾ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter 
following a downwardly revised 8 percen t decline in the second quarter.  
Private domestic demand, especially i nvestment, fell sharply again on a jump 
in unemployment, persistently high infla tion, and considerable skepticism that 
the country’s economic problems will be resolved soon.  Political gridlock 
continues to stymie the government’s effo rts to restore fiscal discipline, with 
President Dilma Rousseff now potentia lly facing impeachment proceedings, 
and consumer and business confidence remain at a near-record low.  
Accordingly, we have significantly re vised down our forecast for Brazil and 
now expect real GDP to cont ract 4¼ percent in the current quarter.  We do not

expect activity to begin to recover until 2017, and we see growth reaching 
only 2 percent by the end of that year.  Our baseline forecast assumes that spillovers from the Brazilian economy’s  weakness are confined to direct 
economic effects on its major trading part ners.  However, in this weak and 
uncertain economic climate, we do see so me risk that Brazil could experience 
more intense financial disruptions; these could spill over to other countries as investors reassess EME prospects more generally. 
Despite the weak econom y, inflation has remained stubbornly high at an 
estimated 9 percent annual rate in the current quarter, fueled by increases in 
administered prices and the s ubstantial depreciation of the real.  We expect 
past policy tightening and lower pressure  from administered prices to bring 
inflation down to 5½ percent by 201 7, still above the central bank’s 
4½ percent inflation target. In Argentina and Venezuela, populist leaders have suffered stunning losses 
in recent elections.  In Argentina, opposition candidate Ma uricio Macri won 
the presidential election and takes of fice December 10.  He has pledged to 
tackle the country’s serious economic problems and restore its access to 
global capital markets.  In Venezuela,  which is suffering a deep downturn and 
high inflation, the opposition secured a strong majority in the December 6 congressional elections.  This victory raises the likelihood that Venezuela will 
begin to address its serious economic problems.

Financial Developments 
Following the October FOMC statement a nd the stronger-than-expected October 
employment report, market participants subs tantially revised upward their expectations 
that the FOMC will raise the target range for the federal funds rate in December.  
Subsequent data releases and Federal Reserve communica tions firmed those views; 
market participants now attach high odds to  the possibility of a December liftoff.  
Notably, the rising likelihood of liftoff did not a ppear to generate any increase in actual 
or expected volatility in equity and fixed-in come markets.  Financing conditions for most 
businesses and households remained generally accommodative. 
 Based on federal funds futures, the odds that investors attached to an initial 
increase in the federal funds rate in December more than doubled to between 
80 and 95 percent, and the expected fe deral funds rate implied by OIS quotes 
rose moderately, increasing 23 basis points and 31 basis points at the end of 
2016 and 2017, respectively. 
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities increased notably, rising 34, 29, and 21 basis points, respectively.   
 Despite a sizable decline in oil pric es, TIPS-based measur es of inflation 
compensation edged up over the period but remained at low levels. 
 The U.S. dollar appreciated about 1¾ percent, as prospects for monetary 
policy divergence among the advanced economies firmed and as declines in global commodity prices weighed on emerging market currencies. 
 The S&P 500 index was little changed, on net, and traded in a relatively 
narrow range.  The VIX edged higher, on balance, but remained below its 
historical median level.   
 Yield spreads on investment-grade co rporate bonds were little changed, on 
net, while spreads on speculative-gr ade bonds widened somewhat further, 
particularly for the energy sector.  CMBS spreads also widened further.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 
Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases over the 
intermeeting period led investors to revise up sharply their perceived odds of liftoff in 
December.  In particular, investors reporte dly read the October FOMC statement as 
suggesting that the Committee judged that the downside risks to the U.S. economy 
stemming from global economic and financial developments had eased since the September meeting.  Further, the change in the forward-guidance language, especially the reference to “at its next m eeting,” was also seen as i ndicating a higher likelihood of a 
December liftoff.  The stronger-than-exp ected October employment report also 
contributed notably to the ri se in perceived odds of a December liftoff.  Other 
communications, including some policymakers’ speeches and the October minutes, as 
well as the November employme nt report appeared to firm the likelihood of a December 
liftoff. 
All told, investors now see a December ra te hike as highly likely.  Based on 
federal funds futures, the proba bility of a December liftoff more than doubled to between 
80 and 95 percent.
1  The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes 
also rose moderately over the intermeeting period; for instance, the implied rate at the 
end of 2016 increased 23 basis points to a little over ¾ percent, and th e implied rate at the 
end of 2017 increased 31 basis points to a little over 1¼ percent.  Rela tive to just before 
the FOMC initiated its tight ening cycles in 1994 and 2004, th e current probability of 
liftoff is somewhat above that observed in  1994 and somewhat belo w that observed in 
2004.  At the same time, the current expected pace of tightening is much slower than in 
1994 and 2004.  
Similar to financial market quotes, the average probability distribution from the 
Desk’s December surveys of primary dealers a nd market participants shows that liftoff at 
the December meeting is highly likely.  The average probability assigned to a December 
liftoff increased to about 90 per cent, from about 35 percent in  the October surveys.  The 
average pace of tightening in the first year following liftoff, conditioned on not returning to the zero lower bound, was little changed. 
1 Estimates of the probability of liftoff generally fall in a range of 80 to 95 percent depending on 
the technical assumptions underlying the calculations.

Consistent with the rise in the expect ed path of the federal funds rate and 
generally stronger-than-expected economic data releases, nominal Treasury yields rose 
34, 29, and 21 basis points on securities with 2-, 5-, and 10-year maturities, respectively.  
Swap rates of comparable horizons rose less than Treasury yields, narrowing swap 
spreads to historical lows.  (See the box “Recent Declines in Swap Spreads.”)  Near-term 
uncertainty about longer-term interest rates,  measured by swaption-implied volatilities on 
the 10-year swap rate, edged down, even as expectations for an imminent liftoff firmed. 
Despite a notable decline in oil prices and modest appreciation of the dollar, 
5- and 5-to-10-year measures of TIPS-base d inflation compensation rose 6 basis points 
and 7 basis points, respectivel y, but remained at low levels.  Inflation compensation 
measures based on inflation swaps also edged higher.   
On October 30, the Congress passed a bill to suspend the debt ceiling until mid-
March 2017.  Treasury bill supply, which had fallen considerably as the Treasury 
Department maneuvered to remain under the debt ceiling, subsequently rebounded strongly.  Throughout the debt ceiling episode and the rest of the intermeeting period, 
liquidity conditions in the Treasury (and agency MBS) markets remained stable.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
Since the October FOMC meeting, movement s in foreign financial markets have 
reflected the firming of expectations for the Fe deral Reserve to begin raising interest rates 
in December, as well as shifts in expectations for additional easing by the European 
Central Bank (ECB).  The dollar strengthened moderately against most currencies, and 
longer-term yields on foreign sovereign bonds  generally moved higher along with U.S.

Strong signals of more accommodation se nt by ECB President Mario Draghi 
since the October 22 ECB policy meeting led to further depreciation of the euro ahead of 
the ECB’s December meeting, a rise in euro-a rea stock prices, and a muted response of

meeting, the ECB cut its deposit rate by 10 ba sis points to minus 0.30 percent, extended

Recent Declines in Swap Spreads 
Interest rate swap spreads have declined noticeably since midAugust to historically low levels, 
leaving spreads at intermediate and long horizons in negative territory (figure 1).1 Similar declines 
are observed for other spreads over Treasury securities, particularly those on overnight index 
swaps. Spreads on debt instruments with default risk comparable with Treasury securities, such 
as triple A corporate bonds, also declined, but not to unusually low levels (figures 2 and 3). 
There are several reasons why one would expect swap spreads to be positive. One reason is that 
swap rates reflect premiums that investors demand for risk associated with exposure to the swap 
contract counterparty and for credit risk embedded in the LIBOR rate. Another is that investors 
are willing to pay a premium for the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities, leading to lower 
Treasury yields and higher swap spreads. In addition to factors driving those premiums, swap 
spreads are also driven by technical factors specific to the swap market, including corporate 
issuance, mortgage related hedging flows, and demand for synthetic duration on the part of 
institutional investors such as insurance companies. Market participants have focused, in 
particular, on the recent decline in swap spreads at short and intermediate horizons, pointing to a 
couple of developments that might have contributed to such a decline. The following discussion 
reviews these developments and examines their relevance for recent spread declines. 
One development is heavy corporate bond issuance ahead of the approaching liftoff in the target 
federal funds rate. Corporate bond issuers reportedly often swap their fixed rate liabilities for 
floating rate ones to match the duration of their assets, potentially leading to higher demand to 
receive fixed rate payments in swap contracts, putting downward pressure on swap rates, and, 
consequently, lowering swap spreads. However, fixed rate corporate bond issuance by financial 
firms—the type of corporate bond issuance that is reportedly more likely to be swapped—has 
not been elevated recently relative to the levels of the past few years, suggesting that hedging of 
corporate bond issuance was probably not the most important factor recently (figure 4).2 
Another factor that market participants have pointed to is the sale of Treasury securities by foreign 
reserve managers, which could have increased the effective supply of these securities in the market, 
leading to higher Treasury yields and, thus, lower swap spreads (all else being equal). Indeed, 
Treasury International Capital, or TIC, data point to substantial net sales of Treasury securities by 
foreign official investors in the third quarter of 2015 (figure 5). Consistent with such sales, decreases in 
1 Swap spreads shown in figure 1 are derived from quotes on plain fixed forfloating interest rate swap 
contracts, in which two parties exchange periodic payments that are based on a prespecified fixed rate (swap 
rate) and on the three month LIBOR, and are computed by subtracting yields on ontherun Treasury securities 
from swap rates of comparable horizons. An example of a realworld situation in which swap contracts are used 
is when a corporation issuing fixed rate debt swaps it into floating rate debt to better match duration of its assets. 
2 This conclusion is supported by regression results (not shown) suggesting that while in some specifications 
fixed rate financial issuance is associated with lower swap spreads, it can explain, at most, a few basis points of 
the spreads’ recent declines (including overall corporate issuance instead of fixed rate financial issuance does not 
change the conclusions). In addition, available data on trading volumes in the swap market do not appear to 
point to any recent runups in fixed forfloating swapping activity. More generally, one would expect the effect of 
corporate issuance to be transitory.

swap spreads over the September intermeeting period were most pronounced in shorter tenors, in 
which holdings of Treasury securities by foreign official investors are said to have been concentrated. 
In addition, some market participants suggested that initial declines in swap spreads triggered by 
foreign reserve sales were magnified by reduced willingness and capacity of dealers to serve as 
intermediaries in the Treasury markets. In particular, due in part to regulatory changes, dealers 
may have become less willing to provide financing for Treasury securities or to take on leverage 
to finance their own Treasury inventories, leading to a larger increase in Treasury yields than 
otherwise.3 In addition, reduced willingness of dealers to provide funding in the repo market 
could be one factor contributing to the downward trend in the spread of the three month LIBOR 
over the GC repo rate in the past couple of years, which has accelerated since August and early 
September (figure 6). Since taking positions predicated on expectations for a widening of swap 
spreads would involve financing long positions in Treasury securities in the GC repo market and 
becoming a receiver of floating rate payments in swap contracts, lower spreads between the 
LIBOR and the GC repo prate may, in turn, make it more costly for investors to take such 
positions, leading swap spreads to remain low for a longer time.4 These developments in the 
Treasury cash and repo markets might help explain why rates implied by derivative contracts, 
such as OIS and interest rate swaps, have not risen in line with Treasury yields since midAugust. 
3 At the same time, other new regulations could have reportedly led to higher demand for Treasury 
securities, particularly those with short maturities. 
4 In addition, participants of the Desk’s most recent Survey of Primary Dealers considered the increased 
balance sheet cost for cash products as the most important factor in explaining the narrowing of swap spreads, 
followed by foreign central bank selling of Treasury securities and increased issuance of corporate debt.

the minimum horizon for its asset purchase pr ogram by six months, and left the pace of 
purchases unchanged.  These measures we re less accommodative than expected by 
markets, resulting in a sharp but only part ial retracement in euro-area markets, which 
spilled over into global bond and equity prices.  On bala nce over the intermeeting period, 
the euro declined 1½ percent against the dol lar, euro-area equity prices fell roughly 
1 percent, and longer-term  German bond yields rose almost 15 basis points.  
The Bank of Japan maintained the existing pace of asset purchases at its October 
and November meetings, despite revising its fo recast so that inflation does not meet its 
2 percent target until early 2017, six months later than previo usly projected.  During the 
intermeeting period, the yen depreciated 2 percent agai nst the dollar, longer-term 
government bond yields were little changed, and Japanese equities rose almost 4 percent. 
In the United Kingdom, 24-month-ahead polic y rate expectations  initially tracked 
the rise in similar indicators for the United St ates, but they subsequently retraced most of 
that increase after the release of the November Inflation Report.   In the report, the Bank 
of England revised down its inflation forecast,  signaled that interest rates would likely 
rise only very gradually, and provided ne w guidance that the bank will wait until its 
policy rate reaches about 2 percent before re ducing its asset holdings, a threshold that is 
higher than previously expected.   
Most EME assets showed only limited weakness in reaction to increased 
expectations for an imminent U.S. liftoff.  Ho wever, declines in commodity prices late in 
the period weighed on EME currencies and e quity prices.  On net, EME currencies 
depreciated by 1¾ percent against the U.S. do llar, and equity prices declined about 
6 percent, reflecting falling ear nings and commodity prices.   
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS 
Despite a steep selloff of energy-sector stocks, broad stock price indexes were 
little changed, on net, since the October FOMC meeting.  The one-month-ahead option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—edged higher on balance.  Spreads 
on investment-grade corporate bonds were li ttle changed, while sp reads on speculative-
grade bonds widened somewhat further, particularly in the energy sector. 
Corporate earnings and credit  quality showed some continued signs of weakening.

per share in the third quarter is projected to have declined slightly compared with year-
earlier levels, in line with e xpectations.  Earnings growth was particularly weak in the 
energy and materials sectors due to declines in  oil and metals prices ; the stronger dollar 
appeared to weigh on earnings growth across many sectors.  Earnings have now declined 
for two consecutive quarters, and Wall Street  analysts’ projections suggest that the 
weakness in earnings growth will persist, with a continued drag coming from the energy sector.  In addition, the vol ume of nonfinancial bonds that were downgraded by Moody’s 
Investors Service in November signifi cantly outpaced the volume of upgrades, 
particularly for speculative-grade firms. 
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE 
Overall, nonfinancial busine sses continued to tap fina ncial markets at a brisk 
pace.  Issuance of corporate bonds and instit utional new money leveraged loans remained 
solid, driven by demand to finance M&A activ ity, while refinancing-related leveraged 
loan issuance stayed weak.  Growth of C&I loans on banks’ books continued to be strong in October and November, driven  mainly by large banks making large loans.  In contrast, 
public equity issuance remained subdued. 
Financing conditions for commercial real  estate lending tightened somewhat over 
the intermeeting period as CMBS spreads widened further, suggesting that CMBS investors continued to reassess the riskiness of the sector following several years of 
robust demand for these securities.  Noneth eless, CMBS issuance remained high and 
underwriting standards stayed relatively l oose, indicating that financing conditions 
continued to be quite accommodative overall.  
On balance, financing conditions for muni cipalities were generally stable.  Gross 
issuance of municipal bonds was solid in r ecent months, and yields declined over the 
intermeeting period, leaving their ratios to l ong-term Treasury yields somewhat lower but 
still at the high end of their historical distri bution.  Puerto Rico met its scheduled debt 
payments, but it continued to experience si gnificant financial strains and reportedly 
continued negotiations with investors to restructure its sizable outstanding debt.

reflecting sustained expansion in credit card balances and sizable increases in auto and 
student loans, although growth of student loan s continued to slow gr adually.  Student and 
auto loans remained broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime credit histories, 
while the availability of credit card lo ans for subprime borrowers stayed tight.  
Meanwhile, after having widened earlier in the fall, yield sp reads on consumer ABS were 
little changed in recent weeks, and ABS issuan ce maintained its robust  third-quarter pace.  
Financing conditions for residential mortga ges were also little changed, on net, 
over the intermeeting period, remaining tight fo r borrowers with low credit scores, hard-
to-document income, or higher debt-to-income ra tios.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages increased 21 basis points over the intermeeting period, in line with the increases in MBS yields and comparable-matur ity Treasury yields.  St ill, mortgage rates 
for qualified borrowers remained below 4 pe rcent—quite low by historical standards. 
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY 
Growth of core loans at commercial banks stayed strong in October and 
November, while growth of high-quality liquid assets held by la rge banks declined 
further, likely as some banks have already acquired enough assets to meet their required 
liquidity coverage ratios and other banks took steps to reduce the need to hold such liquid 
assets.  Within the category of liquid asse ts, domestic banks conti nued to build up their 
holdings of agency MBS while reducing thei r holdings of Treas ury securities.   
Net interest margins at bank holding companies (BHCs) remained about 
unchanged, on average, in the third quarter.  Profitability increased slightly, mainly 
reflecting higher investment banking revenues and lower noninterest expenses at the 
largest BHCs, but remained below the levels ob served in the decade prior to the financial 
crisis.  Stock prices of large domestic BH Cs outperformed the broader market over the 
intermeeting period, reportedly because higher expected interest rates may boost bank profitability in coming years.  Similarly, CD S spreads for large U.S. dealers edged lower 
even as broad market CDS spreads increased.  
M2 grew at an average annual rate of around 5 pe rcent over October and 
November.  Consistent with recent trends , liquid deposits grew moderately, currency 
growth remained strong, and small time  deposits continued to contract.

FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS 
The effective federal funds rate stayed fa irly stable within the target range over 
the intermeeting period, while some other shor t-term rates fluctuated with debt ceiling 
pressures and shifts in mone tary policy expectations.3  Yields on thre e-month Treasury 
bills rose from 8 basis points to 14 basi s points after the release of the October 
employment report and have since risen to 27 basis points, largel y reflecting increased 
expectations of a December liftoff as well as  an increase in Treasury bill issuance.  The 
path of implied GCF repo rates steepened, consiste nt with the rise in the expected path of 
the federal funds rate.  
Testing of the Federal Reserve’s polic y tools continued over the intermeeting 
period.  Take-up of the daily ON RRP opera tions averaged $104 billion, and money 
funds continued to account for the majority of  participation.  ON RRP usage continued to 
spike on month-ends, with October usage partic ularly high, likely due to the scarcity of 
Treasury bills associated with the debt ceili ng impasse.  Later in the intermeeting period, 
as the supply of Treasury bills increased, ON RRP take-up declined.  The Federal 
Reserve conducted a seven-day floating-rate term deposit operation on December 3 with 
$44 billion in awards to 43 participants.  Th e Desk announced plans to offer a total of 
$300 billion in three term RRP operations crossing year-end:   Operations on December 
18 and 23 will mature on January 4, and the December 30 operation will mature on January 5.
4  The Desk purchased about $25 billion of MBS under the reinvestment 
program and rolled $1.2 billion in expected settlements over the period, leaving Federal Reserve total assets  roughly unchanged.
5 
3 The effective federal funds rate averaged 12 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 4.4 basis points. 
4 Also, on December 2, the Desk conducted a sm all-value overnight repo operation that awarded 
$0.6 billion at rates ranging from 10 to 12 basis points. 
5 Due to the December 4, 2015, passage of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, in 
2016 the Federal Reserve’s capital surplus account will be reduced from approximately $29 billion to 
$10 billion, with the difference remitted to the Tr easury to help fund transportation infrastructure 
improvements.  Going forward, the capital surplus account will be capped at $10 billion; all funds that 
would otherwise have been transferre d from earnings to the capital surplu s account to equate it with capital 
paid in by member banks will be remitted to the Treasury.  In addition, the dividend on the stock of the 
Federal Reserve Banks held by member commercial ba nks with assets above $10 billion will be reduced 
from 6 percent to the lower of 6 percent or the prevailing rate on the 10-year Treasury bond.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  We have also maintained our assessment that the risks 
to our GDP projection are tilted somewhat to the downside, primarily reflecting our view 
that neither monetary nor fiscal policy is well positioned to offset large adverse shocks to 
the economy.  We view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned 
with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted somewhat to the upside.   
With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but 
do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, we 
continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.  TIPS-
based five-year-forward inflation compensation remains only slightly above its historic 
low, and there are hints of lower longer-term inflation expectations in some surveys.  In 
addition, although the dollar already reflects expectations of monetary policy divergence, 
the dollar may be stronger than in the baseline, leading to continued downward pressure 
on U.S. inflation.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities of the U.S. 
financial system as moderate.  This assessment reflects strong capital positions at banks 
and insurance companies, moderate leverage at other financial firms, and growth in 
household debt mostly driven by prime borrowers.  That said, commercial real estate 
valuation pressures have continued to increase, with prices rising faster than rents and a 
weakening in underwriting standards for loans originated for CMBS.  Despite a recent 
deceleration in the issuance of risky corporate debt, leverage at low-rated nonfinancial 
firms remains near record-high levels, suggesting a degree of fragility among these 
borrowers. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first

 scenario, the solid increases in consumption and E&I investment in recent quarters signal 
a stronger pace for the economic expansion and higher inflation over the projection 
period.  The second scenario illustrates the effect a moderate recession could have, 
particularly when the federal funds rate remains near the zero lower bound (ZLB).  In the 
third scenario, potential GDP growth is assumed to continue at a pace similar to that 
observed in the past few years and,  thus, at a slower rate than in the baseline.  The fourth 
scenario considers the implications of long-term inflation expectations that are lower than 
in the baseline.  In the fifth scenario, the normalization of U.S. monetary policy leads to a 
large appreciation in the broad real dollar.  The final scenario considers the possibility 
that foreign growth is faster than expected.  
We generate the first and second scenarios using the EDO model, while the third 
and fourth are generated using the FRB/US model.  The final two scenarios, which 
consider international risks, are illustrated using the multicountry SIGMA model.  Once 
the federal funds rate has risen above its current target range, its movements are 
governed —as in the baseline forecast —by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1  
In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their 
baseline paths. 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation  
In this scenario, the solid increases in consumer spending and E&I investment in 
recent quarters are a harbinger of greater underlying strength in the economy.  In 
addition, we assume that inflation is more sensitive to resource slack than in the standard 
version of the EDO model.  This greater sensitivity is consistent with the estimates of 
some other DSGE models, such as Smets and Wouters (2007).2  It is also consistent with 
the view that the Phillips curve is steeper at higher rates of resource utilization than when 
economic activity is relatively weak.3    
                                                 
1 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations.  One key difference relative to the FRB/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference betw een actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

 Real GDP rises 4 percent in 2016, compared with 2½ percent in the baseline 
projection.  The unemployment rate falls rapidly, bottoming out at 4¼ percent by the 
beginning of 2017; it then edges up over the remainder of the forecast period but stays 
lower than in the baseline.  With resource utilization running tighter and the Phillips 
curve assumed to be steeper than in the standard version of the model, inflation rises 
more than in the baseline, approaching 2½ percent in 2019.4  The federal funds rate rises 
more steeply, passing 4 percent in 2018 and reaching 5 percent in 2020.  Given enough 
time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate 
up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent.  Unemployment 
does not need to exceed the natural rate in order to bring inflation back down —simply 
returning to the natural rate is enough —because inflation expectations remain anchored 
throughout the scenario. 
Recession Near the Zero Lower Bound 
Over the postwar period, the average expansion has lasted about five years.   The 
bulk of the statistical evidence suggests that expansions do not “die of old age .”5  
However, some analysts have noted that six years have now passed since the 2009 trough 
and have suggested that the economy might therefore be at heightened risk of falling into 
recession over the next few years.  In this scenario, we assume a recession, starting in 
2016:Q2, of magnitude equal to the average peak- to-trough decline in GDP during the 
five most moderate recessions since 1960.6  In the past, policymakers have reacted to 
recessions much more aggressively than the inertial Taylor rule would have prescribed.  
Accordingly, for the sake of illustration, the federal funds rate in our initial calibration is 
assumed to fall 275 basis points, the average decline seen over the same five recessions 
since 1960.  Such a decline would push the funds rate well below the ZLB. 
                                                 
4 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for 
wages and prices in this scenario; the smaller costs lead to a steeper Phillips curve.  Had we used our 
standard coefficients in the wage and price equations, inflation would have peaked at only about 2 percent. 
5 See, for example, Francis Diebold and Glenn Rudebusch (1990), “ A Nonparametric 
Investigation of Duration Dependence in the American Business Cycle, ” Journal of Political Economy , 
vol. 98 (June), pp. 596 616; and Francis Diebold, Glenn Rudebusch, and Daniel Sichel (1993), “Further 
Evidence on Business-Cycle Duration Dependence, ” in M ark Watson and James Stock, eds.,  Business 
Cycles, Indicators, and Forecasting  (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press for the National Bureau of 
Economic Research), pp. 255 80. 
6 Specifically, we took the average over the recessions that began in 1960, 1969, 1980, 1990, and 
2001.  All five of these recessions lasted less than one year, whereas the other three post-1960 recessions 
lasted more than one year.

 To illustrate the effect of the ZLB on outcomes, results are shown with and 
without the ZLB imposed.  In the case when the federal funds rate is allowed to be 
negative, output falls 3¼ percent below the baseline at its trough in the first quarter of 
2017.7  When the ZLB is imposed, the federal funds rate returns to the ZLB one quarter 
after the onset of recession and remains there until the end of 2017.  In this case, output 
falls an estimated 4½ percent.8  Of course, the fact that the size and composition of the 
SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow their baseline paths means that the effect of the 
ZLB is larger than would be the case if policymakers were to make use of their 
unconventional tools.   
Weaker Supply Side  
In the baseline projection, the staff assumes that potential GDP will rise 
1½ percent next year and accelerate further in the following couple of years, a notable 
pickup from the staff’s estimate of an average pace of potential output growth of about 
1 percent per year over the past four years.  In this scenario, we assume that potential 
GDP growth continues at a pace around 1 percent through the medium term, mostl y 
reflecting slower trend productivity growth.  We also assume that recent aggregate 
demand momentum persists for a while so that GDP growth continues at its baseline pace 
into next year.  Thereafter, momentum gradually fades and the weaker supply-side 
conditions lead to weaker aggregate demand.  Finally, we assume that these revisions to 
the supply side of the economy are fully recognized, including by policymakers.  
The unemployment rate declines more steeply next year than in the baseline, in 
line with the pace of recent years, and dips below 4 percent by mid-2017.  Both tighter 
resource utilization and weaker productivity gains —which push up unit labor costs —
work to boost inflation in this scenario.  Overall inflation rises above 2 percent in 2017; it 
peaks at 2¼ percent at the end of 2018 and edges back toward target thereafter.  
Reflecting higher inflation and tighter resource utilization than in the baseline, the federal 
funds rate rises above 5 percent in 2019 and 2020.  
                                                 
7 The shocks generating the recession in this scenario cause the model’s estimate of the natural 
rate of interest to decline almost 6½ percentage points relative to the baseline by the end of 2016 —
considerably more than the assumed decline in the federal funds rate.   
8 The same exercise in FRB/US under VAR-based expectations shows smaller but more prolonged 
adverse effects on output when the ZLB is imposed.

 Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
In the baseline projection, PCE price inflation is projected to increase gradually to 
the Committee’s longer -run target of 2 percent.  A key assumption behind this projection 
is that the level of long-term inflation expectations is currently consistent with PCE 
inflation of 1.8 percent, and that expectations will eventually rise to a level consistent 
with 2 percent inflation.  However, a wide range of uncertainty surrounds this 
assumption, and some models that we consult suggest that expectations are currently 
consistent with lower inflation.  In this scenario, we assume that long-term expectations 
currently stand at 1.5 percent and that, going forward, households and businesses form 
their expectations adaptively based on past inflation.   
Overall inflation is near 1 percent next year and does not rise above 1½ percent 
until 2019, as subdued inflation expectations and low actual inflation are mutually 
reinforcing.  The path of the federal funds rate is lower than in the baseline, while the 
paths of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged.  However, 
the effect of low inflation on the real economy could be adverse if, for example, there 
were a pronounced debt-deflation dynamic. 
Stronger Dollar 
In the staff baseline, the gradual normalization of U.S. monetary policy is 
associated with only a modest appreciation of the dollar in 2016, and the dollar 
depreciates somewhat thereafter.  However, it is possible that liftoff and ensuing policy 
normalization will induce a much larger and sustained appreciation of the dollar.  In this 
scenario, we assume that liftoff of the federal funds rate triggers moderate financial 
turbulence in the EMEs and flight- to-safety flows toward dollar-denominated assets.  
Specifically, the broad real dollar appreciates about 10 percent next year , and EME 
corporate borrowing spreads increase 100 basis points.9  All told, EME GDP growth falls 
½ percentage point in 2016 relative to the baseline. 
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to 
decline relative to the baseline.  U.S. real GDP expands at an annual rate of only 
2 percent in 2016, about ½ percentage point below the baseline, and the unemployment 
rate remains around 5 percent through most of 2017.  The appreciation of the dollar and 
                                                 
9 The increase in EME corporate spreads is similar to what occurred following the “taper tantrum” 
in the spring of 2013.

 lower resource utilization reduce core PCE inflation to less than 1 percent in 2016.  The 
federa
l funds rate follows a shallower path over the forecast horizon than in the baseline. 
Faster Foreign Growth  
After posting only tepid growth in the first half of this year, foreign real GDP 
growth picked up in t
he third quarter.  Going forward, foreign growth is projected to 
move up gradually to about its potential rate of 3 percent by the second half of next year.  
But a number of factors —such as the substantial easing of monetary policy, the 
abatement of fiscal pressures, or responses to the large drop in oil prices —could spur a 
faster recovery abroad than we are currently projecting.  In this scenario, we assume a 
stronger-than-expected pickup in foreign growth, which leads to a modest depreciation of 
the dollar.  As a result, the level of foreign GDP is 1½ percent above the baseline by 
2017.  Diminished conc
erns about the prospects for the global economy, as well as less 
need for
 monetary accommodation abroad, reduce the demand for dollar-denominated 
assets, le
ading the broad real dollar to decline 5 percent relative to the baseline.  
Stronger foreign growth and the weaker dollar boost U.S. real net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP expands nearly 3 percent in 2016, about ½ percentage point 
more than in the base
line, and the unemployment rate falls to almost 4 percent by the end 
of 2018.  High
er import prices and somewhat greater resource pressures cause core PCE 
inflation to rise a
 little more quickly than in the baseline.  The federal funds rate also rises 
more quickly th
an in the baseline, reaching 4 percent by the end of 2018.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent
 ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions
to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
