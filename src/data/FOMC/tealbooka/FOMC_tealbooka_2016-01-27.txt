Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
We have made only modest changes to our baseline domestic economic outlook 
relative to our December forecast.  To be su re, the available indicators of both spending 
and production that have become available during the intermeeting period have been 
weaker than we had expected, even after looking through some  factors that we think will 
unwind in the next few months.1  Moreover, financial conditi ons have tightened notably, 
with equity prices down about 10 percent since the previous Tealbook, the dollar about 
3 percent stronger, and risk spreads in debt ma rkets wider.  That said, the labor report for 
December was stronger than we expected, a nd initial claims for unemployment insurance 
have drifted up only slightly from ve ry low levels late last year.   
Overall, balancing the labor market data against the other indi cators, we assess the 
cyclical position of the economy as only sligh tly weaker than we t hought it would be at 
the time of the December Tealbook.  In our base line projection, we continue to forecast 
that real activity will move a little above its  sustainable level during the next few years:  
At the end of 2018, we now have real GDP 1¼ percent above potential and the 
unemployment rate finishing that year at 4.6 percent, ½ percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate.  Both of these measures are a shade less strong than in the 
previous projection.   
At the same time, we also see the downside risks to our forecast of real activity as 
more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about 
global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence at home and abroad.   
Our projection for total PCE inflation is lo wer over the first half of this year, 
mainly as a result of the hi gher dollar and the lower path fo r oil prices.  However, we 
continue to project that total PCE inflati on will move up to 2 percent in 2018, as energy 
prices bottom out and start to  increase moderately, import prices turn back up, and 
resource utilization tightens further in an environment of stable  long-term inflation 
expectations. 
1 These transitory factors include a significant slowdown in inventory investment in the fourth 
quarter of 2015, unusually warm weather that suppressed household outlays for energy services, and a 
change in mortgage regulations that temporarily depressed home sales.  These factors are all assumed to 
abate or reverse in the first half of 2016.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2015 is below the Blue Chip 
consensus forecast and the median projection from the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters (SPF) (although the latter dates from mid November). The staff’s GDP 
forecast is close to the others in 2016 but ½ percentage point below the Blue Chip 
forecast for 2017. The staff’s forecast for unemployment is close to the others 
throughout the medium term. Its inflation projections are generally lower, 
particularly in 2016.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 As in previous projections, the path for the federal funds rate is governed by 
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999)  policy rule.  In this round, the federal 
funds rate generated by the rule averag es about 3¼ percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2018, about ¼ percentage point lower than in the December 
Tealbook, mostly reflecting the downward revision to the projection for the 
output gap. 
 We now assume that the SOMA portfolio  will remain at its current size until 
the fourth quarter of this year, at wh ich point the portfolio will begin to 
contract as proceeds from maturing assets  are not reinvested.  Compared with 
the December Tealbook, the cessation of reinvestment was delayed two 
quarters, which we view as more consis tent with the FOMC’s statement that 
reinvestment would continue until no rmalization was “well under way.” 
Other Interest Rates 
 Our projection continues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to rise 
significantly, reflecting the movement  of the 10-year valuation window 
through the period of extremely low short- term interest rates as well as an 
increase in the term premium from its current near-zero value toward its assumed longer-term level of ¾ percen tage point.  Compared with the 
December Tealbook, the 10-year Treasury yield is slightly lower in the 
medium term, reflecting both the lower pa th of short-term rates and the later 
assumed date for the cessation of re investment of the SOMA portfolio.
2 
 We revised the paths for the 30-year mo rtgage rate and th e 10-year triple-B 
corporate bond rate mostly in line wi th the revision to Treasury yields.  
Spreads of rates on triple-B cor porate bonds over those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities have been  rising gradually for the past year, and 
we project them to remain elevated for several quarters into the projection period. 
2 The downward revision to the federal funds rate does not persist much past the medium term and 
thus has only a modest effect on the 10-year Treasury yield.

Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 As of the market close on January 19, stock prices had fallen about 10 percent 
since the time of the December Teal book, leading us to revise down our 
projection for stock prices throughout the medium term.  We judge that a 
portion of the recent drop in equity pri ces reflects a transitory increase in 
investor risk aversion and t hus assume that only a littl e more than half of the 
decline persists by the en d of 2018.  We project that, after stock prices drop 
substantially in the current quarter, they will appreciate about 3½ percent per 
year over the medium term, a shade fast er than in the previous Tealbook.   
 We continue to expect house prices to decelerate further, from an increase of 
5 percent last year to an average ga in of around 2¾ percent per year over the 
medium term.  One simple model of housing valuation that we monitor 
suggests that housing is currently over valued by 7 percent, compared with 
more than 40 percent a decade ago; a second model suggests housing is about 
fairly valued.3 
Fiscal Policy 
 We now anticipate that fiscal policy will be a bit more expansionary than we 
had previously assumed, reflecting provisions of the omnibus spending bill that was enacted in mid-December.  The bill contained two tax law changes 
that we had not anticipated:  a multiy ear extension of the bonus depreciation 
tax credit for business investment and a delay in introdu cing several taxes 
related to the Affordable Care Act.  Overall, we now e xpect fiscal policy 
actions at all levels of government to provide a ½ percentage point boost to GDP growth this year and a more modest boost to growth in 2017 and 2018.

3 Both models were described in a pair of recent memos sent to the Committee on January 16, 
2016:  “Staff Assessment of Housing Overvaluation,” by Steven Laufer, and “Measuring Housing 
Overvaluation Using the Zillow Price-to-Rent Ratio,” by Raven Molloy. The first model assesses the 
price-to-rent ratio against co sts of housing investment (such as inte rest rates) and a linear trend that may 
reflect challenges associated with measuring house prices and rents.  The second model takes a similar 
approach but relies on different data so urces to construct price-to-rent ratios. 
4 Specifically, we project fiscal impetus to be 0.6 percentage point in 2016 (up from 
0.4 percentage point in the December Tealbook), 0.3 percentage point in 2017, and 0.1 percentage point in 
2018.  The estimates for 2017 and 2018 are little revised.

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 The broad nominal dollar has appreciated 3 percent, on net, since the time of 
the December Tealbook.  In the wake of  the recent volatility in Chinese 
exchange rates and financial markets, the dollar strengthened against almost 
all currencies except the Japanese yen.  We  expect the nominal dollar to rise a 
touch further in the first half of this year—lifted by widening monetary policy 
divergences between the United States  and advanced foreign economies and 
some further depreciation of the Chin ese renminbi and other emerging Asian 
currencies—and then to be little change d over the medium term.  By the end 
of 2018, our projection for the broad real dollar is about 4 percent higher than 
in the previous Tealbook.   
 We estimate that foreign real GDP grew at  an annual rate of 2 percent in the 
fourth quarter, slower than the 2½ percen t pace of the third quarter but still up 
from a very subdued 1½ percent pace in  the first half of 2015.  Our estimate 
for the fourth quarter has been revised down ¼ percentage point relative to the 
December Tealbook, largely on account of weaker-than-expected data for 
Canada.  Although we are attuned to the heightened risks emanating from 
China and global commodity markets, we continue to see growth abroad rising to about 3 percent by the end of  2016, albeit with a somewhat weaker 
start to the year that mainly reflects th e expected near-term effect of lower oil 
prices on activity in Canada and othe r commodity exporters.  We project 
foreign economic growth to remain near 3 percent through 2018, supported by 
accommodative monetary policies and depreciated currencies. 
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 Oil prices have tumbled since the Dece mber Tealbook, with the spot price of 
Brent oil down another $12 per barre l, closing at $29 per barrel on 
January 19.  Further-dated futures have moved down even more sharply, with 
the December 2018 futures quote falling $14, to $43 per barrel.  Both demand 
and supply factors have weighed on oil prices.  On the demand side, worries 
include the outlook for economic growth in China and its implications for the 
global economy.  On the supply side, U.S. oil production remains near its 
recent peak, resulting in high and grow ing oil inventories; in addition, the 
lifting of export sanc tions against Iran has firmed  expectations of increased 
Iranian oil exports.  Our forecast for th e price of imported oil in the current

quarter has been revised down by almost  $8 per barrel to $30, with prices 
expected to only slowly move up to $38 per barrel by the end of the forecast 
period.  
 After increasing late last year, metals prices have declined significantly since 
then, likely reflecting, in part, increased concerns a bout global growth and the 
state of the Chinese economy.  In contra st, the prices of agricultural goods are 
basically unchanged on net rela tive to the December Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The incoming data on spending and production in the fourth quarter were 
substantially weaker than we had expected, leading us to mark down our estimate of real 
GDP growth last quarter to a paltry ½ percent at an annual rate—1¼ percentage points 
less than in the December Tealbook and a ma rked deceleration from the 2 percent 
increase in the third quarter.5  While downward revisions were widespread across 
spending categories, the largest contributi ons to the revision we re from inventory 
investment and consumer spending.  We  expect a bounceback in some spending 
categories from what we judge to  be transitory softness, but we also took some signal for 
the underlying pace of activity from weaker read ings in other categories.  In all, we 
project real GDP will increase at  an annual rate of about 2 percent in the current quarter, 
unrevised from the December Tealbook. 
 The recent data suggest that consumer spending slowed by considerably more 
last quarter than we had projected, appa rently advancing at an annual rate of 
just 1¾ percent.  Part of the weakne ss reflected unusua lly warm weather, 
which we think held down spending for energy services in both November 
and December.  However, the first official estimate of December retail sales was surprisingly low, motor vehicle sale s fell more than we had anticipated 
(though to a still-strong level), and spe nding on services ou tside energy was a 
bit softer in November than we expect ed, suggesting that other factors were 
also at work.  For the current quarter, we project PCE growth to step up to a 
3 percent pace.  Spending this quart er is boosted, in part, by a rebound in 
5 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2015:Q4 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at 
1.5 percent, is 1 percentage point higher than the staff’s judgmental projection.  For reference, the standard 
error from the Board staff’s dynamic factor model is nearly 1½ percentage points.

outlays on energy services as temperatur es are assumed to return to normal, 
but the pickup also reflects our expectation that spending growth will return to 
levels consistent with household inco mes, wealth, and consumer sentiment 
(which seems to be holding up reasonably well).  Excluding outlays for energy, the anticipated pickup in PCE gr owth is more modest, from about  
2¼ percent in the fourth quarter to about  2¾ percent in the cu rrent quarter; the 
latter figure is revised down about ½ percentage point from the December Tealbook. 
 Incoming data on housing activity remain consistent with a sector that 
continues to recover gradually from its very subdued levels of recent years.  
Here, too, a transitory factor—related to recently implemented mortgage-
lending reporting rules—he ld down residential inve stment growth last 
quarter.

 Business fixed investment appears to ha ve risen moderately in the fourth 
quarter but is likely to decelerate shar ply in the current quarter.  Business 
purchases of motor vehicles are anticipa ted to fall after a couple of strong 
quarters.  Moreover, we now expect sp ending on other equipment to rise only 
modestly in the near term, given data on orders and shipments through 
November that were somewhat disappointing as well as negative readings from some of the business surveys.  In  addition, we expect drilling and mining 
investment to continue falling sharply this quarter (nearl y 40 percent at an 
annual rate), reflecting the further decreas es in energy prices.  In all, business 
fixed investment is projected to be about flat in the first quarter after 
increasing at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent over the second half of 2015. 
 After subtracting an estimated ¾ percen tage point from real GDP growth in 
the third quarter, inventor y investment appears to have deducted nearly 
1 percentage point from real GDP grow th last quarter, a drag more than 
½ percentage point larger than we ha d projected in December.  With limited 
6 Residential investment in the fourth quarter, as  measured in the NIPA, will be held down by a 
sharp fall in the sales of existing homes in November.  The drop reportedly reflects delays in mortgage 
closings related to new reporting rules for mortgage lenders implemented by the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau in October as part of the Truth-in-Lending Act/RESPA disclosures.  We expect these 
delays will be relatively short-lived—indeed, we expect a solid rebound in sales in the coming months— 
but the effect of sales closings on brokers’ commissions, all else being equal, lowers residential investment 
in the fourth quarter and raises it in the current quarter.

evidence that inventory ratios remain uncomfortably high except for energy 
products, we see this inventory slow down as behind us, and we project 
inventory accumulation to move up a lit tle in the near term, making a small 
positive contribution to GDP growth.  
 We estimate that net exports subtracted almost ½ percentage point from real 
GDP growth in the fourth quarter, as e xports declined slightly while imports 
grew modestly.  In the first half of 2016, net exports are expected to reduce GDP growth by 1 percentage point, as past dollar appreciation pushes exports 
down further and boosts import growth.  
 Industrial production declined  in December for the third consecutive month.  
The sizable downdraft in oil and gas dr illing continues to subtract from 
mining activity, and utilities output fe ll sharply as a resu lt of the unusually 
warm temperatures in recent months.  Manufacturing outpu t only edged up at 
an annual rate of ½ perc ent in the fourth quarter , reflecting a pullback in 
motor vehicle assemblies from the elevated levels seen earlier in the year, weakness in exports, and adverse upstream effects of the reduction in oil drilling.  With these same forces continuing to weigh on the sector, 
manufacturing IP is expected to increase just ½ percent in the current quarter, 
a tepid outlook that is consistent with the low readings of the national and regional manufacturing surveys. 
Beyond the near term, real GDP growth is expected to run above our estimate of 
its potential, supported by the still-accomm odative stance of monetary policy and by 
expansionary fiscal policy. 
 After rising 1¾ percent in 2015, real GDP is projected to increase 2½ percent 
this year, with the pickup reflecting a solid gain in PCE and a boost from 
federal purchases.  Consumption growth in 2016 is projected to be bolstered 
by ongoing gains in real disposable pe rsonal income that reflect further 
improvements in the labor market.  In addition, the effects of earlier increases in the wealth-to-income ratio are an ticipated to support spending growth 
slightly this year.  
 Real GDP growth then slows over th e rest of the pr ojection period, to 
2 percent in 2017 and to 1¾ percent in 2018, as consumer and business

spending decelerates in response to the tightening of monetary policy and as 
fiscal impetus diminishes.  This dece leration in real GDP is attenuated by a 
waning drag from net exports as the effects of the past appreciation of the 
dollar fade. 
 Our forecast for output growth over the next three years is slightly more subdued than in the December Tealbook.  The weaker equity price path and 
the stronger dollar built into this projection are less favorable for growth; 
these factors are partly offset by the positive impetus from more expansionary 
fiscal policy and the lower path for oil prices.  With the downward revision to 
GDP growth in the final quart er of last year and growth rates that are revised 
down slightly thereafter, the projected le vel of real GDP at the end of 2018 is 
almost ½ percent lower than in our previous forecast.  
 The adjustments that we made to the baseline forecast in response to the 
recent movements in financial and commodity prices, which were triggered in 
part by developments in China, only refl ect conventional channels such as the 
wealth effect operating on consumpti on spending, higher borrowing costs for 
businesses, and the dollar appreciation acting to restrain net exports.  We 
assumed no additional contribution in the baseline from effects operating 
through confidence or financial market disruptions, based on the following 
considerations:  We see the direct fi nancial linkages between China and the 
United States as modest, we assume in the baseline that financial conditions in China and most other emerging markets wi ll not worsen materially further, 
and we view the U.S. financial system as being relatively well positioned to 
absorb commodity-related shocks.  (For  additional detail on how we assessed 
the implications of developments in China for the staff baseline forecast, see 
the box “Recent Developments in China a nd Implications for the Outlook” in 
the International Economic Develo pments and Outlook section.)   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
In contrast to the incoming data on spending and production, the December 
employment report was stronger than we had projected. 
 Nonfarm payroll employment is now es timated to have risen nearly 285,000 
per month last quarter, about 45,000 more than we expected and 110,000

faster than the third-quarter pace.  In response to this faster pace of 
employment gains, we boosted our e xpectation for first-quarter hiring by 
25,000, to 240,000 per month.7 
 The unemployment rate held steady at 5.0 percent in December, whereas we 
had expected it to tick down to 4.9 percent.  However, the labor force 
participation rate moved back up to 62.6 percent, and the employment-to-
population ratio edged up and was a touch stronger than we had projected.  
We expect the unemployment rate to d ecline to 4.9 percent in January and to 
remain there through March.   
 With its latest increase, the labor force participation rate now appears to have 
reversed much of the puzzling drop that occurred last summer.  In response, we raised our projection for the cu rrent quarter slightly, putting the 
participation rate just 0.1  percentage point below our  estimate of its trend.  
(See the box “The Scope for Cyclical R ecovery in Labor Force Participation” 
for more information.) 
 The staff’s labor market conditions inde x, or LMCI, an alternative, strictly 
mechanical method of filtering the data, rose moderately in December. 
 In light of the still-strong tenor of th e data coming out of the labor market, we 
think the very weak reading on GDP grow th in the fourth quarter overstates 
the deterioration in the cyclical posit ion of the economy.  Accordingly, we 
lowered our estimates of structural pr oductivity growth and potential output 
growth in 2015 by 0.2 percentage poi nt, to 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent, 
respectively.  After this adjustment, the GDP gap in the current quarter is just 
a touch weaker than in our previous projection.  
Reflecting the deceleration projected for real GDP, the pace of recovery in the 
labor market slows over the medium term.  In addition, given the slight downward revision in projected GDP growth from here  forward, we now have the labor market 
improving by a little less than in the December Tealbook. 
7 We think the warm weather in December ma y have provided a small boost to the reported 
employment gains, most likely in construction.

The Scope for Cyclical Recovery in Labor Force Participation 
Most key measures of labor market conditions—including the unemployment rate and 
payroll employment—have improved markedly since the end of the Great Recession. In 
contrast, the labor force participation rate at the end of last year was 2 percentage points 
below its level at the end of 2009 (figure 1). We estimate that structural factors—including 
demographically driven trends and other secular changes in the labor market—have been 
pushing the participation rate down during the past six years, even as cyclical forces have 
been pushing it up; on net, the structural factors have predominated. In particular, informed 
by a cohort based model of labor force participation developed by the staff, we currently 
estimate that structural factors have pushed down the trend participation rate by about 
2½ percentage points since 2009.1 Thus, we estimate that there has been a cyclical 
improvement in the participation rate gap—the difference between the actual participation 
rate and its trend—of about ½ percentage point since 2009. 
In the staff’s assessment, the participation rate was still ¼ percentage point below its trend 
at the end of last year, even as the unemployment rate had moved below our estimate of its 
natural rate (figure 2). This estimate of the cyclical shortfall in labor force participation is in 
line with our cohort based model and is also consistent with the stillelevated number of 
individuals who are out of the labor force but report they want a job.

The staff anticipates that there is some further scope for cyclical improvement in labor force 
participation, and we expect that the participation rate gap will improve almost 
½ percentage point during the next three years. The somewhat delayed recovery in the 
participation rate is in line with evidence indicating that the cyclic al recovery in labor force 
participation is typically a latecycle phenomenon.2 As shown in figure 2, during the previous 
two recoveries the negative participation rate gap persisted well into the recovery. Indeed, 
the turning point for the cyclical rebound in labor force participation during the past two 
recoveries seems to have roughly coincided with the period when the unemployment rate 
approached its natural rate. At its cyclical peak, the participation rate seems to have been 
about ½ percentage point above its estimated trend. 
Several factors can contribute to a delay ed cyclical recovery in labor force participation. 
First, labor supply decisions tend to be persistent. For instance, decisions to attend school 
or care for children may entail multiyear commitments, and thus it may take time before 
individuals react to improved labor market conditions. Second, wage growth typically 
strengthens as the labor market recovery progresses, and these higher wages might 
persuade individuals on the sidelines of the job market to join the labor force. In fact, 
subdued wage growth in recent years may be one reason why the cyclical rebound in 
participation has not been stronger so far. Third, employers’ hiring behavior is likely to 
change as labor market slack diminishes, leading to increased recruiting efforts and lower 
screening standards. Changes in hiring patterns and attitudes can help pull in individuals 
who have low qualifications, lack recent work experience, or possess criminal records. 
The staff’s assessment of the cyclical shortfall in participation is subject to considerable 
uncertainty, especially in real time. On the one hand, the severity of the Great Recession and 
the sluggishness of the subsequent recovery may have resulted in more permanent labor 
market dama ge than we currently estimate, and thus the trend in participation could be 
lower than currently assumed by the staff. On the other hand, the protracted labor market 
weakness since the end of the Great Recession might have also led to unusually large 
temporary exits from the labor force, implying that the delayed cyclical rebound in the 
participation rate might be longer and larger than in previous cyclical episodes. All told, 
while it is difficult to precisely quantify the relevant amount of uncertainty—which is, to a 
large extent, related to model specificati on uncertainty—different models consulted by the 
staff yield a range of participation gap estimates at the end of last year from near zero (the 
FRB/US model) to negative ¾ percentage point (a variant of the cohort based model). A 
comprehensive measure of uncertainty would surely be wider. 
2 Regression results based on state level data suggest that the full response of the participation rate to 
changes in labor market conditions materializes only after a period as long as a few years. See Aaronson

 Monthly payroll gains in 2015, at 220,000, were surprisingly strong relative to 
GDP growth; concomitantly, productivity  gains have been disappointing, and 
actual productivity in late 2015 was below our estimate of its structural level.  
We expect productivity to move up towa rd its trend over the forecast period 
and job growth to slow to a pace of 175,000 per month by the end of this year 
and to 110,000 per month by 2018.   
 All told, projected monthly job gains ar e little changed this year and are 
revised down about 15,000 in 2017 and 10,000 in 2018. 
 With output increasing faster than its pot ential rate over the medium term, the 
unemployment rate moves down fu rther, reaching 4.6 percent by 2018, 
½ percentage point below our estim ate of its natural rate.  The cumulative 
reduction in the unem ployment rate is 0.1 percentage point less than in the 
Decem ber projection.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Since the December Tealbook, we have received the CPI for November and 
December and PCE prices through November.8  We now estimate total PCE prices to 
have been about flat last quarter, and we exp ect them to decline nearly 1 percent at an 
annual rate this quarter; the low level of bot h figures primarily re flects the pass-through 
to consumer energy prices of th e continued declines in oil prices.  We estimate that core 
PCE prices rose 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter , and we project a similar rate of increase 
this quarter. 
 The projection for headline PCE price inflation in the current quarter is 
1 percentage point lower than in the December Tealbook, largely reflecting 
the lower oil price path.  In addition, we have revised down our projection for 
core PCE price inflation in the first qu arter in response to lower import prices 
as well as our translation of the December CPI and PPI data. 
8 The November CPI was published on December 15, after the December projection closed but in 
time for the December FOMC meeting.

Some of the recent weakness in inflati on performance carries forward into the 
next few quarters, but otherw ise our inflation projection is  about unrevised from the 
December Tealbook.   
 The higher projected path for the dollar and lower commodity prices led us to 
revise down our forecast for core im port prices in 2016 relative to the 
December Tealbook.  We now expect core import prices to decline at an 
annual rate of 3 percent in the first half of 2016, 1¼ percentage points more 
negative than in the previous Tealbook.  We expect core import prices to edge 
up at a ¼ percent pace over the second half, as the effects of the higher dollar fade and commodity prices stabilize, and then rise at around a 1 percent pace 
over the remainder of the forecast period, little changed from the December projection. 
 Core PCE price inflation is projected to average 1.3 percent this year, the 
same as last year.  The greater tightness in resource uti lization this year 
relative to last cont ributes 0.1 percentage point to the pickup in core inflation, 
but energy price pass-through into core  is anticipated to have a roughly 
offsetting effect.  Starting next year, the transitory restraint from import and 
energy prices is expected to begin su bsiding, and the tightening of resource 
utilization puts a bit more upwar d pressure on core inflation.   
 Energy prices are projected to decline at  an annual rate of 28 percent over the 
first half of this year and then to rise somewhat faster than core prices over the 
remainder of the projection period.  Meanwhile, after running below core 
inflation in 2015 and early 2016, food prices  are expected to rise slightly 
faster than core prices over the medium  term.  As a result, total PCE inflation, 
at 0.7 percent, runs below core PCE inflation this year but m oves a little above 
core inflation thereafter a nd reaches 2 percent in 2018.   
 Compared with the December Tealbook, co re PCE inflation is 0.1 percentage 
point lower in both 2016 and 2017; total PC E inflation is 0.5 percentage point 
lower in 2016 and 0.1 percentage poi nt lower in 2017.  The downward 
revisions to inflation mainly reflect the lower import and energy prices in this projection.

 As shown in “Survey Measures of Longe r-Term Inflation Expectations” in the 
nonfinancial Data Sheets section, surv ey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations remain near th e lower end of their ranges of recent 
years.  Market-based measures of lo nger-term inflation compensation have 
edged lower since the December Tealbook. 
We have received little data on labor compensation during the intermeeting 
period.   
 Average hourly earnings were unchanged in December and rose 2½ percent 
over 2015 as a whole, about ½ percentage  point more than in 2014.  In the 
near term, we expect the 12-month cha nge in this measure to be between 
2¼ and 2½ percent. 
 We continue to expect business-sec tor hourly compensation, which rose an 
outsized 3½ percent over the four quart ers ending in 2015:Q 3, to decelerate 
over the next few quarters.  By the end of the medium-term projection, gains 
in compensation per hour pick back up to around 3¼ percen t, little changed 
from the previous projection. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
As described in the box “Changes to the Long-Term Outlook Procedure,” we 
have simplified the model used to generate  the long-term outlook in this Tealbook.  The 
changes in procedure had no material effect  on the projection of the key variables we 
highlight here. 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings of se curities continue to put downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is projected to return to a normal size by the end 
of 2021. 
 The federal funds rate rises further after 2018.  With real GDP above its 
potential level in the medium term and inflation having essentially reached the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the fe deral funds rate moves above its long-
run normal value in 2019 and 2020.

Changes to the Long‐Term Outlook Procedure 
In this Tealbook, the staff has introduced a new model to produce the long term 
outlook for the U.S. economy—currently, for 2019 and beyond. The following 
discussion explains the motivation for changing the model and describes the new 
procedure. 
Previously, the long term outlook was based on a version of the FRB/US model that had 
been adapted to more closely mimic some aspects of the staff’s framework for the 
medium run, particularly Okun’s law and the Phillips curve. However, with the 
hundreds of variables and exogenous factors in the FRB/US model, the task of creating 
a long horizon forecast was challenging and time consuming. 
Given that detailed aspects of the outlook many years ahead are generally not of 
interest, it seemed advantageous to develop a simpler model that focuses on a few key 
variables and a small set of factors that determine the values of those variables over the 
long run. Our new procedure generates a long term projection with the same 
standards of quality as before but at a much lower cost. The new model is focused on 
the variables currently in the “Long Term Outlook” exhibit in DEDO: real and potential 
GDP, the unemployment rate and its natural rate, overall and core PCE price inflation, 
the federal funds rate, the 10year Treasury yield, and the triple B corporate bond rate. 
The model has five main components. First, the model uses an Okun’s law relationship 
to link the unemployment rate to the output gap. Second, the model includes a Phillips 
curve in whic h core inflation is determined  by the unemployment gap and long term 
inflation expectations. Third, the model uses a Taylor rule to generate the path of the 
federal funds rate; this rule is the same as the one we use in putting together the 
medium term forecast. Fourth, the model builds a forecast of long term interest rates 
using the expectations hypothesis of the term structure (assuming model consistent 
expectations) and a term premium that moves with the business cycle. These four 
components are largely unchanged from the previous model we used. The major 
change relative to our previous procedure concerns the relations hip between 
aggregate spending and long term real interest rates. Rather than relying on a large 
number of spending equations in the FRB/US model, the new procedure links the 
output gap directly to long term real interest rates using a relationship analogous to a 
textbook “forward looking IS curve.” A key advantage of the new approach is that the 
forces influencing the outlook can be summarized by a handful of easily interpretable 
factors rather than the many driving forces embedded in the FRB/US model. 
Importantly, we have compared the results from our new procedure with those from 
the previous model for the current and several previous Tealbooks. For the key 
macroeconomic variables in the long term outlook, the results from the two models are 
very similar.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The recent increase in financial market volatility, centered on developments in 
China and global commodity markets, underscore s the headwinds and challenges 
weighing on the outlook for global economic growth.  In addition to the risks and 
uncertainties facing China, these challenges include persistent sluggishness in global 
trade and manufacturing and the implications of the continuing decline in commodity 
prices for commodity-producing economies.  Moreover, cross-border and domestic credit 
flows in the emerging market economies (EMEs) have slowed, in some cases quite 
sharply.  And Japan and Europe are struggling to raise inflation from quite low levels, as 
policy rates are near zero.  These factors contributed to lackluster foreign growth 
throughout 2015 and weigh on prospects going forward.  Nevertheless, our baseline 
outlook for a return of foreign growth to more normal levels over the forecast period, 
while marked down a bit in the near term, remains essentially intact.  We interpret the 
market volatility of recent weeks as primarily reflecting investor concerns about 
downside risks to the global economy. 
We estimate fourth-quarter foreign real GDP grew at a subdued 2 percent 
annualized pace, down from 2½ percent in the third quarter and about ¼ percent below 
the forecast in the December Tealbook.  The slower growth primarily reflected further 
drag from low oil prices in Canada and a deceleration in Mexico’s economy as U.S. 
manufacturing growth stepped down.  Foreign growth is expected to turn back up, albeit 
somewhat more slowly over the first half of 2016 than in our December projection, as the 
recent declines in oil and equity prices, along with tighter credit conditions in the EMEs, 
weigh on the near-term outlook.  As  in our previous forecasts, foreign growth reaches 
3 percent —near its trend rate —by late 2016 and maintains that pace through 2018.  
Growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) is  supported by continuing policy 
accommodation, past currency depreciation, gradually improving credit market 
conditions, and, for Japan and Europe, low oil prices.  In the EMEs, the South American 
economies gradually pull out of their slumps, and emerging Asia is supported by the 
combination of firmer exports to the advanced economies, accommodative policy, and 
lower oil prices.

 In contrast to the more dire concerns highlighted by the recent turmoil in financial 
markets, our baseline expectation is premised on Chin a’s economy decelerating only 
moderately and on the renminbi depreciating only somewhat further in the quarters 
ahead.  Notwithstanding
 the Chine
se authorities’ re cent clumsy communications and 
sometimes surprising policy actions, we think that the authorities will resist large 
currency moves, in part t
o damp capital outflows, and we do not see the currency as 
significantly overvalued.  Moreover, t he Chinese authorities continue to have at their 
disposal a broad arr
ay of policy tools to respond to market strains or shortfalls in growth.  
However, given the
 com
plex challenges facing China, a more adverse outturn cannot be 
ruled out.  In particular, 
as explored in the “China -Driven Emerging Market Economy 
Crisis” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section, a financial crisis and sharp 
weakening of growth in China could produce severe adverse spillovers for other EMEs 
and the global economy.  And further weakness in overall foreign growth could lead to 
the pressures laid out in t
he scenario “ Stronger Dollar and Lower Oil Prices.”   Beyond 
the standard macroecono
mic channels highlighted in this scenario, lower oil prices could 
also lead to financial st
resses in the oil sector here and abroad and additional drag 
on growth.    
We estimate
 that inflation fell to near zero in the AFEs in the fourth quarter, as 
retail energy prices
 declined further.  The additional drop in oil prices since the 
December Tea
lbook is expected to hold AFE inflation near zero again in the first quarter.  
Thereafter, AFE infl
ation is projected to rise to close to 1 percent by the middle of the 
year, as e
nergy prices stabilize, and then to increase gradually to 1¾ percent by the end of 
the forecast period as e
conomic slack diminishes.  In the EMEs, inflation fell to an 
estimated 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower retail energy and food prices, 
but we see it
 rising to a 3
 percent trend pace by the second half of 2016. 
We have revised our monetar
y policy expectations in light of the weaker inflation 
and growth outlooks for the AFEs
.  We now expect the Bank of Canada (BOC) to lower 
its policy ra
te 25 basis points at its March meeting and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to 
expand its asset purchase program by the middle of the year.  We have also pushed back 
our forecast for the B
ank of England (BOE) to begin raising rates by one quarter, to the

 third quarter of 2016.  We have not changed our baseline for the European Central Bank 
(ECB), but we see an increased probability o f additional stimulus measures.  In contrast, 
we have raised our forecasts for policy rate increases for several commodity-producing 
EMEs experiencing currency weakness and above-target inflation, including Brazil, 
Chile, Colombia, and Russia. 
EMERGING M ARKET
 ECONOMIES  
 China.  Chinese real GDP growth edged down from 7¼ percent in the third 
quarter to 7  percent in the fourth, slightly higher than our December Tealbook 
forecast, as a re
trenchment in service sector growth offset a modest pickup in 
manufacturing activity.  Consistent with the solid GDP print, industrial 
production, exports, and retail sales have all been relatively strong, although 
investment continues to slow.  For 2015 as a whole, C hina’s economy gre w 
6.9 percent, a hair under the authorities’ target and only a modest deceleration 
from 7¼ percent growth in 2014.  Notwithstanding a resurgence of volatility 
in China’s financial markets during the intermeeting period, we do not see a 
precipitous slowing of the economy as the most likely scenario (see the box 
“Recent Developme
nts in China and Implications for the Outlook”).  Growth 
is expected to continue its gradual decline to 6 percent by the end of the 
forecast period, in line with our estimate of China’s potential growth rate.  
This forecast is little changed from the December Tealbook. 
After turning slightly negative in the fourth quarter, inflation in China is 
projected to pick up going forward.  A
lthough recent declines in oil prices are 
expected to hold down inflation over the next few quarters, we see inflation 
settling at 2½ percent by
 the end of this year.  We expect the authorities to 
support growth primarily through fis
cal easing and credit policy, which are 
likely to be adjusted in response to the performance of the economy over the 
course of the year, and to make one additional cut to the benchmark lending 
rate.  The authorities are 
also likely to reduce reserve requirements as

 Recent Developments in China and Implications for the Outlook  
Since the start of the year, global financial markets have again been roiled by 
developments in China.  An apparent change in the management of the Chinese 
exchange rate on the first trading day of the yea r led to concerns about the economy and 
a sharp decline in Chinese equity markets, triggering newly minted circuit breakers.  
Pressure on Chinese markets has continued, leaving the onshore value of the renminbi 
(RMB) 1 ¼ percent weaker against the dollar and equity prices down 16 percent so far this 
year.  Tenuous stabilization of Chinese markets appears to have been achieved but only 
through significant government intervention in equity and foreign exchange markets , 
and questions remain about Chinese policy direction and risks to the global economy .   
Market developments notwithstanding , recent official data do not point to a significant 
slowing in Chinese growth.  Although the year started with a weaker-than-expected 
reading on the unofficial Caixin PMI for December, other Chinese data—such as industrial 
production and exports —have been relatively strong.   The stability of these indicators 
was confirmed by the subsequent release of fourth-quarter GDP, which printed about in 
line with expectations.   All told, we have left our forecast for GDP growth in China about 
unchanged, with growth slowing from about 7 percent in 2015 to 6½ percent this year 
and 6 percent by 2018.   Outside analysts also do not appear to have significantly revised 
down t
heir baseline outlook for China.  
Instead, the global market volatility related to China appears to reflect increasing worries 
about downside risks to the Chinese economy and the coherence of Chinese 
policymaking .  Authorities seem to be struggling to balance the goals of liberalizing 
markets and maintaining stability.   Nowhere has that tension been more tangible, or the 
spillovers 
to global markets stronger, than in relation to China’s exchange rate policy .  In 
August, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) change d the way it sets its fixing rate (the red 
dots in figure 1) by tying it more closely to the previous day’ s close (the black line), which 
signaled that the exchange rate would more closely reflect market conditions.  (The 
fixing rate serves as the midpoint and thus anchor s the plus/minus 2 percent daily trading 
band.)  In response to a consequent surge in capital outflows and market turmoil, 
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC - Internal (FR)
January 20, 2016

 however, the PBOC interven ed to stabilize the RMB , apparently contradicting its earlier 
intent .  In December, the PBOC began publishing a new multilateral exchange rate index 
and indicated that it expect ed the RMB to be “basically stable” relative to the currency 
basket.   But the PBOC never clarified whether, and to what degree, it had adopted a  
policy of pegg
ing the RMB to that basket, nor did it reconcile that policy with the goal of 
giving more weight to market forces.  Accordingly, in early January when authorities 
fixed the exchange rate both weaker against the dollar and weaker against the basket 
than the previous market’s close  , as shown in figure 2, investors took this as a signal that 
the RMB would be allowed to depreciate more sharply, setting off renewed turmoil in 
global markets.   In consequence, the authorities once again acted to stabilize the RMB.   
We estima
te that the PBOC has spent nearly $400 billion defending the currency during 
the past year —although, at $3.4 trillion, its reserves remain ample.  
The aut
horities are clearly having trouble reconciling a large number of sometimes 
inconsistent objectives:  (1) containing appreciation of the effective RMB that would 
accompany a further rise in the dollar, (2) preventing a large , disorderly depreciation of 
the currency, (3) maintaining reserves amid strengthening capital outflows, and (4) giving 
greater sway to market forces.  Balancing these goals will be difficult, and attempts to 
accommodate downward pressure on the RMB by allowing some modest depreciation 
will further incentivize outflows and currency pressures.  We project the RMB to 
depreciate further through the middle of this year, both against the dollar and the basket 
(black and red lines in figure 2), before flattening out for a period as investors come to 
realize a hard landing is not imminent .  However, much more extreme outcomes are 
certainly possible.   
Spillovers from the turmoil in China along with falling commodity prices —the latter due 
at least in part to concerns over global demand —have weighed on global financial 
markets , and
 advanced and emerging market equity indexes post ed sharp declines in 
January.  Although wealth effects from lower equity prices are small in most foreign 
economies, lower oil prices led us to mark down growth in key trading partners, including 
Canada and Mexico, leaving a negative imprint on our near-term outlook for trade-
weighted foreign GDP.   
The outlook for the U.S. economy has also been affected, primarily for the worse.  The 
drag on some countries from falling commodity prices, the appreciation of the dollar 
since the previous Tealbook, and our assumption of further RMB depreciation (with 
knock-on effects to the projected path of other EME Asian currencies) have all lower ed 
our forecast for net exports .  In addition, declines in U.S. equities, which have been linked 
to concerns over the foreign outlook and increased risk aversion, have a negative wealth 
effect that lowers U.S. GDP.  These negative effects are somewhat balanced by the 
positive effect of the decline in oil prices on domestic consumption, notwithstanding 
some additional downward pressure on oil-sector investment .  All told, these effects sum 
up to a fairly small drag on U.S. growth over the next few years, with the higher dollar 
and lower oil prices also pushing down inflation in the first half of 2016 .  That said, the 
prospect of a further sharp depreciation of the RMB and a steep downturn in Chinese 
activity could potentially have very large effects on U.S. GDP growth and inflation, a 
scenario considered in the Risks and Uncertainty section.

 necessary to offset the monetary effects of continuing large-scale foreign 
exchange sales, but we do not see such actions as providing net stimulus.    
 Other Emerging Asia.   We estimate fourth-quarter growth edged down to 
3½ percent, in line with our December forecast.  This slowdown is due partly 
to weaker activity in K
orea  after the third-quarter rebound following the end 
of the MERS (Middle-East Respiratory
 Syndrome) outbreak and partly to 
deceleration in India  following unusually strong growth in the third quarter.  
Elsewhere in the region, 
growth has generally held up; high-frequency 
indicators such as PMI and re
tail sales suggest that domestic demand is 
picking up, even as exports, especially to China, continue to disappoint.  
Overall, we expec
t growth to step up to 4¼ percent this year, supported 
initially by stronger domestic demand and later by more robust growth abroad.  
We expect inflation in the region to remain at 2½ percent in the current 
quarter as the continued fall in energy prices is offset by higher food prices.  
We see inflation moving up g
radually to 3¼ percent by 2017. 
 Latin America.  Real GDP growth in Mexico  stepped down ¾ percentage 
point to an estimated 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, ¼ percentage point 
below our December projec
tion.  The deceleration reflects, in part, weaker 
external demand, as Mexica
n manufacturing exports declined.  Also, 
investment in nonresidentia
l structures plunged further in October, driven by 
oil price declin es.  In contrast, private consumption moved up, aided by rising 
employment, accomm
odative monetary policy, and higher disposable income 
as government refor
ms have pushed down energy and telecommunications 
prices.  We see growth gradually moving up to 3 percent by 2018.  The 
outlook for the Mexican econom
y is a little weaker than in the previous 
Tealbook, reflecting the downward revision to expected U.S. manufacturing 
production and lower oil prices.    
Headline inflation dropped to 2½ percent in the fourth quarter, driven by 
another plunge in telecommunications prices.  We see inflation moving back

 up to 3¼ percent by the second quarter and then sustaining that rate.  The 
Bank of Mexico ra
ised its policy rate to 3.25 percent following Fed liftoff, and 
we expect the
 central bank to broadly shadow changes in Federal Reserve 
policy rates going forward.   
In Brazil , persistent political tensions and the associated uncertainty about the 
fiscal outlook, depressed commodity prices, continuing reverberations of the 
scandal at Petrobras, and ongoing monetary policy tightening led real GDP to 
contract at an estimated annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter.  While 
exports and the PMI improved somewhat late in the fourth quarter, industrial 
production and consumer and business confidence fell further.  We expect 
growth to remain in negative territory this year and to resume expanding at an 
anemic pace in 2017, aided by a weaker currency and firming global growth.  
Despite the weak ec
onomy, the substantial depreciation of the real and hikes 
in administered prices kept i
nflation at a 10¼ percent annual rate in the fourth 
quarter.  We see inflation declining to 5½ percent by mid-2017, reflecting 
continued tight monetary policy and lower pressure from administered prices.  
We expect tha
t the continued elevated pace of inflation will prompt the central 
bank to resume policy tightening a
t this week’s meeting.   We do not expect 
policy to begin easing until late 2016. 
In Argentina,  the administration of newly elected President Mauricio Macri 
moved to begin tackling t
he country’s serious economic problems and restore 
its access to global capital markets.  The government laid out a four-year 
economic plan to reduce the fiscal deficit and bring inflation down to 
5 percent by the end of 2019.  The exchange rate system was unified, and the 
official excha
nge rate was allowed to depreciate by 40 percent; export taxes 
were repea
led; and talks with holders of defaulted debt began in January.  
In Venezuela , whos
e economy has been ravaged by economic 
mismanagement and the collapse in oil prices, President Nicolás Maduro has 
decreed a 90-day economic emergency, a measure that would grant him broad

 powers to enact new economic measures.  The opposition-controlled congress 
is poised to reject the decree, however, and political tensions will likely 
intensify in coming weeks.  Meanwhile, the government released a year’s 
worth of macroeconomic data showing that economic activity is extremely 
depressed, with GDP declining 7 pe
rcent on a four-quarter basis through the 
third quarter.  And inflati
on has soared further into three-digit territory, 
exceeding 140 percent on a 12-month basis in September.  
 Other EMEs.   In South Africa , financial markets have come under pressure, 
as two finance ministers were dismissed within a week, and concerns mounted 
over South Africa’s dependence on commodity exports  and its reliance on 
portfolio inflows to finance large external deficits.  The country also continues 
to suffer from low growth and elevated inflation.  Since the December 
Tealbook, the rand 
has fallen by about 15 percent and the CDS premium is up 
around 85  basis points. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Canada.   We have slashed our estimate of fourth-quarter growth in Canada to 
only ½ percent, from 2 pe
rcent in the December Tealbook.  Incoming 
indicators 
point to weaker momentum and a larger drag from low oil prices 
than we had previously thought:  Business investment, manufacturing output, 
and construction ac
tivity contracted in the fourth quarter, and growth in the 
service sector slowed.  The weak incoming data and further declines in oil 
prices have led us to a
lso lower our projection ¾ percentage point for the first 
half of 2016.  We 
do not expect the weakness to be sustained, and we have 
growth picking up to just
 over 2 percent later in 2016 and in 2017, as 
investment recovers, ex
ports are supported by past currency depreciation, 
monetary policy remains accommodative, and the recently elected 
government implements fisca
l stimulus.   
We estimate that inflation declined from 2¼ percent in the third quarter to 
¾ percent in the fourth.  As the drag from lower oil prices fades, inflation is

 projected to step up to 1¾ percent in the second half of 2016, reaching the 
BOC ’s target of 2 percent by mid-2017.  In response to the weaker economic 
outlook, we now expect the B OC to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points at its 
March meeting. 
 Euro Area.   Recent indicators suggest real GDP grew 1¼ percent in the fourth 
quarter.  Going forward, the boost from the recent fall in oil prices should 
more than offset the drag from the recent declines in equity prices.  We expect 
GDP to rise at about a 2 percent rate over the next three years, a touch higher 
than in the December Tea
lbook, supported by ongoing monetary stimulus, 
past currency depreciation, low oil prices, and easing credit conditions.    
Headline inflati
on stayed slightly negative in the fourth quarter due to another 
plunge in retail energy
 prices and a moderate decrease in core inflation.  As 
the drag from ene
rgy prices moderates and the output gap narrows, we expect 
inflation to step up to 1½ perce
nt by late 2016 and to edge up a bit further 
thereafter.  Compar
ed with the December Tealbook, this projection is about 
1 percentage point lower in the first half of 2016, largely due to declines in 
energy prices.  We continue to expect the E CB to purchase assets through 
mid-2017  and to keep its policy rates at current low levels until late 2018.  
However, the rece
nt lowering of the near-term inflation outlook, along with 
recent dec
lines in longer-term inflation compensation, raise the possibility that 
the ECB will underta
ke further stimulus. 
 Japan.   Growth in the fourth quarter is estimated to have remained around 
1 percent.   The recent appreciation of the yen should damp export growth, but 
the decline in oil prices should provide an offsetting boost to consumption.  
All told, we still expect that GDP growth will stay around 1 percent in 2016, 
supported by ongoing
 monetary easing and low oil prices, before a second 
hike in the consumption tax temporarily stalls the expansion in 2017. 
We estimate that consume
r prices fell ¼ percent last quarter, largely reflecting 
falling retail energ
y prices, but that core inflation held steady at just under

 1 percent.  We project that inflation (excluding the direct effect of the 2017 
consumption tax hike) will rise to 1 percent by the end of 2016 and to 
1¼ percent in 2017 and 2018.  With inflation w ell below the BOJ’s 2  percent 
target,  and given the recent substantial oil price declines and appreciation of 
the yen, we now ex
pect that the BOJ will expand its asset purchase program 
by midyear.   
 United Kingdom.   Recent indicators, such as PMIs for services and 
construction, retail sales, and economic sentiment, point to solid growth in 
domestic demand, which has off
set some of the weakness in external demand.  
We expect GDP growth to pick up from 1¾ percent in the third quarter to 
2¼ percent in the fourth and to average just above that pace over the next 
three years.  We also expect that uncertainty about the referendum on U.K. 
membership in the European Union (EU), which could take place as soon as 
the middle of this year, w
ill weigh on activity.  But, because our baseline 
assumption is of continue
d EU membership, this effect should be temporary 
and largely offset by the boost from recent declines in oil prices and the 
foreign exchange value of the pound. 
Because of declining energy prices, consumer prices fell 0.3 percent in the 
fourth quarter, and we expect them to rise by ½ percent this quarter, 
½ percentage point below the December forecast.  As energy prices stabilize 
and the economy conti
nues to expand, we project that inflation will step up to 
a 2 percent pace by late 2016.  In response to BOE communications focusing 
on recent slower wage growth and uncertainties about the global economy, we 
now expect the BOE
 to wait until the third quarter of 2016 to begin raising its 
policy rate, one qu
arter later than assumed in the December Tealbook.

Financial Developments 
Stock prices tumbled worldwide over the intermeeting period, as the post-year-
end turmoil in Chinese financial markets a nd the continued slide in oil prices stoked 
global growth concerns and increased risk aversion.  The decline in the prices of risky 
assets after year-end weighed on policy rate expectations both domestically and abroad, 
and market-based measures of forward inflation compensation fell to record lows.  
Corporate credit quality showed some further signs of deterioration, and speculative-grade issuance slowed to a near halt.  Financing conditions for high-credit-quality businesses and households, though, apparently remained accommodative. 
Following the Committee’s decision at the December meeting to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate, the effective federal funds rate rose to the middle of the new target range and other overnight market rates moved up largely in line.  Otherwise, the FOMC statement elicited little market reaction.    
•The Shanghai composite index dropped 14 percent over the intermeeting 
period, and the renminbi depreciated 1Ҁ percent against the dollar, despite 
reports of repeated intervention in both markets by Chinese authorities.  
•Brent crude oil prices fell to less than $30 per barrel, a level not seen in over a 
decade.  The broad index of the dollar increased 2¾ percent.    
•The S&P 500 index dropped about 8 percent, and stock indexes in the euro 
area and Japan fell 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively.  The VIX rose to 
about 26 percent, near the top of its range over the past few years.  
•Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities decreased 12, 23, and 22 basis points, respectively.  Interest rates on 30-year mortgages moved 
roughly in line with Treasury yields. 
•The expected target federal funds rate of participants in the primary dealer 
survey by the end of 2016 is now 0.80 percent, implying one less rate hike 
compared with the December survey.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS
After little discernible reaction following the liftoff of U.S. policy interest rates, 
global financial market conditions deteriorated sharply in January, as developments in 
Chinese financial markets and another step-down in oil prices appeared to ignite fears 
about global growth.  This shift in sentiment led to a pronounced decline in the prices of 
equities and other risky assets and a notable strengthening of the dollar.  
On January 4 and again on January 7, Chinese authorities set a weaker-than-
expected central parity for the exchange rate of the renminbi versus the U.S. dollar.  Fears 
that this action foreshadowed further renminbi depreciation spooked investors, and stock prices in China fell sharply.  Since the December FOMC meeting, the Shanghai 
composite index has dropped 14 percent despite reports of repeated stock purchases by 
government-directed institutions.  Chinese authorities also appear to have intervened heavily in both onshore and offshore foreign exchange markets, selling foreign reserves to manage the pace of depreciation of the renminbi amid intensifying capital outflows.  
Concerns about China’s intentions regarding its exchange rate were compounded by the 
release of data indicating much larger foreign exchange reserve sales in December than had been expected.  (See the box “Recent Developments in China and Implications for the Outlook” in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section.) 
Both the turmoil in Chinese markets and the sizable decline in oil prices weighed 
on global financial markets.  Equity prices in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) fell sharply, with stock indexes down about

  8 percent and 10 percent in the euro area and Japan, respectively.  AFE 10-year sovereign 
yields decreased substantially, with almost all of the decline due to a drop in inflation 
compensation.  Policy expectations for major foreign central banks, which had risen some 
after the December FOMC meeting, ended the period down.  EME credit spreads 
widened, but outflows from EME-dedicated mutual funds remained moderate.   
The U.S. dollar appreciated further against most currencies, leaving the broad 
index of the dollar up 2¾ percent.  The dollar was little changed, on net, against the euro 
but appreciated about 6 percent versus sterling and the Canadian dollar.  The dollar appreciated up to 3 percent against most Asian EME currencies, which generally moved 
in sympathy with the renminbi, and a bit more versus several Latin American currencies.  
In contrast, the dollar depreciated against the Japanese yen, which was likely supported 
by flight-to-safety flows, including some unwinding of yen-funded carry trades. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 
The Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 
¼ to ½ percent at the December meeting elicited little reaction in Treasury and interest 
rate futures markets, as market participants had appeared reasonably sure that liftoff 
would occur in December.  The changes to the forward-guidance language in the FOMC 
statement were similarly reported as consistent with market expectations that future adjustments to the target range would be data dependent but likely gradual.  The 
December FOMC minutes also prompted limited market reaction.  Market participants 
place essentially no odds on the next rate increase occurring at the January meeting.  Based on a straight read of federal funds futures rates, the perceived odds of a rate hike by the March meeting declined in the intermeeting period from around 50 percent to 
about 30 percent.  Positive news regarding December payrolls was overshadowed by 
global growth concerns and negative domestic spending indicators.     
The market-based expected path of the federal funds rate 12 to 24 months out 
flattened over the intermeeting period and continues to lie noticeably below survey-based 
expectations.  (See the box “Negative Risk Premiums and the Federal Funds Path 
Puzzle.”)  Similarly, the expected path of the federal funds rate according to the Desk’s January Surveys of Primary Dealers has declined.  The expected year-end 2016 target 
federal funds rate moved down to 0.8 percent, suggesting dealers anticipate one less rate 
hike by the end of the year compared with the December survey.  Survey participants

 Negative Risk Premiums and the Federal Funds Path Puzzle 
The market price implied path of the federal funds rate over the medium term stands well 
below most survey-based measures of the trajecto ry of the federal funds rate (figure 1).  In 
part, the gap could indicate that the path of the federal funds rate expected by market participants differs materially from that expected by survey respondents.
1  We explore the 
possibility that survey measures of policy expectations may, in fact, be reasonably well aligned with market expectations and that the gap between the federal funds futures 
curve and the surveys largely reflects a substantial negative risk premium.  
A number of standard models suggest that negative risk premiums can arise in some environments.  The general intuition of such models is that investors are willing to accept 
low returns on assets that have high payoffs during “bad times” when positive payoffs are 
particularly valuable.  This intuition suggests that investors may value federal funds futures 
contracts partly because they help insure agai nst the risk of recession on the assumption 
that the FOMC will lower the federal funds rate in recessions or periods of unexpectedly low growth. 
We use three models from the macro-finance literature to illustrate the potential 
magnitude of this negative premium.
2  The first model, a variant of the “habit persistence” 
model developed by Campbell and Cochrane (1999), assumes that a representative investor’s marginal utility and risk aversi on increase sharply during recessions as 
consumption weakens.
3  We modify the model to include monetary policy that follows an 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule, with the implication that the federal funds rate falls during 
recessions, generating insurance value for fe deral funds futures contracts. Under this 
                                                 
1 Alternative explanations include Illiquidity or ot her imperfections in financial market prices.  The 
December 2015 Tealbook discussed several possibilities (see the box “The Federal Funds Rate Path: 
Market Expectations and Risk Scenarios” in Book B). 
2 Our goal in this exercise is not to calibrate the models to match the observed gap between survey 
expectations and futures rates.  Rather, we use standa rd calibrations to the extent possible to determine 
what the models imply for the risk premium on federal funds futures rates under fairly typical 
parameterizations.  
   3 John Campbell and John Cochrane (1999), “By Forc e of Habit:  A Consumption-Based Explanation of 
Aggregate Stock Market Behavior,” Journal of Political Economy , vol. 107 (April), pp. 205–51.

 model, to infer market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate from market 
prices, one must “correct” federal funds futures rates by adding back the model-implied 
negative risk premium.  The h abit model line in figure 2 plots the market-expected path of 
the federal funds rate generated by this pr ocedure.  The risk premium correction is 
substantial under the habit model in the present circumstance.  Indeed, the magnitude of 
the implied risk premium is about one-half of the observed gap between the actual futures 
path (solid red line) and survey-based expectations (blue dots).  Under this model, the 
premium is presently larger than average in magnitude because aggregate consumption 
remains low relative to its pre-crisis trend, and investor risk aversion thus remains  high.4  
The second model is based on the “long-run risk” (LRR) model of Bansal and Yaron (2004), which we also modify to include the Taylor rule.
5  In this model, macroeconomic 
uncertainty increases during recessions, increasing the magnitude of risk premiums.  As 
shown by the LRR model line, this model also pr escribes a large correction to federal funds 
futures rates due to the presence of a relati vely large negative risk premium.  The key 
ingredient for this result is that the level of uncertainty regarding the growth rate of 
consumption is somewhat higher than average.  
Monetary policy was exogenously specified in the first two models; in contrast, the third 
model, based on Diercks (2015), combines the long-run risk specification with the New 
Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) literature and assumes fully 
endogenous monetary policy, consumption, and asset prices.6  As shown by the DSGE 
model line, this model also predicts a sizable negative risk premium at the end of 2018.  
As discussed earlier, the risk premium in these models stems from a positive correlation 
between the federal funds rate and consumption.  That correlation may hold up well 
during periods when economic fluctuations are driven largely by “demand shocks.”  
However, the risk premium could be quite different during periods when high interest 
rates are associated with weak economic activity.  While the results from these models are 
suggestive, there are some caveats that should be  noted.  First, more work is necessary to 
develop estimates of term premiums that can capture realistic behavior over time using 
these models.  Second, these models suggest that , at present, we should observe relatively 
high risk premiums for other assets that could suffer losses during recessions, such as corporate equities and bonds.  Measuring such risk premiums is very difficult; by some 
estimates, risk premiums for these assets are currently somewhat elevated.  However, 
other estimates of risk premiums for such assets are not especially high.  Developing models that can account for the linkages in risk premiums across asset classes is an 
important area for future research. 
                                                 
4 In general, this model requires extremely high leve ls of investor risk aversion to match the average 
levels of other risk premiums observed in the economy, such as the equity risk premium.

  view 1.3 percent to be the most likely level of  the federal funds rate at which the timing 
of the Committee’s reinvestme nt policy will change.    
Consistent with the decline in fed funds futures rates, nominal Treasury yields 
decreased over the intermeeting period.  Part of the decline likely reflected lower term 
premiums related to global growth concerns following Ch inese developments and the 
continued slide in oil prices.  Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year  nominal Treasury securities 
decreased 12, 23, and 22 basis points, respec tively.  Meanwhile, ne ar-term uncertainty 
about longer-term interest rates, as meas ured by swaption-implied volatilities on the 
10-year swap rate, was little changed on net. 
The 5- and 5-to-10-year measures of TIPS-based inflation compensation moved 
down 11 basis points and 17 basis points, respec tively, largely in line with declining oil 
prices, pushing the far-term measure to a new low.  Inflation compensation measures 
based on inflation swaps posted similar declines.  
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS  
Broad U.S. stock price indexes fell 8½ percent since the December FOMC 
meeting, largely in sync with oil prices a nd equity markets around the world.  In addition 
to energy and basic materials, banks and tec hnology were among the hardest-hit sectors.  
U.S. firms with high international sales e xposure decreased more than those with low 
exposure.  The one-month-ahead option-imp lied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the 
VIX— climbed to about 26, near the 90th perc entile of its range ove r the past few years 
but short of last August’s spike.   
Yield spreads of investment- and spec ulative-grade corporate bonds widened 
19 basis points and 46 basis points, respectively, in part as spreads for firms in the energy sector ratcheted up sharply to levels signaling considerable financial stress.  Bid-asked 
spreads for high-yield corporate bonds were li ttle changed, on net, around the December 
FOMC liftoff announcement and the liquidati on of a high-yield corporate debt fund, 
Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund.  High-yiel d bid-asked spreads sp iked near year-end, 
mostly reflecting their seasonal patt ern, but have since normalized.  
Reflecting primarily the slump in the en ergy and materials sectors, corporate 
earnings continued to show signs of weakne ss.  Based on our most recent read of Wall 
Street analysts’ earnings forecasts, fourth-qua rter earnings are estimated to have declined

  slightly from year-ago levels.  Excluding oil and gas firms, earnings appear to have 
increased modestly.     
Credit quality of nonfinancial businesses continued to show signs of deterioration.  
Through the third quarter, the aggregate ratio of debt to assets climbed further to its 
highest level since the early 1990s.  The volume of nonfinancial bonds downgraded by Moody’s Investors Service outpaced the volume of upgrades again in December.  
Downgrades continued to plague speculative-grade issuers in the energy sector, but, even 
outside the energy sector, downgrades outpaced upgrades.  The Moody’s KMV expected year-ahead default rate continued to increase and is near the upper range of its 
distribution outside of recessions.  In the most recent SLOOS, on net, a significant 
number of banks expected a worsening of the performance of loans to larger firms over 
2016, especially syndicated leveraged loans.   
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE 
Financing conditions for riskier firms tightened somewhat but remained 
accommodative for highly rated firms.  In December and early January, investment-grade 
bond issuance remained robust, while speculative-grade bond issuance was weak.   In the 
most recent SLOOS, on net, a moderate number of banks reported tightening C&I loans 
to large and middle-market firms, and a significant number of banks reported tightening spreads on the riskiest loans in their portfolios.  Banks that reported tightening standards 
and terms pointed to industry-specific problems, particularly in the oil and gas industry, 
as one of the reasons.  Both initial and seasoned equity offerings also continued to be subdued, while M&A activity remained strong.  Issuance volumes in the syndicated leveraged loan market decreased in the fourth quarter, as new-issue spreads increased.  
The decline in issuance was particularly pronounced for relatively risky leveraged loans 
such as those earmarked for leveraged buyouts.  
While overall financing conditions for CRE remained fairly accommodative and 
credit continued to flow smoothly into the sector, financing conditions tightened 
somewhat over the intermeeting period.  In CMBS markets, spreads continued to widen 
but CMBS issuance for December continued apace.  In the most recent SLOOS, on net, a moderate number of banks reported tightening standards on CRE loans in the fourth 
quarter.  Nevertheless, the growth of CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets remained 
robust through the fourth quarter.

  Financing conditions for municipalities stayed generally stable.  Over the 
intermeeting period, the general obligation (GO) municipal bond yield spread was little 
changed, even as Puerto Rico continued to experience financial stress.  As expected, the 
commonwealth made principal and interest payments on its GO debt due January 1 but defaulted on a small amount of bonds issued by its infrastructure and development institutions. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed and 
remained accommodative on balance.  Since liftoff, interest rates on variable-rate credit 
cards have ticked lower, while those on new auto loans are little changed.  Spreads on 
consumer loan ABS, which fund a moderate portion of these consumer loans, have 
stabilized at somewhat elevated levels after widening earlier last year.     
Consumer loan balances continued to rise at a robust pace through November, 
reflecting a further expansion in credit card balances and robust increases in auto and 
student loan balances.  Student and auto loans remained broadly available, even to borrowers with subprime credit histories.  In contrast, lending standards on credit card 
loans continued to be relatively tight for riskier borrowers.  In response to the SLOOS, 
banks indicated, on net, that over the past three months they had eased standards and terms on auto loans and tightened standards and terms on credit card loans.  A significant 
fraction of respondents expect the performance of subprime auto loans to deteriorate this 
year. 
Credit conditions for residential mortgages were little changed over the 
intermeeting period.  Despite the gradual net easing that has occurred for several years, 
credit remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or 
high debt-to-income ratios.  A number of banks reported in the SLOOS that they had 
eased standards on several types of home mortgages over the past three months, and that 
they expected to ease standards further this year.

  auto and other consumer loans grew at a faster pace.  Large banks continued to build up 
holdings of agency MBS and reduce holdings of Treasury securities. 
Over the intermeeting period, stock prices of large domestic BHCs substantially 
underperformed the broader market, but CDS spreads increased only modestly.  Of those 
large banks that have reported earnings, the majority have met or exceeded analysts’ earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter; large bank profitability improved a bit despite 
increases in loss provisions for oil-related loans and persistent pressures on net interest 
margins from low interest rates.  However, market participants primarily focused on the 
exposure of banks to declines in oil prices and global growth concerns. 
M2 expanded at an average annual rate of around 6 percent over November and 
December, continuing the moderate growth seen over the second half of 2015.  The pass-
through of the increase in the general level of short-term rates to retail deposit rates has 
been limited to date. 
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS
Following the increase in the target range for the policy rate, the effective federal 
funds and Eurodollar rates traded within a range of 35 to 37 basis points, in the middle of 
the target range.2  The overnight repo rate for Treasury collateral, as surveyed by the 
Desk, increased to about 30 basis points in the days following the FOMC meeting.   
Subsequently, in response to typical year-end pressures, the fed funds and 
Eurodollar rates dipped below the target range, to 20 basis points on year-end.  The decline in unsecured rates was somewhat larger than the drops observed on recent 
quarter-ends, likely reflecting reduced support from the zero lower bound.  The average 
financing rate for primary dealers increased a few basis points, while the increase in the GCF repo rate was more pronounced.  Following year-end, pressures in money markets 
quickly abated. 
                                                 
2 The effective federal funds rate averaged 34 ba sis points over the intermeeting period, with the 
intraday standard deviation averaging 5.3 basis points.  On March 2, 2016, the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York will change the data  source for the calculation of the effective federal funds rate from 
aggregated data provided by federal funds brokers to  individual federal funds transactions reported by 
depository institutions in the Report of Selected Money Market Rates  (FR 2420).   The effective federal 
funds rate will be calculated as a volume-weighted median rate, as opposed to the current volume-weighted 
average rate.

  Take-up of RRPs was almost unchanged immediately following the increase in 
the policy rate and continued to be explained by the spread of the ON RRP offering rate 
to comparable money market rates.  Demand rose steadily in the days leading up to year-
end, with ON RRPs outstanding reaching $475 billion on December 31, consistent with recent quarter-ends.  Demand for term RRPs was nearly nil, as there was ample capacity 
in the overnight RRP facility and term RRPs were not offered at any premium over 
overnight RRPs.  More recently, overnight take-up fell to under $100 billion. 
The Desk purchased about $21 billion of 15- and 30-year MBS under the 
reinvestment program and rolled $0.9 billion in expected settlements over the period. The 
ratio of monthly settlements for these reinvestment operations relative to gross issuance 
of MBS was roughly unchanged in December at about 30 percent.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in line with the average over the past 
20 years, a period that includes considerable volatility in real activity but relatively stable 
inflation.  We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our GDP projection are tilted to the downside and that the risks to our unemployment projection are tilted to the upside, both because we view neither monetary nor fiscal policy as well positioned to 
offset large adverse shocks to the economy, and a consideration that has recently 
become even more salient because of downside risks emanating from abroad.  Our 
concerns with respect to inflation remain mostly to the downside given the low levels of market-based measures of inflation compensation, hints from some surveys of lower 
longer-term inflation expectations, and the possibility that the realization of the downside risks to economies abroad may put upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the financial vulnerabilities of the 
U.S. financial system as moderate.  This assessment reflects strong capital and liquidity positions at banks, moderate leverage in the nonbank financial sector, and subdued borrowing by households.  While valuation pressures in corporate debt markets have 
eased to a significant degree over the past year amid a pullback in appetite for credit risk,  
leverage has continued to increase not just for oil-related firms and riskier segments of 
the nonfinancial business sector, but also more broadly.  High leverage of nonfinancial corporations and liquidity mismatch at high-yield bond mutual funds suggest elevated 
risks for bond investors and lower-rated borrowers. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. In the first 
scenario, financial turmoil in China triggers a full-blown crisis that severely depresses activity in emerging market economies (EMEs). In the second scenario, weaker growth 
abroad causes the dollar to appreciate substantially and oil prices to decline. In contrast,

in the third scenario, recent strong job gains and upbeat consumer confidence signal that 
economic activity is stronger than in the baseline ; in addition, inflation is more sensitive 
to tighter resource utilization.  The fourth scenario considers a significantly lower 
trajectory for the natural rate of unemployment and illustrates the consequences when 
monetary policymakers learn about the lower natural rate only slowly.  In the final 
scenario, recent financial strains increase and economic activity falls sharply. 
The first two sc enarios are run in the multicountry SIGMA model, and the third 
uses the Board staff’s EDO model.  The fourth scenario uses a DSGE model developed 
by Board staff economists that features search and matching frictions in the labor market. 
The final scenario is implemented using a DSGE model developed by the staff from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York that explicitly incorporates financial frictions.  In 
each of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed as in the baseline forecast by 
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1 In addition, all scenarios assume that the 
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
China -Driven Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies 
In our baseline forecast, we expect reasonably solid Chinese real GDP growth of 
6 percent or a little more, which helps allay concerns about a hard landing and contributes 
to an eventual stabilization of the renminbi (see the box “Recent Developments in China 
and Implications for the Outlook” in the International Economic Developments and 
Outlook section).  However, given China’s many underlying vulnerabilities—including 
high corporate debt, excess capacity in manufacturing, continued property market 
problems, and a large and opaque shadow banking system adverse shocks could trigger 
a severe crisis that causes both China’s GDP growth and its currency to plummet, which 
have large spillovers to other EMEs.  
In this scenario, we assume that such a crisis materializes.  GDP growth in China 
plunges to around 1 percent this year before recovering, with the level of output falling 
7 percent below the baseline by the middle of next year.  GDP in other EMEs is 
depressed to the same extent.  The stresses in EMEs also trigger a noticeable rise in corporate and household borrowing spreads in the United States and AFEs, while flight-
1 Although the form of the policy rule is the same across all models, the concept of the output gap 
differs. EDO uses a production-function-based output gap, whereas the other models use a measure of 
slack equal to the difference between actua l output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that 
would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

to-safety flows cause the dollar to appreciate 15 percent and depress term premiums on 
government bonds.  The EME GDP contraction in our scenario roughly parallels the 
EME experience during the Asian and Russian crises of the late 1990s, while the rise in 
the dollar is slightly larger than what occurred during the crises of the late 1990s.  To 
reflect the deeper linkages in global financial markets at present, we have built somewhat larger disruptions to U.S. financial markets in this scenario than were observed in the late 1990s, at least prior to the Long-Term Capital Management crisis of September 1998. 
In this environment, U.S. real net exports decline relative to the baseline in 
response to the sharp decline in foreign activity and the substantial appreciation of the 
dollar.  Real GDP grows at an annual rate of about 1¼ percent in 2016, and the 
unemployment rate rises to nearly 5¾ percent in 2017.  The appreciation of the dollar and lower resource utilization push down U.S. core PCE inflation to ½ percent in 2016.  The 
federal funds rate follows a much shallower path relative to the baseline. 
Stronger Dollar and Lower Oil Prices 
In our baseline projection, a modest pickup in foreign growth helps support 
demand for crude oil and damps further upward pressure on the dollar so that oil prices 
rise gradually and the dollar appreciates only slightly over the forecast period.  These 
developments are expected to help U.S. inflation move toward the Committee’s 2 percent 
target by 2018.  Nevertheless, even moderately weaker growth abroad may keep globa l 
financial markets focused on downside risks to the foreign economies and monetary 
policy divergence with the United States, causing the dollar to rise substantially and oil 
prices to continue their descent.  In this scenario, we assume that a shortfall in foreign GDP growth of ½ percentage point per year relative to the baseline causes the dollar to appreciate 10 percent mainly by raising the risk premium on foreign currency
denominated assets and oil prices to decline 25 percent, about $7 per barrel, relative to 
the baseline. 
The stronger dollar and weaker activity abroad depress U.S. real net exports.  As 
this drag on net exports more than offsets the stimulus to consumption from lower oil prices, U.S. real GDP expands only 2 percent in 2016, nearly ½ percentage point below the baseline.
2 Greater resource slack, the appreciation of the dollar, and lower oil prices 
2 This estimate does not take into account any financial effects of falling oil prices on the oil 
industry or nonlinear effects on energy investment as oil prices decline to very low levels. In principle, the

cause U.S. core inflation to fall to ¾ percent in 2016.  The federal funds rate follows a 
shallower path than in the baseline, reaching 2.5 percent by the end of 2018. 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
Although man y indicators of spending and production have recently been weak, 
the labor market has been quite strong.  Moreover, consumer confidence has remained 
upbeat in recent months.  In this scenario, we assume that these latter indicators are 
providing a more accurate reading on the underlying state of the economy. In particular, 
strong job gains and solid consumer confidence lead to faster consumer spending growth 
that, in turn, spurs pr oduction and higher business investment.  In addition, we assume 
that inflation is more sensitive to resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO 
model.  This greater sensitivity is consistent with the estimates of some other DSGE 
models, such as Smets and Wouters (2007).3 It is also consistent with the view that the 
Phillips curve is steeper at higher rates of resource utilization than when economic 
activity is relatively weak.4 
Real GDP rises 3¾ percent in 2016, compared with 2½ percent in the baseline 
projection.  The unemployment rate falls rapidly, bottoming out at 4¼ percent by the end of 2016; it then edges up over the remainder of the forecast period but stays lower than in the baseline.  With resource utilization running tighter and the Phillips curve assumed to be steeper than in the standard version of the model, inflation rises more than in the 
baseline, approaching 2½ percent, on average, in 2 019 and 2020.  The federal funds rate 
rises more steeply, passing 4 percent in 2018 and reaching almost 5 percent in 2020.  
Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent.  Unemployment does not need to exceed the natural rate to bring inflation back 
down simply returning to the natural rate is enough because inflation expectations 
remain anchored throughout the scenario. 
financial effects might imply a somewhat greater fall in U.S. GDP, although the implications of 
nonlinearities in the relationship between oil investment and oil prices are less clear.

Misperceived Natural Rate of Unemployment 
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate falls to 4.6 percent 
by the end of 2018, with the natural rate of unemployment unchanged at a 5.1 percent 
level.  This scenario considers the possibility that the natural rate of unemployment falls 
1 percentage point over the next few years.  The natural rate could be driven lower by a 
variety of influences, such as demographic factors, improvements in matching efficiency, 
or a deterioration in workers’ bargaining power . 
The natural rate of unemployment is estimated with considerable uncertainty, and 
it may be difficult for staff or policymakers to gauge such a change in the natural rate 
accurately in real time.  In this scenario, we assume that the FOMC learns about the 
natural rate only gradually from noisy signals of the underlying economic drivers and, 
thus, that a considerable gap between the actual and perceived natural rates persists 
through the end of 2020.  The unemployment rate falls to 4¼ percent by the end of 2018, still slightly above the actual natural rate but considerably below the perceived natural 
rate.  
Economic activity is somewhat stronger than in the baseline throughout the 
simulation as firms create more jobs and expand production.  However, because the unemployment rate does not fall as much as the true natural rate, there is disinflationary 
pressure, and core inflation remains persistently below the baseline through the end of 
2020.  Despite the lower path for inflation in this scenario, the federal funds rate is only 
slightly lower than in the baseline because of policymakers’ misperception of how much 
resource slack is present in the economy. 
Financial Turbulence 
Measures of financial market volatility, such as the VIX, spiked up again recently 
amid the unease in the stock market.  Meanwhile, corporate bond spreads have continued 
to climb since mid-2014 and have now reached levels similar to those at the onset of the 2001 recession.  Market commentary has cited, among other contributing factors, 
uncertainty about both the economic strength of the EMEs and U.S. corporate leverage.  In this alternative scenario, we explore the consequences of a further deterioration in 
financial conditions.  We assume that household and investor risk aversion rises, pushing 
the corporate bond spread 200 basis points above the baseline in the first quarter of 2016,

roughly one-half the increase observed between 2007 and 2008.5 Spreads then gradually 
return to a more normal level.  The rise in spreads raises financing costs for firms’ capital 
expenditures.  In addition, the underlying increase in risk aversion depresses household 
spending, further reducing aggregate demand.  
Under these circumstances, the economy experiences an outright contraction in 
the first quarter of 2016 and grows much more slowly than in the baseline for the rest of 
the year.  The unemployment rate rises to 5½ percent by the middle of the year before a 
gradual recovery begins.  Core PCE inflation is only slightly below the baseline because 
the model has a fairly high degree of price rigidity.  The path of the federal funds rate remains roughly 1 percentage point below the baseline in 2017 and 2018. 
5 In the estimated model of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which explicitly incorporates 
financial market frictions, structural shocks of this magnitude or larger have occurred roughly once every 
20 years. However, estimates of the frequency of such rare adverse shocks are highly uncertain.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
