Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Our near-term assessment of economic activity  is little changed from the January 
Tealbook.  Real GDP growth was modest last quarter, but the availa ble indicators of 
aggregate spending and production point to a pickup this quarter, mostly as we had 
projected.  Labor market conditions also seem  to have improved roughly in line with our 
expectations.   
Financial market conditions, which had tightened between the December and 
January Tealbooks, tightened further in the fi rst half of February.  However, these 
conditions eased later in the intermeeting period and currently are generally more 
accommodative than at the time of the Janua ry Tealbook.  Nevertheless, corporate bond 
spreads remain well above their historical norms; we have accordingly built into our 
forecast a drag on investment spending this year  that offsets a small part of the modest 
boost to real GDP growth from the ch anges in other financial conditions.  
All told, real GDP is projected to in crease 2¼ percent in both 2016 and 2017 and 
about 2 percent in 2018.  At the end of 2018, real GDP is expected to be nearly 
1½ percent above our estimate of  its potential and the unempl oyment rate is expected to 
be 4.3 percent, ¾ percentage point below our revised estimate of 5.0 percent for its 
natural rate.   
Our forecast for total PCE price inflation ove r the first half of this year is higher 
than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting recent  unexpected increases in crude oil prices 
as well as a reading on core PC E price inflation in January th at was stronger than we had 
anticipated.  We have not marked up our for ecast for core inflation materially over the 
remainder of the year, based partly on our experience in the past few years that upside 
surprises during the early months of the year turned out to be evanescent.  We project that 
total PCE price inflation will move up gradually over the medium term, reaching 
1.8 percent in 2018, as energy and import prices bottom out and begin to rise moderately 
later this year and as resour ce utilization tightens further in an environment of reasonably 
stable long-run inflation expectations.  Our forecast for total PCE inflation in 2018 is a 
couple of tenths lower than in the previous  projection, owing primarily to lower energy 
price inflation later in the pr ojection but also to a slightly  lower estimate of underlying 
inflation.

Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  most recently published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections,  or SEP, following  the 
December  FOMC meeting.   The table  on the next page compares  the staff’s current economic  
projection  with the one we presented  in the December  Tealbook.  
Over the three‐year projection  period, the cumulative  growth of real GDP is about unrevised  from 
the December  forecast.   (Relative  to December,  our forecast for real GDP growth this year is 
revised down  a little, while growth in 2017 and 2018 is a bit higher.)  The unemplo yment rate is 
now forecast to decline gradually  to 4.3 percent at the end  of 2018, 0.2  percentage  point below 
our December  projection.   The unemployment  rate gap is only 0.1 percentage  point stronger,  
however,  with the difference  being the result of our having marked down our estimate of  the 
natural rate from  5.1 percent to 5.0 percent.   
The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation has been revised  down slightly in the first half of 
this year, largely  reflecting  lower energy prices.  With  data through January, core  PCE price 
inflation in the first half appears to be running above our December  projection,  but we expect it 
to slow in the second half, leaving our projection  for core inflation unchanged  over the year as a 
whole.  Given our assumptions  that energy prices and core import prices will start  to rise later this 
year along  with our  forecast for tightening  resource  utilization,  we continue to project  that 
inflation will move  up gradually.   Both total and core inflation are projected  to reach 1.8 percent in 
2018.  The forecast  for total inflation in 2018 is 0.2 percentage  point below our December  
forecast, mostly reflecting  the flatter futures prices for oil and food commodities  but also partly 
because of  our assessment  that longer‐run inflation  expectations  relevant for  wage and price 
setters have edged down and are now consistent  with PCE  price inflation of 1.75 percent rather 
than 1.8 percent.   
Under the inertial  version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use to set the path of monetary  policy, 
the federal funds rate rises  roughly 1 percentage point  (or a little less)  per year and  reaches an 
average of about 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, around  ¼ percentage point less than  
in our December  projection.   About 15 basis points of that downward  revision to the  terminal 
funds rate reflects  the slightly lower inflation  outlook in this forecast;  the remainder  reflects a 
complex set of factors including  our recalibration of  the Okun’s law relationship  that is discussed  
in “The Outlook  for the Labor  Market and  Aggregate  Supply” in  this section.

  We discuss our assessment of the risks to the outlook in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section of the Tealbook.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 We continue to assume that the federal funds rate will be governed by an 
inertial version of the Ta ylor (1999) policy rule.  With our outlook for the 
output gap and core inflation little ch anged, this policy rule continues to 
prescribe a path of the federal funds ra te that increases roughly 1 percentage 
point (or a little less) per year over th e projection period, a nd it reaches an  
average of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018.  (See the box “An 
Alternative Path for the Federal Fu nds Rate” for a discussion of the 
macroeconomic implications of a lower pa th for the federal funds rate in the 
next couple of years.)  
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current size until the fourth quarter of 2016 and then begin to contract as the proceeds 
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen we ll below our previous forecast for this 
quarter, and our projected path for that yi eld is notably lower in the near term 
than in the January Tealbook.  A small portion of this downward revision 
persists well into the projection perio d, reflecting our assessment that term 
premiums will remain below historic al norms for longer than we had 
previously thought, and that investors’ expectations of short-term rates will 
take longer to move up to the path imp lied by the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  
Nevertheless, our projection continues to  call for the 10-year Treasury yield to 
rise significantly over the medium te rm, reflecting the movement of the 
10-year valuation window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates as well as the increase in the term premium toward a more 
historically normal level.   
 We revised down the path for the 30-year  mortgage rate broadly in line with 
the revision to Treasury yields.  Howeve r, we revised down the path for the 
10-year triple-B corporate bond rate through 2018 by less than that for the

 An Alternative  Path for the Federal Funds Rate 
In the staff’s baseline projection,  the federal funds rate rises  relatively  steeply—roughly  
1 percentage point (or  a little less) per year until  the end of 2018.  That baseline  trajectory  is 
determined  by the inertial Taylor (1999) interest rate rule,  with the intercept  (often 
interpreted  as a long‐run r*) set equal to 1¼ percent.   Why does the rule call for increases  in 
the federal funds rate to be  as rapid as it does?  Part  of the answer is that the rule views  the 
Committee as  having “fallen behind the curve.”  For example,  a non‐inertial version of the 
rule would have  set the federal funds  rate at 2¼  percent in  2015:Q4,  much higher  than the 
observed  average for the quarter  of 0.16 percent.   Even if the output and inflation gaps  were 
to remain  fixed at their 2015:Q4 levels, the  inertial version of the rule would call for 
significant  increases  in the federal funds rate in the next few years to allow the policy rate to 
“catch up” to the level consistent  with the non‐inertial rule. 
The Committee,  however,  has given no indication  that it sees itself as having fallen behind  
the curve, and therefore  it may not perceive  the need to catch up.  What would  the 
consequences  be for our forecast of assuming  a policy rule with the catch ‐up aspect turned  
off for a while  longer?  One  particularly  simple approach to capturing  this idea is to assume  
that policy will be on hold for 2016 and then will revert  to the baseline rule starting in 
2017:Q1.1  The  table below shows the implications  in FRB/US of following  this alternative  
method for setting  the federal funds  rate.  The effects  are modest, partly  because transient  
federal funds  rate shocks  do not have a large  influence  on long‐term interest rates in the 
model.  In  particular,  the simulations  assume that the public does not draw any independent 
inference from  the delay in further raising the federal funds  rate regarding  the fundamental  
factors determining  the outlook for economic  activity and inflation or change their views 
regarding  monetary  policymakers’  commitment  to achieving  their objectives.

  10-year Treasury yield, reflecting our assessment that corporate bond spreads 
will remain above historical norms for longer than we had previously 
assumed.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 The recent rally in equity prices has reversed most of the sharp drop seen 
earlier in the year.  However, the incoming news on corporate earnings has been downbeat; as a result, we have  not passed through all of the recent 
upward movement in equity prices into th e forecast.  After the current quarter, 
we project that equity prices will rise at  a rate of 3 percen t per year over the 
next three years, slig htly slower than in  the January Tealbook. 
 Incoming house price data have been cl ose to our expectations since the 
previous Tealbook, but we have revised up the forecast over the rest of this 
year slightly in re sponse to a lower projected path  for mortgage rates.  After 
this year, we continue to expect these prices to rise  about 2¾ percent per year.  
One simple model of housing valuation th at we monitor suggests that housing 
is currently overvalued by 6 percent, co mpared with more than 40 percent a 
decade ago.
1  Our forecast has rents rising sli ghtly faster than house prices; as 
a result, this valuation measure move s slowly back toward neutral.  
Fiscal Policy 
 Our fiscal policy assumptions are unrevise d in this forecast.  We continue to 
anticipate that the federal budget legislat ion passed at the end of last year, 
combined with the ongoing modest growth  in state and local purchases, will 
provide a boost of about ½ percentage poi nt to real GDP growth this year and 
make smaller contributions in 2017 and 2018. 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 The broad nominal dollar has depreciated 2¾ percent, on net, since the time of 
the January Tealbook, retrac ing the appreciation that  had occurred between 
the December and January Tealbooks .  The dollar’s declin e since the January 
                                                 
1 As described in the memo “Staff Assessment of Housing Overvaluation” by Steven Laufer that 
was sent to the Committee on January 16, 2016, the mode l assesses the price-to-rent ratio against costs of 
housing investment (such as interest rates) and a linea r trend that may reflect ch allenges associated with 
measuring house prices and rents.

  Tealbook was most pronounced against the currencies of commodity 
producers, particularly those of oil expor ters.  We expect the nominal dollar to 
rise about 1 percent this  year—lifted by monetary policy divergence between 
the United States and advanced foreign economies, and by some further 
depreciation of the Chinese renminbi as well as the currencies of other 
emerging Asian economies—and then to be little changed over the medium 
term.  By the end of 2018, our projecti on for the broad real dollar is about 
3½ percent weaker than in the previo us Tealbook but little changed from 
December.  
 After slowing to an annual  rate of 1¾ percent in th e fourth quarter, foreign 
real GDP growth is projected to move up to a 2 percent p ace in the current 
quarter and then to strengthen to 2¾ percent by late 2017.  This trajectory reflects both continuing slow improvemen t in the euro area and anticipated 
recoveries in Canada and Brazil that  are aided by the stabilization of 
commodity prices.  More broadly, fo reign economies should benefit from 
ongoing U.S. growth, accommodative monetary policies, past currency 
depreciation, and, in some cases, low oil prices.  Relative to the January 
Tealbook, the foreign growth outlook is lo wer by ¼ percentage point this year 
in response to some softness in the incoming data.   
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 Oil prices have been highly  volatile.  The spot price of Brent crude oil closed 
at $40 per barrel on March 8, $11 above its level in the previous Tealbook and 
nearly matching its level in the December Tealbook.  Further-dated futures 
quotes retraced less of their earlier d eclines than spot prices, with the 
end-2018 futures price settling at $49 a ba rrel, up $6 per barrel relative to the 
January Tealbook but $8 lower than in the December Tealbook.  At the start of the year, concerns about the outlook for economic growth in China, the 
continued strength of global oil suppl y, and elevated inventories weighed on 
prices.  Although inventories have c ontinued to build, a combination of 
subsequent news about the possibility  of an agreement between Russia and 
OPEC members to freeze production at January levels and some improvement 
in investor risk sentiment has suppor ted the recent rebound in prices.  Our 
forecast for the average price of imported oil this year has been revised up

  about $8, to $38 per barrel, with prices e xpected to slowly move up to $44 per 
barrel by the end of the forecast period. 
 Metals prices have rebounded strongly  since the previous Tealbook, supported 
by an easing of concerns about Chinese demand and continuing reports of 
supply reductions.  In contrast, the pri ces of agricultural goods are basically 
unchanged relative to the January Teal book and have been mostly flat during 
the past six months.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The incoming data on spending and production remain consistent with our 
projection for moderate GDP growth in the ne ar term.  We now estimate that real GDP 
increased at an annual rate of 1¼ percent in  the fourth quarter—¾ pe rcentage point more 
than in the January Tealbook—primarily reflecting a smaller inventory correction than 
we had previously estimated.  Real GDP is projected to increase at an annual rate of 
about 2 percent in both the first and second quarters, as spending bounces back in several 
categories that were weak last quarter.  Our near-term projection fo r real GDP growth is 
just a touch lower, on average, than in the January Tealbook, as the fourth-quarter 
surprise in inventory investment is antic ipated to unwind duri ng the first half of 
this year.2 
 Real PCE growth is projected to pick  back up to a 3 percent pace in the 
current quarter after slowing to 2 pe rcent in the fourth quarter.  The 
acceleration partly reflects a rebound  in spending on energy services 
following the unusually warm weather in th e fourth quarter, but it also reflects 
a rebound in January outlays on motor vehicles and other goods that had declined in December.  Our forecast for solid PCE growth over the first half of this year is consistent with ongoing improvements in labor market 
conditions, low energy prices, and sti ll-favorable readings on consumer 
sentiment.

2 As displayed in the table “Federal Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q1 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projections generated by the near-term forecasting approaches used within the System, at 
1.9 percent, is the same as the staff’s judgmental projection.

   Real residential investment spending in creased at an annual rate of 10 percent 
in the fourth quarter, and the incoming data on housing activity remain 
consistent with continued solid gains this quarter.   
 Total business fixed investment (BFI) fell about 2 percent at an annual rate in 
the fourth quarter, rather than risi ng moderately as we had projected, and 
appears to have declined again in the current quarter.  We expect drilling and 
mining investment to continue to fall sh arply this quarter—at an annual rate of 
more than 50 percent—reflecting con tinued low energy prices.  Spending on 
equipment and intangibles is now estimated to have been about flat last quarter and is projected to rise only modestly in the current quarter, consistent 
with the data on orders and shipment s of capital goods through January as 
well as weak readings from some of th e business surveys.  In addition, we 
built in a somewhat larger-than-usual re sponse of BFI spending this year to 
the elevated level of corporate bond spreads; this additional adjustment takes 
nearly ¾ percentage point off of our BFI growth forecast. 
 Exports declined 2 percent last quart er and are projected to fall another 
2 percent in the current quarter, in line with past dollar appreciation and weak 
foreign growth.  Imports continued to surprise on the downside, declining ¾ percent in the fourth quarter, which reflects in part continued weakness in 
imports of capital goods.  Supported by past dollar appreciation and the 
strength of the U.S. economy, imports are projected to rise 3½ percent in the current quarter.  All told, net exports are expected to deduct ¾ percentage 
point from real GDP growth this quarter , about ¼ percentage point less than in 
the January Tealbook.   
 Past dollar appreciation and weak forei gn activity have also been a drag on 
manufacturing production:  Factory output has barely edged up, on net, over 
the past several months, and available source data point to a similar sluggish 
pace in February.  Ongoing declines in drilling activity continue to weigh directly on mining production and indirectly, through their adverse upstream 
effects, on manufacturing output. 
                                                 
by 0.1 percentage point.  In addition, we have reduced the amount of catch-up that we are assuming from 
the shortfall of consumption relative to income and wealth  in recent years; this adjustment lowers real PCE 
growth nearly 0.2 percentage point this year.

  Beyond the near term, real GDP is expected to continue to expand faster than its 
potential, supported in part by a still-accomm odative stance of monetary policy and by 
mildly expansionary fiscal policy.  (See the box “Estimates of the S hort-Run Real Natural 
Rate of Interest” for how this rate may evolve over the medium term.)   
 Real GDP growth is projected to be 2¼ percent in 2016 and 2017 and then to 
slow to 2 percent in 2018.  Over this period, monetary policy accommodation 
diminishes and fiscal impetus fades; however, the drag from net exports also lessens as the effects of pa st dollar appreciation wane. 
 Relative to the January Tealbook, real GDP growth is revised up in 2015 and 
down in 2016 by similar amounts; on net,  the change to the timing of 
inventory investment can account for th ese revisions.  GDP growth in 2017 
and 2018 is expected to be slightly higher than in the previous Tealbook, 
primarily reflecting the improvement seen  in financial conditions, on balance, 
since then.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
Taken together, the employment reports fo r January and February indicate that 
conditions in the labor market have continue d to improve about as we had projected. 
 Nonfarm payroll employment is  estimated to have risen at an average pace of 
about 210,000 per month in January and February.  Combined with our forecast of a similar gain in March, the average monthly increase in payrolls this quarter is roughly 30,000 lower than  we expected in the January Tealbook 
but the same as in our December forecast.  We continue to project job gains of 
about 200,000 per month in the second quarter.   
 The unemployment rate declined to 4.9 pe rcent in January and remained there 
in February, as we expected.  We project the unemployment rate to hold 
steady at 4.9 percent through the middle of this year.  
 The labor force participation rate has moved up markedly in recent months, to 
62.9 percent in February, 0.3 percentage  point above our projection in the 
January Tealbook.  We now have the participation rate edging down to 
62.8 percent in March and remaining th ere for most of the second quarter—
¼ percentage point above our  previous projection.

   In response to the upward surprises to th e participation rate in recent months, 
we raised our estimate for the trend pa rticipation rate by 0.2 percentage point, 
reversing the downward revisions we made  last year when the participation 
rate was surprisingly soft.  Separatel y, we now assume the natural rate of 
unemployment continued to edge down through 2015 to 5.0 percent 
(one-tenth lower than our earlier esti mate), reflecting signs of continuing 
improvement in matching efficiency as well as the ongoing secular downtrend 
in job separation rates. 
 The amount of slack left in the labor market has diminished considerably in 
recent quarters, in our estimation.  Factoring in the recent data and the 
revisions to our trends, we now esti mate that in the first quarter, the 
unemployment rate will be slightly belo w its natural rate and the participation 
rate will be slightly be low its trend level.  The employment-to-population 
gap—which accounts for utilization along both of these margins—has 
narrowed considerably sin ce late last year, and th e employment-to-population 
ratio is expected to be just 0.1 percenta ge point below our estimate of its trend 
this quarter.  That said, we  continue to view the el evated share of employees 
working part time for economic reasons as  indicating that a little more slack 
remains than suggested by the more standard measures. 
 In contrast to our judgmental assessme nt that labor market conditions have 
continued to improve, the staff’s labor market conditions index, or LMCI—a 
strictly mechanical method of filtering the data—deteriorated in February and 
was little changed on average over the past three months.4 
                                                 
4 The change in the LMCI reflects movements in a set of 19 detrended measures of labor market 
activity, with the weights given to each variable based on the historical co-m ovements of the detrended 
series.  The LMCI’s assessment of the change in labor market conditions can differ from the staff’s 
judgment for at least two reasons.  First, the trends in the series considered by the LMCI are estimated 
mechanically, and these trends differ—sometimes  substantially—from the staff’s own judgmental 
assessment of the trends.  Second, the statistical filter that generates the LMCI cannot discriminate between 
the signal and noise in any particular realization of the data, but it instead estimates the relative weighting 
of the variables based on their historical average signal-to-noise ratio; in contrast, the staff spends 
considerable effort each month evaluating the signal quality of the incoming data.

 Estimates of the Short -Run Real Natural Rate of Interest  
This discussion  introduces a new exhibit  to the Tealbook  that provides estimates of the 
short -run real n atural rate of i nterest from the Federal Reserve S ystem ’s dynamic stochastic 
general equilibrium  (DSGE ) modeling  project.  The System ’s DSGE project currently includes 
models maintained by the staff at  the Federal Reserve Banks of  New York and Philadelphia 
and at the Federal Reserve Board.  
As explained in a recent memo  to the FOMC, the natural rate of interest is defined as the real 
risk-free interest rate that would prevail in the absence of sluggish adjustment of nominal 
prices and wages.1  The natural rate is therefore unaffected by monetary policy .  In simple 
models, letting the actual real federal funds  rate track the short -run natural rate at all times 
would close the output gap and deliver price stability.  In more complex models , such as the 
ones used in the System ’s DSGE project, targeting the natural rate may not be optimal, as 
monetary policymakers face numerous tradeoffs —notably between stabilizing inflation and 
real activity.  Nonetheless, following a policy rule that is informed by estimates of the short -
run natural rate has been shown to  deliver reasonably good performance in these models in 
controlling the volatility of both  inflation around its target and the output gap.2  
                                                 
1 Hess Chung , Marco del Negro, and others (2015) , “Estimates of Short- Run r* from DSGE Models ,” 
memorandum to the FOMC, October  13.  A related concept to the equilibrium federal funds rate is the 
neutral rate of interest, which is defined as the rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary 
if the economy were operating at potential.  Although the neutral and natural rates of interest are different 
in models with several independent nominal fr ictions, they tend to have similar patterns, and thus the 
natural rate is informative about the neutral rate.

The figure on the previous  page shows the most recent estimates of the short -run real 
natural rate of interest from the three participating models .  The solid line represents the 
median estimate of  the models, and  the shaded green band provides the range at any point 
in time. As the range of variation  shown  in the exhibit suggests, estimates  of the natural rate of 
interest are model dependent.  Furthermore, these estimates are volatile from period to 
period , reflecting the fact that the natural rate responds to transitory shocks buffeting the 
economy.  Smoothing through the high -frequency variation in the median estimate of the 
real natural rate of interest, we observe a sharp decline during  and shortly after the Great 
Recession.  Moreover, estimates from  all of the models  are negative by the end of the 
financial crisis.   The three models attribute most of the decline in the natural rate to financial and 
investment shocks that restrained  aggregate demand and, hence, overall economic activity.  
The slow unwinding of these adverse shocks has led to the gradual upward trajectory in the 
median estimate of  the real natural rate of interest  over the past several years .  The median 
estimate is projected to rise above zero by the first quarter of 2017  and then steadily increase 
to around 1  percent at the end of 2018.  The model estimates  range from 0.6 to 1.4 percent  at 
the end of the forecast period . 
The following table shows how the models’  estimates of the natural rate of interest in the 
first quarter of 2016 have been revised since the December Tealbook.  Although  the estimate 
from the New York model is essentially un changed , the estimate from the Philadelphia 
model has been revised down 20 basis points , and the estimate from the Board model has 
been revised up substantially.  This diversity in revisions highlights the differences 
across  models  in real- time inference about the underlying shocks  driving  the natural rate 
of interest.

  With real GDP growth in this forecast av eraging a little higher than we projected 
in the January Tealbook, the medium-term outlook for the labor market is a little stronger 
than in our previous projection.  
 We now project that the unemployment rate will fall to 4.3 percent by the end 
of 2018, 0.3 percentage point below our forecast in the January Tealbook.  By 
itself, the slightly faster growth of real  GDP in this projection explains most of 
this revision.5  In addition, the small adjust ment to our assumption regarding 
the natural rate contributes one-tenth to the decline in the unemployment rate. 
 Payroll gains over the past year have been surprisingly strong relative to GDP 
growth, while productivity growth has been surprisingly weak.  Given the 
slight deceleration projecte d for real GDP over the medium term, as well as an 
expected increase in produc tivity toward its structur al trend, we expect job 
growth to slow from an average pace of about 200,000 per month over the 
first half this year to about 140,000 per month by 2018.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
The BEA now reports that total PCE pri ces increased at an annual rate of 
½ percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  We project th at overall PCE prices will be 
about flat this quarter and then  rise at an annual rate of about 1¼ percent in the second 
quarter.  These low rates of inflation reflect  in large part our estimate that consumer 
energy prices will decline steeply and food pric es will be flat, on net, over this period.  
Core PCE price inflation is anticipated to step  up from 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter to 
nearly 2 percent this quarter before slowing to 1½ percent next quarter.

unemployment rate gap has become more cyclically sensitive to the GDP gap since the mid-1980s than it 
had been earlier.  In response, we reestimated the Okun’s law relationship and found that a 1 percentage 
point increase in the output gap now reduces the unemployment rate after a year by 0.55 percentage point 
compared with our previous estimate of a 0.45 percentage point reduction.  Based on the projection in the January Tealbook, the larger coefficient would have implied about a 0.1 percentage point lower unemployment rate at the end of the medium term than  we had projected in January.  However, for this 
Tealbook we offset the implications for the unemployment rate by raising our assumption for potential output growth from 2016 to 2018 by a cumulative 0.2 percent.  As a result of the change in the Okun’s law 
coefficient, the revision to the outp ut gap at the end of the medium term  is not directly comparable to the 
revision to the unemployment rate gap in this projection.

   The projection for headline PCE price infl ation in the current quarter, weak as 
it is, is 1 percentage po int higher than in the Ja nuary Tealbook.  The higher 
projected path for oil prices boosts the forecast of consumer energy price 
inflation in the near term; more im portantly, however, we revised up our 
projection for core PCE price inflation in the first quarter by ¾ percentage 
point.  The revision to core inflation was largely because of upside surprises in 
several erratic components (including nonmarket prices) where price changes 
in a single month have hist orically carried little signa l about future inflation.  
In addition, the January jump in goods prices seems hard to square with 
ongoing declines in import prices.  Furthe rmore, given difficulties in seasonal 
adjustment, it is our experience that upsid e surprises in the early months of the 
year often turn out to be transitory.  As a result, we left our projection of core inflation for future months little changed and continue to expect it to be about 
1½ percent in the second quarter.
6   
  A lower dollar and higher commodity pri ces led us to revi se up our forecast 
for core import price inflation in co ming months.  We now expect import 
prices to decrease at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the first half of this year, 
compared with the 3 percent decline projected in the previous Tealbook.  
Starting in the second half of this year, co re import prices are expected to rise 
at about a 1 percent pace.  
 Some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have 
moved down to the lower end of their historical ranges.7  The University of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of longer-run infla tion expectations 
dropped to 2.5 percent in February, tied for the lowest reading in the history of 
the series.  While these low readings lik ely reflect—at least in part—declines 
in gasoline prices over th e past year and a half, it is  possible that some of the 
                                                 
6 The consumer price index (CPI) for February will be published on March 16, the second day of 
the FOMC meeting.  In January, the 12-month change in the core CPI was 2.2 pe rcent, compared with the 
1.7 percent increase in core PCE prices over the same period.  The current wedge between these two 
inflation measures—at ½ percentage point—has remained  elevated relative to its longer-run average value 
of about 35 basis points.  As discussed in the September 2015 Tealbook box “The Recent Gap between 
Core CPI and Core PCE Price Inflation Measures,” the behavior of prices for housing services and for medical services, combined with the different weights for those items in the two indexes, could more than 
explain why core CPI inflation was unusually high relativ e to core PCE inflation in the middle of last year, 
and that remains the case in the latest data.   
7 This topic was discussed in more detail in the memo “Longer-Term Inflation Expectations:  
Evidence and Policy Implications” that was sent to the FOMC on March 4, 2016.

  decline reflects a more persistent reduc tion in inflation expe ctations.  Ten-year 
expectations for PCE price inflation in the Survey of Professional Forecasters 
moved back up to 2 percent this quarter , although CPI infla tion expectations 
in this survey edged back down to 2.1 percent, where they have hovered over 
the past year at their lowest level on record.  Market-based measures of 
longer-term inflation compensation rema in at extremely low levels.  On 
balance, we think these indicators su ggest that the longer-term inflation 
expectations relevant for wage and price setting have edged down over the 
past year.  Accordingly, we nudged down our estimate of underlying inflation 
from 1.8 percent to 1.75 percent over the medium term.8   
We continue to expect inflation to m ove gradually higher over the medium term, 
as energy and import prices be gin to turn up later this ye ar and resource utilization 
tightens further.   
 Core PCE price inflation is projected to  increase from 1.4 percent this year to 
1.8 percent in 2018.  Energy and import pr ice pass-through is anticipated to 
continue to hold down core inflation near ly ½ percentage point this year, but 
the restraint from these sources is exp ected to subside noticeably next year 
and dissipate almost entirely in 2018.  In addition, the proj ected tightening of 
resource utilization over the medium te rm contributes about 0.1 percentage 
point to the pickup in  core inflation.   
 Beyond the near term, both food and energy prices are projected  to rise just a 
little faster than core prices.  As a re sult, total PCE price inflation moves up to 
the same rate as core inflation in 2017 and 2018.   
 Compared with the January Tealbo ok, both overall and core PCE price 
inflation are slightly high er in both 2015 and 2016 a nd slightly lower in 2017 
and 2018.  The upward revision to overall inflation expected for this year 
reflects higher energy and import prices as  well as higher core inflation in the 
near term.  Over the medium term, co re PCE price inflation was revised down 
0.1 percentage point in 2018, partly refl ecting the small downward revision to 
underlying inflation; fact oring in the downward re vision to energy price 
inflation, overall PCE price inflation is down 0.2 percentage point in 2018.

  (Revisions to the inflation proj ection since the December Tealbook are 
discussed in the box “New Exhibits fo r Monitoring Changes to the Inflation 
Projection.”) 
In the latest data, labor compensation shows little sign of having accelerated.  
However, with labor and product markets expe cted to tighten over the projection period, 
we continue to project that compensation gains will pick up gradually over the medium 
term. 
 Reflecting the latest reading from the Quarterly Ce nsus of Employment and 
Wages, the four-quarter change in business-sector hourly compensation was 
revised down noticeably in 2015 to 2½ percent, about the same as its average 
pace in recent years.  We continue to project that gains in this measure of 
compensation per hour will pick up to around 3¼ percent by the end of the medium-term projection. 
 The employment cost index (ECI) for priv ate workers rose at an annual rate of 
1.9 percent between September and Decem ber, a little slower than we had 
projected, leaving the 12-month change in 2015 at 1.9 percent, about the same 
as its average increase over the previous five years.  We project ECI growth to 
pick up to about 2½ percen t over the medium term.  
 Average hourly earnings of all employees, a less comprehensive but more 
timely measure of wages, increased 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in 
February, up slightly from its av erage pace in recent years.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 Beyond 2018, the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to put 
downward pressure on longer-term interest  rates, albeit to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a 
normal size by 2021. 
 The federal funds rate rises furthe r after 2018.  With the economy running 
above its potential level in the early years of the long-term outlook and 
inflation approaching the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the federal funds 
rate rises above its long-run value in  2019.  It reaches 4 percent in 2020 and 
2021 and moves back toward its long-r un value of 3¼ perc ent thereafter.

   The natural rate of unemployment rema ins at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP 
rises at about its long-ru n value of 1.9 percent per year, on average, from 2019 
through 2021. 
 As monetary policy continues to tigh ten, real GDP decelerates further and 
rises 1½ percent in 2020 and 2021.  The unemployment rate remains at 
4.3 percent in 2019 and edges back up toward its assumed natural rate 
thereafter. 
 PCE price inflation moves up from 1.8 percent in 2018 to the Committee’s long-run objective of 2.0 percent by 2020.

 New Exhibits for Monitoring Changes to the Inflation Projection 
The exhibits on the next three pages will be included regularly in the Tealbook to help 
monitor the evolution of actual and forecast inflation since the time of the Committee’s 
decision to raise the target for the federal funds rate in December 2015 .   
The first exhibit, titled “Inflation Forecasts since the December 2015 Tealbook, ” displays the 
staff’s current four-quarter inflation rate projection, along with projection lines for every 
Tealbook forecast since December 2015, for three key inflation indexes (total PCE prices, 
core PCE prices, and the core CPI).  To provide readers with a sense of the significance of 
forecast revisions, the exhibit also displays the 70 percent confidence intervals surrounding 
the December 2015 projection.1  The dashed vertical lines denote the most recent full 
quarter of data publish
ed by the official statistical agencies. 
The second exhibit, titled “Sources of Inflation Forecast Revisions since the December 2015 
Tealbook, ” provides the sources of the cumulative change in the forecast since December 
2015.2  The top panel apportions revisions in overall PCE price inflation into revisions to the 
subcomponen
ts of food, energy, and core PCE prices.  The lower panel applies the staff ’s 
judgmental rules of thumb to apportion revisions to core PCE price inflation into changes 
stemming from revisions in import prices, energy prices (specifically, their pass-through into 
core prices), resource utilization, and our judgmental inflation trend; a n “other” category is 
also shown, which includes revisions to the forecast from sources other than these four 
categories.  This “other”  category includes items such as nonmarket and medical price 
surprises, as well as forecast surprises that we cannot readily attribute to specific sources. 
As shown in the first exhibit, revisions to projected inflation over the past two Tealbooks 
have been relatively small and, in most cases, are thus far within the 70 percent confidence 
intervals.  As shown in the top panel of the second exhibit , currently the largest source of 
revision to our total PCE price inflation forecast since December 2015 has been lower-than-
expected energy prices this year.  For core PCE price inflation, in the lower panel, the 
forecast in 2016 is a touch higher than in the December Tealbook, as a positive surprise in 
goods and nonmarket PCE prices for January (reflected in the “other” c ategory) has been 
only partially offset by other factors, including a slight lowering of the judgmental inflation 
trend in reaction to declines in both market-based inflation compensation and the Michigan 
survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations.  The adjustment to that trend 
contributes to the small downward revision to the core inflation forecast in 2017 and 2018 .    
In addition to these two new exhibits, a third exhibit titled “Survey Measures of Longer -
Term Inflation Expectations, ” which was previously included in the data sheets, will now be 
moved to this section to provide a more prominent tracking of survey-based inflation 
expectations measures.  
                                                 
1 These confidence intervals are derived from staff errors from the December forecasts since 1998 and 
are consistent with those shown in the exhibit “Prediction Intervals Derived from Historical Tealbook 
Forecast Errors” in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.  
2 The range of the vertical axes in the second exhibit were chosen to roughly represent the 70 percent 
confidence interval for the 2017 core PCE price inflation forecast as of the December 2015 Tealbook.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Recent data suggest that foreign growth is likely to be a bit more sluggish than we 
were anticipating in the January Tealbook.  However, the markdown to our outlook is 
modest,  and we continue to expect a slow but steady pickup in the pace of foreign growth 
over the course of th is year and into 2017.  
After having rallied to a near-trend 2½ percent pace in the third quarter, foreign 
real GDP growth fell back to 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter, ¼ percentage point below 
the January Tealbook estimate.  The Japanese economy contracted, Canadian activity 
stalled, and Brazil remained mired in recession.  With momentum weaker than we had 
previously assessed and financial market conditions in some foreign economies still 
depressed, we marked down the foreign growth path ¼ percentage point this year and 
slightly thereafter.  This revision comes on the heels of a small markdown in the January 
Tealbook.   
Despite the downward revision to the outlook, we still expect foreign growth to 
strengthen over the forecast period, rising to 2  percent in the current quarter and to a 
trend rate of 2¾ percent by 2017.  This trajectory reflects anticipated recoveries in 
Canada and Brazil,  aided by a stabilization of commodity prices, and improvement in the 
euro area.  Foreign economies, more generally, should benefit from U.S. growth, 
accommodative monetary policies, and past currency depreciations. 
Our confidence in this still-restrained forecast has received some support from the 
recent recovery of financial and commodity markets.  Starting in mid-February, foreign 
equity indexes and oil prices mostly retraced their declines from earlier in the year.  
Uncertainty about China’s exchange rate policy , an important contributor to market 
volatility early in the year, has also abated with the stabilization of the renminbi and 
communications by the Chinese authorities that they will attempt to keep the currency 
from depreciating sharply. 
Nonetheless, downside risks to the foreign growth outlook remain elevated.  First, 
despite the aforementioned recovery in financial markets, investors remain quite jittery,

 and even small shocks may push them from relative calm back down into despair, with 
concordant effects on confidence, spending, and activity.  Second, and as a related matter, 
the reasons for market worry —financial imbalances and a possible hard landing in China, 
excessive corporate debt in EMEs, effects of low oil prices on oil-exporters —have not 
gone away, and a new one has been added to the list:  Br itain’s potential exit from the 
European Union (EU), or Brexit .  We assume that the United Kingdom will vote in June 
to remain in the EU, but that outcome is hardly preordained.   Third, over the past year, 
the pace of foreign economic growth has fallen to its lowest level since the global 
financial crisis, rendering  it more vulnerable to adverse shocks.  Our econometric 
analysis, described in the box “ Estimates of World Recession Probabilities,”  points to a 
material rise in the likelihood of a global recession, though we continue to believe that is 
not the most likely scenario.  Finally, as explored in the Risks and Uncertainty section, if 
a widespread foreign recession was to materialize, there is a risk that further monetary 
stimulus may fail to support domestic demand abroad, resulting both in a deeper foreign 
recession and a sharper rise in the dollar.   
AFE inflation slowed to just 0.2 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter and 
an estimated 0 percent in the current quarter,  reflecting further declines in retail energy 
prices.  Inflation is estimated to have remained below zero in Japan and the euro area.  
With the projected firming of oil prices, AFE inflation should move up to about 
1¾ percent by 2018 .  This forecast is a touch weaker despite the recent increase in oil 
prices, largely reflecting recent exchange rate appreciation, the weaker growth outlook, 
and lower inflation expectations in the euro area and Japan.  EME inflation is expected to 
rise to 2 percent in the current quarter, as a rebound in local food prices is pushing up 
Chinese inflation, more than offsetting energy-related declines in inflatio n elsewhere in 
the region.  In much of Latin America, weaker currencies are keeping inflation elevated.   
We expect EME inflation will rise to 3  percent by midyear and remain at about that rate 
through 2018.  
Given the lower inflation and growth outlooks, we revised our monetary policy 
assumptions for some of the AFEs.  We now expect the European Central Bank (ECB) to 
ease monetary policy this month and the Bank of England (BOE) to delay its first rate

 hike to the end of the year, one quarter later than previously assumed.  Following the 
surprise cut of the deposit rate into negative territory, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) will likely 
ease policy further this year.  In contrast, we took back our call for a rate cut this month 
in Canada, and we now expect the Bank of Canada to begin raising rates in mid-2017.  In 
the EMEs, the scope for monetary policy easing is somewhat limited by concerns about 
capital outflows and also, in Latin America, by inflationary pressures; policy rates are 
generally projected to either remain unchanged or increase over the forecast period.  A 
notable exception is China,  where t he People’s Bank of China  cut the reserve requirement 
ratio, and we expect additional cuts going forward.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro Area.  Real GDP growth edged up to 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter, as we 
had expected, but indicators for the first quarter suggest that activity is not 
accelerating as projected in the January Tealbook.  Economic sentiment and 
purchasing managers’ indexes declined in January and February and point to only 
modest growth.  In addition, the economy faces headwinds from recent increases 
in debt yield spreads for banks, lower-rated corporations, and peripheral 
sovereigns.  As a result, we revised down our forecast for GDP growth nearly 
½ percentage point in 2016 and a smaller amount thereafter.  Nonetheless, 
accommodative ECB policy, a depreciated euro, and still-low oil prices should 
support a pickup in GDP growth to nearly 2 percent by late 2016. 
In February, 12-month inflation fell to minus 0. 2 percent, mainly as a result of 
further declines in retail energy prices.  Core inflation also edged down, and 
market-based measures of long-term inflation expectations declined to historical 
lows.  Given the weaker inflation data, we now estimate that headline inflation 
declined to minus 1¼ percent at an annual rate in the current quarter.  As energy 
prices move up, inflation is projected  to rise to 1½ percent by early 2017.   We 
expect the ECB to ease monetary policy at its March meeting, including by 
decreasing its deposit rate further and extending its asset purchase program by a 
few months.

 Estimates  of World Recession  Probabilities   
The tightening  of global financial conditions  earlier in  the year—against  the backdrop  of 
generally  lackluster  economic  activity data—raised  concerns  that the global economy  may 
be headed toward recession.   To quantify these risks,  we present estimates  of recession 
probabilities  for the world economy  and some key U.S. trading partners  based on 
indicators  of macroeconomic  activity and financial market conditions.   
We estimate the  following  global and country‐specific probit models:  
ܻ௧ൌΦሺߙ൅ݐܺߚ൅ݐܼߛ ൅ߝ௧ሻ	, 
 
where ܻ௧	is a monthly  variable that takes the value  1 if the economy  is in recession 
sometime  over the  subsequent  12 months.  Recession  dates are obtained  from the 
Economic  Cycle Research  Institute (ECRI), which follows  a methodology  similar  to that of 
the National  Bureau  of Economic  Research  to date recessions  abroad.   We define a world 
recession as  occurring  when countries  representing  two‐thirds of  world GDP are in 
recession.1  The variable  ܺ௧ is the Aruoba‐Diebold‐Scotti (ADS) index of macroeconomic  
activity, which summarizes  the state of business conditions  by combining  real‐ time 
macroeconomic  indicators  and GDP growth.  For the global  ADS, we use data on world 
industrial  production,  world retail sales,  the new export orders component  of the global 
purchasing  managers  index (PMI), and world GDP growth.2  The variable  ܼ௧ is a measure  of 
financial stress, constructed  from the first principal  component  of country‐specific financial 
variables such as equity prices and interest rate spreads.   In the global model, our  proxy for 
financial stress is the Gilchrist and  Zakrajšek  excess bond premium  (EBP) series,  which 
captures the extra compensation  demanded  by investors  after accounting  for e xpected 
losses due to default.3  Though calculated  for U.S. corporate debt, the EBP fluctuates  with 
measures  of global risk aversion and  is available  for a longer  period. 
Figure 1 shows that both the global ADS index (the black line) and  the EBP series  (the red 
line) are highly correlated  with the global business  cycle, with  the world ADS index 
dropping  markedly  in recessions  and the EBP series  rising sharply.  Notably,  both indicators  
have deteriorated  since last  summer.  Figure 2  shows historical  estimates  of the probability  
of a world recession over  the next 12 months (the blue line).  The probit  model captures  
cyclical slowdowns  in the world economy  well, showing  increases  in the estimated  
probability  ahead of recessions.   Given the deterioration in  macroeconomic  and financial 
conditions  through February,  the estimated  probability  of recession has  increased  of late 
and now stands at about 48 percent,  pointing to sizable  downside  risks to the  global 
outlook.  The  model attributes  two‐ thirds of the increase in the probability  of recession 
relative to its unconditional  value (the horizontal  black line) to weak  ADS readings,  with 
                                                 
1 This criterion identifies  four recessionary  episodes in the world economy  since 1970.

 the remaining  one‐third explained  by tighter financial conditions.   The table  presents  
country‐specific recession probability  estimates,  comparing  current estimates  with those 
obtained  with data  through September  2015.  Consistent  with our  results for the  global 
economy, the  country‐specific estimates  point to higher recession risks at present.  
Even so, several caveats are worth no ting.  First, uncertainty  around these probit  estimates  
is large, reflecting  the difficulty  in predicting  cyclical turning points given that recessions  
are infrequent  events.  Second, the model does  produce some “false positives”; for  
example,  spikes in recession probability  in 1991 and 2002 were not associated  with global  
downturns.   Moreover,  the model’s  current relatively  high probability  of recession may,  in 
part, reflect its misreading  of a structural  slowdown  in global growth.  The constr uction of 
the ADS index assumes  that economic  growth fluctuates  around a stable average,  and it 
attributes  any slowdown  in the underlying variables  to cyclical  factors.  To  the extent that 
growth rates of potential  GDP have slowed, as  has likely occurred  in many economies  since 
the global financial crisis, the ADS index may mistakenly  attribute this  slowdown  to weak 
cyclical conditions  and push up recession probability  estimates.   Finally, in recent days we 
have seen some  improvement in  financial conditions  and in macroeconomic  data for some  
countries  not yet captured  in our indexes .

  Japan.   Real GDP surprisingly contracted 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, driven 
mainly by a drop in consumption.  That said, some recent indicators, including 
industrial production and employment, were more encouraging.  Thus, we expect 
growth to rebound in the current quarter and to reach 1  percent for 2016 as a 
whole before a second hike in the consumption tax temporarily stalls the 
expansion in 2017.  This forecast is slightly lower than our January Tealbook 
projection, reflecting weaker-than-expected data as well as appreciation of the yen 
and higher oil prices. 
Inflation is estimated to have declined to minus ½ percent at an annual rate in the 
current quarter because of lower retail energy prices.  We now see inflation 
(excluding the direct effect of the consumption tax hike) moving up quite slowly 
and reaching only 1¼ percent by late 2017.  In late January, the BOJ surprised 
markets by reducing its deposit rate 20 basis points to  minus 0.1 percent, just a 
week after Governor Haruhiko Kuroda publicly ruled out using negative policy 
rates as an option.  Japanese bond yields declined substantially, but the yen 
appreciated and bank stock prices fell sharply.  Despite this mixed response, we 
expect the BOJ to cut the deposit rate further this year amid sluggish growth and 
inflation. 
 United Kingdom.   Real GDP growth edged up to 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter 
but fell short of our 2¼ percent forecast,  as investment and exports disappointed.  
More recent data,  such as PMIs, were weak.  Accordingly, and despite a weaker 
exchange value for the pound, we revised down our GDP growth forecast nearly 
½ percentage point this year.  Part of this revision also reflects our view that, even 
though we assume U.K. citizens will vote in June to remain in the EU, uncertainty 
about the outcome of the Brexit referendum is weighing on economic activity.  
Indeed,  confidence indicators ha ve edged down recently,  and we expect consumer 
and business spending to be curtailed ahead of the referendum.  In the unlikely 
scenario that the referendum results in Britain leaving the EU , the negotiations on 
the new terms of the relations with the EU will likely be protracted, further 
damaging confidence and disrupting economic activity.  With uncertainty about

 Brexit expected to be resolved  in June, GDP growth is projected to edge up to 
2¼ percent by the end of 2016 and beyond.  
After turning negative in the fourth quarter,  inflation is expected to rebound to 
½ percent in the current quarter.  With energy prices projected to continue to rise, 
we expect inflation to increase to about 2 percent in the second quarter and 
beyond.  Recent BOE communications have focused on concerns about weak 
wage growth and downside risks to the global economy.  According
ly, we now 
expect the BOE to delay raising its policy rate until the fourth quarter of 2016, 
one quarter later than assumed in the January Tealbook.  
 Canada.  Following a 2.4 percent expansion in the third quarter, real GDP 
increased only 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  This drop-off mainly reflect ed 
oil-related declines in business investment,  although inventories were also a drag.  
Indicators for the current quarter, such as the manufacturing PMIs, suggest that 
output is expanding at a slightly faster pace.  We expect growth to rise to 
1¾ percent in 2016 and to be around 2  percent thereafter, as oil prices move up 
further,  monetary policy remains accommodative, and fiscal stimulus boosts 
activity.  Our forecast for 2016 and 2017 is a bit below the January Tealbook 
projection, as the drag from the recent currency appreciation and the slightly 
weaker U.S. growth outlook is only partly offset by the boost from higher oil 
prices. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 China.   Recent indicators suggest that growth will step down to 6 percent in the 
current quarter from 7 percent in the fourth.  In particular, a notable decline in 
exports, together with a slightly weaker PMI, points to slowing manufacturing 
growth in the current quarter.  Declining turnover in China’s stock market lead s 
us to expect a further retrenchment in financial services growth.  Our assessment 
is that Chinese authorities will keep the renminbi broadly stable against their 
preferred currency basket over the forecast period (see the box “Will China 
Devalue the Renminbi?” in the Financial Developments section).

 We now see growth rising to 6½ percent in the third quarter —the bottom of the 
authorities’ newly announced  target range of 6.5 to  7 percent for th is year—
before slowing to about 6 percent in 2017.  Policymakers signaled further 
monetary and fiscal easing to support growth, causing us to mark up our outlook a 
bit in the second half of this year.  That said, further stimulus could exacerbate 
existing imbalances within the economy, potentially leading to more painful 
adjustments in the future.  Indeed, after several years of decline, credit growth has 
risen notably since the middle of last year and surged in January.   
We estimate that inflation, after turning negative in the fourth quarter, is rising to 
an annual rate of just under 1 percent in the first quarter, owing primarily to a 
normalization of food price inflation.  Rising oil prices led us to revise up 
inflation over the next few quarters.  We now see inflation rising to 2¾ percent by 
the end of this year before settling at 2½ percent in 2017 and beyond. 
 Other Emerging Asia.   Real GDP growth slowed to 3 percent in the 
fourth quarter, a bit below our January Tealbook forecast.  The deceleration in 
activity is, in part,  a result of weaker growth in Korea , where the fiscal stimulus 
enacted following the MERS (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak has 
faded, and in Hong Kong, where reduced tourism spending from mainland China 
weigh ed on activity.  In contrast, domestic demand strengthened in many other 
economies in the region, leading to surprisingly robust growth in Taiwan , 
Indonesia , the Philippines , and Malaysia , even as exports remain ed weak.  The 
weakness in exports has persisted into the current quarter, but PMI readings 
through February edged up above their fourth-quarter levels.  We expect growth 
in the region to pick up to 3½ percent in the current quarter and 4 percent by 
midyear, supported by stronger growth in the advanced economies and 
accommodative policies.  This projection is ¼ percentage point lower this year, 
dragged down in part by weaker growth in the United States and the AFEs, and 
little changed thereafter. 
 Latin America.   Mexican  real GDP growth slowed to 2.2 percent in the 
fourth quarter,  as we had expected.  Demand-side components have not been

 released, but monthly data suggest that external demand softened, as U.S. 
manufacturing production stagnated and petroleum shipments declined.  W e 
expect growth to remain at 2 ¼ percent this quarter but to rise to almost 3  percent 
by 2017, supported by a depreciated peso and past economic reforms.  This 
projection is revised down slightly this year—particularly in the first half —in 
response to the downward revision to U.S. manufacturing production.  We revised 
current-quarter inflation down ½ percentage point to 2½ percent because of 
declines in transport prices.  Inflation should move up to 3¼ percent in the 
third quarter and beyond.  Despite inflation that remains squarely within its target 
range, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate 50 basis points in mid-February, 
citing concerns about the effect of peso depreciation on inflation going forward. 
In Brazil , real GDP plummeted a somewhat larger-than-expected 5.7 percent in 
the fourth quarter,  marking the fourth  consecutive quarter of declining activity 
and closing out a year in which GDP fell 6 percent.  Fixed investment continued 
to plunge,  and private consumption weakened amid rising unemployment.  In the 
current quarter, we expect the economy to continue contracting, albeit at a slower 
pace.  Although still depressed, both consumer and business confidence have 
improved a bit so far this year,  and the manufacturing PMI and industrial 
production have edged up.  We do not see Brazilian growth turning positive until 
2017 , as political tensions weigh on the economy and obstruct policy responses to 
the recession.  Former President Lula was questioned in relation to the corruption 
scandal at Petrobras, adding fuel to the growing expectation that current 
President Dilma Rousseff will be forced to step down.  Despite the weak 
economy, the substantial depreciation of the real and hikes in administered prices 
pushed inflation up to an estimated 11 percent at an annual rate in the current 
quarter.  We see inflation declining to 5½ percent by mid-2017, as monetary 
policy remains tight. 
Argentina’s newly elected government has taken major strides to address the 
country’s economic problems and mend its relationship with the international 
community.  Most recently, Argentina reached agreement in principle with the

 remaining holdout creditors who had refused to participate in the 2005 and 2010 
debt restructurings.  The Argentine congress is expected to approv e the 
agreement, which will remove the last hurdle in the country ’s path toward 
renormalizing its access to international capital markets.   We expect the economic 
reforms of the new government, including fiscal consolidation, to restrain growth 
this year, but further out, improved confidence in the government’s commitment 
to the reforms will begin to bear fruit.  Thus, we lowered growth a bit to 
1¾ percent this year and raised it almost 1 percentage point thereafter to almost 
3½ percent.   Elsewhere in South America, Venezuela ’s real GDP  plunged 
7.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and growth is estimated to have come in weaker 
than expected in Chile  and Colombia .  The region’s economic malaise reflects, in 
part, the challenges posed by low commodity prices, which are proving more 
difficult than previously expected.

Financial Developments 
Investor risk sentiment improved, on ne t, over the intermeeting period, with 
domestic stock prices up, the VIX down, a nd credit spreads on speculative-grade bonds 
narrower.  However, yields on longer-dated nominal Treasury securities declined, 
reflecting in part expectations of more  accommodative foreign monetary policy and 
perceptions of an increased po ssibility of a lower or even negative domestic policy rate.   
In particular, the net changes in financ ial markets over the current intermeeting 
period were as follows: 
 The S&P 500 index increased 4 percent over the period, and the VIX declined 
to a level close to its long-run historical median. 
 Spreads on investment-grade bonds we re about unchanged, while speculative-
grade risk spreads dropped, more so for the lowest-rated credits. 
 Oil prices climbed appreciably, apparent ly contributing to a rise in medium-
term market-based measures of inflation compensation. 
 Longer-term nominal Treasury yields moved down, on net, while domestic 
policy rate expectations dec lined a bit.  The risk-neutr al probability of a policy 
tightening at the March meeting ebbed fu rther over the period and currently 
stands at about 6 percent.   
To extend the time frame to late last year, markets seemed to take the FOMC’s 
decision to tighten policy at the December m eeting in stride, and financial markets were 
fairly quiet through year-end.  However, in early January, investors seemed to become much more concerned about the global econom ic outlook and associated downside risks.  
Uncertainties about the Chin ese economy and exchange ra te policy triggered a sharp 
reduction in risk-taking, and global equity  prices decreased.  Those moves were 
accompanied by declining oil prices and concer ns about the possibility and implications 
of widespread negative rates.  The angst in  global financial markets—reinforced by some 
unsettling news about the health of Eur opean banks—extended through mid-February, 
with investors marking down the expected path of policy in the United States and many 
other countries, sovereign yields moving appreciably lower, and ri sk spreads widening.

  Since mid-February, however, investor concerns about the global economic 
outlook have abated somewhat.  Equity and oil prices have rebounde d notably, and risk 
spreads have narrowed.  The factors underlyi ng the improvement in investor sentiment 
are not completely clear.  In  part, investors may have concluded that increased risk 
aversion earlier in the year was overdone and not fully consistent with fundamentals.  In 
addition, central banks have generally signaled a willingness to provide more 
accommodation as needed, while incoming economi c data in the United States have been 
somewhat better than expected.   
On balance since the December FOMC mee ting, domestic stock prices are down 
and Treasury yields are markedly lower, suggesting lingering concerns about global 
growth and inflation prospects.  Domestic policy expectations are also notably lower.  In 
addition, speculative-grade debt issuance remained relatively light, aggregate corporate 
earnings forecasts were marked down signifi cantly, and corporate credit quality showed 
signs of weakening further, even outside the energy sector.  In cont rast, credit conditions 
for households stayed accommodative overall.  
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS  
FOMC communications were mostly seen as  in line with expectations over the 
current intermeeting period.  However, policy expectations declined somewhat following 
the release of the January FOMC statement, as investors reportedly interpreted it as 
suggesting that the Committee was concerned ab out recent global developments and their 
potential implications for the U.S. ec onomic outlook.  The Chair’s congressional 
testimony and the release of the January FOMC minutes elicited limited market reaction. 
Early in the intermeeting period, the Bank of Japan introduced a negative deposit 
rate, after which market participants became increasingly attentive to  the possibility of 
negative short-term interest rates in the Un ited States.  (See the box “The Prospect of 
Negative Interest Rates in the United States and Implications for L onger-Term Yields.”)  
The odds of a policy hike at the March meeti ng, which were already low at the beginning 
of the intermeeting period, receded further to less than 10 percent.  The path of the 
federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes was roughly unchanged for 2016 but declined at 
longer horizons, with projected  rates at the end of 2016 a nd the end of 2017 at about 60 
basis points and 80 basis poi nts, respectively.

 The Prospect  of Negative Interest Rates in the U nited States   
and Implications for Long er-Term Yields  
Following the recent decisions by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Riksbank to cut key  policy 
rates either into or further into negative territory, market participants have speculated  about the 
possibility that the Federal Reserve might similarly  adopt a negative rate policy  should the U.S. 
economic outlook deteriorate sharply .  Such spe culation is likely to be reflected in asset prices 
and has indeed sh own up in traders’ positions.  As shown in figure 1, the number of outstanding 
contracts , or “ open interest ,” on Eurodollar futures options with a two -year horizon that pay off 
when the th ree-month LIBOR rate falls below zero had beg un to move up around the Greek 
bailout referendum in July 2015 but surged around the BOJ’s unexpected announcement  on 
January 29 .1  Currently , the number of contracts placed on negative rates accounts for a 
nontrivial 16 percent of all outstanding Eurodollar futures put options of the same maturity.     
Figure 2 show s the implied risk -neutral probability distribution for the three- month LIBOR rate 
two years ahead.2  This so -called risk -neutral probability reflects not only the actual perceived 
odds of negative rates , but also the premiums that investors are willing to pay to insure against 
such outcomes.3  The figure show s that the distribution has shifted notably to the left since the 
beginning of the year.  As highlighted by t he red bars , current option prices embed a substantial 
risk-neutral probability of the three- month LIBOR rate being negative in two years’ time.   
 
The evolution over time of the risk-neutral probability  of negative rates  is shown in f igure 3  on 
the next page, with the red dot representing  the sum of the red bars in f igure 2.  The probability 
of negative rates was low and relatively stable throughout the second half of last year, including 
during the market turmoil last summer.  However, since the beginning of the year, th e probability 
has risen substantially amid renewed market  stress and the BOJ’s unexpected move.  The 
probability peaked  at just over 20 percent in early  February  and, although subsid ing somewhat of 
late, remains above its level at the time of the December and January FOMC meetings.  
                                                 
1 We use Eurodollar futures options because, for the two -year horizon that we consider, federal funds 
futures options are less liquid and the data on those contracts are therefore less reliable.   
2 The distribution is estimated using all outstanding Eurodollar futures options with this maturity.  
3 Although it  is difficult to quantify the size of these premiums, the premiums are likely to be negative 
because of the insurance value of these contracts.  Therefore, our risk -neutral probabilities likely overestimate 
the true probability of rates being negative at t he options’ maturity date.

 The prospect of negative short -term interest rates could also have an effect on longer- term 
yields .  First, the possibility of the policy rate turning negative in the future would lower the 
average expected  future short rate component of longer- dated yields , even when the modal 
expected policy path remain s unchanged .  Second, the potential for negative rates could also 
push down term premiums  through at least two channels:  (1) Fixed -income investors might be 
prompted to extend the duration of their assets to maintain positive yields , and (2), with 
negative rates, Treasury prices could be pushed higher than would otherwise be possible in the 
event of an adverse shock to the economy.  This potential for larger price gains  in adverse 
scenarios could make Treasury securities more attractive as hedging instruments against losses 
on other financial assets and enhance their “safe  haven” value.  These effects could in part 
explain some of the increases in implied volatilit y of longer- dated Treasury securities since 
early  February. 
Figure 4 shows results from staff analysis that explores the effect on the 10 -year zero- coupon 
nominal Treasury yield and its term premium component should the FOMC have unexpectedly 
announced  at any given time since 2008 that it would  allow the target range for the federal funds 
rate to fall to between negative 25 and negative 50 basis points .4  The blac k line shows that such 
an announcement would have pushed down yields by as much  as 25 basis point s in 2012 and 2013.  
Its current effect is estimated to be around  minus 15 basis points.  The red line shows that the 
decline in yields would  have occurred  mainly through the term premium ch annel during 
most  of the sample, with a smaller negative contribution from declines in average expected rates  
(not shown) . 
All told, market participants appear to be pricing in a nonnegligible probability of short -term 
rates turning negative in the United States  in the medium term.  This development  is likely 
putting  downward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields through the expectations 
components and, more importantly, through the term premium components of yields, which 
may help explain some of the recent decline in long er-term yields .  
                                                 
4 The analysis is based on a shadow- rate model of U.S. Treasury yields, a variant of the model discussed in 
appendix B of Marcel A. Priebsch (2013), “Computing Arbitrage -Free Yields in Multi -Factor Gaussian Shadow -Rate 
Term Struc ture Models,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013 -63 (Washington:   Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, September), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201363/ 201363pap.pdf .  For 
each date, the model -implied change in yields and term premiums resulting from a reduction in the lower bound 
to minus 37½ basis points is computed, holding the expected path of the shadow short rate fixed.  For greater 
(lesser) hypothetical reductions in the lower bound, the results will correspondingly be more (less) pronounced.

  The median dealer in the Desk’s March Su rvey of Primary Dealers judged that the 
federal funds rate could fall to as low as  negative 12½ basis points in a future lower-
bound episode.  Since the January survey, the me dian dealer’s probability estimate of an 
increase in the target federal funds range at the FOMC’s March meeting has fallen to 
5 percent, and the year-end expectations for the federal funds rate for 2016 and 2017 have 
declined 25 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively. 
Yields on medium- and long-term Treasury securities fell early in the 
intermeeting period, continuing a trend that be gan around the turn of the year.  While the 
10-year Treasury yield has recently rise n a little, it ended the period down 16 basis 
points.1  Staff models attribute roughly two-thirds  of the decline in longer-dated Treasury 
yields to lower term premiums.  Near-term uncer tainty about longer-term  interest rates, as 
measured by swaption-implied volatilities, remain ed elevated following notable spikes in 
early February, possibly reflect ing in part increased invest or speculation about negative 
rates in the United States.     
TIPS-based inflation compensation for the next five years rose 13 basis points 
over the intermeeting period, boosted by some what stronger-than-expected economic 
data releases in recent weeks.  Even so, 5-to-10-year TIPS-based inflation compensation 
is about 25 basis points below its level at the time of the December FOMC meeting.  
Measures of forward inflation compensation based on inflation swaps are about 
unchanged over the current intermeeting period.   
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS   
Although global financial conditions have improved since mid-February, they are 
still worse than at the time of the D ecember FOMC meeting.  In early January, 
developments in Chinese financial markets a nd declining oil prices ignited fears of a 
global growth slowdown, which were followed in  early February by heightened concerns 
about stresses in advanced-economy banking sectors.  Recent renminbi stability seems to 
have calmed investors, as has the reb ound in oil prices.  (See the box “Will China 
Devalue the Renminbi?”)  Although global risk assets have largely recovered from their 
                                                 
1 Since the January FOMC meeting,  the Treasury auctioned to the public $238 billion of Treasury 
nominal fixed-rate securities, $7 billion of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, and $28 billion of two-
year Floating Rate Notes.

 Will China Devalue the Renminbi? 
Although calm has returned to Chinese markets in recent weeks, many market participants 
remain focused on the possibility that the Chinese authorities will be forced to allow a sharp 
depreciation of the renminbi (RMB) not just against the dollar but against a broad range of 
currencies .  Implied volatilities and risk reversals also suggest that markets continue to 
attach a significant probability to such an outcome.  In particular, many view China’s foreign 
exchange intervention, which has been supporting the RMB at the cost of a significant loss 
of international reserves, as unsustainable in the face of accelerating capital outflows 
(figure 1).  As described below, we believe that these outflows will remain sufficiently 
contained to allow the authorities to maintain the stability of the RMB, although we 
acknowledge that this is an uncertain call.     
One key factor behind the recent pickup in capital outflows is  that the Chinese authorities 
have guided the RMB lower —first with a surprise devaluation in August and then again 
from November through early January, as can be seen in figure 2 —creating confusion about 
the authorities’ motives and raising expectations of further depreciation.   However, more 
recently , the People’
s Bank of China (PBOC) has stepped up its intervention, leading the 
RMB against the dollar, the black line in figure 2, to bottom out and then rise somewhat.  
This move was followed by PBOC communications that it saw no need for a large 
depreciation of the currency, and that while its long-term goal is to move to a managed 
float, its near-term goal is to maintain a roughly stable currency manage d with reference to 
its announced currency basket (the red line in figure 2).  Although the authorities continue 
to struggle to clearly articulate their exchange rate strategy, these actions appear to have 
helped reduce downward pressure on the currency:  Since Chinese markets reopened after 
the Lunar New Year holiday in February, the RMB has remained relatively stable against the 
PBOC’s basket .  We expect RMB stability to lessen the impetus for capital outflows, as fears 
of a sharper devaluation subside.

 Another reason to expect capital outflows to abate is that a significant share of the uptick in 
these flows reflect repayments of debt, particularly short-term bank loans, owed to 
nonresidents (see the teal bars in figure 3) .  The stock of this debt accumulated rapidly from 
2010 to early 2014 as the gradual appreciation of the RMB against the dollar fueled bets on 
further appreciation.  This dynamic reversed in mid-2014 as the RMB stopped appreciating 
against the dollar, and the reversal accelerated as the risk of depreciation increased.   Bank 
for Internat
ional Settlements (BIS) banking statistics suggest that short-term claims of 
foreign banks on Chinese residents have declined about $250 billion since mid-2014, bringing 
the stock of these claims to about $600 billion , around its mid-2013 level .    
To be sure, as shown in figure 3, other capital out flows have picked up as well .  Although 
the vast majority of China’s domestic savings are essentially locked up in the domestic 
banking system by the authorities’ vast arsenal of capital controls, a p ickup in the net errors 
and omissions component of the balance of payments, the gray bars, suggests that these 
controls are nonetheless quite leaky.   These outflows are potentially more volatile, and 
because they are more likely to occur through unregulated channels, the potential 
magnitude of such outflows is difficult to assess .   
The authorities should be able to avoid a large devaluation , however, even if private capital 
continues to flow out at a moderate pace.  China’s current account surplus ($300 billion in 
2015) provides a substantial buffer, as does its $3.2 trillion in reserves.1 Moreover, the 
authorities face strong disincentives to attempt to devalue the RMB in an effort to stanch 
the loss of reserves.  First, it would undermine a prior commitment to exchange rate 
stability , reducing Chinese authorities’ credibility and leading markets to expect further 
depreciation.  Second, bearing this in mind, markets would likely interpret such a move as a 
sign that the underlying strength of the Chinese economy is much weaker than the GDP 
data suggest.  This interpretation in turn would likely have destabilizing consequences for 
global financial markets, which, at least in the short run, would adversely affect demand for 
Chinese exports.    
In light of these considerations, while we see a sharp devaluation as a risk, our assessment 
is that a devaluation is neither warranted nor very likely, barring a pronounced deterioration 
in economic conditions.  Accordingly, our best guess is that the RMB will remain broadly 
stable against the PBOC’s currency basket  in the near term, although this means we expect 
the RMB to depreciate somewhat against the dollar.  But if the risks of a pronounced 
slowing of China’s economy, possibly turning into a hard landing, should materialize, a 
depreciation would be more likely.   As such, we will continue to closely monitor risks 
associated with the Chinese economy and their implications for both the U.S. and global 
econom ies.   
                                                 
1 These reserves are above the upper end of the International Monetary Fund ’s reserve adequacy 
range for China, which we estimate to be roughly $2.5 trillion, although it bears noting that investors often 
get nervous when reserves get near some perceived adequacy threshold.

  mid-February lows as these concerns have  eased, advanced-economy sovereign yields 
and policy expectations rema in noticeably lower.    
Global equity price indexes have been volat ile since year-end.  Equity indexes fell 
through the middle of February but subseque ntly recovered as investor sentiment 
improved.  Since the January FOMC mee ting, equity prices are up, on average, 
13 percent in the emerging market economies and as much as 8 percent in advanced 
economies.  However, most equity indexes in  advanced economies are still lower on the 
year.  Bank stocks have been especially affected, reflecting concerns about weak 
economic growth, poor asset quality, and th e effect on margins of low and negative 
policy interest rates.  Litiga tion costs and risks to investor s from enhanced bail-in rules 
have been an additional drag on the stock a nd debt prices of European banks.     
Amid low oil prices and worries about global growth, inflation compensation has 
moved lower in the euro area and particularly in Japan.  Market-based measures of policy 
expectations also declined  markedly.  U.K. and Japanese 24-month-ahead policy 
expectations have moved down about 35 basi s points since the January FOMC meeting, 
while euro-area equivalents have decreased about 8 basis points.  Some of the downward shift in policy expectations is the result of central bank actions.  The Bank of Japan 
introduced a negative deposit rate at its Ja nuary policy meeting, and Sweden’s Riksbank 
cut its repo rate in February deeper into negative territory.  Ma rket reaction to the 
negative rate moves was mixed, as investors we ighed the benefits of  additional stimulus 
against the effect on bank profitability and f ears that central banks are running out of 
tools to boost growth and inflation.  Long-te rm yields in advanced economies declined 
accordingly, with U.K. and German 10-year  yields lower by about 25 basis points over 
the intermeeting period, while the 10-year yield in Japan fell to a remarkable minus 7 basis points.    
The broad dollar index has weakened by about 2½ percent since the January 
FOMC meeting but is little changed, on net, since year-end.  Over the intermeeting period, the dollar is about 5 percent weaker against the currencies of commodity-
exporting countries and about 3 percent weaker against the advanced-economy 
currencies.  The dollar fell 5 percent against the Japanese yen, driven by flight-to-safety 
flows and the unwinding of currency carry trades, but strengthened against the pound on 
the possibility of a U.K. exit from the European Union.

  CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS  
Over the intermeeting period, the S&P 500 index rose 4 percent, and the VIX 
ended the period close to its historical me dian level.  However, since the December 
FOMC meeting, the S&P 500 has declined 5 percent and the S&P 500 bank index is 
17 percent lower.   The swings in equities appeared to reflect movements in oil prices and 
fears about a slowdown in global economic activity.     
The correlation between stock and oil prices has been strongly positive, which is 
difficult to explain.  Such a correlation is  typically associated with periods when 
movements in oil prices are driven by globa l demand.  However, recently, the correlation 
has been positive even on days with signi ficant news about the global oil supply.   
Analysts’ forecasts for year-ahead earnings across sectors were revised down 
notably over the intermeeting period.  Stoc k prices for sectors with more pronounced 
downward revisions to expected earnings dec lined relatively more than those for sectors 
with smaller revisions, suggesting that ea rnings news weighed on share prices.   
Over the intermeeting period, spreads on investment-grade corporate debt were 
little changed, while those on speculative-grade debt narrowed roughly 10 basis points.  
However, spreads on corporate bonds remain higher than at the time of the December 
FOMC meeting.    
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE  
Corporate bond issuance for investment-g rade firms was robust in January and 
February, while that for speculative-grade issu ers stayed subdued.  C&I loan growth at 
banks was also strong, mostly driven by the origination of large loans to investment-
grade borrowers.  Refinancings of institutional leveraged loans were near zero in 
February, as was equity issuance th rough initial public offerings.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial cor porations continued to show signs of 
deterioration, primarily driven by developm ents in the energy sector.  (See the box 
“Recent Developments in Speculative-Grade Corporate Debt Markets” for a somewhat 
longer perspective.)  The de fault rate on nonfinancial bonds has remained somewhat 
elevated compared with typical levels outside recession periods.  In addition, the volume 
of corporate bonds downgraded by Moody’s Invest ors Service significantly outpaced that 
of upgrades, even for investment-grade secu rities, with most of the downgrades in

 Recent Developments  in Speculative‐ Grade  Corporate  Debt Markets 
In contrast with  the relatively  stable financing  conditions  for investment ‐grade firms, conditions  
in U.S. speculative ‐grade corporate  debt markets have deteriorated  markedly  since the third 
quarter of  2015.  In the primary market,  gross issuance  of speculative‐grade  bonds and leveraged 
loans has slowed sharply over the past few months, now reaching the lowest quartile of the 
distribution  since  2005.   In the secondary  market, credit  spreads have widened notably, reaching 
the highest quartile of the distributions  since  2005.   Retail investor  appetite for risk has  continued  
to wane, with speculative‐grade  bond funds and loan mutual  funds experiencing  persistent  
outflows.   Formation  of collateralized  loan obligations,  which  typically buy speculative ‐grade 
debt, has been reduced.   While  conditions have  worsened  sharply in the energy sector, market 
participants  are reportedly  concerned  that the deterioration  in the credit fundamentals  of 
speculative‐grade  firms is becoming  more widespread.1  The following  discussion  provides a 
forward‐looking view  on fundamentals  of speculative‐grade  companies  by examining  their 
profitability,  trends in downgrades  and expected  corporate  defaults, and the ability of 
speculative‐grade  companies  to refinance  maturing  debt over the medium term.  
 
In terms of profitability,  company  filings show a sharp increase since  mid‐2014 in  the share  of U.S. 
speculative‐grade  energy  firms with  negative operating  incomes,  but only a slight increase in the 
fraction among non‐energy firms (figure 1).  Nonetheless,  earnings forecasts  by Wall Street 
analysts for speculative‐grade  non‐energy companies  in the first quarter of 2016 were revised 
down substantially  amid concerns  of a deterioration  in the global economic  outlook.  As a result, 
the ability to service debt, measured  by the interest coverage  ratio, weakened  somewhat  as 
compared  with  its previous year level (figure 2).   
Measures  of corporate  credit quality have also shown some signs of deteriorati on, with  modest 
but notable  declines even  outside the energy sector.  The dollar  volume of speculative‐grade  
nonfinancial  corporate  debt that was downgraded  by Moody’s Investors  Service has outpaced  
the volume of upgrades  since mid‐2015,  and in February  it reached its fastest monthly pace since 
2001.   Although  downgrades  continue to be concentrated  in the energy sector,  other industries   
 
  
 
  
                                                 
1 As of year‐end, the energy sector accounts  for about 5 percent of the leveraged  loan market and 18 percent 
of the high‐yield bond market.

 showed some weakness as  well.  The  number of companies  added this year to the  Moody’s  list of 
corporates  rated B3 or lower with  a negative  outlook (a signal of higher risk of default) has  
increased  to a six‐year high.   Apart from  the significant  number of energy firms  on the list, there 
are firms in other industries,  including  services as well as consumer  and media (figure 3).  
The large number of recent downgrades  is consistent  with expectations  of increasing  corporate 
defaults over the  next 12 to 24 months.  Indeed, aggregate expected  year‐ ahead default rates for 
U.S. nonfinancial  firms based on the Moody’s  KMV mod el increased  to over 1  percent,  about 
double the level that prevailed  a year ago.  For speculative ‐grade firms, the staff’s estimates  also 
suggest a pickup in expected  year‐ ahead defaults, consistent  with  market participants’  
perceptions  that expected  default rates over the  next 12 to 24 months could range from 3 to 
6 percent.2  Even though  expectations  of defaults are highly concentrated  in the energy sector, 
the staff’s estimates  indicate a slight increase in  expected  defaults among non‐energy firms, 
pointing to more widespread  vulnerabilities.  
As a result of recent developments  in speculative ‐grade debt markets, market participants  have 
expressed concerns  about the amount of speculative ‐grade debt that will be maturing  in coming 
years and the ability of such issuers  to roll over  their debt.  Indeed, the  staff estimates  that about 
$1 trillion of debt issued by nonfinancial  speculative ‐grade firms (composed  of both leveraged 
loans and speculative ‐grade bonds) will mature  between 2017  and 2020 (figure 4).     
All told, should credit quality continue  to deteriorate,  speculative ‐grade companies  in the energy 
sector may face challenges  in accessing  debt markets going forward.   Conditions  for non‐energy 
firms are not as dire, but tighter  financial conditions  may result in increased  debt burdens and 
thus higher defaults, with potentially  negative  implications  for the  broader economy.  
 
                                                 
2 The staff’s survey of the research from eight firms (S&P, four dealers, and three buy‐side firms)  shows  that 
all eight  expected  an increase in default rates for speculative‐ grade firms from the previous year level, citing 
persistently  low oil prices, the amount of leverage among some of these  firms,  the beginning  of tighter Fed 
monetary  policy, and slowing global economic  growth.

  February accounted for by energy firms.  Banks  increased their loan  loss reserves in 
recent months and reported doing so primarily for C&I loans to borrowers in the oil and 
gas industry. 
On balance, credit conditions in the broader municipal bond market remained 
stable despite Puerto Rico’s ongoing fiscal crisis.  After de faulting on a small fraction of 
payments in January, Puerto Rico met all of its February debt payments.  However, the 
near-term default outlook for the commonweal th is still uncertain, and Puerto Rico 
continues to look for a viable debt-restructuring agreement.  
Financing conditions in CRE tightened somewhat over the intermeeting period 
but remain accommodative.  Spreads on CMBS continued to widen despite the narrowing 
of spreads in broader bond markets.  Repor tedly in response, CMBS issuance was down 
somewhat over the first two months of the year.  However, CRE loans on banks’ balance 
sheets continued to increase at a robust pace through February.     
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE  
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets generally remained 
accommodative, with outstanding student and auto debt continuing to grow at robust 
paces in January. 
Mortgage rates declined, on net, ove r the intermeeting period and are down 
notably since the December FOMC meeting, w ith interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages currently standing at 3.5 percent.  However, lending conditions in residential 
real estate markets we re little changed.  
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS AND MONEY   
Overall, bank credit continued to increas e moderately in January and February.  
Spreads on credit default swaps for banks were about unchanged, on net, over the 
intermeeting period and remain wider than at the time of the December FOMC meeting.  
Concerns over banks’ future net intere st margins, a deterioration in global 
macroeconomic conditions, and banks’ exposure to the energy sector were reportedly the 
main drivers behind the downbeat sentiment.     
In line with historical norms, interest rates on banks’ retail deposits remained 
about flat in the wake of the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  Even

  so, deposit volumes on banks’ books have been little changed, and MMFs have 
experienced only small net inflows since the December FOMC meeting.  
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS  
Over the intermeeting period, short-term rates were generally stable, and the 
effective federal funds rate traded within the target range.2  Triparty repo rates remained 
above the ON RRP rate throughout the inte rmeeting period.  In addition, triparty 
Treasury repo volumes increased, apparently reflecting foreign centr al bank selling of 
Treasury securities as well as higher bill i ssuance by the Treasury.  Daily take-up of 
ON RRPs declined markedly since the y ear-end, dropping at times to less than 
$40 billion.3  The foreign RP pool increased, which was largely attributed to portfolio 
rebalancing by a small numb er of central banks.  
The Desk reinvested $37 billion of matu ring Treasury securities in February, in 
contrast to previous months, when matu ring Treasury securities were roughly zero.4  The 
Desk purchased $24 billion of 15- and 30-y ear MBS under the reinvestment program and 
rolled $0.5 billion in expected  settlements over the intermeeting period.  The ratio of 
monthly settlements for these reinvestment  operations to gross issuance of MBS was 
roughly unchanged in January at about 32 percent.  
                                                 
2 The effective federal funds rate has averaged 37 basis points since January 4, with low intraday 
volatility except for significant declines on month-ends.  On March 2, the data source for calculating the 
effective federal funds rate moved from using aggregated data provided by federal funds brokers to using individual federal funds transactions reported by depos itory institutions in the Report of Selected Money 
Market Rates (FR 2420).  The effective federal funds rate is now calculated as a volume-weighted median 
rate, as opposed to the previous volume-weighted average rate. 
3 On February 18, the Federal Reserve conducted a test Term Deposit Facility operation as part of 
routine quarterly testing of the facility that offered seve n-day deposits at a rate of 1 basis point over IOER, 
with a maximum counterparty cap of $5 billion.  Take-u p totaled $63.9 billion, w ith 40 banks participating 
and eight maximum bids. 
4 On February 23, the Desk conducted a test outright coupon purchase of $226 million in Treasury 
securities, the first outright purchases since the end of the purchase program in October 2014.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  We have also maintained our assumption that the risks 
to our GDP projection are tilted to the downside in part because we view neither monetary nor fiscal policy as well positioned to offset large a dverse shocks.  In addition, 
while there has been some improvement in global financial conditions during the past few weeks, downside risks emanating from abroad remain  substantial ; global financial 
risks could presumably flare  up again as quickly as they recently receded.  We view the 
risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to the upside. 
With regard to inflation, we see considerable uncertainty around our projection, 
but we do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, we continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.  Market -based measures of inflation compensation  remain very low , and some survey-
based measures of long er-term inflation expectations  have edged down further in recent 
months.  In addition, the realization of the downside risks to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.   The f irst two 
scenarios consider the possibility of a global recession but differ in the degree of effectiveness of the countervailing monetary policy actions taken by foreign central 
banks.  In the third scenario, domestic aggregate demand is persistently weaker than in the baseline, consistent with a substantially lower long- run equilibrium real interest rate .  
To illustrate the heightened risks of returning to the effective lower bound in a low interest  rate environment, the fourth scenario adds a pronounced near- term slowdown on 
top of the longer- term malaise of the third scenario .  In contrast, in the last scenario, 
recent strong job gains and upbeat consumer confidence signal that economic activity is

 stronger than in the baseline; in addition, inflation is more sensitive to tighter resource 
utilization.  
We generate the first and second  scenarios using the multicoun try SIGMA model. 
The next two scenarios are generated using the FRB/US model, and the final scenario 
uses the Board staff’s EDO model.1  In each of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is 
governed—as in the baseline forecast —by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2  
In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.  
Global Recession 
Notwithstanding some improvement in global financial conditions during the past 
month, the financial turbulence earlier this year and somewhat disappointing data abroad have heightened concerns about a global recession.  In this scenario, the foreign econo mies experience a sharp tightening of financial conditions and fall in confidence 
that would depress their GDP more than 5 percent below baseline in the absence of 
additional foreign monetary stimulus.  However, this scenario assumes that foreign 
central b anks take aggressive actions that are effective in depressing bond yields 
significantly and in supporting domestic demand.  This stimulus to domestic demand in foreign economies and to their net exports from a modest depreciation of their currencies mitiga tes the contraction in foreign GDP so that foreign output falls only about 3 percent  
below baseline.  The foreign shocks are assumed to have modest financial spillovers to 
the United States, with U.S. corporate bond spreads rising about 50 basis points. 
Weaker external demand, an appreciation of the broad real dollar of about 
4 percent, and some tightening of U.S. financial conditions cause U.S. rea l GDP to 
expand by only around 1½ percent in 2016 and 2017, ¾ percentage point lower than in 
the baseline, whi le the unemployment rate remain s close to 5 percent through 2018.  The 
                                                 
1 The confidence intervals in the exhibit titled “Forecast Confidence Intervals and Alternative 
Scenarios” are based on a new procedure for stochastic simulations.  The procedure uses a version of the 
FRB/US model that, with the exception of the effective l ower bound on interest rates, is linear.  The new 
procedure eliminates certain undesirable asymmetries in the confidence intervals, notably the downward skew around the projection for the unemployment rate.  The new procedure also affects the exhibits 
“Selected Tealbook Projections and 70 Percent Confidence Intervals” and “Assessment of Key 
Macroeconomic Risks.” 
2 For the scenarios run in SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US and 
EDO simulations.  One key difference relative to the FR B/US and EDO simulations is that the policy rule 
in SIGMA uses a measure of slack equal to the difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

 combination of dollar appreciation and greater resource slack pushes down core PCE 
inflation to around 1¼ percent in 2017.  The federal funds rate rises more gradually than 
in the baseline.  
Less Effective Foreign Monetary Policy  
Monetary policy in the foreign economies may well be less effective in providing 
support for domestic demand than in our previous scenario.  This reduced effectiveness may reflect that pass -through to private yields is very low, or, alternatively, that even if 
these actions succeed in reducing private yields, households and firms might not respond by increasing  their spending and investment.  In this scenario, we examine the effects of a 
global recession that is  similar to that in the previous scenario, but we assume that any 
given monetary policy action by AFE central banks is less effective in providing support for domestic demand.  Accordingly, although our scenario has AFE central banks taking even more aggressive policy actions to push down interest rates, most of the boost to GDP comes through exchange rate depreciation and expenditure-switching effects toward their exports.  In addition, we assume that EME central banks face capital flow and exchange rate p ressures that limit their ability to ease policy rates by as much as in the 
previous scenario.  All told, foreign GDP falls to more than 5 percent below baseline in our scenario, and the broad real dollar appreciates by almost 9  percent.  
In this environment, U.S. real GDP growth falls to around 1 percent in 2017 in 
response to much weaker global economic activity and a strong appreciation of the dollar.  
The unemployment rate climbs to around 5¼ percent in  2017, nearly 1 percentage point 
higher than in the baseline.  Core PCE inflation declines to ¾ percent in 2017, reflecting 
both dollar appreciation and lower resource utilization.  The federal funds rate follows a much shallower path than in the baseline forecast, hovering around 1 percent through early 20 18. 
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate 
Aggregate demand has been weak during the recent recovery, reflecting both 
domestic and global factors.  In the baseline, these factors are expected to dissipate, causing  the equilibrium real federal funds rate to rise over time.  However, some 
observers have argued that the factors depress ing demand are essentially permanent.  
Accordingly, this scenario assumes persistently weaker domestic aggregate demand over the next decade than in the baseline, consistent with a long-run equilibrium real federal

 funds rate of 0 percent .3  We assume that policymakers immediately recognize the lower 
trajectory of the equilibrium interest rate . 
In the longer run, there is enough room between the baseline path for the federal 
funds rate and the effective lower bound that  monetary policy can fully accommodate the 
fall in the equilibrium real federal funds rate .  By 2020, the federal funds rate is almost 
1½ percentage points lower than in the baseline and the unemployment rate has returned 
to baseline.  
  In the short run, however, the federal funds rate does not fall enough to fully 
offset the weaker aggregate demand  because of the inertial component of the policy rule.  
As a result, output expands more slowly, and the path for the unemployment rate is slightly higher than in the baseline.  Real GDP growth through 2016 and 2017 is ¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline projection; the unemployment rate is ¼ percenta ge point higher in 2017 and 2018.  With resource utilization  only slightly 
weaker , inflation remains close to the baseline.   
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate with Near-Term 
Downturn 
As many commentators  have pointed out, with a lower long- run value of the 
federal funds rate (such as the value that prevails in the previous scenario), the effective 
lower bound may become binding more often .  To illustrate this risk, in this scenario we 
layer a near -term slowdown of economic activity on top of the persistent demand 
weakness that was featured in the previous scenario.   
In particular , we assume that investment spending weakens significantly, whi ch in 
turn reduces hiring.  Weaker employment and incomes gradually depress household 
spending relative to the baseline, further reducing aggregate demand.  As in the previous scenario, policymakers recognize the lower long-run equilibrium federal funds ra te and 
take it into account, but they otherwise continue to follow the prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) interest rate rule . 
                                                 
3 This very low level of the long -run equilibrium real federal funds rate is consistent with the 
estimates in Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest 
Redux,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series  2016- 011 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, February),  http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.011 .

 Real GDP declines for three consecutive quarters starting in the second half 
of 2016.  The unemployment rate rises above 5½ percent before a gradual recovery 
begins.  The path for inflation is lower than in the baseline projection, with core PCE 
inflation still below 2 percent in 2020.  Given this weaker outlook and the lower long-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate, the federal funds  rate is substantially below 
baseline and becomes constrained by the effective lower bound in late 2017.
4  Had the 
long-run equilibrium federal funds rate remained at its baseline level, this near -term 
slowdown in activity would not have brought the federal funds rate to the effective lower  bound. 
As in our other alternative scenario s, we assume that the behavior of monetary 
policy is determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) interest rate rule  and that t he size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.  However, additional 
asset purchases, forward guidance, or other unconventional tools could be deployed to 
mitigate the adverse effects outlined in this scenario. 
Faster Growth with Higher Inflation 
Although some indicators of production have recently been weak, real PCE and 
the labor market have posted solid gains.  Moreover, consumer confidence has remained 
reasonably upbeat in recent months, and low prices of gasoline and other forms of energy have provided a boost to real incomes, which may aug ur larger  gains in consumption in 
the near future.  Accordingly, in this scenario, we assume faster consumer spending 
growth that, in turn, spurs production and higher business investment.  In addition, we 
assume that inflation is more sensitive to resource slack than in the standard version of the EDO model.  This greater sensitivity is consistent with the estimates of some other  
DSGE models.
5  It is also consistent with the view that the Phillips curve is steeper at 
higher rates of resource utilization than when economic activity is relatively weak.6 
Real GDP rises 3½ percent in 2016, compared with 2¼ percent in the baseline 
projection.  The unemployme nt rate falls rapidly, bottoming out at 4  percent by mid -
                                                 
4 The federal funds rate does not hit the effective lower bound until the second half of 2017 d espite 
a contraction in activity starting in mid -2016 as a mechanical result of inertia in the interest rate rule.

 2017; it edges up after 2018 but remains  lower than in the baseline.  With resource 
utilization running tighter and the Phillips curve assumed to be steeper than in the 
standard version of the model, inflation is higher than in the baseline, rising above 2¼ percent.
7  The federal funds rate exceeds  4 percent at the end of 2018 and reach es 
almost 5 percent in 2020.  Given enough time, this path for the federal funds rate would eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natural rate and bring inflation back down to 2 percent .  Unemployment does not need to exceed the natural rate in order 
to bring inflation back down—simply returning to the natural rate is enough —because 
inflation expectations remain anchored throughout the scenario. 
 
                                                 
7 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs fo r 
wages and prices in this scenario; the smaller costs lead to a steeper Phillips curve.  Had we used our 
standard coefficients in the wage and price equations, inflation would have peaked at only about 2 percent.

Note: “Staff” represents stochastic simulations in FRB/US around the staff baseline; baselines for FRB/US, BV AR, EDO, and
the factor model are generated by those models themselves, up to the current-quarter estimate. Data for the current quarter are
taken from the staff estimate for the second Tealbook in each quarter; if the second Tealbook for the current quarter has not yet
been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.
1The computation of the recession probability from the factor model has been adjusted in the March Tealbook, and the new
procedure will be used in future Tealbooks. The “Previous Tealbook” value reports the probability consistent with the current
algorithm, given data as of the January 2016 Tealbook.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the t
wo inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
