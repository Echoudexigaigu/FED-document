Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information we received during the intermeeting period abou t aggregate 
spending and production has been di sappointing, with the discouraging news coming 
from most spending categories.  We now estimate that real GDP e dged up at an annual 
rate of only ½ percent in the f irst quarter, compared with 2 percent in the March 
Tealbook.  In contrast, incoming la bor market data have remaine d solid, suggesting that 
the labor market has continued t o improve at a pace roughly in line with our previous 
forecast. 
As in the two preceding years when we confronted a similar conf luence of data, 
we judge that some of the weakne ss in the spending indicators r eflects influences, such as 
residual seasonality, that will  be reversed in subsequent quarters as well as observation 
error.  Accordingly, we made a downward adjustment to our estim ate of potential output 
in 2016 to reduce the effect of the weak spending data on our e stimate of the output gap.  
Nevertheless, we took some nega tive signal from the incoming data and now view the 
current cyclical position of the economy as slightly weaker than we thought in the March 
Tealbook forecast.  In the current  quarter, we expect real GDP growth to pick up to a 
2¼ percent pace, similar to our previous forecast. 
Beyond the near term, real GDP is  projected to rise at an avera ge annual rate of 
2¼ percent through 2018.  This forecast  for GDP growth is a lit tle stronger than in the 
March Tealbook projection primarily because the paths for inter est rates, equity prices, 
and the dollar are more supportive.  At the end of 2018, real GDP is expected to be about 
1½ percent above our estimate of its potential and the unemployment rate is expected to 
be 4.2 percent, 0.1 percentage point b elow the March Tealbook f orecast and 
¾ percentage point below our estim ate for its natural rate.   
Our forecast for PCE price inflation over the first half of thi s year is the same as 
in the previous Tealbook, as re cent news on inflation appears consistent with our view 
that the January reading on core PCE inflation was transitorily  high.  We project that total 
PCE price inflation will be a bout 1 percent this  year and will move up to 1.8 percent in 
2018, as energy and import prices beg in to rise moderately late r this year and as resource 
utilization tightens further i n an environment of reasonably st able long-run inflation 
expectations.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is slightly lower than the median 
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) in 2016 but in line with 
the Blue Chip consensus forecasts in 2016 and 2017. The staff’s forecast for 
unemployment is a little higher than the others in 2016 and the same in 2017. Its 
inflation projections are a little lower, on balance.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 We continue to use an inertial ve rsion of the Taylor (1999) policy rule to set 
the federal funds rate in the projection.1  A mechanical implementation of this 
rule calls for the federal funds r ate to rise about 1 percentag e point per year 
over the forecast period and to a verage 3.3 percent in the four th quarter of 
2018.2  This level is slightly higher than in the March Tealbook, lar gely 
reflecting tighter resource uti lization in this projection.  
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current size 
until the fourth quarter of 2016 a nd then begin to contract as the proceeds 
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates 
 Compared with the March Tealboo k, we have revised down somewhat  the 
entire projected path of the 10-ye ar Treasury yield.  This revision mostly 
reflects our assessment that the demand for holding U.S. Treasu ry securities 
and risks to the global growth outlook will keep term premiums well below 
historical norms for longer th an we had previously thought.  Th e 25 basis 
point downward revision from this reassessment is partly offset  by the higher 
projected path of future short-term interest rates.  Neverthele ss, our projection 
continues to call for the 10-y ear Treasury yield to rise signif icantly over the 
medium term, mostly reflecting the movement of the 10-year valu ation 
window through the period of extreme ly low short-term interest rates.   
1 In the near term, the federal funds rate revised down a bit re lative to the previous projection, as 
the realized federal  funds rate in the fi rst quarter of 2016 wa s lower than the value prescribed by the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule.  To help smooth the transition from one qua rter to the next, we have modified our 
procedure so that we now project  the federal funds rate in the current quarter using the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule only for the remaining days of the quarter; for the period preceding the close of the forecast, we 
use actual market quotes. 
2 In light of the fact that the ba seline path for the federal fu nds rate is somewhat above the median 
projection from the most recent SE P, we are contemplating wheth er to modify our assumed policy rule for 
the June Tealbook.  In addition, to illustrate the sensitivity of the staff projection to  changes in the federal 
funds rate, we conducted a simulation using the FRB/US model under the assumption that the federal funds 
rate remains flat through the end  of 2016 and then reverts to t he baseline rule starting in 2017:Q1.  In this 
scenario, the level of real GDP i s 0.1 percent higher than in t he baseline by the end of 2017, the 
unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point lower, and core infla tion is 4 basis points higher; the federal 
funds rate remains lower, by nearly 40 basis points.

 We revised down the paths for th e 10-year triple-B corporate bo nd rate and 
the 30-year mortgage rate about i n line with the revision to Tr easury yields.  
The spread of rates on 10-year  triple-B corporate bonds over th ose on 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities, currently at elevated levels, is 
forecast to narrow slowly and end the projection period somewhat above its 
historical median level.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have increased 6¼ pe rcent since the time of the M arch 
Tealbook, but as the outlook for c orporate earnings remains dow nbeat, we 
have not passed through all of the recent upward movement in eq uity prices 
into the forecast.  Thus, the projected path for equity prices is only modestly 
higher than in the March Teal book, with stock prices projected to rise about 
2¾ percent per year  on average through 2018. 
 We expect house prices to ris e about 4 percent in 2016 and abou t 2¾ percent 
per year in 2017 and 2018.  We have r evised up our expectations  for the path 
of house prices relative to the March Tealbook, largely in resp onse to strong 
incoming data.  House prices curre ntly appear slightly overvalu ed compared 
to rents, with one measure we tr ack suggesting th at house price s are 
overvalued by about 6 percent (com pared with more than 40 perce nt prior to 
the housing bust).  Our forecast has house prices rising slight ly slower than 
rents over the medium term, whi ch gradually reduces this overva luation.  
Fiscal Policy 
 Our fiscal policy assumptions are unrevised in this forecast. We continue to 
anticipate that the federal budge t legislation that was passed at the end of last 
year, combined with ongoing modest growth in state and local pu rchases, will 
provide a boost of just over ½ pe rcentage point to real GDP gro wth this year 
and make smaller contributions in 2017 and 2018. 
Foreign Economic Acti vity and the Dollar 
 The broad nominal dollar has de preciated almos t 3 percent, on n et, since the 
time of the March Tealbook, prim arily on expectations of more 
accommodative monetary policy in the United States.  We expect the nominal 
dollar to edge up about 1 percent  over the remainder of this ye ar and then to

rise a total of 2¼ percent over th e following two years, lifted by monetary 
policy divergence between the U nited States and abroad.  Our pr ojection for 
the level of the broad real dolla r averages about 3 percent low er than in the 
March Tealbook. 
 We estimate that foreign real GDP grew at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the 
first quarter, ¼ percentage point stronger than in the March Te albook and 
above the 1¾ percent pace of both the fourth quarter and 2015 a s a whole.  
This step-up was largely driven by a rebound in Canadian activi ty, although 
growth in emerging Asia (excluding  China) and the euro area als o improved 
on the back of stronger domestic  demand.  As expected, economic  growth in 
China slowed in the first quart er, although we project that gro wth will pick up 
in the remainder of the year , supported by further policy stimu lus.  Overall, 
we see the pace of growth abroad edging up to 2¾ percent by the end of 2016 
and then staying at about th at rate through 2018, supported by accommodative 
monetary policies and the depreciation of f oreign currencies re lative to the 
dollar over the past two years.  
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices  
 The spot price of Brent crude oil closed at $44 per barrel on A pril 19, 
$4 above its level at the time  of the previous Tealbook.  Altho ugh the spot 
price was volatile over the period, further-dated futures quote s were 
unchanged relative to those in t he March Tealbook.  Overall, oi l supply 
continues to exceed oil demand, a nd global inventories are anti cipated to 
continue to accumulate in the near term.  Thereafter, we expect  the supply 
imbalance to close.  We therefor e expect the price of imported oil to increase 
only slightly, from $39 per barrel  in the current quarter to $4 3 per barrel by 
the end of 2018. 
 Other commodity prices were mixe d.  Metals prices are little ch anged on 
balance since the time of the previous Tealbook, remaining somewhat above 
their trough in early 2016.  Agr icultural prices moved up on av erage, with 
soybean prices boosted in part by stronger foreign demand.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The incoming data on spending and production in the first quart er were 
substantially weaker than we had expected, leading us to mark d own our estimate of real 
GDP growth last quarter to ½ percent at an annual rate—1½ perce ntage points less than 
in the March Tealbook.3  The downward revision was br oad based across spending 
categories, although weaker cons umer spending accounted for mor e than half of the 
revision.4  When considering our forecast for the current quarter, we dis counted much of 
this disappointing news because of the inherent variability in the quarterly GDP data and 
because it seems at odds with the ongoing improvement in the la bor market, solid 
measures of consumer sentiment, and the recent improvement in m any forward-looking 
indicators of business invest ment and production.  Nonetheless,  we marked down our 
projection for growth in private  domestic final purchases a little, although the effect on 
GDP growth was more than offset by an upward revision from the contributions of net 
exports and inventory investmen t.  All told, we expect real GDP to rise 2¼ percent in the 
second quarter, a little higher than in the March Tealbook. 
 Real PCE growth appears to have slowed from an annual rate of 2 ½ percent in 
the fourth quarter to 1¾ percen t in the first quarter, in contr ast with the slight 
step-up in growth we projecte d in the March Tealbook.  However,  given 
recent gains in household incomes  and wealth, still-favorable readings on 
consumer sentiment, and earlier  declines in energy prices, we e xpect real PCE 
growth to move up to a 3 percent pa ce in the current quarter, the same as in 
our March Tealbook forecast.  (Se e the box “Energy Prices and C onsumer 
Spending” for a related discussion.)   
3 This depressed GDP growth in the first quarter continues the p attern observed in 2014 and 2015.  
Although it is difficult to judge with any precision how much o f this repeated weakness is due to 
incomplete seasonal adjustment, t he staff estimates that residu al seasonality, which primarily affects data 
for net exports and for state an d local government construction spending, subtracted about ½ percentage 
point from first-quarter GDP growth in 2016.  Outside estimates  of residual seasonality in the first quarter 
span a fairly wide range, from essentially zero to a subtractio n of more than 1½ percentage points.  The 
BEA’s initial estimate of GDP for  the first quarter will be rel eased the day after the FOMC meeting ends. 
4 As displayed in the table “Fede ral Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q1 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projecti ons generated by the near-term forecastin g approaches used within the System, at 
0.8 percent, is about 1 percentage point lower than at the time  of the March Teal book; the staff’s 
judgmental forecast is well within  the range of nowcasts, which run from negative 0.5 percent to 
1.9 percent.

Energy Prices and Consumer Spending 
The drop in gasoline prices by nearly half since June 2014 resulted in households saving an 
estimated $120 billion on gasoline expenditures over this period, or nearly $1,000 per household 
on average. In addition, the decline in oil prices has likely led to slightly lower prices of non
energy goods, further boosting purchasing power. Traditional macroeconomic analyses 
suggest that these savings should have generated a material boost to real consumer spending. 
For example, using the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) out of income from one of the 
staff’s benchmark PCE models, this windfall gain implies a ¼ percentage point boost to real PCE 
growth in 2015 and a similar contribution to growth this year. 
Falling gasoline prices also appear to boost consumer sentiment, although the magnitude of the 
effect may depend on households’ perceptions about the permanence of the decline.1 
Expectations that a price decline is persistent could amplify its near term effects as some 
households react immediately to anticipated future savings on gasoline. Indeed, we estimate 
that much of the step up in sentiment in the Michigan survey since mid2014 was due to falling 
gasoline prices, and that this sentiment channel contri buted positively to PCE growth in 2015. 
Combining the income and sentiment channels, we estimate that the direct effect of the decline 
in energy prices since mid2014 (excluding the multiplier) added ½ percentage point to real PCE 
growth in 2015 and will contribute an additional ¼ percentage point to growth in 2016.2 
Although these estimates are on the low end of the estimates in the time series literature, those 
studies are primarily informed by only a handful of large historical fluctuations in oil prices.3 
Moreover, recent spending data have appeared weak relative to fundamentals, raising the 
question as to whether even our estimates of the energy price effects might be too large.

2 Low energy prices may boost profits for firms that use energy and cut profits for energy producing firms, 
affecting employment, dividend income, and wealth. We believe the net consumption response from these 
channels is small.

 To help shed light on how  energy prices have affected  aggregate consumption,  the following  
figures contrast  the actual evolution  of real PCE and the saving rate since mid‐ 2014 (the solid 
black lines) with two hypothetical  scenarios  based on a staff model of  PCE growth.  One 
scenario (the red dotted line) shows a hypothetical  path of real PCE assuming  households  saved 
all of the windfall from both lower energy  prices and their pass‐through to core PCE prices.  The 
other scenario  (the dashed blue line) shows  the trajectory  of spending  based on our estimate  of 
the effect of falling energy prices  on consumption  from the table on the previous  page.  
Based on these scenarios, the  spending  data since mid‐ 2014 might suggest that the drop in 
energy prices  boosted household  spending  by less than  we had estimated.   However,  PCE 
growth is somewhat  volatile and subject to revision,  and a larger spending  response  may have 
been obscure d by other factors.4  In fact, studies using microdata,  such as a widely cited analysis 
of household ‐level credit  card transaction  data by the JPMorgan  Chase Institute,  conclude  that 
individuals  may have spent a much larger portion of  the windfall income, at least initially.5 
Taken together,  the macro and micro evidence  suggest that households did spend  out of the 
windfall savings from falling energy prices.  Thus,  the fact that the saving rate has stepped up 
since energy prices  began  to fall and  consumer  spending  remains well below  the level implied  
by fundamentals  suggest that factors not well captured  in our models—such as  precautionary  
savings—may  be holding down spending.   We expect these precautionary  motives to ease over 
the medium term in response  to continued  improvements  in the labor market.  However,  as we 
think that most of the spending  gains from falling energy prices  have been realized  already, we 
expect only a modest additional  boost in 2016 from this channel.

4 Beyond the general point  that data are measured  with error, there is also  a specific measurement 
problem associated  with how the BEA’s  methodology  maps sales at retailers such as Costco into spending  
categories  that exclude gasoline.  Because  many of these  retailers  also  sell gasoline,  their nominal sales are 
depressed  when gasoline  prices fall, leading BEA’s  estimate of non‐gasoline  retail sales to be biased downward.   
We estimate this error  cumulates  to ¼ percentage  point on the level of PCE since  June 2014.

 Incoming data on housing activity are consistent with continued  gains in 
residential construction.  We pr oject that real residential investment spending 
will increase at an annual rate  of 7½ percent in the first half of this year, a 
touch slower than in the previous Tealbook.   
 We estimate that total business fixed investment fell at a 3¾ p ercent pace in 
the first quarter—2½ percentage po ints more than in the March T ealbook 
forecast—as data now suggest that spending on transportation an d other 
equipment contracted and outlays  for drilling and mining struct ures plunged.  
In the current quarter, we exp ect that spending on equipment an d intangibles 
will rise modestly—a view supported by recent improvements in f orward-
looking indicators of business spending—but that drilling and m ining 
investment will fall further. 
 We continue to expect that a mil d correction in in ventory investment will 
subtract ¼ percentage point from  GDP growth over the first half  of this year, 
though with the drag more concen trated in the first quarter.  S pecifically, the 
data now suggest that inventory investment subtracted ½ percent age point 
from real GDP growth in the first  quarter, but we expect it to be a nearly 
neutral influence on GDP growth in the second quarter.  
 Net exports are estimated to ha ve held down real GDP growth nea rly 
¾ percentage point in the first  quarter as the strong run-up in  the dollar from 
the middle of 2014 through the end of last year continued to weigh on exports.  
In the current quarter, we expect  the drag from net exports to diminish to 
about ½ percentage point, as expor ts begin increasing again—alb eit only at a 
tepid 1½ percent rate—and import growth continues at about a 4 percent pace.  
Although we continue to project ne t exports will subtract from GDP growth 
over the forecast period, the lo wer path of the dollar relative to the March 
Tealbook has led us to lessen t he expected drag a touch.       
 Industrial production decreased in the first quarter, as utilit ies and mining 
output fell and manufacturi ng output was little changed.  Looki ng forward, the 
weakness in the energy sector w ill likely continue to weigh con siderably on 
the industrial sector.  Neverthel ess, we expect industrial prod uction to rise 
over the next few months, as manufacturing output picks up—cons istent with 
the recent improvement in both the  national and regional new or ders

indexes—and as utilities output rebounds with a return of temperatures to 
more seasonable norms. 
Beyond the near term, real GDP is expected to expand faster than its potential, 
supported by a still-accommodative stance of monetary policy an d by mildly 
expansionary fiscal policy.  Noneth eless, real GDP growth slows  over the medium 
term—from 2¾ percent in the s econd half of 2016 to 2½ percent i n 2017 and 2 percent in 
2018—as waning monetary policy accommodation and fading fiscal impetus outweigh a 
lessening drag from the effects  of past dollar appreciation.   
 The level of real GDP at the end of the forecast is slightly hi gher than in the 
previous Tealbook, reflecting s everal partially offsetting fact ors.  We expect 
only a little of the recent softness in the spending data to be  made up this year, 
leading us to revise down GDP growth in 2016.  However, as desc ribed 
earlier, we revised down our forecast for the term premiums in Treasury 
yields, lowering our pro jection for long-term interest rates and providing a 
boost to GDP growth throughout the forecast.5  In addition, the lower dollar 
and higher equity prices in this projection also support somewh at stronger 
growth in 2016 and 2017.   
 The box “Tealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2015” rev iews the 
recent errors in the staff’s forecasts for GDP, unemployment, a nd inflation. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
The March employment report was broadly in line with our projection and 
indicated that the labor market  has continued to strengthen. 
 For the first quarter as a whol e, nonfarm payroll employment av eraged about 
210,000 per month, the same as in our M arch forecast.  We continue to project 
job gains of about 200,000 per mont h in the current quarter.   
5 We allowed this revision to the term premium to affect our for ecast for real activity following 
our usual rules of thumb for int erest rate effects.  We conside red the possibility that the lower term 
premium was driven by factors th at had not already been incorpo rated into the projection, in which case 
accounting for these factors woul d have offset some or all of t he boost from the lower interest rates. In the 
end, however, we thought it more likely that the factors drivin g the lower term premium, including 
increased risk to the global growth outlook, had already been b uilt into the projection.

 Tealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2015  
As was the case in 2013 and 2014 , the most recent estimate of real GDP growth in  
2015 is close to prior staff forecasts, but the unemployment rate i s lower than the 
staff expected .  Price inflation in 201 5 is in line with staff forecasts made last spring 
but well below forecasts from the previous year.  Here we p resent and discuss these 
recent forecast errors.  
The gray bars in the left panel of figure 1 show the currently published Q4/Q4 percent 
changes in real GDP from 2012 to 2015; the blue squares show the forecasts for GDP 
growth made in the April Tealbook one year prior, and the green triangles show  the 
forecast from the April Tealbook  in the contemporaneous year.   The whisker bands 
around the squares and triangles demarcate 70 percent forecast -error bands, with 
unusually large forecast errors represented by cases where the top of a gray bar falls 
outside one of the whisker band s.  Because the bars themselves represent the latest 
revised data , the red dots show the Bureau of E conomic Analysis  (BEA) estimate of 
GDP growth for each year from mid -April of the subsequent  year (known as the third 
estimates), along with 70 percent bands computed from  past revisions.   
Staff errors in forecasting 2015 real GDP growth do  not appear particularly large 
compared with past staff forecast errors .  Moreover, the red whisker bands show that  
the current  BEA estim ates are prone to sizable revision s, making discussion of these 
forecast errors  tentative.  Having said  that , the prior- year forecast appears to have 
been too high because of a greater- than -expected drag from net exports , likely 
associated with  the surprisingly  large appreciation of the dollar exchange rate.  L ower -
than -expected investment and personal consumption expenditures  appear to have 
contributed to the forecast error as well.  Current estimates of real disposable personal 
income are close to the year-ahead projections ; consequently , the  BEA’s current 
estimate of the saving rate is higher than the staff  anticipated.

 As in earlier years, lower- than -expected GDP growth in 2015 was not accompanied by  a 
weaker- than -expected labor market.  As t he right panel of figure 1 shows , the staff 
forecast s of the unemployment rate in 2015 :Q4 were too high , continuing the pattern  
of one- sided errors  in forecasts made since August 2011.   However, t he misses for 2015 
were somewhat  smaller than the unusually large misses observed for the previous t wo 
years.  In addition, the prior -year forecast of monthly payroll employment g ains in  2015  
was very close to the published figure of 229,000 ( which  is still subject to revision) .1    
Figure 2 shows the same information  for total and core PC E price inflation .  Despite the 
downside surprises to the unemployment rate, t he current -year forecasts (the green 
triangles) have been relatively accurate in recent years, particularly f or core PCE price 
inflation .  The accuracy of the forecasts relative to the current estimates partially 
reflects upward revisions to nonmarket prices in last  summer’s  annual revision that 
brought  core PCE price inflation in 2012 and 2013 up  to be  in line with staff forecas ts 
that initially appeared somewhat too hig h. 
The staff made an  unusually large error in its prior- year forecast  of 2015 total PCE price 
inflation , which was  concentrated in the energy  category and reflected  the 
unexpect ed plunge in crude oil prices.  T he error in forecasting 2015 core PCE price 
inflation  one year ahead  was smaller, and, in part, reflects the surprisingly  large dollar 
appreciation restraining core goods price inflation.  N on-energy, nonhousing services  
prices were also low er than projected , likely pushed down  by a variety of factors  that 
included  the unexpected expiration of a temporary increase in Medicaid 
reimbursement rates to doctors  that  held down administered medical service price 
inflation  in 2015 .  Some of these factors were idiosyncratic to the core PCE price index, 
and the staff’s prior- year forecast of 2 percent core CPI inflation  in 2015 (not shown) 
proved accurate despite the unexpected appreciation of the dollar.  
                                                 
1 Looking at a broader set of Tealbook forecasts of the 2015:Q4 unemployment rate, the 
eight forecasts made during 2014 ranged between 0.1 and 0.6 percentage point too high, with 
the error from April 2014 shown in the chart at the high end of this range.  For payrolls, these 
eight prior -year fo recasts were too low, by an average of 18,000 jobs per month,  and rang ed 
from being too low (by 68,000 jobs per month ) to too high (by 7,000 jobs per month ).

 The unemployment rate edged up to 5.0 percent in March, whereas  we had 
expected it to remain flat at  4.9 percent.  However, the labor force 
participation rate and the emp loyment-to-population ratio both moved higher 
and were above our expectati ons, and in response we nudged up our 
projection of the participation rate in the coming months.  We expect the 
unemployment rate to drop back t o 4.9 percent in April and rema in there 
through the middle of this year.  
 Given our current assessment of trend participation and the nat ural rate of 
unemployment, we estimate that t here is now essentially no slac k left in the 
labor market.  In the current quarter, the projection puts the unemployment 
rate slightly below our estimate  of its natural rate, the parti cipation rate at its 
trend level, and the employment- to-population ratio a touch abo ve its trend.  
That said, we continue to view the share of employees working p art time for 
economic reasons as a little elevated. 
 The staff’s labor market condi tions index, or LMCI—a strictly m echanical 
method of filtering the data—decr eased again in March and has n ow declined 
for each of the past three months.  The model’s assessment is a t odds with the 
staff’s view that the recent ris e in labor force participation and the strong pace 
of job gains point to continued imp rovement in labor market con ditions 
despite little change in the une mployment rate in recent months . 
 We revised down sharply our foreca st for labor productivity in the near term.  
As noted earlier, output gains have been disappointing.  In addition, although 
job gains in March came in as  projected, business-sector hours surprised us to 
the upside because of a larger-than-expected increase in the ho urs of workers 
who are outside the scope of the payroll survey.6  We now expect that 
productivity will be unchanged over the first half of this year , in contrast to 
the 1¾ percent increase we projected in the March Tealbook. 
We adjusted downward our estimat es of structural productivity a nd potential 
output in this projection.  By t he end of 2016, the level of structural productivity is 
6 Business-sector workers outside the scope of the payroll surve y primarily comprise self-
employed persons, farm workers, and unpaid family workers.

¾ percent lower than in the Ma rch Tealbook, and the level of po tential output is 
¼ percent lower. 
 As previously indicated, we attri bute some of the weakness in f irst-quarter 
GDP growth to observation error.  To insulate our estimate of t he output gap 
from this error, we lowered our  estimates of potential output g rowth and 
structural productivity gro wth ¼ percentage point in 2016. 
 We lowered structural productiv ity an additional ½ percent and revised up the 
trend level of business-sector  hours by the same amount in ligh t of a string of 
stronger-than-expected readings for the component of hours that is outside the 
scope of the payroll survey.7  On net, these adjustments had no effect on our 
estimate of potential output. 
The medium-term outlook for the l abor market is slightly strong er than the March 
Tealbook projection.  
 We now project that the unemplo yment rate wil l fall to 4.2 perc ent by the end 
of 2018, a touch below our forecas t in the March Tealbook, consistent with 
the slightly faster pace of growth of real GDP beyond the near term.  This path for the unemployment rate, which ends the medium-term forecast 
0.8 percentage point below our estim ate of the natural rate, co rresponds to our 
projection that GDP will be 1½ perc ent above our estimate of it s potential

Acceleration Will Be More Gradual” for an alternative view that  labor 
productivity growth will be weak er than projected by the staff. 
 The pace of payroll job gains has remained surprisingly strong relative to 
GDP growth.  We expect job growth to remain near its current pa ce through 
the middle of 2017 and then to slow to about 140,000 per month by 2018, as 
output growth moderates and productiv ity rises just a little le ss than its trend 
rate. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Recent data on inflation have, on balance, been in line with our March Tealbook 
projection and support our expecta tion that core PCE price infl ation will step down in the 
second quarter.   
 Much of the acceleration in core PCE prices in the first quarter, to nearly 
2 percent at an annual rate, refle cted high readings in January  for categories 
from which we take little signa l.  Consistent with this view, the core PCE 
price index decelerated in February, and, with CPI and PPI data  in hand, we 
estimate that it only edged up in March.9  Accordingly, we expect that core 
PCE inflation will step down to 1½ percent in the current quart er—essentially 
unrevised from the March Teal book.  Our monthly projection impl ies that the 
12-month change in core PCE pri ces will be at 1.5 percent from March 
through June. 
 With the fall in energy prices  now largely behind us, we expect  total PCE 
inflation to be 1¼ percen t in the second quarter. 
 Core import prices are expected  to increase at a modest 1 perce nt annual rate 
in the current quarter, ending a s tring of six consecutive quarterly declines, as 
the recent depreciation of the dollar pushes up prices.  We expect core import price inflation to pick up to a 2¼ percent pace in the second h alf of this year 
and then to average onl y 1 percent in 2017 and 2018, consistent  with our 
projection for foreign inflation, t he dollar, and commodity pri ces. 
9 The core CPI posted a relatively large increase of 0.3 percent  for February, which we reported at 
the March FOMC meeting, but the increase in the core PCE index in February turned out to be modest, 
rounding to 0.1 per cent, in part because n onmarket prices rever sed a large share of the January increase.

 Alternative View:  Productivity Acceleration Will Be More Gradual  
In contrast to the staff’s baseline projection that business -sector labor productivity will grow , on 
average, 1¼ percent annually over the next three years, this discussion presents the view that 
productivity growth will recover more slowly from its recent meager pace.   Since 2011, productivity 
growth has averaged less than ½ percent per year, which represents a substantial slowdown 
relative to  the 2 percent  average between 1973 and 2007.  Like most other forecasters, the staff did 
not anticipate this slowdown  and has been repeatedly surprised by the disappointing  productivity 
gains  (figure 1).  Although  the importance of different explanations for the recent paltry pace of 
productivity growth is still being debated, some of the f actors  that are holding back productivity 
improvements  will likely persist  for a while longer.  
It is worth noting that the productivity slowdown is not unique to the United States but instead has 
been experienced by most developed countries.  Indeed, among OECD countries with available 
data, 29 of 30 countries experienced a reduction in productivity gains after 200 5, with productivity 
growth 1 ¼ percentage points lower per year, on average, between 2005 and 201 4 than during the 
preceding 10- year period .  The ubiquity of the productivity deceleration suggests that the 
underlying forces are likely to be common as well.  
One  set of possible explanations for the productivity slowdown in the United States relate s to the 
lingering effects of the Great Recession.  Most importantly, growth of capital stock has been  
anemic in the aftermath of the financial crisis , and, as a result , capital deepening —historically an 
important driver of productivity growth —has been  unusually and persistently subdued  (figure 2) .  
At the same time , the severe distress  in the labor market has likely impeded the reallocation of 
labor toward its most productive uses.  Moreover, firm formation dropped precipitously during  the 
Great Recession  and remained depressed thereafter, and th is “missing generation” of firms may 
have diminished growth in the productive capacity of the economy.1  Although  the effects  of these 
factors should  dissipate over time, the experience so far suggests that this process will be gradual.

According to a second set of explanations , the productivity slowdown actually preceded the Great 
Recession.  Factors that resulted in unusually strong multifactor productivity growth in the 1990s — 
most notably, factors related to rapid advances in information and communication technologies — 
had run their course by the mid-2000s .2 Relatedly, falling job reallocation associated with declining 
busine ss dynamism appears to be pushing down productivity growth in the post -2000 period as 
well.3 As a consequence of these influences , we might have entered a period of slow productivity 
growth beginning in the mid-2000s , perhaps reminiscent of the one t hat started in the 1970s.4 
All told, with several different underlying forces likely contribut ing to the subpar productivity 
growth over the past five years, it seems unlikely that all of these forces will swiftly disappear in 
coming quarters .  Moreover, s ince the mid-1980s , productivity appears to be countercyclical, and 
thus one should expect below -trend productivity growth at this stage in the business cycle. 
Therefore, it seems more likely that productivity will accelerate only gradually , mov ing up perhaps 
½ percent in 2016, ¾ percent in 2017, and 1 percent in 2018.  If so , the level of productivity at the 
end of 2018 would be 1¼ percent lower than currently projected by the staff. 
A downward adjustment to the productivity forecast would also potentially have important 
implications for other aspects of the staff’s projection. If the lower productivity growth were 
assumed to reduce consumers’ and investors’ expectations of income, this reduction would result 
in weaker aggregate demand but would have little implication for the labor market forecast . 
Alternatively , and more consistent with the experience of the past few years, this lower 
productivity growth could coincide with real GDP growth similar to the staff’s current outlook for 
aggregate demand, in which case lower productivity growth would lead to a faster -than -projected 
improvement in labor market conditions (see the Risk s and Uncertainty section for a model- based 
perspective on possible macroeconomic outc omes ). Moreover, equilibrium wage growth — 
the sum of trend inflation and underlying productivity growth —would be lower by almost 
½ percentage point per year, implying that even a mode st step -up in wage growth could lead to 
inflationary pressures. 
Finally, it is worth considering the case in which productivity growth remains historically low for a 
prolonged period of time.  A protracted productivity slowdown would have much more serious 
macroeconomic consequences, including continued downward pressure on the equilibrium real 
interest rate, reduced incentives for labor force participation, rising fiscal imbalances, and slower 
improvements in living standards .

4 Another possibility is that the productivity slowdown reflects measurement issues. However, existing 
research has found little support for this hypothesis; see David M. Byrne, John G. Fernald , and M arshall B. Reinsdorf 
(forthcoming), “Does the United States Have a Productivity Slowdown or a Measurement Problem?” Brookings

 The Michigan survey measure of l onger-run infla tion expectation s fell 
0.2 percentage point to 2.5 percent in the preliminary April re lease, matching 
the very low reading we had in hand at the time of the March Tealbook.  
Meanwhile, market-based measures  of longer-term inflation compe nsation 
have edged up somewhat but still  remain at the low end of their  historical 
range.   
We project core PCE inflation to be 1.5 percent this year but t o move gradually 
higher over the remainder of the projection period, reaching 1. 8 percent in 2018.  
 Waning restraint from energy and import price pass-through acco unts for 
nearly all of the rise in core inflation that we are projecting  over the medium 
term.  Other influences on the i nflation projecti on, including the projected 
tightening of resource utilizati on over the medium term, are re latively small.   
 Beyond the near term, both food and energy prices are projected  to rise just a 
little faster than core prices on average.  As a result, total PCE price inflation 
moves back up to the same rate as core inflation in 2017 and 2018.   
 Compared with the March Teal book, both overall and core PCE pri ce inflation 
are 0.1 percentage poin t higher in 2016, as th e lower path for the dollar shows 
through to higher import prices.  T hereafter, the inflation forecast is 
essentially unrevised.  Revisi ons to the inflation projection s ince the 
December 2015 Tealbook are also relatively small. 
We have received little data on labor compensation since the March Tealbook. 
 In the 12 months through March, average hourly earnings increas ed 
2¼ percent, in line with our expectation.  In the near term, we  expect the 
12-month change in this measur e to edge up slightly to 2½ perce nt. 
 We now estimate that business-se ctor compensation per hour rose  at an annual 
rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter and will increase 2¾ pe rcent over the 
year as a whole.  We continue t o expect that gains in hourly co mpensation 
will move up further, to 3¼ percent, by 2018.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The Federal Reserve’s holdings  of securities continue to put do wnward 
pressure on longer-term interest r ates, albeit to a diminishing  extent over time.  
The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a normal size by the end 
of 2021. 
 The federal funds rate rises further after 2018.  With the econ omy running 
above its potential level and inflation having reached the Comm ittee’s 
2 percent objective, the federal funds rate reaches 4 percent i n 2020 and 2021 
and moves back toward its long- run value of 3¼ percent thereaft er.     
 The natural rate of unemploymen t remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP 
growth reaches its long-run value of 1.9 percent in 2020. 
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates f urther and 
rises at an annual rate  of 1½ percent in 2020 and 2021.  The unemployment 
rate is 4¼ percent in 2019 and the n starts rising gradually tow ard its assumed 
natural rate in subsequent years. 
 PCE price inflation moves up fro m 1.8 percent in 2018 to the Co mmittee’s 
long-run objective  of 2 percent in 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
After a very weak economic performance abroad last year, we have been relieved 
to see indicators pointing to a pickup in foreign real GDP growth, to 2¼ percent , in the 
first quarter.  W e see foreign growth edging up over the rest of this year and next to a 
near-trend pace.  Outside of a slight upward revision in the first quarter, our outlook is 
little changed —but even that is a welcome departure from several rounds of forecast 
downgrades.  
Much of the unexpectedly large rise in foreign growth during the first quarter was 
concentrated in Canada, which rebounded from a weak fourth quarter and has a heavy 
weight in our aggregate for foreign GDP.  O utput in the euro area and emerging Asia 
excluding China also picked up.  And although indicators for Japan were disappointing, 
they nevertheless point to flat growth in the first quarter compared with a contraction in 
the fourth.  To be sure, Chinese growth slowed—to 5.4 percent from 7  percent in the 
previous quarter—but we had largely anticipated this declin e.  And March indicators for 
China were more upbeat , supporting our view that a stimulus-induced rebound is 
under way. 
We see foreign growth moving up to 2½ percent in the second half of this year 
and to 2¾ percent in 2017.  Foreign growth should be supported by the improvement in 
global financial market conditions after a turbulent start to the year and by 
accommodative macroeconomic policies.  In the emerging market economies (EMEs), 
where financial markets were hit hard by the turmoil early this year, credit spreads have 
narrow ed, stock prices have risen , and net capital inflows have resumed .  
The improved tone of financial markets and the recent pickup in growth makes us 
more confident about our baseline forecast.  Nevertheless, downside risks remain, which

are all the more worrisome in an environment where several major central banks may 
have limited latitude to respond to adverse shocks: 
• Expectations of a more accommodative U.S. monetary policy stance seem to 
have helped quell market tension s recently, but an eventual  U.S. tightening 
could still roil markets. 
• The continued opacity of Chinese exchange rate policy creates the potential 
for renewed financial turmoil, especially if Chinese authorities reacted  to a 
sharp generalized appreciation of the dollar by allowing the RMB to 
depreciat e significantly . 
• Also in China, large financial imbalances, exacerbated by recent credit 
stimulus, could amplify an unexpected slowing of growth into a hard landing. 
• A further fall in oil prices could intensify financial strains  among oil 
producers. 
• U.K. vote rs might surprise market participants and us by opting to leave the 
European Union (EU), which could have disruptive effects .  (See  the box 
“Effect of a U.K. V ote to Leave the European Union” and the a lternative 
scenario “Diso rderly Brexit.” )  
In the advanced  foreign economies (AFEs), headline inflation slipped into 
negative territory in the first quarter , weighed down by past declines in energy prices.  
We see inflation in the AFEs rising as domestic energy prices move back up and the 
degree of economic slack diminishes .  By the end of 2018, we project that inflation will 
have reached 2 percent in Canada and the United Kingdom and 1½ percent in the euro 
area. By contrast, in Japan, low inflation is still well entrenched in wage - and price-
setting behavior, and we expect inflation to only reach 1 percent.   Throughout the AFEs , 
weak inflation ary pressures  and the modest economic recovery should keep monetary 
policy accommodative.  The European Central Bank (ECB) eased policy further last 
month (after the Tealbook closed), and the Bank of Japan ( BOJ) is expected to ease 
further at its next meeting. The Bank of England is not expected to lift off until the 
fourth quarter, and the Bank of Canada will likely not tighten policy until mid -2017.

By contrast, our EME inflation aggregate jumped  in the first quarter, largely 
reflecting a food-driven increase in inflation in China and increases in much of Latin 
America.  W ith inflationary pressures in other emerging A sian economies at bay, t he 
central banks of India, Indonesia, Singapore, and Taiwan loosened monetary policy to 
support demand.  Conversely, Colombia’s central bank raised its policy rate to fight 
inflationary pressures.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Canada.  Recent indicators, including retail sales  and monthly GDP for 
January , suggest that real GDP growth rebounded to 2¾ percent in the first 
quarter after slumping late last year .  The surge in growth was driven, in part, 
by a pickup in inventory investment that we expect to be temporary.  W e 
project that growth over the next three years will average 2 percent , up from 
0.5 percent in 2015, as investment recovers, exports are supported by past 
currency depreciation, monetary policy remains accommodative, and fiscal 
stimulus  announced i n the March federal budget is implemented. 
• Euro Area.  Recent indicators suggest that growth picked up from 1¼ percent in the fourth quarte r to 1¾ percent in the first, partly reflecting transitory 
factors such as a recovery of retail sales f rom disruptions late last year 
associated with the terrorist attack in Paris .  Looking ahead, t he ECB’s recent 
expansion of asset purchases and t argeted longer-term refinancing operations 
should support growth , but the recent appreciation of the euro will partly 
offset this boost.  All told, we expect GDP to grow at a 2 percent rat e in 2017 
and 2018—unchanged from our March Tealbook projection, which had 
already anticipated some ECB easing .      
• United Kingdom. We assume that uncertainty around the vote to leave the 
EU will weigh on U.K. growth in the first half of the year, despite some boost 
from the weaker  pound.  W e expect growth to average  about 2 percent, down 
from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.  Recent indicators, such as industrial 
production, PMIs, and consumer confidence, are consist ent with this loss in

Effect of a U.K. Vote to Leave the E uropean Union 
In a referendum scheduled for June 23, U.K. citizens will be asked to vote on the 
following question: “Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European 
Union or leave the European Union? ”1 The latest polls have the outcome as a virtual 
toss -up, with a bout 20 percent of voters still undecided.  In o ur baseline forecast , we 
assume voters will choose to remain in t he European Union ( EU).  But the risk of exit 
is material. This discussion assesses the potential consequences of a “leave” vote for 
the U .K. economy as well as attendant spillovers . 
If the leave vote succeeds , the U .K. government has pledge d to notify the European 
Council of the country’s intention to leave the E U, thus beginning negotiations 
regarding future U.K. –EU relations . The Treaty of Lisbon sets a two -year negotiation 
period during which all EU laws still apply and the United Kingdom retains access to 
the single market. Many people expect that the complexity of negotiations will 
require an extension of the two -year period that would require unanimous approval 
of the remaining EU member states . 
The key element s to be agreed upon are the terms of the United Kingdom ’s access to 
the single market and, given the dominant role of London in EU financial markets, 
bank passporting rights (the ability to provide financial services in a different EU 
country without a need to set up a subsidiary ).  Two models stand out as possible 
frameworks: Norway, which has full access to the single market (with passporting 
rights) but does not have influence on the EU legislative process ; and Switzerland, 
which , through a set of bilateral agreements with the EU, has limited access to the 
single market that excludes, in particular, financial services and thus passporting 
rights. Of note, once it is no longer in the EU, the United Kingdom would also need to 
renegotiate its trade agreements with the rest of the world. 
The economic, financial, and political consequences of a leave vote could be 
significant for the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU , given their tight trade and 
financi al links . The United Kingdom exports 45 percent of its goods and services to EU 
countries , and roughly 50 percent of its imports come from these countries .  In 
addition, London serves as the most important financial center in the EU, accounting 
for almost 25 percent of all EU financial services income and roughly 40 percent of EU 
financial services exports . 
Although a leave vote would not immediately change the status of the United 
Kingdom in the EU , uncertainty over the outcome of negotiations could be disruptive. 
On the financial side, uncertainty about the future role of London in EU financial 
markets could lead to stress in various markets.  The pound sterling would likely come 
under pressure, and gilt yields could move up because of higher risk premiums as

foreign investors exit the U.K. market . Some U.K. banks and firms could face liquidity 
problems as nonresident foreign -currency -denominated deposits are pulled back .  On 
the real side, uncertainty may depress economic growth by inducing companies to 
postpone investment and households to save more. 
Spillovers would likely be apparent in other European countries .  A leave vote could 
lead to increased uncertainty about the future of European integration , which could 
have global consequences.  Capital outflows from Europe would weigh on peripheral 
spreads and lead to depreciation of the euro and appreciation of safe- haven 
currencies.  L ower U.K. growth would negatively affect the rest of the EU through 
financial spillovers and, to a lesser extent, trade.  In particular, euro-area banks may 
suffer from their large exposure (65 percent of Tier 1 capital) to the nonbank U.K. 
private sector. 
Two factors are likely to determine the severity of these effect s on the U.K. economy 
and the magnitude of international spillovers.  The f irst is whether U.K. and EU 
policymakers are committed to smooth negotiations that aim to preserve strong 
trade and financial links.  The s econd factor relates to the adequacy of contingency 
planning by the Bank of England (BOE) —and possibly by other European institutions , 
such as the European Central Bank —in the event of financial stress following a leave 
vote.  Recently, the BOE announced that it will hold additional liquidity auctions 
around the date of the referendum. 
We envision two possible scenarios in the case of a leave vote. Our moderate 
scenario assumes that negotiations , though difficult, will be relatively uncontentious 
and financial stresses will remain contained .  We judge that uncertainty would still 
have a negative effect on the U.K. economy (1 to 1½ percent decline in the level of 
GDP relative to baseline through 2018 ) but with limited spillover to the rest of the EU 
(¼ to ½ percent decline in GDP). However, we can also envision a more adverse 
scenario (further discussed in the Risks and Uncertainty section) in which a leave vote 
lead s to heightened political tensions between the United Kingdom and the EU.  In 
such a case, concerns about the future of the European project could emerge and 
undermine confidence in financial backstops for vulnerable peripheral euro- area 
countries, triggering a sharp and persistent increase in financial distress.  In this 
scenario, we estimate that the U.K. economy would experience a much larger output 
loss (2 to 2½ percent decline in GDP relative to baseline), with greater s pillovers to the 
EU (1 to 1½ percent decline in GDP) and material effect s on the rest of the world . 
We also see the long -term effect of a leave vote for the United Kingdom as negative. 
The exact size of the negative effect will be determined by the specifics of the 
withdrawal agreement. In particular, any new arrangement with the EU will likely 
result in a reduction in trade for the United Kingdom , which could weigh on 
productivity and thus lead to a permanent loss in GDP level.

momentum.  Given our assumption that voters will choose to stay in the EU, 
we have growth picking up later this year to 2½ percent and holding just 
below that rate o ver the remainder of the forecast period.  
• Japan.  On the heels of a fourth -quarter decline in GDP, r ecent data have been 
unexpectedly weak —industrial production plunged in February , and the 
Tankan survey of business expectations was downbeat.  Moreover, recent yen 
appreciation should damp exports, disappointing spring wage negotiations 
will weigh on consumption, and the recent earthquake in southern Japan will 
likely cause s ome disruption in corporate supply chains.  W e now estimate 
that GDP was flat in the first quarter  and project only a modest rebound in 
growth starting this quarter .  Given weak growth and sliding inflation 
expectations , we expect the BOJ to ease policy at its April 28 meeting by both 
increasing the pace of asset purchases  and making its policy interest rate 
slightly more negative. In addition, we expect the government to postpone by 
one year the consumption tax hike currently scheduled for April 2017. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• China. Real GDP growth fell to 5 .4 percent in the first quarter, largely in line 
with our expectations, as China’s manufacturing sector slowed sharply and 
services growth moderated .  Despite the weak start to the year , near -term risks 
have receded a bit as policymakers have signaled a somewhat easier policy 
stance.  Indeed, a pickup in credit and investment growth, which appears to be 
contributing to a turnaround in the housing market, suggests that policy 
accommodation in recent quarters has begun to feed through to the real 
economy.  We expect growth to pick up to about 7 percent in the current 
quarter and next before declining g radually to 6 percent by 2018.  Intervention 
sales of dollars have declined of late, likely reflecting reduced selling pressure 
on the Chinese renminbi.  
• Other Emerging Asia. We estimate that real GDP rose 3½ percent in the first 
quarter , up from a 3 percent pace in the fourth .  The step -up was concentrated

in Hong Kong, Korea , and Taiwan  and was due to expansionary fiscal 
policies as well as robust private investment.  Throughout the region, r ecent 
high-frequency indicators such as PMIs and industrial production suggest that 
activity picked  up late in the first quarter even as exports continued to 
disappoint.  Overall, as in the March Tealbook, we expect the region’s growth 
to step up to 4 percent this year and beyond, supported by stronger domestic 
demand and s ome firming of growth in the advanced economies. 
• Mexico . Incoming data suggest that growth remained at a subdued 2¼ 
percent pace in the first quarter. U.S. demand for Mexican manufactured 
goods remained weak except for automotive exports, which grew briskly.  The 
low price of oil has weighed on growth through tighter fiscal policies, 
particularly cuts in public -sector investment. We see growth remaining 
subdued in the current quarter, restrained by weak U.S. manufacturing growth , 
before edging up to its trend pace of 3 percent by late 2018.  Monetary policy 
continues to be accommodative, and both the large depreciation of the peso 
and past economic reforms should provide some impetus  to growth.  
• Brazil .  Policy paralysis amid the political crisis  continued to drag down 
activity , with real GDP estimated to have declined by 3 percent in the first 
quarter .  Consumer and business confidence have been stuck at very low 
levels, and industrial output continued to plunge.  Activity is being further 
depressed by the central bank’s tight monetary policy stance to combat high 
inflation , which registered 9.4 percent on a 12-month basis in March.  On 
April 17, the House of Deputies voted to recommend that President Dilma Rousseff be impeached.  The impeachment process now moves to the Senate, 
which is expected to vote in mid -May to start the impeachm ent trial.  Once 
this step is taken,  President Rousseff will need to step aside and Vice 
President Michel Temer will lik ely become the interim president.  The trial 
could take several months.  Amid such an unsettled political environment, we do not see Brazil returnin g to positive growth until 2017 and even then expect 
only a very slow recovery.

Financial market conditions imp roved further, on balance, over the intermeeting 
period, with investors appeari ng to respond to Federal Reserve communications that were 
viewed as more accommodative than expected and somewhat better incoming data on 
foreign economic activity.  Risk s entiment appeared to improve further, on net, 
accompanied by a decline in financial market volatility and hig her oil prices.  Domestic 
economic data releases over th e period had, on balance, a limit ed effect on asset prices. 
 According to a straight read of f utures contracts, the path of the federal funds 
rate flattened significantly, with the rate at the end of 2017 down about 
23 basis points, and the odds placed on an increase in the fede ral funds rate at 
the June meeting were reduced f urther.  In the Open Market Desk’s surveys of 
primary dealers and market participants, the median dealer’s modal policy 
path was little changed, while t he median investor’s modal path  moved down 
substantially. 
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal securities declined betwe en about 
19 basis points and 25 basis points, while market-based measure s of longer-

strengthened, except for C&I loans, for which demand by larger firms 
reportedly diminished.1 
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations appeared to ease somewhat 
relative to earlier this year :  Bond issuance by speculative-gr ade firms 
rebounded and CMBS spreads narrowe d markedly, although they rem ain 
elevated. 
 Recent patterns of household financing conditions continued:  M ortgage 
markets remained tight for lower-quality borrowers, while consu mer credit 
markets stayed accommodative. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND TREASURY YIELDS 
Federal Reserve communications a ccompanying the March FOMC meet ing were 
interpreted by market participan ts as more accommodative than e xpected.  In particular, 
investors were attentive to the larger-than-expected downward revision to the projected 
path of the federal funds rate i n the Summary of Economic Projections and to references 
to risks to the U.S economic outlook stemming from global econo mic and financial 
developments.  Subsequently, Chair Yellen’s remarks to the Economic Club of New York on March 29 appeared to reinfor ce market expectations of a gradual pace of policy 
rate increases.  Meanwhile, domestic data releases came in mixed and elicited only a 
modest market reaction. 
On net, the policy path implie d by OIS quotes flattened notably  since the March 
FOMC meeting, with the fed funds rate at the end of 2016 and at  the end of 2017 moving 
down 17 basis points and 23 basis poi nts, respectively.  Based on a straight read of 
federal funds futures rates, market participants now place essentially no odds on a rate 
increase at the April meeting.  The odds of a rate hike by the June meeting estimated 
from futures quotes declined signi ficantly over the intermeetin g period from around 
28 percent to 17 percent.  The resu lts from the Desk’s April surveys of primary dealers 
and market participants gave so mewhat conflicting results.  Whe reas the median dealer’s 
modal policy path was little cha nged, the median investor’s modal path moved down 
substantially.  Consistent with this divergence, the median investor also pushed out the

most likely timing of a change to the Committee’s policy on reinvestments by about a 
quarter. 
Nominal Treasury yields decrease d noticeably since the March FO MC meeting. 
On net, yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year  nominal Treasury securities moved down 21, 25, and 
19 basis points, respectively.2  According to staff models, the decline in medium- and 
longer-term Treasury yields refl ected declines in both the expe cted policy path and term 
premiums.  The 5-year inflati on compensation based on TIPS was about unchanged, and 
5-to-10-year inflation compensa tion increased modestly but rema ined at low levels. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
Since the March FOMC meeting, global financial market conditions have eased 
modestly.  Overall risk sentiment appears to have improved, wit h expectations of more 
accommodative monetary policy in the United States playing a ro le.  Sentiment was also 
boosted by foreign data suggesting g rowth picked up in the firs t quarter, somewhat 
alleviating market fears of a s harp slowdown in global growth. 
Along with U.S. interest rates, A FE sovereign yields declined n otably following 
the March FOMC meeting and the speech by Chair Yellen in late M arch.  Over the 
period, 10-year sovereign yields d eclined 15 basis points in Ge rmany, 3 basis points in 
the United Kingdom, and 11 basis points in Japan, reaching near  all-time lows in these 
countries.  After a slight re bound earlier this year, 5-to-10-y ear inflation compensation 
continued to trend down in the e uro area and the United Kingdom . 
The broad dollar depreciate d 2¾ percent, including 3¼ percent a gainst AFE 
currencies and 2¼ percent against EME currencies.  A number of factors contributed to 
the weakening.  First, the dollar moved down noticeably on days  when U.S. policy 
expectations shifted, importantly after the FOMC meeting and th e Chair’s speech.  In 
addition, upward moves in the price of oil appeared to support commodity currencies.  
The British pound appreciated less than most other AFE currenci es, reflecting concerns 
about “Brexit.”  Somewhat para doxically, the Japanese yen appre ciated a bit more against 
the dollar—3½ percent—even as da ta strongly disappointed.  Market participants partly

attribute this development to t echnical factors, such as the co vering of short positions, 
which put upward pressure on the yen.  
The demand for dollar funding by financial institutions remained elevated, which 
was apparent in the “dollar f unding premium,” the additional co st of obtaining dollar 
funding via the foreign exchange s wap market relative to the co st of direct dollar funding. 
(For more discussion on the dollar funding premium, see the box  “Recent Developments 
in Offshore Dollar Funding Markets.”)  
Over the intermeeting period, forei gn equity market performance  was generally 
positive.  AFE broad equity indexes were up slightly, although bank stocks continued to 
underperform.  Supported by expectations of more accommodative U.S. monetary policy 
and higher oil prices, EME equiti es gained about 4 percent, EME  sovereign spreads 
narrowed on net, and money flowed into EME funds.     
CORPORATE ASSET PRICES AND EARNINGS 
Over the intermeeting period, broa d U.S. equity price indexes m oved up, on net, 
likely owing to more-accommodative-than-expected monetary polic y and an 
improvement in risk sentiment.  Sto ck prices increased across a ll industries, including the 
energy sector.  One-month-ahe ad implied volatility on the S&P 5 00 index—the VIX— 
moved down and ended the period below its historical median. 
Spreads of 10-year corporate bond y ields over those of comparab le-maturity 
Treasury securities for both tri ple-B-rated and speculative-gra de issuers declined 
somewhat on balance. Nonetheless, even as broader risk sentimen t among investors 
improved, the spreads remained a t levels near the top of their ranges since 2012 and the 
outlook for corporate earnings deteriorated somewhat over the intermeeting period.  (See 
the box “The Level of U.S. Corpor ate Bond Yield Spreads” for a longer-term perspective 
on spreads.)   
With earnings reports of roughly 10 percent of companies in the  S&P 500 index 
on hand and a straight read of Wall Street equity analysts’ for ecasts for the rest, corporate 
earnings in the first quarter a re projected to have decreased a bout 7 percent relative to the 
previous quarter.  The staff exp ects that, following typical pa tterns, most actual reports 
will beat Wall Street analysts’ f orecasts—as appears to be the case so far—and the 
decline in earnings will likel y be more modest.  In addition, W all Street analysts

 Recent Developments in Offshore Dollar Funding Market s 
Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the cost of dollar funding by directly  borrowing dollars has 
differed significantly from funding by indirectly  borrowing another currency and using a foreign 
exchange (FX) swap to convert th ose funds into dollars.  In theory , these differences in dollar 
funding costs should be small, as wide spreads between the two rates create arbitrage 
opportunities that make it profitable to engage in transactions that would tend to close the gap.  This discussion examines  possible causes for the rise in  differences in dollar funding costs and 
offers a possible explanation for the recent divergence in these  measures  across currencies.  
Although large dollar funding gaps were often viewed as a sign of funding distress  in the past , the 
recent rise in the se gaps likely reflects other factors, particularly  the combination of increased 
financial intermediation  costs  after the GFC and divergent monetary policy stances  between the 
Fed and foreign central banks  in recent years .  
Dollar funding gaps used to be small.  As shown in figures 1 and 2, the dollar funding premium, 
which is the cost of funding via the FX swap market minus the cost of funding directly, was close to zero before 2007.   During the GFC , the dollar funding premium spiked, reflecting the acute 
global shortages of dollar liquidity and , more generally , the disorder in global financial markets.  
Even after more orderly financial conditions returned, the funding premium has remained wider 
and considerably more variable.  
In addition , dollar funding premiums  now differ  remarkably based on the currency involved.  The 
recent increases in premiums  have been especially pronounced for the euro and yen at  both

 short and long maturities.  Short -term premiums  are important for banks when transforming 
funding across currencies , whereas long -term premi ums  are particularly relevant for corporate 
issuers and investors of long -dated securities when hedging long -term currency risk.  The five-
year premium vis -à-vis t he yen is currently about  90 basis points, near its historical high, and the 
five-year premium vis -à-vis the euro is about  40 basis points, close to the level observed during 
the GFC’s peak.  In contrast, the recent rise in the premium vis -à-vis the Britis h pound has been 
much more subdued.  
Rather than reflecting severe offshore dollar funding distress, the recent increase in dollar 
funding premiums more likely reflects two other factors.  First, balance sheet constraints faced by 
global banks , in part as a result of  regulatory reforms  since the GFC , could be weakening market  
making and arbitrage mechanisms that ensured near- zero dollar funding premiums before the 
crisis.  Even under normal financial market conditions , tighter regulations have likely increased 
the return that banks require to provide FX swap liquidity and  to directly engage in activities that 
narrow variations in dollar funding costs .  
Second, i n the presence of costly financial intermediation  after the crisis , divergent monetary 
policy  stances have likely contributed to the recent increase in dollar funding premiums.  Figure 3 
show s policy expectations in the United States started diverging from those in the euro area and 
Japan in 2013 and 2014 but remained close to those in the United Kingdom.  The persistently low - 
or negative- yield environment in Europe and Japan in recent years and the ample liquidity in 
euros and yen supplied through unconventional monetary policies have likely  increased the 
imbalance between the demand for dollar- denominated assets and the supply of  euro- and yen -
denominated liabilities.1  Consistent with this narrative,  figures 4 and 5 show, respectively, strong 
demand from foreign investors for U.S. corporate debt and strong issuance by  U.S. firms in 
foreign currencies starting in 2013.  To offset the imbalance between the strong demand for 
dollar- denominated assets and the strong supply of foreign currency funding, financial 
intermediaries demand more dollar funding via the FX swap market, exerting upward pressure on 
dollar funding premiums vis -à-vis the euro and the yen .  The relatively similar monetary policy 
stances in the United States and th e United Kingdom help explain the  much smaller magnitude of 
the premium vis -à-vis the pound . 
 
                                                 
1 We note that despite the rising dollar funding premium, borrowers without ready access to direct dollar 
funding  may still find it more advantageous to obtain dollar funding indirectly via the FX swap.

 The Level of U.S. Corporate Bond Yield Spreads  
Even though corporate bond spreads narrowed notably in late February and March, their levels  
remained very elevated  and are currently  around the 75th  percentile of their historical 
distribution s (figure 1 ).  These elevated spreads are consistent with  the deterioration  in the  
energy sector, heightened risk aversion , and increased concerns on the outlook for credit 
defaults , all of which contribute to tightness in financing conditions for the corporate sector and 
may warn of some sluggishness in economic activity  going forward.1   
The sharp drop in the price of oil since mid -2014 has substantially threatened the prospects, and 
in some cases the viability, of many firms  involved in the exploration and production of fossil 
fuels .  Over this period , spreads for investment - and speculative- grade bonds of these firms  have 
widened  substantially  to levels  not seen since  the Great  Recession  (figure 2) .  However, s preads 
have also widened outside the energy sector, although by considerab ly less, indicating  that 
factors specific to this sector cannot entirely account for the overall high level of spreads.   
Estimated risk premiums in  bond spreads also have increased since mid -2014  (figure 3).  The 
increase is consistent with  both  investors’ perception of higher economic uncertainty and less 
willingness to hold risky securities .  However, near- term  forward spreads  on speculative- grade 
bonds, which are interpret ed as an indicator of  factors such as the near- term credit outlook, have 
widened more than  far-term spreads  have , which is interpreted more as an indicator of investors ’ 
appetite to bear credit risk (figure 4).  This divergence suggests that an increase in expected 
credit losses for the broad market account s for some  of the increase in corporate bond spreads.  
 
 
                                                 
1 Some studies find that corporate bond spreads tend to increase before recessions ( for example , Mark 
Gertler and Cara Lown (1999),  “The Information in the High- Yield Bond Spread for the Business Cycle: Evidence 
and Some Implications, ” Oxford Review of Economic Policy,  vol. 15 (Autumn), pp. 132 –50) and have  significant 
predictive power for economic activity  (see, for example,  Simon  Gilchrist  and Egon Zakrajšek (2012 ), “Credit 
Spreads and Business Cycle Fl uctuations,”  American Economic Review,  vol. 102 (4), pp.  1692 –720).   Other studies 
point out that spreads frequently increase even outside recession periods ( for example , James Stock  and Mark 
Watson  (2003 ), “Forecasting Output and Inflation:  The Role of Asset Prices,”  Journal of Economic Literature,  
vol. 41 (3), pp.  788– 829), such as during the L ong -Term Capital Management  and the European debt crises.  In the 
March 2016 memo to the FOMC titled “ Probability of Recession Implied by Credit Market Sentiment, ” Giovanni 
Favara, Kurt Lewis, and Gustavo Suarez document and evaluate the significant predictive power of an investor 
sentiment measure extracted from bond spreads.

 Information from nonfinancial corporations’ financial reports are consistent with a potential 
weakening in c redit performance.  After trending up for several years, the aggregate ratio of debt 
to total assets for the corporate sector is at its  high est level in more than two decades  (figure 5).  
In recent quarters, g rowth  in corporate earnings has slowed and credit quality downgrades have 
significantly outpaced upgrades .  Last quarter, corporate defaults neared six -year highs, with 
about half of the defaulted principal accounted for by energy and commodities industry debt .  
These developments  suggest  increased  vulnerability of the corporate secto r in the near term, as 
reflected in current estimates  of expected defaults .2  However, these estimates remain low 
relative to the historical average, and a few additional factors mitigate the level of concern  
(figure 6 ).  Aggregate cash holdings remain high , interest expenses remain low by  historical 
standards , and reliance on short -term debt by U.S. corporations remains low in the aggregate.  
Finally, although we cannot rule out that concerns about market liquidity risks may also have 
contributed to the widening of bond spreads, traditional measures of market liquidity , such as 
trading volume and bid -asked spreads have not signaled a significant worsening of liquidity in 
recent years .3   
                                                 
2 Similar vulnerabilities are discussed in the March 2016 Tealbook (see the box “Recent Developments in 
Speculative -Grade Corporate Debt Markets” in Tealbook A).  
3 Available l iquidity indicators are based on executed trades , as m ost trading is over the counter with no 
centralized mechanism to collect trade orders .  The stability in recent year s of these indicators contrasts with the 
view, shared by a wide range of market participants, of a deterioration of liquidity in credit markets.  However,  no 
evidence is available to suggest that the perceived deterioration  accounts for the widening  of spr eads since 2014.

beyond the energy sector, although the downward revisions were much smaller than in 
prior months. 
BUSINESS AND MUNICIPAL FINANCE 
Overall, financing conditions for U.S. nonfinancial businesses remained generally 
accommodative for investment-grade issuers, and those for specu lative-grade firms 
improved somewhat after having sho wn strains earlier in the yea r.  Corporate bond 
issuance for speculative-grade firms rebounded in March from th e sluggish pace in 
January and February.  While ini tial public equity offerings remained anemic in the first 
quarter, early indications suggest  that stock repurchases and M&A activity stayed robust. 
Growth of C&I loans on banks’  books remained strong and continu ed to be driven 
by lending at large banks making l oans to investment-grade borr owers.  Nonetheless, 
according to the most recent SLOOS, on balance during the first  quarter, banks further 
tightened their lending standards  on C&I loans to large and mid dle-market firms, while 
demand for such loans weakened.  Banks mainly pointed to a less  favorable economic 
outlook and a worsening of conditions in the energy sector in e xplaining the tightening in 
lending standards last quarter; c ustomers’ reduced needs for fi nancing fixed investments 
and merger activity were cited a s the drivers of weaker demand. 
Expected credit performance for nonfinancial corporations, whil e still solid 
overall, showed additional signs of weakening, as the volume of  corporate bonds 
downgraded by Moody’s Investors Serv ice in March significantly exceeded the volume 
upgraded, even among firms outside  the energy sector.  The SLOO S indicated that banks 
expect an increase this year in delinquencies and charge-offs o n existing loans to firms in 
the energy sector.  Moreover, banks  noted some deterioration in  credit quality of loans to 
non-energy businesses located in U .S. regions that are dependen t on the energy sector. 
Turning to the commercial real e state (CRE) sector, a significa nt number of 
SLOOS respondents reported tight ening their lending standards on all major categories of 
these loans during the first qua rter, following a moderate numb er that reported doing so 
in the fourth quarter and after several years of easing.  Banks also reportedly tightened 
several loan terms over the past year and pointed to the outloo k for vacancy rates, 
capitalization rates, and prope rty prices, as well as a reduced  tolerance for risk, by way of 
explanation.  However, demand for CRE loans reportedly strength ened, and CRE loans

on banks’ books continued to grow at a robust pace over the fir st quarter.  In response to 
wider and more volatile CMBS s preads at the beginning of the ye ar, CMBS issuance has 
been subdued in the first quarter, c onsistent with reports from banks in the SLOOS.  Over 
the intermeeting period, CMBS spr eads narrowed markedly but rem ained at elevated 
levels. 
Credit conditions in municipal  bond markets continued to be sta ble, even as the 
situation facing Puerto Rico’s cr editors deterior ated further.  Gross issuance of municipal 
bonds remained solid in the first quarter, and yield spreads on  general obligation (GO) 
municipal bonds over comparable-m aturity Treasury securities were little changed, on 
net, over the intermeeting peri od.  A default by Puerto Rico on a wider range of debt, 
including its GO bonds, remains likely in the absence of a rest ructuring agreement with 
investors or congressional intervention.  Puerto Rico’s Governm ent Development Bank 
has a substantial debt payment  due in early May, and the next s izable payment of GO 
bonds is due in July.  In addition, t he Puerto Rican legislature passed a bill allowing the 
governor to declare a moratorium on debt payments.  However, ma rket participants 
reportedly consider the risks of broader spillovers from a poss ible default to be low.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCE 
Growth of residential real estat e (RRE) loans on banks’ books r emained subdued 
through the first quarter, and credit conditions stayed tight f or mortgage borrowers with 
low credit scores, hard-to-document income, or relatively high debt-to-income ratios.  A 
significant number of SLOOS responde nts reportedly eased lendin g standards on GSE-
eligible residential mortgages and witnessed stronger demand ov erall for RRE loans in 
the first quarter.  Over the in termeeting period, quoted intere st rates on 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages to well-qualified bo rrowers declined 17 basis points,  on net, in line with MBS 
yields and comparable-maturit y Treasury yields, and stand at about 3.44 percent, near 
their all-time lows. 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little cha nged and 
remained largely accommodative, with student and auto loans con tinuing to be broadly 
available and credit card lendi ng conditions relatively tight, particularly for borrowers 
with subprime credit scores.  Moreo ver, responses to the SLOOS indicate that during the 
first quarter, while credit card lending standards were little changed, a modest number of 
banks reported easing lending sta ndards on auto and other consu mer loans.  Over the 
same period, demand for auto loans  reportedly further strengthe ned at many banks.

Consumer loan balances continued to increase at a robust pace through February, and 
data on bank lending activities s uggest further growth through March.  Issuance of ABS 
continued to be robust in the f irst quarter, with their spreads  stabilizing at levels that 
remained a bit higher than usual. 
BANKING DEVELOPMENTS 
Growth of core loans and deposits  at commercial banks stayed ro bust during the 
first quarter.  Over the intermeeting period, the largest banks  reported declines in 
profitability during the first quarter due to reduced trading a nd investment banking 
revenues and low net interest mar gins.  However, for several ba nks, these declines in 
profitability were i n line with or slightl y better than analyst s’ consensus expectations.  
Stock prices of bank holding compa nies underperformed broad equity market indexes but 
edged higher on banks’ earnings reports later in the period, wh ile banks’ CDS spreads 
remained elevated. 
FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS AND SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS 
Over the intermeeting period, ta ke-up in overnight reverse repu rchase agreement 
(ON RRP) operations continued t o be well below average levels in 2015 and strikingly 
below the median dealer estimate of ON RRP take-up after liftoff in the Desk’s 
December Survey of Primary Dealer s.  The elevated triparty Trea sury repo volumes, 
combined with the high Treasury b ill issuance, likely depressed  take-up.  Low take-up 
has persisted despite recent conve rsions of prime money market mutual funds (MMFs) 
into government funds (see the box “Developments regarding the Implementation of 
Money Market Fund Reforms” for a discussion about ongoing prime  MMF conversions).  
Meanwhile, take-up on quarter-end was about $170 billion lower than on year-end; 
however, the increase in tak e-up on March 31 was in line with r ecent quarter-ends, 
suggesting cash investment opportu nities diminished somewhat as major borrowers— 
foreign banks, in particular—pare d their balance sheets on the statement date. 
Over the intermeeting period, th e effective federal funds and E urodollar rates both 
traded consistently at 37 basis points, although they both dipp ed to 25 basis points on the 
March quarter-end.3  The overnight repo rate for Treasury collateral, as surveyed by the 
Desk, stayed above the ON RRP offer rate of 25 basis points.  On quarter-end, the GCF

intraday standard deviation averaging 3 basis points.

 Developments  regarding  the Implementation   
of Money  Market Fund Reforms  
In July 2014,  the SEC adopted changes in the rules that govern the operation  of money market 
funds (MMFs).  The key reforms include requiring  floating net asset values (NAVs)  for prime  
institutional  funds and tax‐exempt institutional  funds and mandating  that all prime and tax‐
exempt funds have the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption  gates when their liquid 
assets fall below specified  thresholds.   These new rules go into effect in October 2016.1 
In response,  fund complexes  have announced  or completed  changes that will, on net, reduce 
prime fund assets under management  (AUM) by about $300  billion—approximately  20 percent  of 
the prime fund industry.  These changes  mostly reflect  conversions  of prime funds to 
government ‐only funds,  which allow funds  to avoid the gates‐and‐fees and floating NAV 
requirements.   Moreover,  some funds have been closed  or have left the MMF sector, and others 
may still be waiting to announce  a conversion.   In addition, prime funds with  about $100  billion in 
assets have completed  conversions  from institutional  to retail  funds,  which allows  them to avoid 
the floating NAV requirement.2 
The implementation  of the new rules could raise a number of issues for markets  and 
policymakers.   First, large moves from prime to government  funds require a shift in assets from 
private securities  to U.S. government  securities  and government  repurchase  agreements,  and 
these  changes could affect  credit spreads for money  market  instruments.  Funds  that have 
completed  conversions  to government  funds have eliminated  their holdings of private 
instruments, including  commercial  paper and certificates  of deposit, and increased  their holdings 
of Agency debt (figure 1).  Partly in preparation for this  shift, over the past year, prime funds in  
                                                 
1 A number of new regulations,  also  announced  in July 2014, will take effect  later this month.  These 
regulations  include additional  rules on asset diversification,  enhanced  disclosure  of information  allowing  investors  
to assess risks,  and enhancements  of the stress‐testing requirements  adopted  by the SEC in 2010.  
2 Under  the SEC’s Investment  Company  Act Rule 2a‐7, as amended,  retail MMFs  are funds  that have “policies 
and procedures  reasonably  designed  to limit all beneficial  owners of the fund to natural persons”  
(https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2014/33‐ 9616‐rule‐2a‐7‐amendments.pdf ).  Institutional  funds  are not subject  to 
such a restriction  and may be held primarily by institutional  investors.   The SEC imposed the floating  NAV 
requirement  only on institutional  funds  because, historically,  institutional  investors  have  been far more likely than 
retail investors  to redeem MMF shares  during episodes  of stress.

aggregate have substantially reduced their holdings of private instruments with more than 30 
days to maturity. Overall, money funds managed these sizable shifts by reallocating assets very 
gradually over a period of several months and, as a result, it is difficult to identify any price 
effects. 
Second, the implementation of MMF reforms could drive investors away from prime MMFs, 
which could be disruptive for short term funding markets. Although, to date, investors have not 
moved away from prime MMFs (see the blue hashed portions of the bars in figure 2), large and 
disruptive outflows from institutional prime funds could occur ahead of the October deadline, 
particularly if institutional investors want to avoid floating NAVs, gates, and fees. As a reported 
precaution against such redemptions, fund managers have increased, in aggregate, their holdings 
of liquid assets. 
Third, the shift in assets from prime MMFs to government MMFs could boost take up at the 
overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility because government funds typically 
invest larger shares of their assets in ON RRPs than do prime funds. That said, we have not 
observed signs of increased take up at the facility in response to the conversions. In fact, the 
average daily take up by government MMFs has remained under $35 billion over the intermeeting 
period. As regards ON RRP participation at quarter ends, when prime MMFs tend to place a large 
amount of their assets in the Fed’s facility, the reduction in the AUM of prime MMFs could damp 
ON RRP participation spikes. 
Fourth, the reduction in the AUM of prime MMFs should have a net positive effect on financial 
stability, as prime funds are particularly vulnerable to runs. However, the net effect depends on 
what happens to the assets previously held by prime funds and how investors—particularly 
institutional investors who have used prime funds for cash management—move their balances. 
So far, the money fund industry, and money markets more generally, appears to be adjusting 
relatively smoothly to the new rules. However, given that the adjustment is ongoing, the staff 
will continue to monitor both the transition and the efficacy of the SEC’s reforms.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth, 
the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly in line with the average over the past 
20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC).  We have maintained our assumption that 
the risks to our GDP projection are tilted to the downside, in par t because we view 
neither monetary nor fiscal policy as well positioned to offset large adverse shocks.  In 
addition, while there has recently been some improvement in global financial and 
economic conditions, downside risks emanating from abroad remain.  We view the risks 
around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, 
as skewed to the upside. We continue to see the risks around our inflation projection as 
weighted to the downside.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain 
low, and some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are at the low 
ends of their historical ranges. 
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the vulnerabilities of the U.S. 
financial system as moderate overall.  This assessment is due importantly to high capital 
positions at banks and insurance companies, sizable holdings of liquid assets at large 
banks, and below-trend leverage for the household sector.  That said, valuation pressures 
have increased in equity markets and commercial real estate in absolute terms, although 
such pressures are less apparent when judged relative to the low level of Treasury yields.  
Moreover, nonfinancial corporate firms’ leverage is elevated; although these corporations are not expected to face debt repayment difficulties in the near term, given their expected 
profits and the low interest rates, elevated leverage leaves these firms vulnerable to 
distress should profits unexpectedly weaken. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models. The first two 
scenarios explore the effects of shocks that weaken labor productivity growth and

premiums on long-duration Treasury securities slows economic growth. The fourth 
scenario considers the implications of long-term inflation expectations that are lower than 
in the baseline. In the fifth scenario, a U.K. exit from the European Union (EU) leads to 
increases in financial stress and an appreciation of the dollar. The final scenario 
considers the possibility that stronger growth abroad causes the dollar to depreciate 
substantially relative to the baseline. 
We illustrate the first two scenarios using the Board staff’s EDO model.  The next 
two scenarios are generated using the FRB/US model, a nd the last two scenarios use the 
multicountry SIGMA model.  In each of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed as in the baseline forecast by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.
1 
In all cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Weaker Labor Productivity, Weaker Labor Market 
Labor productivity growth has been weak over the past several years, averaging 
less than ½ percent per year from 2011 throu gh 2015.  In the baseline projection, 
productivity growth is assumed to pick up to an average annual rate of 1¼ percent in 
2017 and 2018.  However, as presented in the box “Alternative View: Productivity 
Acceleration Will Be Mo re Gradual” in the Domestic Economic Developments and 
Outlook section, the forces that have contributed to subdued productivity growth over the 
past several years may abate more slowly than is assumed in the baseline.  In this 
scenario and the next, the path of labor productivity is assumed to be the same as the one 
considered in the alternative view box: Labor productivity increases ½ percent in 2016, 
¾ percent in 2017, and 1 percent in 2018. The growth rate of labor productivity remains 
at 1 percent in 2019 and 2020 and gradually converges to the baseline path thereafter. 
In this scenario, the lower path of labor productivity is driven solel y by reduced 
total factor productivity. With a slower growth rate of total factor productivity, real GDP 
grows more slowly than in the baseline, averaging about 1½ percent per year over the 
next five years.  The bad news about future productivity causes a slight deterioration in 
labor market conditions by reducing households’ permanent income and depressing 
1 For the scenarios run in EDO and SIGMA, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the 
FRB/US simulations. One key difference relative to the FRB/US simulation is that the policy rules in EDO 
and SIGMA use a measure of slack equal to the difference betwe en actual output and the model’s estimate 
of the level of output that would occur in the absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

aggregate demand; accordingly, the unemployment rate follows a trajectory that is a bit 
higher than the baseline path. Lower total factor productivity increases firms ’ marginal 
costs of production, leading to inflation that rise s a little more quickly than in the baseline 
and reach es 2 percent in late 2018. The path for the fe deral funds rate is essentially 
unchanged from the baseline, a s the effect of a slightly higher path for the unemployment 
rate is offset by mildly higher inflation. 
Weaker Labor Productivity, Stronger Labor Market 
It is difficult to gauge all of the underlying sources behind weak labor 
productivity growth in recent years, a nd th is scenario presents an alternative set of 
economic forces with different implications for key macroeconomic outcomes.  In this 
scenario, the lower path of labor productivity is driven by a combination of lower total 
factor productivity growth and stronger aggregate demand, similar to the staff’s 
interpretation of the past several years.2 Real GDP and employment rise faster than in the 
first scenario, at rates that are more in line with the average paces seen since 2014. The 
unemployment rate declines more rapidly than in the baseline, reaching a low point of 
3¾ percent in 2019. With resource utilization tighter in this scenario, the path for core 
PCE price inflation is higher than in the baseline and in the first scenario. Core PCE 
price inflation peaks at 2¼ pe rcent in late 2018.  Reflecting both the lower unemployment 
rate and higher inflation, the federal funds rate rises faster than in the baseline a nd 
reach es 5¼ pe rcent by the end of 2020. 
Sharp Increases in Term Pre miums 
Measures of the term premiums on long-maturity Treasury securities have 
recently fallen further into negative territory. In the baseline projection, these term 
premiums are expected to increase gradually from their current levels to positive long-run 
average values.  However, a s noted in the “QS Assessment of Financial Stability,” the 
rise in term premiums could be abrupt.  In this scenario, we consider the possibility that 
term premiums on 5-y ear and 10-year Treasury securities rise more than 200 basis points 
in one year and that term premiums on 30- year Treasury securities rise 165 basis points. 
Sharp increases in Treasury term premiums lead to price declines across a broad 
range of long-duration assets including mortgages, c orporate bonds, and equities
2 In EDO and other DSGE models with both labor and capital as inputs to production, a positive 
shock to aggregate demand typically leads to a larger increase in hours than in output and thus to a lower 
labor productivity because the marginal product of labor declines with hours.

tightening overall financial conditions and thus exerting downward pressure on 
household consumption and business activity. Real GDP grows 1½ percent per year 
from 2016 throu gh 2018 , ½ percentage point below the baseline. The unemployment rate 
remains near 5 percent over the next five years. The path for inflation is a touch lower 
than in the baseline and reaches just under 2 percent at the end of 2020. Even though 
long-term Treasury yields are higher than in the baseline, the federal funds rate is lower, 
reflecting the weaker economic conditions. The federal funds rate rises to only 3 percent 
by late 2020. 
The adverse effects of a sharp increase in term premiums could plausibly be either 
smaller or larger than described in this scenario. For example, in implementing this 
scenario, we assume that the sharp increases in term premiums and the associated rises in 
yields will not cause widespread financial stress or disrupt the financial system and that 
their effects on economic activity will only come through the usual interest rate channels.  
If that assumption turned out to be wrong, the negative effects on economic conditions could be worse than those shown in this scenario. Alternatively, if term premiums have 
become more negative recently as a result of increased uncertainty about the economic 
outlook and some of the increases in term premiums are driven by the unwinding of such 
uncertainty effects, this unwinding could mitigate some of the adverse effects of the 
increases in term premiums described in this scenario. 
Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations 
In the baseline projection, PCE price inflation is projected to increase gradually to 
the Committee’s longer -run objective of 2 percent.  A key assumption behind this 
projection is that the level of long-term inflation expectations relevant for wage and price 
setting is currently consistent with PCE price inflation of 1¾ percent, a nd that 
expectations will eventually rise to a level consistent with 2 percent inflation.  However, 
a wide range of uncertainty surrounds this assumption, and some measures of longer-run inflation expectations are currently near the low ends of the ir historical ranges. In this 
scenario, we assume that long-term inflation expectations currently stand at 1.5 percent 
and that, going forward, households and businesses form their expectations adaptively based on past inflation.
3 
3 Long- term inflation expectations can persistently stay below the Committee’s target even when 
households and businesses are fully rational and forward looking if households and businesses perceive that

Core PCE price inflation is lower than in the baseline, reaching its trough of 
1.3 percent in early 2017, as subdued inflation expectations and low actual inflation are 
mutually reinforcing.  Thereafter, core inflation ris es gradually, reaching 1¾ percent in 
2020.  The path of the federal funds rate is lower than in the baseline, while the paths of 
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are roughly unchanged.  However, the effect of low inflation on the real economy could be adverse if, for example, there was a 
pronounced debt-deflation dynamic. 
Disorderly Brexit 
Although our baseline assumes that the U.K. electorate will vote to stay in the EU 
in the June 23 referendum, this outcome is far from assured.  In this scenario, we assume 
that the United Kingdom opts to leave the EU and that subsequent negotiations on new 
trade and financial arrangements between U.K. and EU authorities prove contentious.4 
U.K. household and business confidence deteriorates markedly, a nd financial conditions 
tighten sharply.  Moreover, concerns about the future of European integration also cause 
a persistent worsening of European financial conditions.  All told, EU GDP falls around 1¼ percent below baseline, with an even sharper decline in the United Kingdom, while 
flight- to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar to appreciate about 5 percent. 
The stronger dollar and some tightening of U.S. financial conditions cause U.S. 
real GDP growth to moderate to about 1¾ percent in 2016 and 2 percent in 2017. The 
U.S. unemployment rate falls less than in the baseline.  Weaker economic activity and 
falling import prices reduce U.S. core inflation to 1¼ pe rcent in 2016 and 2017. The 
federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline and is about 2¾ percent at 
the end of 2018.  
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar 
In our baseline forecast, the substantial downside risks facing the foreign 
economies diminish only gradually as foreign output growth picks up modestly and 
inflation slowly moves closer to central bank targets.  However, a number of factors
risks to future inflation are tilted to the downside. The lower-bound constraint on interest rates naturally 
tilts inflation risk to the downside and thus can depress long-term inflation expectations. See Timothy 
Hills, Taisuke Nakata, and Sebastian Schmidt (2016), “The Risky Steady State and the Interest Rate Lower 
Bound, Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016 -009 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, February), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.009 .

including highly accommodative foreign monetary policies, fiscal stimulus in some 
EMEs, and the unleashing of pent-up demand as financial conditions continue to 
improve could spur a stronger recovery abroad than we are currently projecting.  In this 
scenario, we assume that foreign GDP improves at a moderately faster pace than in our 
baseline so that the level of foreign output runs 1 percent above the baseline by early 
2018.  Increased optimism about the foreign recovery and the perception of diminished 
tail risks cause the broad real dollar to depreciate 8 percent by the end of n ext year, 
reversing about half of the appreciation that has occurred since the middle of 2014.

exports.  Consequently, U.S. real GDP expands 2¾ percent in 2017, nearly ½ pe rcentage 
point more than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate falls to 3¾ percent by the end 
of 2018.  Higher import prices and resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to reach 
2 percent by late 2017.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the baseline, 
reaching almost 4 percent by the end of 2018.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
