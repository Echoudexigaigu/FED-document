Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Since the April Tealbook, the news about economic activity has been mixed.  The 
incoming information about labor market conditions was considerably weaker than we 
had expected.  In addition, business investment appears to have underperformed, even relative to our pessimistic exp ectations.  In contrast, the lat est readings on consumer 
spending and net exports have been  better than we anticipated.  On balance, we still 
expect real activity to pick up no ticeably from its lackluster first-quarter pace, but our 
forecast for GDP growth in the second, third, and fourth quarters is modestly softer than 
in the previous Tealbook.  This  downward revisio n reflects our judgment that there is less 
momentum in the labor market and in business investment, and th at the recovery in 
residential construction is likely on a slower track than we th ought at the time of the April 
Tealbook. 
Beyond this year, our projection f or real GDP growth is quite close to our 
previous forecast.  We expect real GDP growth to increase to a 2½ percent pace in 2017 
and then edge down to around 2 percent in 2018—rates sufficient  to generate some 
further tightening of resource ut ilization.  As in the April Tealbook, we forecast real GDP 
to be 1½ percent above our estimate of its potential at the end  of 2018.  Likewise, we 
expect the unemployment rate  to be 4¼ percent, ¾ percentage point below our estimate 
of its natural rate. 
We now project that PCE prices wil l rise at an annual rate of 1 .2 percent over the 
first half of this year, 0.4 percentage point faster than in th e previous Tealbook, reflecting 
higher-than-expected recent re adings on energy prices and upwar d surprises in the non-
market-based component of core prices.  Beyond the near term, the inflation forecast is 
essentially unrevised.  We contin ue to project that PCE inflati on will move up to 
1.8 percent in 2018, as energy and impor t prices rise moderately and as resource 
utilization tightens further i n an environment of reasonably st able long-run inflation 
expectations. 
While the modal outlook has not  changed much, our perception is  that the 
downside risks to real activity m ay have increased somewhat sin ce the April Tealbook, as 
illustrated by the most recent labor market report.  We provide a more extensive discussion in the Risks and Uncertainty section.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is similar to the median projection 
from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus 
forecast in 2016, but it is somewhat above the Blue Chip in 2017. (Both of these 
forecasts are a month old; the next Blue Chip survey results will be available on 
June 10.) The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is in line with the others. 
The staff’s CPI inflation projection is similar to the others, while its forecast for both 
total and core PCE price inflation is a little lower than the SPF.

Revisions  to the Staff  Projection  since  the Previous  SEP
The  FOMC  most  recently  published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections,  or SEP,  following  the 
March  FOMC  meeting.  The  table  below  compares  the staff's  current  economic  projection  with  
the one  we presented  in the March  Tealbook.
Over  the three-year  projection  period,  the cumulative  growth  of real  GDP  is about  unrevised  from  
the March  forecast.  (Relative  to March,  our forecast  for real  GDP  growth  this  year  is a little  
lower,  whereas  growth  in 2017  and  2018  is a bit higher.)  The  unemployment  rate  is still  forecast  
to decline  to 4.3 percent  at the  end  of 2018,  the same  as in our  March  projection.
The  staff's  forecast  for total  PCE  price  inflation  has  been  revised  up slightly  in the first  half  of this  
year,  in large  part  reflecting  higher  energy  prices.  Core  PCE  price  inflation  in the first  half  also  
appears  to be running  a little  above  our March  forecast.  Given  our assumptions  that  energy  
prices  and  core  import  prices  will rise  further  and  our  forecast  of tightening  resource  utilization,  
we continue  to project  that  inflation  will move  up in the coming  years.  Both  total  and  core  
inflation  are projected  to reach  1.8 percent  in 2018.
Under  the intercept-adjusted  inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule  that  we now  use  to set the path  of 
monetary  policy,  the federal  funds  rate  rises  more  slowly  and  reaches  an average  of 2.65  percent  
in the fourth  quarter  of 2018,  around  50 basis  points  less  than  in our  March  projection.  About  half  
of that  downward  revision  to the terminal  funds  rate  reflects  the lower  longer-run  equilibrium  
rate  in this  forecast,  and  the remainder  reflects  the inertial  effects  of the medium-term  intercept  
adjustment  in the rule;  very  little  of it reflects  the small  net  change  in the inflation  and  output  
gaps.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
 The assumed path of the federal f unds rate is lower than in the  April 
Tealbook, primarily reflecting two a djustments that we made to the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule that we use t o mechanically set this rate in  our projection. 
o First, we lowered the real long-run equilibrium rate (r*) used in the rule 
from 1¼ percent to 1 percent.  Seco nd, we adjusted down the nea r-term 
path of the federal funds rate based on our interpretation that Committee 
participants implicitly have in mind a somewhat more accommodat ive 
reaction function than the iner tial Taylor (1999) rule.  These 
adjustments—and their implications  for the forecast—are describ ed in a 
recent memo to the Committee.1 
o With these changes, the rule generates an average federal funds rate of 
0.8 percent in the fourth quart er of this year and 2.7 percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2018, between 50 and 65 basis points, respectively, below their 
levels in our previous projecti on.  Had we combined the policy rule from 
the April Tealbook with our updated forecasts for inflation and resource 
utilization, the path of the fed eral funds rate would been revi sed down 
only 10 basis points in the f ourth quarter of 2016 and 20 basis  points in the 
fourth quarter of 2018. 
 We assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at its current le vel until the 
third quarter of next year and t hen begin to contract as the pr oceeds from 
maturing assets are no longer re invested.  The cessation of reinvestment is 
assumed to end three quarters l ater than in our April forecast, in part reflecting 
the lower projected path for the federal funds rate. 
Other Interest Rates 
 Compared with the April Teal book, we have revised down the proj ected path 
of the 10-year Treasury yield through 2018, primarily reflectin g the lower

projected path of future short-te rm interest rates.  Our projec tion continues to 
call for the 10-year Treasury yi eld to rise significantly over the medium term, 
reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window through  the period 
of extremely low short-term inter est rates as well as increases  in term 
premiums. 
 We revised down the paths for th e 10-year triple-B corporate bo nd rate and 
the 30-year mortgage rate broadly in line with the revision to Treasury yields. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 The projected path for equity pri ces is about the same as in th e April 
Tealbook.  Stock prices are project ed to increase about 3 perce nt per year, on 
average, through 2018. 
 Incoming data on house prices have been a little stronger than we expected, 
causing us to boost our forecast for house price appreciation to around 
5½ percent this year.2  According to one of the mod els that we monitor, house 
prices are about 7 percent above  the value predicted by their l ong-run 
relationship with rents; for perspective, this model estimates that housing was 
overvalued by 40 percent at its  peak in 2005.  Therefore, we co ntinue to 
expect house prices to decelerate to an average pace of about 3  percent per 
year in 2017 and 2018. 
Fiscal Policy 
 Our fiscal policy assumptions are unrevised in this forecast. We continue to 
anticipate that the federal budge t legislation that was passed at the end of last 
year, combined with ongoing modest growth in state and local pu rchases, will 
cause fiscal policy, aggregated a cross all leve ls of government , to boost real 
GDP growth ½ percentage point this year and by smaller amounts in 2017 
and 2018. 
2 CoreLogic recently changed the methodology for constructing th eir house price index.  We have 
not incorporated the new index into the June Tealbook because w e are still analyzing its implications for 
recent house price chan ges and overvaluation.

  Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 The rebound in foreign economic growth in the fir st quarter to an annual rate 
of 2½ percent was somewhat greater than we expected in the April Tealbook.  
In contrast, we have marked dow n our estimate of second-quarter  foreign 
GDP growth to 1¾ percent , largely reflecting what we view as te mporary 
factors.  As in the April Tealbook, we project aggregate foreign economic growth to pick up to 2¾ percent i n the second half of this year  and to remain 
at about that pace through 2018, supported by accommodative mon etary 
policies. 
 The broad nominal dollar has appr eciated about 1  percent since the time of the 
April Tealbook, with the rise being mostly against the emerging  market 
currencies, especially the Mex ican peso.  We expect the broad n ominal dollar 
to appreciate at about a 1½ per cent annual rate through the for ecast period, as 
market expectations for the fed eral funds rate move up toward the staff 
forecast.  Our forecast for dollar appreciation is similar to t hat in the April 
Tealbook despite a more gradual in crease in the projected feder al funds rate, 
as we boosted the assumed sensi tivity of the dollar to the proj ected tightening 
of U.S. monetary policy.  Rela tive to the April Tealbook, our p rojection for 
the broad real dolla r is about 2 percent higher by the end of 2 018. 
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil has increased about $7 per ba rrel since the 
close of the April Tealbook, reaching $51 per barrel.  The incr ease has been 
driven primarily by supply disrup tions, especially in Canada an d Nigeria, but 
also by indicators of stronger demand for oil.  Futures prices have increased 
by a similar amount as spot prices , with the December 2018 Bren t futures 
prices currently at $56 per barr el.  The upward slope of the fu tures curve is 
consistent with a slow closi ng of the supply glut that has weig hed on prices 
since 2014. 
 In contrast with prices for oil, p rices for industrial metals f ell back near their 
early 2016 lows amid concerns abou t the strength of demand, particularly in 
China.  Strong global demand helped push up agricultural prices , consistent 
with robust U.S. agricultural exports in April.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Real GDP is now estimated to have  increased at an annual rate o f 1¼ percent in 
the first quarter, ¾ percentage poi nt faster than in the April forecast.  We did not 
understand why GDP growth was as weak as had been earlier repor ted, and we view this 
revision as essentially correc ting that anomaly.  The incoming information has been 
mixed but is nonetheless consistent with a moderate pickup in r eal GDP growth in the 
second quarter to an annual rate of about 2 percent, ¼ percenta ge point lower than in the 
April Tealbook.3  In the second half of this year, we forecast real GDP growth to be 
around 2¼ percent, nearly ½ percenta ge point below the previous projection. 
 The recent data suggest that real PCE growth has stepped up markedly this 
quarter; these data include a solid gain in retail sales in April and a rebound in light motor vehicle sales in Apr il and May from the dip in Marc h.
4  We now 
project real PCE growth to pick up to a 3½ percent pace in the second quarter 
and to average 2½ percent in the f irst half of this year.  This pace is supported 
by earlier gains in household incomes and wealth, past declines  in energy 
prices, and still-favorable read ings on consumer sentiment. 
 In contrast, the near-term outl ook for business investment spending has 
deteriorated further since the April Tealbook.  Investment in e quipment and 
intangibles (E&I) is  now estimated to have  declined at a 5½ per cent pace in 
the first quarter—5 percentage poi nts more negative than our Ap ril Tealbook 
forecast.5  Available data suggest that E&I spending will flatten out in the 
current quarter, and we project it to pick up to a 3½ percent p ace in the second 
half of this year.  Low oil prices are forecast to continue to drag down 
investment in drilling and mini ng structures this quarter and the next, though 
we expect that spending in this sector will rebound some after that.  While the 
weakness in drilling and mining is understandable, we have exam ined a 
3 As displayed in the table “Fede ral Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q2 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projecti ons generated by the near-term forecastin g approaches used within the System, at 
2.3 percent, is similar to the  staff’s judgmental projection. 
4 The Census Bureau will publish May retail sales on June 14, th e first day of the FOMC meeting. 
5 The annual revision to the Censu s Bureau’s measures of manufac turing orders, shipments, and 
inventories, which covers 1997 to 2015, points to a level of real E&I spending at the end of 2015 that is 
about 3 percent lower than curre ntly published in the NIPA.  In  July, the BEA will incorporate this 
information and other new source data during its annual revisio n to the NIPA.

variety of hypotheses but remain somewhat puzzled as to why oth er business 
fixed investment has been so w eak in the past few quarters. 
 Incoming data on housing starts and home sales have been solid,  and we 
marked up our forecast for real residential investment spending  during the 
first half of this year.  Howev er, single-family housing permit s—which 
generally give a better indicat ion of the underlying trend in r esidential 
construction—have been moving esse ntially sideways since late l ast year.  As 
a result, we marked down our foreca st for the growth of residen tial investment 
in the second half of this year. 
 Import growth so far this year ha s been much weaker than we expected.  As a 
result, we now estimate that net exports added a small amount to real GDP 
growth in the first quarter, c ompared with the drag of about ¾ percentage 
point that was forecast in the  April Tealbook.  However, we project that net 
exports will subtract about ¼ perc entage point in the current q uarter, as 
imports pick up, and will subtract a  bit more than ¼ percentage  point in the 
second half of this year, slightl y less than in the April Tealb ook. 
 Industrial production ha s declined in six of  the past eight mon ths, led by a 
steep drop in oil and gas drilli ng and extraction; in addition,  the effects of 
earlier dollar appreciation ha ve weighed on factory output.  Manufacturing 
production rose only modestly in A pril, and the available indic ators, including 
production worker hours, point to a small decline in May.  We expect factory 
output to rise at only a subdued pace in the coming months, con sistent with 
the mixed signals from the natio nal and regional manufacturing surveys. 
Our medium-term forecast for re al GDP growth is about unrevised relative to the 
April Tealbook.  Compared with the previous forecast, revisions  to fundamentals were 
largely offsetting:  Lower interest rates and higher home value s provide small boosts to 
the forecast, whereas a stronger dollar and higher oil prices w ork in the opposite 
direction. 
 As in previous projections, real  GDP growth—at 2½ percent in 20 17 and 
2 percent in 2018—is expected to outpace our estimate of potent ial growth,

sustainable level; at the e nd of 2018, we forecast real GDP to be 1½ percent 
above potential. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Taken together, the April and Ma y employment reports point to l ess improvement 
in the labor market than we ha d projected in the April Tealbook. 
 Nonfarm payroll employment ro se an estimated 123,000 in April a nd—after 
adjusting for the effects of the Verizon strike—73,000 in May.6  On a strike-
adjusted basis, job gains averaged only 127,000 per month over the three 
months ending in May, almost 80,000 per month less than we proj ected in the 
April Tealbook.  We think the lat est published es timates probab ly overstate 
the softening in labor market conditions, and we marked down ou r near-term 
forecast by about 40,000 per month; we now project payrolls to rise about 
150,000 in June (net of the boost from the returning strikers) and at a similar 
pace in the third quarter. 
 We also judge the news from the household survey to have been w eaker, on 
balance, than we expected in the April Tealbook.  The labor for ce 
participation rate fell a cu mulative 0.4 percentage point over April and May, 
to 62.6 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower than our April fore cast.  After 
holding steady at 5.0 percent in April, the unemployment rate d ropped to 
4.7 percent in May, in part because an unusually large number o f unemployed 
persons exited the labor force .  We think some of these downwar d surprises in 
the household survey will unwind ne xt month; thereafter, both m easures are 
projected to move roughly sideway s for the rest of this year. 
 We continue to estimate that lit tle slack remains in the labor market.  In the 
current quarter, our projection pu ts the unemployment rate 0.2 percentage 
point below our estimate of its na tural rate, wh ile the participation rate stands 
0.2 percentage point below its tre nd.  Combining these two, we see the 
employment-to-population ratio as just a touch below its trend.   In addition, 
6 According to the BLS, payrolls i n May were held down about 35, 000 by workers on strike at 
Verizon.  These workers are now b ack on the job and should be i ncluded in the June payroll counts.

we view the share of employees w orking part time for economic r easons, 
which rose noticeably in May, as elevated. 
 The staff’s labor market condi tions index declin ed in April and  May, 
continuing a string of declines since January.  In recent months, the model has 
taken strong negative signals fr om the slowdown in private payr oll gains and 
the increase in involun tary part-time employment that were only  partly offset 
by a decline in the unemploymen t rate.  In contrast, the staff takes a different 
view and judges that the labor m arket has improved a bit furthe r on balance. 
With regard to aggregate suppl y, we lowered our assumption for structural 
productivity growth in 2017 and 2018 but raised trend business- sector hours growth by 
the same amount.  Taken together, these adjustments leave poten tial output growth 
unrevised in the medium term at 1½ to 1¾ percent.  (Our medium- term assumptions are 
in line with the available figures from the CBO, the OECD, and some other outside 
forecasters.) 
 We lowered our forecast for st ructural productivity growth 0.2 percentage 
point in each of 2017 and 2018, to 1¼ per cent.  This revision reduced the 
acceleration in productivity over the medium term and brought o ur forecast in 
line with the average of produc tivity growth over the past 10 y ears.  We also 
took some signal from recent upward surprises to business-secto r hours and 
raised its trend growth rate  0.2 percentage point in each year. 
 With first-quarter GDP grow th having been revised up ¾ percenta ge point, we 
reversed the technical adjustmen t that we implemented in the Ap ril Tealbook 
to insulate our estimate of the output gap from what we judged at the time to 
be anomalously weak spending data .  As a result, we revised up potential 
GDP growth in 2016 by 0.2 percentage poi nt, to 1.6 percent—the same rate of 
growth as in the March Tealbook. 
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed,  the outlook for the 
labor market is similar to our April projection. 
 The contour of job gains roughly f ollows that of GDP growth, wi th average 
monthly increases stepping up from 160,000 this year to 190,000  next year 
before slowing to 150,000 in 2018.

 These job gains are sufficient t o cause the unemployment rate t o fall to 
4.3 percent at the end of 2018, 0.7 percentage point below our estimate of its 
natural rate. 
 The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend next year 
and in 2018, as sustained job gain s and rising wages continue t o draw 
individuals into the labor for ce.  As a result, the participati on rate is about 
0.1 percentage point above its t rend level at the end of 2018. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The most recent data corroborate  our expectation that core PCE price inflation 
will step down in the second quarter.  Core PCE prices rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months 
ending in April, and we continue t o expect that 12-month change s in core prices will 
remain close to this pace in the coming months.  At the same time, recent readings on 
retail energy prices  have been higher th an we expected. 
 Core prices are now estimated t o have risen at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in 
the first quarter, a little highe r than we expected in the Apri l Tealbook, largely 
because of upward revisions that were concentrated in nonmarket  prices.  In 
line with our usual practice, we  have taken no signal for the inflation outlook 
from the surprise in nonmarket  prices.  Moreover, the data on core inflation in 
April came in close to our forecast, and we continue to project  second-quarter 
core PCE inflation of  about 1½ percent. 
 After falling sharply in the first quarter, PCE energy prices a re now projected 
to rise at a 17 percent annual rate in the second quarter, noti ceably more than 
in the April Tealbook.  Consequently, we now expect total PCE inflation to 
pick up from a ¼ percent annual rate in the first quarter to ab out 2 percent in 
the second quarter. 
 Following six consecutive quarterl y declines, core import price s are expected 
to rise at a ¾ percent annual ra te in the current quarter and t hen at a 1 percent 
average annual rate through the  rest of the forecast period.  T his turnaround is 
consistent with our projection that rising foreign inflation and flat commodity 
prices will offset the effects of further modest dollar appreciation.

Recent readings on longer-term inflation expectations have been  mixed, but the 
overall picture appears consis tent with our view that longer-te rm inflation expectations 
remain reasonably stable. 
 Longer-run inflation expectations from the University of Michig an Surveys of 
Consumers remained at 2.5 percent in May, tying the lowest read ings in the 
history of the series.  Three-year-ahead expected inflation fro m the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York Survey of Consumer Expectations rose 
0.3 percentage point in April, t o 2.8 percent, but remains well  below the levels 
seen a couple of years ago. 
 The median projection for 10-year  average PCE price inflation f rom the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters moved back up to 2 percent i n the second 
quarter. 
 Market-based measures of longer-t erm inflation compensation hav e moved 
down somewhat since the April Tealbook and remain near the low end of their 
historical ranges. 
Beyond the near term, our outlook f or inflation is essentially unrevised.  We 
continue to project that cor e PCE inflation will move up to 1.8  percent in 2018, primarily 
reflecting the waning restraint f rom earlier declines in energy  and import prices.  With 
consumer food and energy prices e xpected to rise roughly in line with core prices after 
this year, we project that total  PCE prices will rise at the sa me pace as core PCE prices. 
Our forecast for hourly compensation growth is little changed. 
 Incorporating information from une mployment insurance tax recor ds caused 
the four-quarter change in busin ess-sector hourly compensation in 2015 to be 
revised up to 3¼ percent, ¾ percentage point higher than the pr evious 
estimate.  We think this pace of increase is somewhat faster th an can be 
accounted for by the relevant fundamental factors; therefore, we continue to 
project that this measure of c ompensation per hour will increas e at about a 
3 percent pace over the medium term, as the small downward revi sions to 
structural productivity offset the greater upward pressure on w ages from the 
tighter labor market.

 The employment cost index (ECI) fo r private workers rose at an annual rate of 
2.6 percent between December a nd March, in line with our April Tealbook 
forecast.  For the year ending in March, the ECI rose 1.8 percent, though we 
expect this 12-month change t o move up to 2¼ percent in the sec ond quarter 
as a low reading from a year ago drops out of the  calculation.  We continue to 
expect that ECI compensation growth will edge up to about 2½ pe rcent by the 
end of the medium term. 
 Average hourly earnings of all employees, a less comprehensive but more 
timely measure of wages from the establishment survey, increased 2½ percent 
over the 12 months ending in May, i n line with our April Tealbo ok forecast.  
An alternative measure of hourl y wage growth calculated by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta has move d up more noticeably in the pas t year and a 
half.7  Because this measure is less affected by changes in the composition of 
employment over the business cycl e, it appears to be more procyclical than 
average wages in the establishment survey. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 The natural rate of unemploymen t remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP 
rises at about its long-run valu e of 1.9 percent starting in 20 20. 
 With the economy running above its potential through 2021 and inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percen t objective, the federal funds  rate rises 
above its long-run value in 2019.  It reaches a level just abov e 3.5 percent in 
2020 and 2021 and moves back toward its long-run value of 3 per cent 
thereafter. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on l onger-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by 2022. 
7 The Wage Growth Tracker is calcu lated using microdata from the household survey.  It is the 
median 12-month change in the hourly wage for all individuals w ho are employed both in the current 
month and in the same month one year earlier (though, due to da ta limitations, not necessarily at all times 
between those two dates nor at the same employer).

 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates f urther and 
rises at an annual rate  of 1½ percent in 2020 and 2021.  The unemployment 
rate is 4.3 percent in 2019 and the n starts rising gradually toward its assumed 
natural rate in subsequent years. 
 PCE price inflation moves up fro m 1.8 percent in 2018 to the Co mmittee’s 
long-run objective by 2020. 
 In this Tealbook, we have revis ed down the long-run value of th e 10-year 
Treasury yield from 4.1 percent to 3.5 percent.  This adjustmen t reflects the 
¼ percen tage point reduction in the longer-run equilibrium leve l of the real 
federal funds rate as well as a lowering of the longer-run term  premium on 
10-year Treasury securities by 30 ba sis points.  We view these adjustments as 
a reassessment of the level of interest rates that is consisten t with the 
attainment and maintenance of f ull employment and price stabili ty.  
Accordingly, we did not allow th e adjustments to affect our projections for 
inflation and real activity.  T he reassessment of r* extends a series of 
downward adjustments and takes us  a little closer to various mo del-based 
estimates of the long-run equilibrium rate; the revision to the  term premium 
extends into the long term the adjustment that we made in the m edium-term 
projection of the April Tealbook a nd attempts to better reflect  the apparent 
downward trend in the term premium.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
The pace of foreign growth in the first quarter , at 2½ percent,  turned out to be 
somewhat greater than we expected at the time of the April Tealbook.  However , more 
recent indicators have been a touch softer than expected , and several temporary factors — 
wildfires in Canada, an earthquake in Japan, and the fears of “Brexit” in the United 
Kingdom—have weighed on second-quarter growth.  Thus, we see growth slowing to 
1¾ percent in the current quarter before rising to a near -trend pace of 2¾ percent in the 
second half, in part as growth bounces back from the effects of these temporary factors. 
We expect that growth will remain at around a 2¾ percent pace for the remainder 
of the forecast period—a projection about unchanged from the April Tealbook.  Growth 
in the medium term is expected to stay subdued relative to its p re-crisis pace, in part 
because p otential growth rates have declined  in both advanced foreign economies (AFEs) 
and emerging market economies (EMEs) .  This moderation in potential growth , in turn , 
reflects a widespread step -down in labor productivity growth , the causes of which are 
challenging to fully explain  (for an analysis of the AFEs, see the box “ The International 
Productivity Slowdown ”).  We assum e potential growth abroad remains flat at its current 
pace in our forecast, but further declines in potential growth remain a risk. 
The global economy continues to face other risks as well —importantly , the 
imminent prospect of a “leave” vote in the U.K. Brexit referendum on June 23 (see the 
alternative scenario “Disorderly Brexit ” in the Risk s and Uncertainty s ection)  and the 
continued uncertainty associated with the possibility of a hard landing in China resulting 
from mounting financial vulnerabilities .  Moreover, the process of monetary policy 
normalization by the Federal Reserve, gradual as it is likely to be, could have greater 
spillovers than we expect, especially to EMEs. These risks take on greater significance in 
the context of headwinds to global growth that have pushed monetary and fiscal policy 
near their limits, constraining policy responses to further negative shocks.  
In Japan and Europe, 12-month core inflation has been at or below 1 percent, and 
headline inflation has been near zero  in part because of past declines in oil prices.  
Despite diminishing labor market slack in many countries, wage growth has also failed to 
pick up convincingly.  The more recent increase in oil prices, as well as continued 
reductions in slack, should boost inflation, though it w ill likely remain well below the

 The International Productivity Slowdown   
The slowdown in U.S. labor productivity growth has attracted much attention  of late, with 
vigorous debate on whether th e slowdown represents the lingering effect of the Global Financial 
Crisis (GFC) or m arks the start of an era of prolonged lower economic growth.  T his discussion 
reviews recent developments in productivity across the advanced economies (AEs)  and relates 
them to our foreign outlook . 
As seen in figure 1, since the GFC,  labor productivity growth in the foreign  AEs has 
underperformed such growth in the United States , and  the slowdown  relative to prior averages 
has generally been much larger as well.  For foreign AEs, as for the United States, the slowdown 
typically  predated the GFC, although  the pace of growth clearly slowed further after the GFC.  
The slowdown in labor productivity  appears to reflect  both a smaller contribution from capital 
deepening (changes in the capital–labor ratio) and a lower growth rate of total factor 
productivity (TFP , a measure of how efficiently labor and capital are combined to produce 
output ).  The step -down in capital deepening has been linked to a collapse in investment in the 
AEs in the wake of the GFC  (figure 2) , which  in many cases has yet to return to its pre- crisis peak .  
However, much of the lower labor productivity growth can be accounted for by  slower TFP 
growth  (figure 3) , which  for many countries has averaged well below pre-crisis rates . 
The global slowdown in TFP growth has several possible explanations, with some authors 
emphasizing factors that predate the GFC.  For example, Gordon (2012) sees it as part of a secular 
decline in technological progres s—reflecting diminished capacity to introduce major 
innovations —that is likely to persist into the coming decades.1  Relatedly, evidence suggests that 
the influence of the production and use of information technology —an important factor in 
boosting product ivity since the mid -1990s —began to fade in the early  2000s.2

Other  explanations  link  the weakness  in TFP  growth  to the GFC. First,  tight  financial  conditions  
and  weak  demand  during  and  after  the GFC  led to a sharp  decline  in business  research  and  
development  (R&D)  spending:  As shown  in figure  4, growth  in business-sector  R&D  after  the GFC  
has been  much  slower  than  in the  two  preceding  decades. 3 Second,  the GFC  impaired  both  the 
process  of worker  reallocation  toward  more-productive  firms  and  the  rate  of new  business  
formation. 4 As seen  in figure  4, the rate  of business  formation —measured  by new  business  start ­
ups relative  to the economically  active  population —remained  well  below  its 2007  value  in all the 
AEs  except  Canada.  Third,  historical  cross-country  evidence  indicates  a negative  relationship  
between  TFP growth  and  labor  input. 5 This  pattern  suggests  that  the relatively  low  wages  and  
large  amount  of labor  market  slack  following  the GFC  may  have  led firms  to feel  less  urgency  in 
making  efficiency-enhancing  investments.  Finally,  although  greater  trade  integration  in the 
decades  before  the GFC  boosted  TFP—as countries  specialized  in producing  goods  in which  they  
had  a comparative  advantage —the sharp  deceleration  in international  trade  in the wake  of the 
GFC  may  have  halted  these  trade-related  TFP  gains.
All told,  it seems  plausible  that  some  of the GFC-related  factors  restraining  productivity  growth  
may  eventually  fade  and  that  we will see  a substantial  rise  in productivity  growth  from  its anemic  
post-GFC  pace.  Even  with  some  recovery,  however,  the staff  sees  labor  productivity  growth  as 
likely  to remain  noticeably  below  pre-crisis  averages  in the medium  to longer  run. Accordingly,  
the staff  forecasts  potential  output  growth  in the foreign  AEs  to edge  up gradually  to around  
1/2 percent  by 2018,  slightly  above  its average  rate of about  1% percent  over  the 2008-15  period 
but still noticeably  below  its 2 percent  pace  just before  the GFC. Actual  GDP  growth  in foreign  
AEs is expected  to run well above  potential  as accommodative  monetary  policies  help reduce  
resource  gaps.

2 percent target in the euro area and Japan throughout the forecast  period.  Similarly, 
higher oil prices should continue to raise inflation in EMEs in the near term. 
However , with inflation still low and growth prospects uncertain, monetary policy 
in the AFEs as well as many emerging Asian economies  should remain accommodative.  
In Latin America, where central banks have been striving to bolster their anti -inflation 
credibilit y in the face of sharp currency depreciations , policies have been tightening. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Canada.  After a very weak 2015, GDP growth rebounded to 2.4 percent in 
the first quarter, reflecting strong consumption and surges in resi dential 
investment and exports.  However, as  a result of disruptions in oil production 
following wildfires in  Alberta, we expect GDP growth to be flat in the second 
quarter, with a nearly full payback coming in the second half as production 
recovers .  The recent rise in oil prices and the depreciation of the Canadian 
dollar, along w ith accommodative monetary and fiscal policy, should boost 
growth over the next year.  We expect GDP growth then to settle at around 
2 percent  by 2018, a projection slightly higher than in the April Tealbook.  We 
continue to expect that the Bank of Canada will next increase its policy rate in 
mid-2017. 
• United Kingdom. First-quarter GDP growth  slowed to 1.4 percent from 
2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015.  T his deceleration reflected 
disappointing net exports and sluggish investment, which was most likely 
affected by uncertainty around the upcoming vote on leav ing the EU.  Recent 
indicators, such as lower PMIs, subdued consumer confidence, and a fall in 
investment intentions, suggest that uncertainty continues to weigh on economic activity .  Thus, we marked down our second-quarter GDP growth to 
1½ percent, ½ percentage point lower than in our April forecast.  In line with 
our assumption tha t voters will choose to stay in the EU, we project that as 
Brexit uncertainty dissipates , growth will pick up in the second half of this 
year to 2¼ percent and hold at around that rate over the remainder of the 
forecast period.  With the path of output somewhat weaker, we now expect the 
Bank of England to wait until the first quarter of 2017 to begin raising its 
policy rate, one quarter later than assumed in the April Tealbook.

• Japan.  GDP rebounded in the first quarter, posting higher- than-expected 
growth of 1.9 percent. However, w e take little signal from this rebound, 
which was driven by unusually weak imports as well as data not being 
adjusted for the leap day. More recent data, including the manufacturing 
PMIs through May, were  disappointing ; in addition, the earthquake in April 
disrupted supply chains.  Given these considerations , as well as payback from 
the seasonal boost , we expect a mild contraction this quarter. 
After the current quarter , we project Japan ese growth will average about 
1 percent throughout the forecast period.  Our forecast over the medium term 
is slightly higher than in the April Tealbook, as w e now expect that a special 
fiscal package will be enacted  after the July upper house election.  Moreover, 
amid weak economic conditions, Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced that 
the planned consumption tax hike will be postponed 2½ years , from April 
2017 to October 2019.  Because we had previously assumed only a one- year 
delay in the tax hike, this announcement substantially rais es our outlook for 
2018.  W e expect the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further by its 
July meeting in response to modest growth prospects and weak inflation. 
• Euro Area. GDP growth accelerated from 1 .7 percent in the last quarter of 
2015 to 2.2 percent in the first quarter of 2016, partly reflecting transitory 
factors such as a recovery from disruptions late last year associated with the 
terrorist attacks in Paris .  Recent indicators, such as PMIs and business 
confidence, suggest that growth moderated to 1½ percent in the current 
quarter.  W e expect GDP to accelerate to 1¾ percent in the second half and to 
nearly 2 percent in 2017 and 2018, just a touch below our April Tealbook 
projection on account of higher oil prices.  We expect the European Central 
Bank to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy 
throughout the forecast period. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• China. Recent indicators have been somewhat disappointing but remain 
consistent with a pickup in growth in the second quarter to 6¾ percent from 
5¾ percent in the first quarter .  Exports, which exerted a significant drag on 
growth in the first quarter , should provide a small boost in the current quarter.  
In addition, e asier monetary and fiscal policies in recent quarters appear to be

supporting growth, with infrastructure spending accelerating and the real 
estate sector in particular getting a boost from easier credit conditions. 
However, Chinese policymakers have been trying to limit expectations for 
additional stimulus, pointing out the ir intent to rein in credit growth and 
advance economic reforms .  As such, we expect the pickup in growth to last 
only a few quarters.  We see growth falling to just over 6 percent by early next 
year and  to 5¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, reflecting both a 
diminution of policy stimulus and slower growth of China’s potential output.  
Higher food prices have driven up inflation recently, but we expect inflation 
to return to 2½ pe rcent early next year. 
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth remained a lukewarm 2 ¾ percent in 
the first quarter , ¾ percentage point lower than in the April Tealbook.  
Domestic demand remained weak —especially  in Korea —while real exports 
dropped.  However, April exports have improved somewhat over earlier in the 
year, and PMI readings through May have been on an upward trajectory.  We 
thus expect growth to pick up to 3½ percent in the second quarter.  Growth 
should edge up to 3¾ percent over the remainder of the forecast , ¼ percentage 
point lower  than we expected in April, as we have reassessed the rate of 
potential GDP growth for the region . 
• Mexico .  Real GDP growth jumped to 3.3 pe rcent in the first quarter , 
1 percentage point above our April Tealbook estimate.  Monthly data suggest that t he pickup was  due to a n increase in household demand and a jump  in 
fixed investment despite the drag from the weak oil sector .  For the second 
quarter, we have penciled in a drop in growth to a subdued 2½ percent as 
household demand softens and the surge in investment fades.  We then expect 
growth to move up gradually to 3 percent by late 2017.  Although f iscal 
consolidation will be a drag on activity, an improvement in U.S. 
manufacturing a ctivity and the 15 percent real  depreciation of the peso since 
mid-2014 should provide some boost.  We expect the Bank of Mexico to raise 
its policy rate from 3¾ percent to 6 percent by the end of 2018, tracking the 
federal funds rate upward. 
• Brazil. Real GDP again declin ed in the f irst quarter, falling 1.1 percent .  
However, this contraction was significantly less than the 3 percent decline we

had estimated in the  April Tealbook.  Although domestic demand continued to 
contract amid rising unemployment, the external sector provided substantial 
support to growth, as real exports surged nearly 30 percent at an annual rate 
and imports contract ed 20 percent .  Given the country’s political and 
economic challenges,  we do not see Brazil climbing out of recession until next 
year.  Vice President Michel Temer became the interim president in mid -May 
after the Senate voted to begin the impeachment trial of President Dilma 
Rousseff.  Although Temer has appointed a highly regarded economic team , 
observers remain skeptical that the new government will be able to deliver 
needed fiscal and structural reforms .

Financial Developments 
Domestic financial market condi tions remained fairly accommodative over the 
intermeeting period.  Equity price indexes and corporate bond s preads were little 
changed, on net, and, in aggregate , corporations continued to t ap credit markets at a solid 
pace.  Credit also remained broadl y available to households, ex cept for higher-risk 
borrowers in some markets.  The market-implied near-term path o f the federal funds rate 
flattened somewhat, on balance, ov er the intermeeting period.  The release of the April 
FOMC minutes had pushed up the path noticeably, but that increa se was reversed 
following the disappointing May emp loyment report.  The flatter domestic policy path, 
along with an apparent decline in global risk sentiment early i n the period, pulled down 
longer-term Treasury yields and AFE sovereign yields.     
 Based on market quotes, the probabi lity of a rate hike in June fell to near zero 
after the May jobs report.  The  implied odds of an increase at the July FOMC 
meeting remain near 20 percent. 
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities decli ned 5, 16, and 
22 basis points, respectively.  Similarly, AFE 10-year sovereig n yields fell 
significantly. 
 Market-based measures of inflation compensation at near horizons were little 
changed even as oil prices rose.  Forward measures of inflation  compensation 
at far horizons declined modes tly, with TIPS-based measures fal ling more 
than those based on inflation swaps. 
 The broad dollar index appreciat ed by ¾ percent, reflecting a 1 ¾ percent 
increase against EME currenc ies.  The dollar was unchanged, on net, against 
AFE currencies. 
 Shifting perceptions about the p robability of “Brexit” moved the dollar value 
of the British pound, but, on net, both the odds of Brexit from  betting sites and 
the pound were little changed.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Domestic Market Developments 
Market-based estimates of the pr obability of a rate hike at the  June FOMC 
meeting were highly variable dur ing the intermeeting period.  The probability for June 
fell to near zero in early Ma y, jumped to 34 percent after the release of the April FOMC 
minutes and other Federal Rese rve communications, and dropped a gain to near zero after 
the May jobs report.  An i mplied probability of roughly 18 perc ent remains attached to an 
increase at the July FOMC meeting.  In the medium term, the fed eral funds rate path 
implied by a straight read of mar ket quotes declined a bit on n et.  The implied federal 
funds rates at the ends of 2016 and 2017 fell 5 basis points an d 11 basis points, 
respectively, though some of these declines could reflect reduc tions in term premiums. 
Consistent with market-based es timates, respondents to the Desk ’s June surveys 
of primary dealers and market pa rticipants assigned probabiliti es of near zero and 
22 percent to rate hikes in June and July, respectively.  Indee d, the median respondent in 
each survey now expects onl y one hike in 2016, down from two hikes in the April 
surveys.  However, the most likely path of the target federal f unds rate in 2017 was 
relatively little changed fo r the median respondent. 
The nominal Treasury yield c urve flattened, on net, over the in termeeting period, 
mainly reflecting another round of declines in longer-term rate s.  Two-year yields 
decreased 5 basis points and 10-ye ar yields fell 22 basis point s, leaving the spread 
between yields on 2- and 10-year T reasury securities near its l owest level since 2007.  
Moreover, declines in Treasury forward rates were most pronounc ed at long horizons, 
with the 1-year forward r ate ending in 10 years dropping 34 basis points.  While a 
significant portion of the declines  across the yield curve was spurred by the May jobs 
report, yields at longer maturities had been drifting down earl ier in the period, consistent 
with an apparent declin e in global risk sen timent.  Some market  participants attributed the 
decline in domestic yields to h eavy demand from foreign investo rs.1  (See the box “Have 
Financial Conditions Become More Sensitive to Changes in Policy  Expectations in 
1 However, the conjectures of strong foreign demand cannot be su bstantiated because data on 
foreign net purchases of Treasury securities (collected through  the Treasury International Capital System) 
are not yet available for the intermeeting period.

 Have Financial  Conditions  Become More Sensitive  to  
Changes  in Policy Expectations  in Recent Months?  
Some market commentaries  have suggested  that broad financial conditions  may have become 
more sensitive  to changes  in the perceived  stance of  monetary  policy in recent months.  In a 
recent Board briefing, the staff presented  evidence  that the exchange  value of the dollar seems  
to have become more sensitive  to changes  in domestic short‐term  interest rates over the  past 
two years.1  We examine the sensitivities  of longer‐term interest rates and  broad equities to 
changes in short‐term  interest rates,  which we take as a proxy for changes  in the perceived  
stance of  monetary  policy.  In doing so, we focus on sensitivities  around two types  of releases:  
FOMC releases (statements  and minutes)  and key domestic macroeconomic  data releases 
(nonfarm  payrolls).   We find that while the sensitivities  of longer‐term interest rates and equities 
to changes  in policy expectations  are time varying,  their current levels are not elevated.  
The figure  below plots the time‐varying sensitivities  of 10‐year Treasury  rates and S&P futures 
around FOMC releases (on the left) and around nonfa rm payrolls releases (on the right).   We 
regress changes  in 10‐year Treasury  rates and S&P futures over a narrow window  surrounding  
each type  of release on the corresponding  changes in the 2‐year Treasury  yield using a two‐ year 
rolling sample.2  The plotted  sensitivities  can be interpreted  as the response  of each variable  to an 
unexpected  25 basis point increase in  the expected  path of policy as proxied by the 2‐year 
Treasury yield.3 
As shown by  the black line in the left panel, on average,  a 25 basis  point increase in  the 2‐year rate 
following  FOMC releases has been associated  with about  a 19 basis point increase in  the 10‐year 
rate.  However, this  sensitivity  of the 10‐year rate to changes  in policy expectations  has varied  
  
                                                 
1 See Stephanie  Curcuru  (2016), “The International  Outlook,”  briefing,  Board of Governors  of the Federal 
Reserve System, Division of International  Finance,  April 25. 
2 The change for the equity  index is in percentage  terms, while  the change for interest rates is in levels.  Both 
are computed  over a 30‐minute window, starting from 5 minutes prior to the release  to 25 minutes  after the 
release.  Instead of a regular least‐ squares regression  method, we use a least absolute  deviations  regression  
method to mitigate the effect of a few influential  observations.    
3 Some of the changes in the 2‐year yield may reflect changes in term premiums,  as the 2‐year yield may still 
contain a small term premium  component  despite its relatively  short  maturity.

over time, declining during the 2005–07 “conundrum period” and then rising after the recent 
financial crisis during the first two large scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) in 2009 and 
through 2011. The sensitivity peaked in the summer of 2013 during the socalled taper tantrum 
episode but has fallen back since and is now at levels comparable with those prior to the crisis. 
The sensitivity of domestic equities (the red line) to changes in policy expectations following 
FOMC releases has generally been negative, with a 25 basis point change in the 2year rate 
inducing an average decline of about 1.1 percent in the S&P 500. This sensitivity has also varied 
over time and became significantly more negative during the taper tantrum, consistent with the 
sensitivity of longer term rates during this episode. The sensitivity is currently at levels 
comparable with those prior to the crisis.4 
As shown in the right panel, the sensitivity of long term rates to changes in policy expectations 
(the black line) following nonfarm payroll releases rose from 2010 to 2014 when both investors 
and policymakers focused heavily on LSAPs. This behavior would be expected to result in 
increased sensitivity of long term rates because a positive surprise in an employment report likely 
would have led investors to anticipate less accommodation in the form of asset purchases, 
putting upward pressure on term premiums affecting long term yields. At the same time, the 
Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate probably tended to damp upward 
revisions in the short end of the yield curve. Stock price responses to changes in short term rates 
(the red line) around the time of employment reports are generally positive, in contrast to the 
pattern seen around FOMC communications. This positive response reflects that fact that 
positive or negative news about the economy tends to move the expected path of short term 
rates and stock prices in the same direction. The magnitude of this response increased for 
several years following the crisis. Over that period, the FOMC’s forward guidance likely tended to 
damp the change in near term policy expectations. At the same time, perceptions of tail risks to 
the domestic and global outlook were probably heavily influenced by news about the U.S. 
economy, resulting in significant changes in U.S. stock prices. More recently, the sensitivities of 
both long term rates and stock prices to short term rates around employment reports have 
returned to more normal levels. 
In summary, whereas the sensitivity of the exchange value of the dollar to domestic short term 
rates has increased over the past two years, the sensitivities of other indicators of domestic 
financial conditions, such as longer term interest rates and equities, have not risen and are 
currently at levels seen prior to the crisis. Furthermore, the standard errors of all these sensitivity 
estimates (not shown) have remained stable in recent months. Nevertheless, the staff will 
continue to monitor developments in this area. 
4 For example, Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) find that a 1 percentage point surprise increase in the 
federal funds rate target would lead the broad equity index to decline about 4 percentage points and the 2year 
Treasury yield to increase about 45 basis points within the halfhour window surrounding the FOMC statement 
announcements from July 1991 through December 2004, which would imply about a 2 percentage point decline in 
the equity index for a 25 basis point increase in the 2year yield. See Refet S. Gürkaynak, Brian Sack, and Eric T.

Recent Months?” for an analysis  of the sensitivity of financial  conditions to the 2-year 
Treasury yield.)   
Five-year inflation compensat ion based on TIPS was little chang ed, while 5-to-
10-year inflation compensati on decreased 15 basis points.  A sw aps-based measure of 
5-to-10-year inflation compensation moved down less than its TI PS-based counterpart, 
consistent with declines in the  TIPS-based measure being partia lly driven by elevated 
demand for long-term nominal Treasury securities. 
Broad stock price indexes moved within a narrow range and were little changed, 
on net, over the intermeeting peri od.  In line with low realize d volatility, one-month 
ahead option-implied volatilit y on the S&P 500 index—the VIX— r emained near the 
lower end of its historical distribution.  Spread s of 10-year triple-B-rated corporate bond 
yields over those of comparable- maturity Treasury securities were little changed on 
balance.  High-yield spreads widened by 15 basis points, mainly for firms outside of the 
energy sector (which saw narrowed spreads amid rising oil prices).  (For a longer-horizon 
view of Treasury securities, i nflation compensation, and other key financial indicators, 
see the box “Longer-Term Look Back a t Financial Market Developm ents.”) 
Foreign Developments 
The major driver of foreign finan cial markets since the April F OMC meeting has 
been shifting views about Fede ral Reserve policy and the underl ying strength of the U.S. 
economy, with deteriorating risk s entiment early in the period also playing a role.  On 
balance, AFE sovereign yields a nd foreign equity markets declin ed, outflows from EME 
equity funds resumed, and EME bond spreads widened a touch.  AFE 10-year sovereign 
yields were down as much as 39 ba sis points, with the exception of Japan, where yields 
remained near negative 10 basis  points.  Fluctuating expectatio ns of the likelihood of 
Brexit and the provisional agreem ent of European finance minist ers to avert a Greek 
default left little lasting imp rint on global financial markets .   
The broad nominal dollar is ¾ perc ent higher, on net, since the April FOMC 
meeting.  The dollar rose with expe ctations of U.S. monetary po licy tightening for much 
of the period but then partially retraced following the U.S. la bor report.  The dollar’s 
1¾ percent increase against the cu rrencies of the EMEs has been  primarily driven by an 
outsized 5½ percent fall in the M exican peso.  The dollar also climbed 1 percent against

Longer‐Term Look Back at Financial Market Developments 
Since March 2016 . . . 
Global financial market conditions appear to have improved on balance since the 
March FOMC meeting—the last time Committee participants submitted 
economic projections—amid expectations of more accommodative monetary 
policy and declining market volatility. Prices of risky assets have generally 
advanced, including an increase in the S&P 500 index of nearly 5 percent, as well 
as a narrowing of spreads for 10year U.S. high yield corporate bonds due to the 
substantial spread narrowing in the energy sectors. The WTI oil price rose more 
than 38 percent to $50 per barrel amid substantial declines in U.S. production and 
disruptions to global supply. Yields on 2and 10year U.S. Treasury securities 
have declined, while 5to10year TIPS based inflation compensation was little 
changed on net. The broad U.S. dollar index declined 1½ percent. Foreign 
sovereign yields declined about in line with U.S. Treasury securities, but foreign 
equity markets were mixed, with emerging markets outperforming advanced 
economies. 
Since December 2015 . . . 
The net changes in financial market conditions since the December FOMC 
meeting are generally similar to the changes since March, albeit with more 
sizable declines in sovereign yields. In particular, U.S. and foreign 10year 
sovereign yields have declined about 40 to 70 basis points since the December 
meeting. The declines appear to mainly reflect more accommodative monetary 
policy, both here and abroad, and perhaps a market consensus putting increased 
weight on the prospect of low long term economic growth.

basket of currencies as the do llar has risen.  On balance, the dollar’s value against the 
currencies of the AFEs is almost unchanged.  The dollar strengthened 1 percent against 
the Canadian dollar amid severe wildfires in oil-producing Albe rta.  Offsetting this 
appreciation was a 3½ percent depr eciation against the Japanese yen, mainly reflecting 
sharp moves after the unexpected BOJ decision not to ease polic y further at its April 
meeting and after the May U.S. employment report.   
FINANCING CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESSES , MUNICIPALITIES , AND 
HOUSEHOLDS 
Business Finance  
Overall, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms improved a  bit over the 
intermeeting period, remaining acco mmodative, even as the credit quality of nonfinancial 
corporations continued to show some signs of deterioration. 
Amid still-low yields, bond issuance from investment-grade corp orations resumed 
its robust pace in May, and specula tive-grade issuance also pic ked up.  Growth of C&I 
loans on banks’ books remained s trong in April and May and cont inued to be driven by 
large banks.  Following signifi cant declines in the first quart er of 2016, gross leveraged 
loan issuance increased slightl y in April and May, as refinanci ngs were reportedly 
boosted a bit by lower loan spreads.   
Equity issuance by nonfinancial  firms through initial public of ferings remained 
subdued over the intermeeting pe riod.  Meanwhile, nonfinancial firms continued to 
repurchase their shares at a r obust pace in the first quarter, and dividends stayed near 
record levels. 
Regarding the credit quality of  nonfinancial firms, the percentage of C&I loans 
entering delinquency or being charg ed off increased further in the first quarter, the 
volume of corporate bonds enter ing default moved up in April, a nd downgrades 
significantly outpaced upgrades in May for nonfinancial bonds rated by Moody’s 
Investors Service.  Expected yea r-ahead default rates remained moderately elevated 
relative to previous expansions, w hile those for oil companies continued to be extremely 
elevated. 
Financing conditions in commercial real estate remained fairly accommodative on

briskly during April and May.  By contrast, CMBS spreads remain  elevated, and the 
wider-than-normal level of spread s that has prevailed since las t fall has suppressed 
CMBS issuance markedly so far this year. 
Municipal Finance 
On balance, credit conditions in municipal bond markets continu ed to be stable, as 
general obligation municipal bond y ield spreads were little cha nged and gross issuance 
remained solid.  The default by Puerto Rico on the Government D evelopment Bank debt 
payment in early May was widely expected and has elicited limit ed reaction in broader 
muni markets thus far.  Municipal bond investors have turned th eir attention to the 
$2 billion payment due from Puerto Rico in July, which involves constitutionally 
protected general obligation bonds , and to the prospects of fed eral legislation that would 
allow the territory to re structure its debt.   
Household Finance 
Financial conditions in consumer credit markets were little cha nged and generally 
remained accommodative.  Consumer loan balances continued to in crease at a robust 
pace in recent months, with year-over-year growth in credit car d outstanding balances 
continuing to trend upward.  (See th e box “Recent Developments in the Credit Card 
Market.”)  Issuance of credit card ABS picked up in May, in part because of further 
narrowing in ABS spreads.  However , year-to-date issuance still remains below levels 
observed for the same period of last year. 
Credit in mortgage markets stay ed tight for borrowers with low credit scores, 
hard-to-document income, or high de bt-to-income ratios.  Intere st rates on 30-year 
fixed-rate mortgages, at about 3.4 percent, continued to be low  by historical standards.  
Banking Developments 
Growth of core loans and depos its remained robust during April and May due to 
continued expansions of loans t o businesses and nonmortgage len ding to households.  
Broad measures of bank profitability  moved lower in the first q uarter as provisions for 
loan losses continued to incr ease, reportedly because of concer ns over exposures to the 
oil and gas sectors.  Banks’ net interest margins, however, wer e flat during the quarter

 Recent Developments in the Credit Card Market  
Credit card lending has picked up markedly recently , with aggregate balances 5¾ percent 
above their level of a year ago.  Still, from a longer- term perspective, growth  has 
remained  within a normal range, and aggregate balances remain  well below their pre-
crisis peak, especially for nonprime borrowers.  Indeed,  despite some nascent sig ns of 
easing  recently, credit card lending standards rem ain relatively  tight , on balance, for 
subprime borrowers, which has helped keep delinquency rates  on credit card debt near 
historical lows.  Going forward, the low  interest rate environment, an apparent rise in 
households’ willingness to borrow, and the robust profitability of  credit card business  
activities  will likely continue to support  further lending  expansion . 
The credit card market expanded very rapidly during the 1990s, with aggregate balances 
rising at an average annual rate above 10 percent (figure 1).  G rowth slowed some in the 
late 1990s but continued to be relatively brisk until the financial crisis.  However, during  
the financial crisis and the years following it , lenders cut credit card limits significantly 
across the credit score distribution and increased minimum required credit scores to access such loans.  Outstanding credit card balances plunged nearly 20 percent  and 
moved sideways for several years before the  recovery started.   
The recent p ickup in the growth rate of credit card d ebt appears to reflect several 
factors.  First, as the Senior Loan Officer Opin ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
indicates , lenders have been  easing credit card lending standards gradually  from  the very 
tight levels  seen  after the financial crisis  (not shown).  D emand for such credit has 
continued strengthening over the past few years amid improving econom ic and 
household balance sheet conditions.  Second, the vast majority of credit card loans are originated by large commercial banks, which  had access to stable and low -cost  funding 
sources  during the ultra- low interest rate era.  Third, partly because of the low interest 
rate environment, banks’ net interest margins are at a very low level, making the credit 
card business attractive because of its stable high profitability.

 high profitability, market commentary suggests banks are currently offering more 
attractive terms and incentives on credit card contracts to strengthen consumers’ use of 
credit cards, both as a transactional and  a credit device. 
While credit card lending has accelerated a bit, outstanding balances remain nearly 
$70 billion below their pre- crisis peak.  Moreover, lending conditions remain fairly tight 
for borrowers with low credit scores —for exam ple, aggregate balances for nonprime 
borrowers remain at very subdued levels, as shown in figure 2, and credit card limits 
remain well below their pre -crisis levels, as shown in figure 3.  In addition, the interest 
rate spreads on newly offered credit card  loans remain high, especially for nonprime 
borrowers (figure 4).  
The significant tightening in credit standards that occurred during the financial crisis, 
combined with the bias toward prime borrowers in the subsequent easing of standards, produced a marked shift in the composition of credit card debt toward less risky borrowers.  This shift contributed, in part, to the significant decrease in the credit card delinquency rate, which is currently moving at historical lows and shows no clear signs of credit deterioration with the recent  pickup in lending (figure 5 ).  The historically low 
delinquency rate, in combination  with  a growing economy , limit s the near- term  financial 
stabili ty concerns arising from a pick up in credit card lending.  At the same ti me, the high 
profitability of credit card lending  activit ies in an environment of low  funding costs  will 
likely  support future expansions of the credit card market .

ON RRP take-up over the intermeet ing period averaged just under  $50 billion, 
continuing a trend of low take-up from the previous intermeetin g period, and was well 
below average levels in 2015.2  These low levels are genera lly consistent with elevated 
triparty Treasury GC repo volum es and high Treasury bill issuan ce.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our 
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, in large part because we view neither 
monetary nor fiscal policy as well positioned to offset large adverse shocks.  Foreign 
authorities face similar —or, if anything, more severe—constraints on policy; as a 
consequence, we continue to view the risks to the foreign outlook as also skewed to the 
downside and, thus, as an additional source of downside risk to the U.S. economy.  We 
view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to the upside.  The two disappointing recent employment reports and the ongoing f lat profile of manufacturing production suggest that the risks to GDP 
and unemployment may have intensified somewhat since the time of the April Tealbook.  
With regard to inflation, we see considerable uncertainty around our projection, 
but we do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, 
we continue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.  
Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain very low, as do some survey-
based measures of longer -term inflation expectations.  In addition, the realization of the 
downside risks to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the foreign exchange 
value of the dollar. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives  to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first 
scenario consider s the possibility that the recent weakness in employment and investment 
growth turns out to be the harbinger of a recession.  In the second scenario, we explore 
the consequences of continued subdued labor productivity growth .  The third and fourth 
scenario s both illustrate risks to the projection stemming from a lower natural rate of 
unemployment than in the baseline, but they differ in their assumption s about how 
quickly monetary policy makers recognize the low er natural rate. In the fifth scenario , we 
illustrate how a disorderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, or

“Brexit,” might affect the outlook for the U.S. economy .  The last scenario considers a 
stronger appreciation of the dollar  than in the baseline. 
We generate the first, third , and fourth scenarios using the FRB/US model, and 
the second scenario is generated using the EDO model.  The last two scenarios are run in 
the multicoun try SIG MA model.  In all except the first scenario, the federal funds rate is 
governed by the same inertial policy rule as in the baseline.  (We discuss the exception 
later.)  The policy rule used in all scenarios incorporates the same intercept adjustment s 
as were made to the rule used to generate the baseline projection , and these adjustments 
are invariant to economic events in the scenarios.1 In all cases, we assume that the size 
and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths. 
Recession 
The latest information on the labor market has been disappointing.  Payroll 
increases have slowed , and the labor force participation rate has reversed much of its 
recent improvement.  These disappointing results come on top of tepid g ains in real GDP 
in the past two quarters, declining business fixed investment, and industrial production 
that has been falling for much of the past 1½ years .  In this scenario , we assume this 
accumulated bad news is the harbinger of an economic contraction.  
Specifically, we assume that a recession starts in the third quarter of this year, 
with a decline in real GDP growth during the recession that is  broadly comparable to the 
moderate recession of 2001.  Real GDP shrinks until the first quarter of 2017.  T he 
unemployment rate increases to  5¾ percent by the end of 2017, 1¼ percentage points 
above the baseline,  and gradually returns toward the baseline thereafter .  Given the low 
responsiveness of inflation to aggregate demand in the FRB/US model, inflation is only modestly below the baseline. 
The federal funds rate returns to the effective lower bound with the onset of the 
recession .  This reduction in the federal funds rate is faster than would be implied by our 
baseline policy rule and is motivated by the typical behavior of the federal funds rate in 
1 In continuity with previous Tealbook simulations, we use a policy rule with the same sensitivity 
to inflation and the output gap as in an inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  For the scenarios run in SIGMA and 
EDO, we assume a policy rule broadly similar to the FRB/US simulations.  One key difference relative to 
the FRB/US simulations is that the policy rule in SIGMA and EDO us es a measure of slack equal to the 
difference between actual output and the model’s estimate of the level of output that would occur in the 
absence of slow adjustment of wages and prices.

recessions.2 After the recession  ends, monetary policy is set using the baseline version of 
the policy rule, which prescribes that the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower 
bound through the third quarter of 2017.  Clearly, in the event of a recession when the 
federal funds rate is already near the effective lower bound, the Federal Reserve could 
deploy other tools to combat the contraction in economic activity , but such tools are not 
deployed in this scenario . 
Weaker Productivity 
Labor productivity growth has been weak over the past several years, averaging 
less than ½ percent per year from 2011 through 2015.  In the baseline projection, 
productivity growth is assumed to pick up to an average annual rate of 1¼ percent in 
2017 and 2018, about the average pace over the past 10 years .  However, the forces that 
have recently contributed to subdued productivit y growth may persist longer than in the 
baseline. In this scenario, labor productivity growth is assumed to remain at only 
½ percent per year over the first two years of the scenario before gradually moving up to 
the baseline pace.  The level of labor productivity remains permanently below the 
baseline path .  The lower path of labor productivity is driven by a combination of lower 
total factor productivity growth and positive shocks to aggregate demand.3 
Although r eal GDP grows somewhat more slowly than in the baseline, t he 
unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory , consistent with the weaker labor 
productivity and positive shocks to aggregate demand.  Lower productivity growth also 
pushes up firms’ marginal costs of production, leading to a steeper increase in inflation 
than in the baseline; indeed, inflation rises to 2¼ percent in 2018 and remain s above the 
Committee’s target in  2020.  Reflecting both the reduction in resource slack and higher 
inflation, the federal funds rate rises faster than in the baseline and reaches 4 ½ percent by 
the end of 2020. 
2 In particular, we add negative monetary policy shocks to the pol icy rule during the three quarters 
of the recession, in line with the deviation from the rule during the 2001 recession.  Once the recession is 
over, we return to the baseline version of the policy rule.  Had we not assumed the additional shocks to the 
interest rate equation, the federal funds rate would not have reached the effective lower bound but would 
have dipped to ¼ percent in mid -2018 before increasing thereafter. 
3 In EDO and other DSGE models with both labor and capital as inputs to production, a positive 
shock to aggregate demand typically leads to lower labor productivity because the marginal product of 
labor declines with hours.

Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment 
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate falls to 4¼ percent 
by the end of 2018, about ¾ percentage point below the staff’s baseline estimate of the 
natural rate of unemployment.  However, the natural rate is estimated with considerable 
uncertainty and could be lower than the staff’s estimate of 5 percent —a possibility that 
could be consisten t with ongoing low inflation.  In this scenario, we assume that the 
natural rate of unemployment has been 4 percent in the past few years and remains at that 
level in  the future . 
This scenario assumes that the monetary policymakers are aware of the lower 
natural rate an d have adjusted their estimate of the output gap downward by about 
1 percentage point at the beginning of the simulation.  By the end of 2017, t he federal 
funds rate is ½ percentage point below baseline.  The unemployment rate falls faster than 
in the baseline as a result  of the more accommodative stance of policy, which generates 
modestly stronger job creation and GDP growth.  I nflation is a touch higher .  
Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment with Mispercep tion 
This scenario is the same as the previous one except that policymakers and the 
staff initially perceive that the natural rate of unemployment remain s at 5 percent and 
learn only slow ly about the true natural rate of 4 percent ; the gap between the actual and 
perceived natural rate is not completely eliminated until the end of 2020. 
Because unemployment in the next few quarters is judged to be below its natural 
rate ( rather than still above it, as in the previous scenario without misperception) and 
because output is perceived to be correspondingly above its potential, the path for the 
federal funds rate is higher than in the previous scenario—by about ½ percentage point, 
on average, through the end of 2018.  The tighter sta nce of policy reduces GDP growth 
by about ½ percentage point compared with the scenario without misperception.  Relative 
to the baseline, GDP growth is a touch weaker. The unemployment rate is ½ percentage 
point above the scenario without misperception by the end of 2020.  In this scenario , 
misperceiving the output gap has a modest effect on real economic activity. This result 
reflects in large part the relatively low interest rate sensitivity embedded in FRB/US , and , 
hence, simulations with other models could yield outcomes that are less benign. Inflation 
remains rather close to the baseline.

Disorderly Brexit 
Although our baseline assumes that the U.K. electorate will vote to stay  in the EU 
in the June 23 referendum, this outcome is far from assured.  In this scenario, we assume 
that the United Kingdom opts to leave the EU and that subsequent negotiations on new 
trade and financial arrangements with EU authorities prove contentious.  Financial 
conditions tighten sharply, and U.K. household and business confidence deteriorates 
markedly.  Moreover, concerns about the future of European integration also cause a 
persistent worsening of European financial conditions.  All told, EU GDP (including the 
United Kingdom ) falls 1¼ percent below the baseline, with an even sharper decline in the 
United Kingdom, while flight- to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar to appreciate 
about 5 percent .  As described in the note distributed to the Committee, “Economic and 
Financial Consequences of Brexit,” this scenar io is more adverse than what we judge to 
be the most likely scenario in the event of Brexit, though even more -adverse outcomes 
are entirely  possible.4 
The stronger dollar and some tightening of U.S. financial conditions lead U.S. real 
GDP growth to moderate to  about 1¾ percent in 2016 and just below 2 percent in 2017.  
The U.S. unemployment rate runs about ¼ percentage point above the baseline over the 
forecast period.  Weaker economic activity and falling import prices reduce U.S. core 
inflation to just above 1¼ percent by 2017.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower 
path than in the baseline and is 2 percent at the end of 2018. 
Stronger Dollar 
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate slightly over th e forecast 
period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster than markets currently appear to 
expect.   However, U.S. policy normalization could well cause a much larger and more 
sustained appreciation of the dollar, especially if higher U.S. interest rates generate 
financial stresses in vulnerable EMEs.5  The dollar may also rise much more markedly 
than in our baseline if weaker -than-expected foreign growth, including in the AFEs, 
causes foreign central banks to ease monetary policy further and also amplifies investor 
concerns about downside risks to the foreign outlook.  In this scenario, we assume that

Consequences of Brexit,” memorandum to the Federal Open Market Committee, Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, Division of International Finance, June 3. 
5 Immediately after the release of April FOMC minutes, the dollar st rengthened more than implied 
by our estimated rule of thumb, suggesting the possibility that further U.S. monetary policy normalization 
could have much larger effects on the dollar than envisioned in our baseline.

the broad real dollar appreciates 10 percent by the middle of next year relative to its 
baseline path as credit conditions abroad tighten modestly and confidence declines .  All 
told, foreign GDP growth runs about ½ percent age point below baseline through the 
middle of 2018, notwithstanding the sizable depreciation of foreign currencies.  
The stronger  dollar and weaker foreign growth depress U.S. real net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP growth moderates to about 1¾ percent in 2017, about 
½ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Lower import prices and w eaker economic 
activity cause core PCE inflation to be only about 1 percent in 2017.  T he federal funds 
rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, moving just above 2 percent by the end 
of 2018.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
