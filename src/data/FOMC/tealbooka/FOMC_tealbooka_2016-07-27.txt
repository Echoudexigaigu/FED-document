Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Since the June Tealbook, incom ing information on economic activ ity has been 
close to our expectations on balan ce.  On the positive side, th e June labor market report 
was stronger than we had expect ed and corroborated our supposit ion that the May report 
was anomalously weak.  The news on consumer spending has been f avorable as well.  
However, indicators of construc tion spending point to a weaker growth trajectory 
beginning in the second quarter; in addition, news from the ind ustrial sector has come in 
softer than our already modest e xpectations.  Overall, we still  estimate that real GDP 
growth picked up from its lacklus ter pace in the first quarter to around 1¾ percent in the 
second quarter.   
Strikingly, the United Kingdom vote to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) seems 
to have had relatively mild effect s on U.S. financial condition s and similarly mild 
implications for our baseline ou tlook for real a ctivity and inf lation.  We are anticipating 
some small negative effects for the U.S. economy from a slightly higher value of the 
dollar and lower foreign GDP, but t hese effects are essentially  offset by somewhat lower 
domestic borrowing rates and higher equity prices.  We looked f or adverse effects of 
Brexit on uncertainty, but, as disc ussed in the Financial Devel opments section, the VIX 
and interest rate spreads have more than retraced their spikes immediately following the 
vote.  The limited available survey evidence also suggests only  small effects.  Although 
Brexit has not affected our base line outlook much, it has somew hat increased our sense 
of downside risks to real activity and inflation. 
Based partly on the downbeat news  on construction, we downgraded our 
projection for GDP growth a littl e in the second half of this y ear to a 2 percent annual 
rate; thereafter, real GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 hews close t o our previous forecast.  
We expect GDP growth to increase to a 2½ percent pace next year  and then to edge down 
to around 2 percent in 2018—rates s ufficient to generate some f urther tightening of 
resource utilization.  At the end of 2018, we project real GDP to be 1½ percent above our 
estimate of its potential and t he unemployment rate to be 4¼ pe rcent, ¾ percentage point 
below our estimate of its natural rate. 
The inflation forecast is little revised relative to the one in  the June Tealbook.  We 
continue to estimate that PCE prices rose at an annual rate of a little more than 1 percent

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth  is slightly weaker than the median 
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip 
consensus forecast in 2016, but it is somewhat stronger than that of the Blue Chip in 
2017.  (The SPF forecast is released quarterly and is now two months old; we await 
the next release on August 12.)  The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is 
slightly higher than the others in 2016 but about in line with Blue Chip in 2017.  Staff 
projections for CPI inflation are similar to outside forecasters, though somewhat 
lower than the SPF for both total and core PCE price inflation.

  over the first half of this year , and we project that they will  increase only a little faster in 
the second half of the year.  O ver the following couple of year s, PCE inflation moves up 
to 1.8 percent as the effects of earlier energy and import pric e declines fade and as 
resource utilization continues to tighten in an environment of reasonably stable long-run 
inflation expectations. 
We discuss our assessment of the risks to real activity and inflation in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 We continue to set the federal funds rate path according to the version of the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule that  we introduced in the June Teal book.1  This rule 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase roughly 90 basis p oints per year 
over the projection period and t o average 2.5 percent in the fo urth quarter of 
2018.  The assumed path of the federal funds rate is very simil ar to the one 
from the June Tealbook.  
 As in the June Tealbook, we assu me that the SOMA portfolio will  remain at 
its current level until the thir d quarter of next year and then  begin to contract 
as the proceeds from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.   
Other Interest Rates  
 Treasury yields have come in we ll below our projection at the t ime of the June 
Tealbook.  The 10-year Treasury yie ld is expected to average on ly 1.7 percent 
this quarter, 0.3 percentage point l ess than in the previous Te albook, a 
revision that, according to our pr eferred model, mostly reflect s lower term 
premiums.  Our projection continue s to call for the 10-year Tre asury yield to 
rise significantly over the medium term, reaching 3.3 percent b y the end of 
2018—only a handful of basis points lower than in the June Teal book—as 
term premiums increase gradually and the 10-year valuation wind ow moves 
through the period of extremely low  short-term interest rates. 
                                                 
1 The rule we introduced in June incorporated a downward adjustm ent to the intercept in the near 
term that gradually fades over time such that the federal funds  rate rises to a real l ong-run equilibrium rate 
of 1 percent.

   Triple-B corporate bond spreads have, on net, edged down a litt le in recent 
weeks.  As a result, we have rev ised our projection for triple- B corporate 
yields by a bit more than for 10-year Treasury yields.  The pat h of 30-year 
fixed mortgage rates is revise d down less than that of Treasury yields in the 
near term but by essentially the  same amount as Treasury securi ties further 
out.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are higher than we  had projected at the time of t he June 
Tealbook.  As a result, we have r evised up the projected path f or equity prices 
about 2¾ percent.  Stock prices are  projected to increase a little less than 
2 percent per year, on average, from late this year through 201 8. 
 CoreLogic has revised their m ethodology for constructing their flagship house 
price index.  Incorporating the  new series and reestimating the coefficients of 
the associated model of house pr ice valuation, we now judge the  current level 
of prices to be only marginally above its historical relationship with rents and 
noticeably less so than we earlier thought.  Accordingly, we ex pect house 
prices will decelerate less t han in our previous forecast and p roject they will 
rise at an average pace of about 4 percent per year in 2017 and  2018 (versus 
3 percent in the June Tealbook). 
Fiscal Policy 
 We anticipate that discretionary fiscal actions across all leve ls of government 
will provide a boost of 0.4 percen tage point to real GDP growth  this year and 
next, with a smaller contribut ion in 2018.  Relative to the Jun e Tealbook, the 
projected contribution is 0.1 per centage point lower this year, as purchases at 
all levels of government have been rising at a somewhat more sl uggish pace 
than anticipated.  (For a disc ussion pertaining to the outlook for the state and 
local government sector, see the box “State and Local Pensions and Aggregate 
Demand.”)  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Brexit-related uncertainty and finan cial stresses are expected to weigh on 
economic growth in Europe, low ering our projection of foreign g rowth 
¼ percentage point in the sec ond half of this year and 0.1 perc entage point

  over the remainder of the forecast period.  (For more details, see the box 
“Global Implications of the U.K . Vote to Leave the European Union” in the 
International Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  Even with this 
markdown, foreign growth is pr ojected to rebound to an annual r ate of 
2½ percent in the second half of t his year from a 1½ percent pa ce in the 
second quarter, as some temporary factors restraining second-qu arter growth 
dissipate.  Projected foreign grow th then edges up further to 2¾ percent in 
2017 and 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policies and  a 
recovery in Latin America.  
 Despite the sizable post-referendum  depreciation of the British pound, the 
broad nominal dollar has apprec iated only about 1½ percent sinc e the time of 
the June Tealbook.  The dollar in creased 3 percent against the currencies of 
the advanced foreign economies a nd was up slightly against emer ging market 
currencies.  We project the broa d nominal dollar to appreciate at about a 
1½ percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market e xpectations for 
the federal funds rate move up t oward the staff forecast.  Rela tive to the June 
Tealbook, our projection for the br oad real dollar is about 1½ percent higher 
by the end of 2018.   
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil has decreased about $5 per barrel since the 
close of the June Tealbook, to $47 per barrel.  This decline ha s been driven 
primarily by concerns about unexpe cted increases in gasoline in ventories.  
Futures prices are down less—$1 pe r barrel—with the December 20 18 Brent 
futures price currently at $55 per barrel.  The upward slope of  the futures 
curve is consistent with a re duction of the supply glut that ha s weighed on 
prices since 2014.  
 In contrast to oil prices and in s pite of downward pressure fro m a slightly 
stronger dollar, prices for industrial metals have risen on net  since the June 
Tealbook.  Continued supply cuts a nd some improvement in demand  have 
supported metals prices.  Agricul tural prices, however, decline d sharply since 
mid-June on a more favorabl e U.S. weather forecast.

 State and Local Pensions and Aggregate Demand  
Many state and local governments are confronting the legacy of years of pension 
underfunding.  This discussion explores  the size of these unfunded liabilities and 
assesses their effect on the spending of  state and local governments in recent years  
and in the future.   
States and localities estimate that unfunded pension liabilities totaled about $1  trillion 
in 2015.  These  liabilities are calculated using a discount rate based on the expected rate 
of return on pension assets.  However, finance theory suggests that future liabilities should be discounted at rates that reflect the risk of the liabilities rather than the risk of 
the assets.  Using the lower discount rates associated with the pension liabilities makes 
the funding situation look worse.  For example, discounting by the Treasury yield curve 
suggests that pension underfunding is closer to $3  trillion.
1  
Based on pen sion liabilities data that use an intermediate discount rate, the Federal 
Reserve’s Enhanced Financial Accounts show that funding ratios —defined as the 
market value of pension assets divided by the present value of liabilities —differ 
significantly across s tates.   In figure 1, states shown in white, such as Wisconsin, have 
essentially fully funded pensions , while the dark red states, such as Illinois, have ratios 
well under 50 percent.  
Governments have been addressing pension underfunding by increasing their 
contributions in recent years.  Figure 2 displays estimates of annual pension 
contributions as a percent of the a ctuarially defined employer contribution (ADEC).2  
The ADEC has two c omponents:  the portion needed to fund the benefits earned by 
workers in the current year and the portion  needed  to amortize unfunded liabilities 
from previous years over a given period (usually 30  years).  According to Census Bureau 
data, between 2012 and  2015, state and local governments increased their total annual 
contributions about $30  billion.3  Primarily because of  this funding increase, the share 
of the A DEC  paid rose more than  9 percentage points to  91 percent  in 2015 .   
Assuming these increased contributions would have otherwise been used on state and 
local purchases, the increased pension funding has reduced the contribution of state 
and local governments to real GDP by a relatively small cumulative total of 0.2  percent 
over 2012  to 2015.  Over the next several years , if states continue to increase their 
                                                 
1 See Robert Novy- Marx and Josh ua Rauh (2011),  “Public Pension Promises:  How Big Are They and 
What Are They Worth?” Journal of Finance,  vol. 66 ( August), pp. 1211–49 .  The estimate of pension 
underfunding in this paper was subsequently updated; see Joshua Rauh (2015), “Unfunded Pension 
Debts of U.S. States Still Exceed $3 Trillion,” Forbes , August 25.  
2 The percentage of the ADEC paid, displayed in figure 2, is an estimate based on a sample of large 
pension plans in Alicia H. Munnell and Jean- Pierre Aubry (2016), “The Funding of State and Local 
Pensions:  2015 –2020,” Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, Brief 50 (Boston:  CRR, 
June).

Benefit Data ,” available on the Census Bureau’s website at https://www.census.gov/govs/retire.

 contributions  at the  same pace as in recent years, pensions would be roughly  fully 
funded (by the A DEC  criterion) by 2018, at the cost of a similar drag on aggregate 
demand.   However, unlike in r ecent years, the adjustments would likely need to be 
more concentrated in the states with a legacy of pension underfunding , which would 
intensify the fiscal strain already being experienced by some of these governments.  
Indeed, pension woes were a major reason why  Illinois w as unable to pass a budget in 
fiscal year 2016 (which ended on June 30)  and why Pennsylvania went nearly the entire 
year without a budget . 
The rise in state and local government purchases has been quite anemic over the course of the current expansion.  Although the analysis here suggests that pension 
obligations are likely a contributing factor, the magnitude of the pension effect is not 
large enough to be the primary cause of the sluggish rise in purchases.  That said, the 
effect on aggregate demand could eventually be much larger.  In particular, using the 
lower discount rates  discussed earlier, state and local governments are significantly 
understating the annual contributions required to reach full funding.  Nevertheless, 
over the next few years, we view it as unlikely that these governments will shore up 
their pensions beyond the contribution  levels indicated by currently used discount 
rates.  Meeting the A DEC  payment (calculated under current discount rates) is 
generally viewed by these governments as being sufficient to “fully fund the pension 
obligation.”   Over the longer haul, though, these government s may be required to 
increase their pension contributions more substantially.

4 Many states have also increased the required contributions of new employees and reduced their 
pension benefits.  Some states have also attempted to reduce the benefits of current employees and 
retirees.  These benefits typically have legal protections, and attempts to reduce them are therefore 
usually subject to legal challenges.  Courts have expressed a wide range of views on pension reform, with different states sometimes arriving at opposite conclusions.  For example,  reductions in cost -of-
living adjustments for current retirees were upheld in Colorado, Minnesota, New Jersey, and South Dakota but were struck down in Arizona, Montana, and Illinois.  Although the reduction in benefits 
and increased employee contributions are unlikely to have a large effect on aggregate demand over 
the next several years, the magnitude of the effect will likely increase gradually over time.

  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  
AND THE LABOR MARKET  
The data that have become availa ble since the June Tealbook are  consistent with a 
moderate pickup in real GDP growth to an annual rate of 1¾ perc ent in the second 
quarter, essentially in line with our June forecast.2  For the second half of the year, our 
baseline view is that real activ ity will grow at a 2 percent ra te—roughly ¼ percentage 
point less than in the June T ealbook—with a weaker path of residential investment 
making the largest contribu tion to this revision.  
 Incoming data point to a little more real PCE growth over the f irst half of the 
year than we had estimated in t he June Tealbook; we now put the  average rate 
of gain at about 2¾ percent, the same as in 2015.  We expect re al PCE to rise 
at a 2½ percent pace in the second half of the year—unchanged f rom the June 
Tealbook—supported by consumer sentim ent that is still reasonab ly upbeat, 
ongoing gains in employment and income, and past increases in h ousehold 
wealth.  
 In contrast, incoming data on resid ential construction suggest slower growth 
over the near term than we had written down in the June Tealbook.  Single-
family permits have been moving essentially sideways since late  last year, and 
revised data suggest a much large r decline in the average value of homes 
started this past winter that w ill likely show through to falli ng real residential 
investment over the second and thi rd quarters of this year as t hose homes are 
completed.3  
 The near-term outlook for busines s investment remains weak, tho ugh we 
expect some improvement relativ e to the experience of the past few quarters.  
Investment in equipment and intan gibles (E&I) is now estimated to have 
declined at a 1¾ percent pace in the first half of the year, and available 
indicators suggest a gain of 4½ percent in the current quarter,  still modest by 
                                                 
2 As displayed in the table “Fede ral Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q2 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projecti ons generated by the near-term forecastin g approaches used within the System, at 
2.1 percent, is a touch higher than the staff’s judgmental proj ection. 
3 That said, we also expect the annual NIPA revisions on July 29  to show an upward revision to 
the level of residential invest ment in 2015, which mostly offse ts the lower growth we now anticipate for 
2016.  That anticipated revision to 2015 is not currently refle cted in the staff projection but would be 
unlikely to alter our view of the resource utilization gap.

  historical standards.  (See th e box “The Recent Weakness in Bus iness 
Investment and Corporate Profits .”)  Meanwhile, investment in n onresidential 
structures looks to have also declined in the first half of the  year, but we 
expect activity to level off in the second half, with an end to  the decline in 
drilling and mining structures an  important part of the story.   
 Incoming data now suggest that ne t exports had a neutral effect  on GDP 
growth in the first half, as opposed to the small drag we had e stimated in the 
June Tealbook.  However, we projec t that net exports will subtr act about 
½ percentage point from GDP grow th in the second half of this year.  Imports 
have been surprisingly weak in r ecent quarters, but we expect import growth 
to pick up in line with the stronger dollar and anticipated imp rovement in U.S. 
consumption and investment.  We expect that exports will contin ue to be held 
down by a high dollar and weak foreign demand. 
 Manufacturing production was lit tle changed, on balance, in May  and June 
and has been essentially flat for the past year and a half.  Fa ctory output has 
been held down by weak foreign de mand and the strong dollar, along with 
slow capital investment and spillovers from the drop in mining output.  
Although regional and national ne w orders indexes have moved up , on net, 
in recent months, they point to only modest growth in the second half of 
the year.   
Turning to the near-term labor data, the June employment report  corroborated our 
earlier view that the readings f rom the May report were anomalo usly weak and that the 
labor market has continued to imp rove.  Nevertheless, data in h and suggest that the pace 
of labor market improvement has slowed this year.  
 Nonfarm payroll employment is c urrently reported to have increa sed 287,000 
in June following a gain o f only 11,000 in May.  Although we had expected 
payrolls to bounce back last m onth, the estimated job gain in J une was some 
100,000 stronger than we had projected.4  On average, payrolls increased 
                                                 
4 According to the BLS, payrolls i n May were held down about 35, 000 because workers were on 
strike at Verizon; these workers were back on the job as of the  June survey week, which boosted the June 
payroll gain by the same amount.  These strike-related dynamics  were known at the time of the June 
Tealbook and do not account for our surprise in either May or J une.

  147,000 per month in the second quarter , as compared with about  200,000 in 
the first quarter and 230,000 in 2015.  We expect payroll growth to average 
165,000 per month over the second half, close to its mean so far this year and 
still above the roughly 85,000 monthly pace we estimate would b e consistent 
with unchanged labor utilization.5 
 The unemployment rate rebounde d to 4.9 percent in June from 4.7  percent in 
May and, on net, is down just slig htly so far this year.  The l abor force 
participation rate also ticke d up in June and has changed littl e, on net, over the 
past year—which, when judged aga inst its declining trend, impli es some 
improvement in this dimension of labor market conditions.  We e xpect both 
the participation rate and the  unemployment rate to hold at the ir June levels 
through the current quarter, consistent with some additional na rrowing of 
labor market slack.   
 The share of employees working part time for economic reasons, which has 
been little changed, on balance, since late last year after falling notably in the 
previous year, is still somewhat  elevated relative to its pre-r ecession level and 
we think is consistent with an additional small source of remai ning slack. 
 The labor market conditions index (LMCI) moved down in June for the sixth consecutive month.  Taken at face value, the LMCI thus points t o some 
deterioration in labor market conditions in the first half of t his year, which 
contrasts with the staff’s assessment that labor market conditions have continued to improve. 
THE MEDIUM -TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  AND THE LABOR MARKET  
Overall, the available informa tion suggests that the cyclical p osition of the 
economy continued to improve in r ecent quarters but at a slower pace than previously.  
This apparent slowing raises the key questions as to why it hap pened and what it portends 
for the future.  The slowing might  be seen as particularly concerning, given that the 
                                                 
5 Our estimate of the neutral pa ce of payroll gain is necessaril y imprecise; it is meant to represent 
the amount that, on average, would be sufficient to hold the un employment rate flat, allow the labor force 
participation rate to decline in  line with its estimated struct ural trend, and yield a wedge between the 
household and payroll measures of employment approximately cons istent with the cycle’s being in a 
mature phase.  Historically, the relationship between employment in the household survey and employment 
in the payroll surv ey has been loose.

 The Recent Weakness in Business Investment and Corporate Profits  
Nonresidential private fixed investment  has been quite disappointing of late.  The 
weakness is apparent even for equipment and intangibles (E&I) investment, which has 
been much less affected than energy -sector structures by the fall in energy prices .  
Although the recent softness in business investment might be partly due to noise or 
mismeasurement, it may also r eflect firms’ recent profit performance and  expectations 
that their future profits will not rise enough to justify a faster pace of capital spending 
today.  In light of notabl y dour analysts’ profit expectations, our outlook for E&I 
investment is especially weak  this year.  
Real E&I investment is estimated to have declined at an average annual rate of 
2½ percent in 2015:Q4 and 2016:Q1 , and the incoming data suggest that investment wa s 
little changed in the second quarter.  E&I investment has been much weaker than we 
anticipated in the October 2015 Tealbook, immediately prior to when we began receiving 
spending data for the fourth quarter (figure 1) .  Although we expect E&I spending to pick 
up in the second half of the year, we still projec t spending to rise by less than 1 percent 
for 2016 as a whole, which is unusual for an expansion . 
NIPA c orporate profits have also moved down  on net  lately , and in the first quarter they 
were more than 4 percent below their level from a year earlier ( the green line in figure 2).  
As a result, the return on existing capital—a measure of the profitability of firms’ 
installed capital— has declined , even if from an elevated level ( the blue line in figure 2 ).  If 
the decline in profits w as seen as merely temporary, we would  not expect it to have 
much effect on capital spending.  However, Wall Street analysts now expect profits to be 
essentially flat this year (not shown), which is a significant downgrade from earlier 
perceptions .  Although  a large portion of the recent weakness in corporate profits and 
profit expectations is concentrated in the energy sector, other sectors have also seen significant downgrades , with S&P  500 (excluding energy) profits expected to grow only 
modestly in 2016.  Moreover, expect ations of profits three to five years ahead —as 
reported by analysts who follow S&P  500 firms —have also been downgraded

 substantially since early last year even after accounting  for the downward trend since the 
mid-2000s  (figure 3) . 
Figure 4 shows E&I inves tment growth and predictions from the staff’s workhorse 
medium -term forecasting model.1  In this model, investment is explained by business 
output growth and the cost of capital, which are intended to proxy for firms’ expected 
future profits .  Although the increase in E&I investment in recent years has fallen short of 
longer- term historical averages, it has been reasonably well explained by th is model, 
which captures the subdued pace of the overall recovery through the business output 
term.  That said, investment in recent quarters has been noticeably below the predictions 
of the model, and we expect that to hold for the year as a whole.   Some of the surprising 
weakness in E&I investment may reflect low demand for mining equipment; some of it 
may also simply be noise, given the inherent volatility of business investment.   
In addition, s ome of the recent weakness in E&I investment may reflect the drop in actual 
profits or expectations  of future profits.  Indeed, taking account of  analysts’ expectations 
of future profit s, such as those shown in figure 3, do es appear to improve the model 
forecasts .2  As shown by the red line in figure 4 , the projections from this model imply a 
softer pace of real E&I growth this year that is more in line with the recent data and 
consistent with the current Tealbook  projection .  We also investigated whether adding 
realized NIPA corporate profits to the model improved its performance but found that it 
did not, perhaps because the explanatory power of that variable was already captured in 
the other variables included in the model.  
                                                 
1 The staff’s model is based on the neoclassical investment model, which tends to outperform other 
models i n the macrodata .  See Stephen Oliner, Glenn Rudebusch, and Daniel Sichel (1995), “New and Old 
Models of Business Investment:  A Comparison of Forecasting Performance,” Journal of Money, Credit, 
and Banking , vol. 27 (August), pp. 806 –26.

Cummins, Kevin Hassett, and Stephen Oliner (2006), “Investment Behavior, Observable Expectations, 
and Internal Funds,” American Economic Review , vol. 96 (June) , pp. 796– 810.  In addition to these data, 
we also use many other indicators, such as measures of business sentiment and uncertainty, and bond 
spreads.

  settings of the FOMC’s main policy instruments have remained cl ose to unchanged (with 
the federal funds rate up only 25 basis points and the SOMA portfolio still very large).  
As for why it happened, one factor  may have been the appreciati on of the dollar since 
mid-2014 and the circumstances that gave rise to that appreciation, including the 
weakness in foreign growth.  Other factors include the recent w eakness in business fixed 
investment and a reduction in stockbuilding from the rapid pace  of a year ago. 
Looking ahead, we project GDP gr owth to step up to 2½ percent i n 2017, 
reflecting in part a w aning drag from the dol lar appreciation since mid-2014 as well as a 
step-up in business investment.  This outlook is predicated on the view that—among 
other things—Brexit will not lea d to the breakup of the euro ar ea or other severe 
consequences.  In 2018, GDP growth falls back to 2 percent as m onetary policy gradually 
normalizes and the stimulus from fiscal policy diminishes.  
 The pace of GDP growth in 2017 and  2018 is very similar to our June 
Tealbook projection.  Lower interes t rates and higher household  wealth 
provide small boosts to the forecast, whereas the weaker foreig n outlook and 
stronger dollar mostly offset those effects. 
 With GDP growth expected to outp ace our estimate of potential g rowth over 
the medium term, real activity overshoots our estimate of its l ong-run 
equilibrium level.  At the end of 2018, we forecast real GDP to be 1½ percent above potential—about the same as in the June Tealbook.  
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed,  the outlook for the 
labor market is similar to our June projection. 
 The contour of total job gains over the medium term roughly fol lows that of 
GDP growth, with average monthl y increases slowing from 185,000 next year 
to 145,000 in 2018. 
 These job gains are sufficient t o cause the unemployment rate t o fall to 
4.3 percent at the end of 2018, 0.7 percentage point below our estimate of its 
natural rate and unrevise d from our June projection. 
 The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend next year 
and in 2018, as sustained job gain s and rising wages continue t o draw

  individuals into the labor for ce while also slowing outflows.  As a result, the 
participation rate is projec ted to be about 0.1 percentage point above our 
estimate of its trend level a t the end of 2018, unchanged from the June 
Tealbook. 
 Labor productivity is forecast to increase 0.7 percent in 2016,  the same as last 
year, and then to accelerate to its trend pace of growth of 1.3  percent in 2017 
and 2018. 
 We made no changes to our suppl y-side assumptions this round. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Price data received since the  close of the June Tealbook have b een close to our 
expectations.  With the June PPI and CPI data now in hand, we estimate headline PCE 
price inflation to have move d up to an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the second quarter, 
led by a substantial rebound in ga soline prices.  In contrast, core PCE inflation has 
slowed modestly in recent months following a 2.0 percent readin g in the first quarter of 
the year.  We project the 12-m onth changes in headline and core PCE prices to remain in 
the neighborhood of 1 percent and 1 ½ percent, respectively, thr ough late this year. 
 Core PCE price inflation is pr ojected to slow from a 1.9 percent annual rate in 
the first half of the year to a 1.3 percent pace in the second half.  The slowing 
reflects some residual seasonal ity as well as expected decelera tions in prices 
for goods and nonmarket services following outsized gains early in the year.6   
 PCE energy prices rebounded in t he second quarter following sha rp declines 
in the first quarter and late la st year.  With oil prices havin g moved down 
since the June Tealbook, PCE ene rgy prices are now expected to be little 
changed, on balance, over the remainder of the year. 
 PCE food prices declined at an e stimated 1¾ percen t annual rate  in the first 
half of the year; the weakness i n this category has been more sustained than 
                                                 
6 For example, nonmarket services  prices, a category from which we take little signal for future 
price changes and where we s ee little seasonal pattern, are est imated to have risen a t a 3½ percent pace in 
the first half of this year compa red with a 2½ percent increase  in 2015.  Similarly, some categories of goods 
showed large increases earlier th is year that we expect to be t ransitory, such as an outsized jump in jewelry 
prices.

  we expected in the June Teal book.  With food commodity prices h aving 
moved down recently, we expect cons umer food prices to continue to run 
somewhat below core inflation, on average, over the second half  of the year.  
 After having declined over the p revious six quarters, core impo rt prices are 
estimated to have risen at a 1 pe rcent annual rate in the secon d quarter.  We 
project these prices to continue rising moderately through the rest of the 
forecast period, reflecting the i nfluences of foreign price inc reases tempered 
by the small further dollar a ppreciation in our projection.  
 On balance, readings on longer-term inflation expectations appe ar consistent 
with the view that these expect ations remain reasonably stable.  The Michigan 
survey now shows longer-term infl ation expectations having been 2.6 percent 
in June.  (The preliminary read ing for June, published between the close of the 
June Tealbook and the FOMC mee ting, had dipped to a record-low 
2.3 percent.)  The preliminary es timate for July held steady at  2.6 percent.  
Three-year-ahead expected inflati on from the Federal Reserve Ba nk of New 
York’s Survey of Consumer Expect ations rose to 2.9 percent in J une, roughly 
similar to its level of a year a go.  The TIPS-based measure of five-year-
forward inflation compensation is 1.4 percent, 0.1 percentage p oint below its 
value at the time of the June Tealbook.  
Our outlook for inflation beyond t he near term is essentially u nrevised.  We 
continue to project that cor e PCE inflation will move up to 1.8  percent by 2018, primarily 
reflecting the waning restraint f rom earlier declines in energy  and import prices.  With 
consumer food and energy prices e xpected to rise roughly in line with core prices after 
this year, we project that total  PCE prices will rise at essent ially the same pace as core 
PCE prices.   
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our  core inflation projection has been 
revised up slightly in 201 6 and down slightly in 2017 and 2018.  
We have received little infor mation on hourly compensation since the June 
FOMC meeting, and our projection is little changed:  We continue to project that 
business-sector hourly compensation will increase at about a 3 percent pace over the 
medium term.

   Average hourly earnings of all employees increased 2½ percent over the 
12 months through June; this measure has been trending modestly  upward 
since holding roughly steady at around 2 percent from 2012 to l ate 2014.  
 An alternative measure of hourl y wage growth calculated by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which i s more procyclical than average  hourly 
earnings, has moved up a bit more  in the past year and a half, from around 
2¾ percent to 3½ percent, but the pa ce of gains remains well below its pre-
recession levels.7 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 The natural rate of unemploymen t remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP 
increases at about its long-r un value of 1.9 percent per year s tarting in 2020. 
 With the economy running above its  potential an d inflation close to the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, t he federal funds rate rises above its long-
run value in 2019.  It reaches 3.6 percent in 2021 before movin g back toward 
its long-run value of 3 percent.  
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on l onger-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by 2022. 
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates f urther and 
rises at an annual rate  of 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2021.  The unemployment 
rate remains at 4.3 percent i n 2019 and then rises gradually to ward its 
assumed natural rate in subsequent years. 
 PCE price inflation moves up fro m 1.8 percent in 2018 to the Co mmittee’s 
long-run objective by 2020. 
                                                 
7 The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker is calculated using micr odata from the Current 
Population Survey.  It is the 3-month moving average of the median 12-month change in the hourly wage 
for all individuals who are employed both in the current month and in the same month one year earlier 
(though not necessarily at all times between those two dates no r at the same employer).

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The key development influencing our international forecast over the intermeeting 
period was  the unexpected “leave” outcome of the June 23 U.K. referendum on 
membership in the European Union (EU).  The vote for British EU exit, also known as 
“Brexit ,” has increased economic and political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, which 
we expect to substantially lower the rate of U.K. economic growth over the next year and 
a half .  The vote also has heightened euro- area political risks and amplified existing 
vulnerabilities in its  banking system, likely weighing on euro- area growth .  Beyond 
Europe, however, the effects of Brexit are expected to be limited, as many post-vote asset 
price declines have been reversed.   Thus, we have lowered our forecast for aggregate 
foreign growth only ¼ percentage point in the second half and just a touch in 2017 and 
2018 (see the box “Global Implications of the U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union”). 
The Brexit shock comes against the ba ckdrop of a foreign expansion that was not 
very solidly entrenched.  We had anticipated  a slowing of growth in the second quarter, 
mainly due to temporary factors such as wildfires in Canada, and we have marked down 
our estimate  a bit further, to 1½ percent, based on recent weak data, especially from 
Canada and Mexico.  Still, we expect aggregate foreign growth will rise to 2½ percent in 
the second half, as rebounds in Canada and Latin America more than offset a slowing in Europe.  The effects of Brexit  only slow  somewhat , but do not stop, the recovery of 
foreign growth, which rises to its trend pace of  2¾ percent in the next two  years, as  
projected in the June Tealbook. 
In our projection, foreign growth is supported by more accommodative monetary 
policy.  We now assume policy easing by the Bank of England (BOE)  and the European 
Central Bank  (ECB) , and we have increased the extent of policy easing assumed for the 
Bank of Japan (BOJ) .  In addition, the central banks of Indonesia and Taiwan cut their 
policy rat es during the intermeeting period in response to concerns over slowing external 
demand.  Most recently, on July 19, Turkey ’s central bank  cut its marginal funding rate; 
this fifth consecutive monthly cut in rates was expected even before the previous weekend’s coup attempt. 
Although the Brexit vote had a limited net effect  on financial markets  outside 
Europe and we expect  only modest effects  on overall foreign activity, Brexit does 
intensify some downside risks to the outlook.  Contentious negotiations between U.K.

 Global Implications  of the U.K. V ote to Leave the European Union  
On June 23 , a slim majority of U.K. voters elected  to leave the European Union  (EU).   Although 
the referendum result is not legally binding , new Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to proceed 
with British withdrawal from the E U (“ Brexit ”).  This discussion lays out our assumptions 
regarding Brexit  and the implications for the United Kingdom , Europe, and the rest of the world.  
Prime Minister May indicated that the U.K. government will probably wait at least until around 
year- end before triggering  Article 50 of the Treaty  of European Union , which governs  the 
withdrawal process  from the EU .  We assume negotiations  between U.K. and EU authorities  will 
be complex , as the U.K. government will demand some restrictions on  EU immigration but, at the 
same time, will try to preserve the current U.K. access to the EU single market.  Even so, in our 
baseline, we assume a new deal will be reached (or largely decided ) in the two -year period 
prescribed by Article 50.  Most probably, the new relationship will include a preferential trade agreement but with some restrictions on access  to the single market , including for financial 
services .  Based on a literature review of the costs of leaving the EU, we estimate that Brexit will 
lower the level of U.K. GDP 5 percent in the long run.
1  This admittedly very uncertain estimate 
reflects direct losses due to less  trade integration  as well as some negative spillovers on U.K. 
productivity growth.  
Higher economic and political uncertainty are also likely to restrain economic activity in the 
United Kingdom  in the short and medium run .  As shown  by the red line in figure 1 , the Economic 
Policy Uncertainty index  increased noticeably in the months leading to the Brexit  referendum  and 
stayed at an elevated level following the vote  to leave the EU .2  This  rise in uncertainty and the 
associated s urge in financial stress  (the red line in figure 2)  are expected to weigh on  U.K. 
investment  and consumption .  We revised our forecast for the level of U.K. GDP down 2 percent 
by the end of 2018, largely based on our empirical analysis relating  measures of uncertainty and 
financial stresses to economic conditions in the U.K. economy . 
So far, Brexit spillovers  to other economies  have been felt primarily in the euro area, as shown by 
the rise in  measures of uncertainty and financial stress ( the blue lines in f igures 1 and  2).  The 
increase in financial stress is mainly due to overall stock return volatility  as well as  falling  stock 
prices  and rising credit default swap spreads  of euro- area banks.  E uro-area banks have been 
under stress for a while amid growing concerns over bank profitability, capital adequacy , and the 
sufficiency of euro- area financial backstops (further discussed in the box “Taking Stock of 
European Banks after Brexit”  in the Financial Developments section ).  Some banking sectors with 
large exposure to the nonbank U.K. private sector, notably those of Ireland and Spain, could 
suffer if the United Kingdom were to experience a significant downturn.  Overall, largely based on 
increased uncertainty and financial stresses, we revised the level of GDP in the euro area down 
¾ percent  by the end of 2018 . 
                                                 
1 The U.K. treasury estimates that Brexit will reduce the level of U.K. GDP in 2030 between 3 and 9.5 percent, 
depending on whether the country remains in the European Economic Area or reaches no preferential agreement 
with the EU, in which case U.K. –EU trade will be governed by World Trade Organization rules.

 Given the relatively subdued reaction of global financial markets to Brexit once the initial surprise 
had passed, o ther parts of the world are affected only marginally by Brexit  under our baseline 
forecast .  Some advanced economies, including the United States and Japan, experienced sharp 
declines in stock prices and strengthening of their currencies in the first days after the 
referendum , but these movements were, to a large extent , subsequently reversed.   In the 
emerging market economies, given their small trade exposure to Europe and limited financial 
spillovers to date ( perhaps due to prospects of easier monetary policy in the advanced 
economies ), economic activity should not be  much  affected.  
Of course, it  is still early, and more substantial adverse consequences from Brexit could still 
materialize from several sources .  First, the prospect of further financial disruptions  in the United 
Kingdom  remains .  For example, recent stresses in U.K. commercial real estate (CRE) funds could 
lead to a wider downturn in the U.K. real estate market, curtail lending by small businesses that predominantly use CRE as collateral, and spill over to other financial markets both in the United 
Kingdom and perhaps abroad.  Second , banking sectors in the peripheral euro-area countries, 
especially in Italy, could come under such pressure as to reduce government fiscal positions and 
the availability of regional financial backstops , thus reviving  the euro- area crisis.  Third, the U.K. 
referendum could spur a rise of populist parties and anti -EU movements in various EU countries 
that could lead people to worry about  a breakup of the EU , also heightening financial stresses.  
The global implications of such risks materializing would be significant, as discussed in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section.  
Although downside risks predominat e, we cannot exclude the possibility of more benign 
scenarios than in the baseline .  First, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU could 
be productive and  quick , leading the short -run economic effects for both the United Kingdom 
and the rest of Europe to be limited.  Second, it is also possible that Brexit will not  happen, 
perhaps because the U.K. Parliament  takes actions to stop the Brexit process .  In such a case, we 
may still see some short -run costs as a result of  elevated political uncertainty , but many adverse 
effects of Brexit over the longer term would be avoided.

 and European authorities and a further rise in support for anti -EU movements in other 
member  countries could fuel worries about a breakup of the EU.  Moreover, concerns 
have risen about the health of European banks, especially in Italy  (see the box “Taking 
Stock of European Banks after Brexit” in the Financial Developments section) .  These 
concerns could contribute to a loss of confidence in fiscal positions and financial 
backstops for vulnerable euro- area countries and, at an extreme,  lead to a revival of the 
euro-area crisis  (see the alternative scenario “Severe Financial Stress in Europe” in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section).  O ther risks to the global economy also remain a source 
of concern, including  the possibility of a hard landing in China resulting from mounting 
financial vulnerabilities  and the risk of negative spillovers to  emerging market economies  
(EMEs ) from monetary policy  normalization  by the Federal Reserve. 
Inflation is anticipated to remain below the 2 percent  targets in both the euro area 
and Japan throughout the forecast period.  We marked down projected  inflation  in those 
economies in response to weaker economic growth and, in the case of Japan, a stronger 
yen.  In contrast, w e are projecting a temporary surge in U.K. inflation on account of the 
recent sharp depreciat ion of the pound.  Inflation in the EMEs  declined to 2¾ percent in 
the second quarter, largely on a sharp slowing  in food price inflation , but it is projected to 
rise to 3¼ percent for the remainder of the forecast p eriod.      
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• United Kingdom.  We estimate that real GDP expanded 1¾ percent in the 
second quarter, the same as in the previous quarter and higher than we had 
anticipated, as in dicators of activity before the Brexit referendum show ed 
more momentum than previously assumed.  However, we expect increased 
political and economic uncertainty will depress business investment and consumer spending following the U.K. vote to leave the EU.  The substantial depreciation of the pound and a more accommodative monetary policy stance 
are expected to  provide only a partial offset.  Accordingly, we project that 
GDP growth will step down to less than 1 percent in the second half of this year before rising back to  1¾ percent pace by  2018.  Compared with the June 
Tealbook, this forecast has been  marked down 1½ percentage points in the 
second half of this year, 1 percentage point in 2017, and ½ percentage point in 2018.

 The recent pound depreciation is projected to push U.K. inflation up to 
2½ percent b y early next year .  However, we assume the BOE, as it has 
indicated in recent communications, will look through that temporary surge in inflation  and ease monetary policy in response to the considerable 
deterioration in the outlook.  We assume the BOE will  cut its policy rate 
25 basis points, to 0.25 percent, and announce additional asset purchases (perhaps including private -sector asset s) of £75 billion; the BOE currently 
holds the £375 billion in assets that it purchased between 2009 and 2012. 
• Euro Area.  Recent  indicators, including industrial production data through 
May, suggest GDP growth declined from 2.2 percent in the first quarter to 
1¼ percent in the second.  In the aftermath  of the U.K. referendum, we 
anticipate euro -area economic growth will be d epressed by stresses on euro-
area financial institutions and by uncertainty over euro -area cohesion and 
negotiations between the EU and the United Kingdom.  Thus , we revised 
down our growth projection relative to the June Tealbook ½ percentage point in the second half of this year and ¼ percentage point next year.  We now project  GDP growth to slow to about 1 percent in the second half before rising 
to 1¾ percent by  2018.  With inflation projected to rise from its current near-
zero pace to only 1½ percent b y the end of 2018, w e assume the ECB will 
announce additional stimulus at  its September meeting by lowering its deposit 
rate 10  basis points (to negative 0.5 percent) and committing to purchase 
assets at the current pace for one additional  quarter, until m id-2017.   
• Japan.  We estimate that GDP growth slowed  from 1.9 percent in the first 
quarter to ½ percent in the second.  Th e second -quarter  estimate is 
1 percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook, as recent data, including 
a rebound in the manufacturing PMI in June, suggest the economic effect of 
April’s earthquakes was less severe than previously assessed.  Moving forward, we expect Japan’s economy to expand at a pace near ¾ percent through 2018, a bit lower than in the previous Tealbook because of the appreciation of the yen.  Our forecast for the June Tealbook already assumed 
the new stimulus package that  Prime Minister Shinzō Abe is set to pursue 
following his party’s  sizable election victory on July 10.  In addition, amid 
weak growth prospects and with inflation projected to rise only to 1 percent by the end of 2018, we expect the BOJ  to ease monetary policy at its July

 meeting  by cutting its deposit rate 15 basis points (to negative 0.25 percent) 
and increasing purchases of exchange-traded stock funds and Japanese 
government bonds.   
• Canada.  Disruptions in oil production following wildfires in Alberta weighed 
on the Canadian economy in the second quarter.  In addition, data on April monthly GDP, May international t rade, and June manufacturing PMI point to 
weaker -than-expected activity even outside the energy sector .  As such, we 
revised down our estimate of Canadian GDP growth 1 percentage point to a 
contraction of 1 percent in the second quarter.  However, we anticipate a strong payback in the second half of the year as oil production recovers, and we project  GDP growth to average almost 2 ¾ percent through mid-2017, 
supported by a weak Canadian dollar and accommodative monetary and fiscal 
polic ies.  This projection is slightly weaker than in the June Tealbook, l argely 
reflecting  a more subdued outlook for business investment. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China.  Real GDP growth rose  from an upwardly revised 6.5 percent in the 
first quarter to 7.1 percent last  quarter, ½ percentage point above our June 
Tealbook estimate.  Growth was boosted by a partial recovery of exports and a 
credit -induced acceleration in investment  by state -owned enterprises, which 
more than offset a slowing in the growth of private investment.  W e expect 
GDP growth to decline going forward as the authorities, concerned about aggravating financial vulnerabilities, temper their stimulus.  Indeed, in our view, further increases in corporate indebtedness in recent quarters pose significant downside risks.  That said, the steady depreciation of the renminbi on a trade-weighted basis (by more than 10 percent since last August) also presents some upside risk to growth in the coming quarters.  For now, 
however, we see growth falling to about 6½ percent in the second half of this 
year and to about 5¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, in line with our 
estimate of potential growth.  
• Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that r eal GDP growth pick ed up in the 
second quarter to 3½ percent after subdued first -quarter growth of 2 .6 percent.  
However, recent data, especially exports, were a bit weaker than expected,

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

 and we have nudged down our near -term growth forecast.  Concerns that 
weak external demand will spill over into domestic demand have already led 
to monetary policy easing in Indonesia and Taiwan and to a new fiscal 
stimulus program  in Korea.  W e assess the negative effects of Brexit on 
growth to be small, given the relatively limited trade exposures of these countries to Europe and the fairly  benign financial market spillovers observed 
so far .  We continue to project  growth to strengthen to 3¾ percent  in 2017, 
supported by accommodative policies and a recovery in exports. 
• Mexico .  Recent data on exports, industrial production, and domestic spending 
were weaker than expected, and we now see a sharper slowing in GDP growth , to 2 percent in the second quarter from 3.3 percent in the first.  We 
expect growth to gradually climb up to 2¾ percent by mid-2017, supported by 
the 20 percent real depreciation of the peso since mid-2014, the boost to 
disposable income from reform- related price reductions in 
telecommunications, and energy reform.  Those factors should outweigh the negative growth effects of a gradual rise in the Bank of Mexico’s policy rate, which is expected to track the federal funds rate upward.  On June 30, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate 50 basis points, to 4.25 percent, largely 
in response to concerns that earlier peso depreciation  would boost inflation.  
Mexican inflation is projected to rise from a 2½ percent pace in th e first half 
of this year to just above the 3 percent target in the second half. 
• Brazil.   We estimate that the recession deepened in the second quarter, with 
GDP contracting 3  percent at an annual rate, as slowing export growth and 
falling retail sales signal ed weak external and domestic demand .  We expect 
GDP growth to turn positive next year  and to ris e to only 2 percent by 2018.  
Consumer and business confidence measures recently have improved, and 
industrial production has leveled off after a long decline.  Political uncertainty 
remains a drag on growth, although t he government  has succeeded in 
negotiating limits on states’ spending and has submitted a constitutional 
amendment bill to the National Congress to tie  public spending growth to 
inflation.   We project that inflation will fall from an estimated 7½ percent 
pace in the second quarter to 5½ percent by mid -2017, allowing a modest 
reduction in policy rates.

Financial Developments 
Negative sentiment surrounding the  outcome of the U.K. referend um on exit from 
the European Union (“Brexit”) ea rly in the intermeeting period was subsequently 
alleviated by expectations for greater policy accommodation in the AFEs, the reduction 
of near-term political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and positive domestic 
economic data releases.  Immediat ely after the vote, prices of risky assets declined 
sharply while the prices of safe -haven assets spiked.  Despite substantial volatility in 
financial markets, there were mi nimal disruptions to market fun ctioning.  Longer-term 
nominal Treasury yields decrease d further in the two weeks foll owing the vote. 
Since then, Treasury yields have  reversed some of their post-Br exit decline .  
Prices of most risky assets have m ore than rebounded from the n adir reached during the 
week following the Brexit vote, reflecting in part expectations for policy support abroad as well as better-tha n-anticipated employment and retail sales releases that apparently 
helped ease concerns about the U.S. economic outlook.  
 The path of the federal funds r ate implied by OIS quotes was little changed, 
on net, over the intermeeting peri od.  However, the median dealer’s modal 
policy path of the target federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018 f rom the Survey 
of Primary Dealers moved down substantially.  
 Longer-term nominal Treasury yiel ds touched record lows followi ng Brexit 
and retraced partially to end the intermeeting period somewhat lower.  
Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net.   
 Federal Reserve communications following the June FOMC meeting were interpreted by market participan ts as more accommodative than e xpected; 
subsequent communications were ge nerally characterized as in li ne with 
expectations.    
 Broad U.S. stock price indexes increased moderately, on net, ov er the 
intermeeting period despite an in itial sharp decline following the Brexit vote.  
Yield spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed slightly, and 
those on speculative-grade c orporate bonds fell notably.

   The broad U.S. dollar index was little changed on net; it stren gthened against 
most AFE currencies—especia lly the British pound—but weakened a gainst 
most EME currencies.   
 Overall, financing conditions for  nonfinancial firms remained 
accommodative, and firms have con tinued to raise funds through debt markets 
in recent weeks.  
 Conditions in the residential mortgage market became somewhat m ore

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Initial Market Reaction to the  United Kingdom’s Brexit Vote 
In the days immediately following the Brexit vote, asset prices  were volatile, and 
some markets, particularly certa in FX markets, experienced brie f periods of strained 
liquidity.  Global stock indexes sold off notably, credit spreads widened, and safe-haven 
assets appreciated substantiall y.  Nonetheless, these moves wer e consistent with—or, in 
many cases, smaller than—what had been expected by many market participants in the 
event of a “leave” vote.  Moreove r, there were no broad-based m arket dislocations, 
apparently because major investors and financial market utiliti es had prepared 
sufficiently for a volatile scenario.  Market participants also  pointed to the 
communications and actions by advan ced-economy central banks bo th before and after 
the vote as helping to reassure i nvestors.  Nevertheless, sever al longer-term Brexit-related 
risks remain, including to financial stability and political co hesion in the European 
Union.  
Foreign Developments 
In the weeks following the Brexit vote, risk sentiment improved  substantially on 
the back of the resolution of s ome of the near-term political uncertainty in the United 
Kingdom, as well as the better-than-expected U.S. June employment and retail sales 
releases.  Longer-term soverei gn yields in Germany and Japan ar e down slightly since the 
June FOMC meeting, and U.K. yields fell more strongly on expect ations for further 
policy accommodation.  Peripheral eu ro-area spreads narrowed, i n part, as the ECB

  reportedly shifted its asset purchase program toward peripheral  bonds, though some of 
the decline in Spanish spreads al so reflected improved sentiment following the poor 
showing of the far-left Podemo s party in general elections.  
The broad U.S. dollar was little changed, on net, since the Jun e FOMC meeting. 
The British pound partially recove red from its post-Brexit lows  but remains weaker 
against all major currencies ove r the intermeeting period, incl uding by 7½ percent against 
the U.S. dollar.  Similarly, the yen retraced most of its post- Brexit gains amid 
improvements in risk sentiment and expectations of more stimulu s by the Bank of Japan.  
In addition, following the Japanes e parliamentary elections in which Prime Minister 
Abe’s Liberal Democratic Part y strengthened its majority, the g overnment announced 
further fiscal stimulus.  Emergi ng market assets were relativel y resilient over the 
intermeeting period, as the dollar weakened against most emergi ng market currencies, 
and flows into emerging market assets picked up.  By contrast, the Chinese renminbi 
depreciated against the U.S. do llar and the currency basket, bu t this development elicited 
little market reaction.  Later i n the intermeeting period, the unsuccessful coup attempt in 
Turkey left little imprint on ot her emerging market assets.  
Improved risk sentiment and increased expectations for addition al policy stimulus 
in Europe and Japan led globa l equity indexes higher, on net, o ver the intermeeting 
period.  Stocks of larger U.K. c ompanies with significant overs eas operations benefited 
from the weaker pound, far outperf orming smaller domestic-orien ted peers.  European 
bank equity indexes underperformed on investor fears that lower  yields will continue to 
weigh on profitability.  Italian ba nk stocks, in particular, continued to come under 
significant selling pressure due to ongoing concerns about loan  quality and exacerbated 
apprehensions about slower grow th and lower rates.  Investors w ill be focused on the 
results of the euro-area bank stress tests (see the box “Taking  Stock of European Banks 
after Brexit” for more details).   
Domestic Developments 
Since the June FOMC meeti ng, the policy path implied by OIS quo tes was little 
changed on net.  The OIS curve rem ains very flat, with futures quotes not fully pricing in 
a quarter-point tightening until early 2018.  However, these qu otes are likely depressed 
somewhat by negative term premiums.  The implied policy path de clined somewhat after 
the June Summary of Economic Projections showed larger-than-exp ected downward 
revisions to the projected pat h of the federal funds rate.  Fol lowing the Brexit vote, the

 Taking Stock of European  Banks  after Brexit 
In the wake of the U.K. vote  to exit the European  Union (EU),  EU bank equities have been 
hard hit, with  bank stocks declining  up to 30 percent in the immediate  aftermath and  
remaining  depressed on balance despite  a broad recovery in  equity prices (as shown in 
the figure on the following  page).1  The declines—with weaker institutions  being more 
significantly  affected—appear  to reflect  concerns  about the effects  on bank profits of 
lower expected  EU growth, further monetary  easing, and a flatter yield curve.  To date, 
for most European  banks, solvency  concerns  appear limited:  CDS spreads have increased  
but remain  well below  levels observed  during the European sovereign  debt crisis for 
most banks.   However, the  release of the EU bank stress‐test results  on July 29 has the 
potential  to reveal  new weaknesses  and intensify  such fears.  
For U.K. banks, stocks fell after the  vote, but the severity  differed notably across 
institutions.   Declines were the largest for the banks  with significa nt domestic operations,  
likely reflecting  expectations  for deterioration  in the U.K. economic  outlook and asset 
quality, especially  for commercial  real estate.   In contrast,  stocks for  Asia‐oriented banks 
were less affected  and have risen  on balance.  To help prevent liquidity problems  and 
cushion the possible effect of credit intermediation,  the Bank of England has made 
additional  liquidity available through  sterling funding auctions and reduced the 
countercyclical  capital buffer rate from  0.5 percent to 0 percent.  
Investment bank  share prices across the  EU also saw declines,  as markets anticipated  
weaker investment  banking revenues  and an increase in  operatio nal and regulatory  costs 
from the possible loss of “passporting  rights,” which allow these banks  to operate 
through branches  or provide cross‐border services  across the  EU.  Reactions  of share 
prices of other banks in the euro‐area core  have also been sizable and  mostly driven by 
dimmer earnings  prospects. 
The shares  of banks in the euro‐area periphery  saw particularly  steep declines.   Although  
these banks  have little direct  exposure  to the United Kingdom, they  tend to have very  
low earnings  and capital buffers, and  they operate in  the weakest  economies.  Italian 
banks, in particular,  have suffered.   Unlike banks in other peripheral  countries, Italian 
banks did not undergo  major government ‐sponsored  restructuring  after the European  
sovereign  debt crisis.  As a result, they  have a very high  share of nonperforming  loans 
(NPLs) (18 percent of  gross loans), insufficient  provisions  against losses on these loans  
(45 percent of NPLs), and low profitability  (return on assets of 0.22 percent).   Moreover,  
they tend to have little capital  in excess of the required  minimum s, a weakness  that is 
compounded  by having inadequate  loan  loss reserves.   At the same  time, they have a 
very limited ability to raise capital through the market, as failed attempts  by two small 
lenders demonstrated  earlier this  year.

 In recent weeks, analyst commentary  has highlighted  rumored  capital shortfalls  in the 
upcoming  EU stress‐test results at a few Italian lenders,  in particular  Banca Monte dei 
Paschi di Siena.  (The results will also be closely watched  for banks  in other countries, 
specifically  Deutsche  Bank, which is struggling  with low capital buffers  and weak 
earnings.)  This  year, EU regulators  have not set an official pass/fail threshold, so  the 
exact capital  shortfalls  will not be immediately  evident.  Weaknesses  revealed  in the 
exercise will, however,  be used by supervisors to determine bank ‐specific capital needs.   
Italy’s authorities  are exploring  options to support their  banks, but they  face challenging  
economic,  legal, and  political constraint s.  Under the  EU’s bail‐in rules, injecting  public 
funds into the banks  would likely require imposing  losses on bank liabilities.   But because 
a large fraction of uninsured  bank debt is held by Italian retail investors, imposing  such 
losses would be politically  costly, especi ally ahead of a constitutional  referendum  in 
October on  which the government  has staked its future.  Recent initiatives  to tackle  the 
NPL problem  without large‐scale government  involvement have  been mostly  ineffective.   
An NPL securitization  scheme and a private  investment  fund set up to help with small 
bank recapitalization  and NPL sales were seen as positive but inadequate  because of 
limited private‐sector  participation.   Currently,  a second  private fund of about €5 billion—
well below  the estimated  required  capital to address sector ‐wide problem  loans—has  
been discussed.  An important  factor in banks’ inability  to resolve  problem  loans is the 
country’s  bankruptcy  procedures.   Desp ite recent reforms,  banks take several years  to 
foreclose  on defaulted  borrowers  and claim collateral.  
Reportedly, Italy’s  authorities,  the European Commission,  and the EU bank regulators  
have not yet agreed on a strategy  for solving  the situation.   As a step to avoid a potential  
run on the country’s  banks, the European  Commissio n authorized  a contingency  plan of 
the Italian government to  guarantee  bank bond issuance of  up to €150 billion until the 
end of the year.  U.S. banks’ direct exposures  to Italian banks  are very modest—only  
1 percent of U.S. banks’ aggregate Tier  1 capital.  Nevertheless,  problems  addressing  the 
weaknesses  of Italian banks  have the potential  for s pillovers through a range of  
channels—for  example,  knock‐on effects of a banking  crisis on the Italian sovereign  and 
other peripheral  sovereigns  more broadly—which all  may result in heightened  financial 
stresses and economic  disruptions  in Europe and perhaps globally.

  implied path declined more substantially, with the near-term im plied policy path 
becoming inverted, as investors  evidently assigned a nonnegligible probability of a rate 
cut at upcoming FOMC meetings.  T his inversion reversed followi ng domestic data 
releases—particularly for emplo yment and retail sales in June—t hat were generally 
viewed as better than expected.  At the end of the intermeeting  period, market quotes 
implied only a slightly positive probability of a rate hike at the July meeting.       
According to the Desk’s July sur veys of primary dealers and mar ket participants, 
respondents assign a probability of near zero to a rate hike at the July meeting.  While the 
median respondent continues t o expect one rate hike by the end of 2016, the timing of the 
next rate hike has shifted out f rom September to December.  In addition, the median 
dealer’s modal policy path of the t arget federal funds rate in 2017 and 2018 moved down 
substantially.  The median inve stor’s path also moved down.  Consistent with these 
declines, the median dealer pushe d out the likely timing of a c hange to the Committee’s 
policy on reinvestments by about ha lf a year, although the median investor’s likely timing 
was relatively little changed. 
The Treasury yield curve has flat tened slightly, on net, since the June FOMC 
meeting.  While 2- and 5-year Tr easury yields were about unchanged, 10- and 30-year 
tenors declined 8 basis points a nd 14 basis points, respectivel y, on net.  Longer-term 
nominal Treasury yields had fallen precipitously in the two wee ks following the Brexit 
vote before reversing course, a nd the level of longer-dated yie lds and the spread between 
2- and 10-year yields had reached r ecord lows during that perio d.1  The declines appear to 
reflect a variety of factors, including expectations for a more  accommodative stance of 
monetary policy by major central b anks; the reported intensific ation of demand for safe-
haven assets immediately following Brexit; and the reported strong demand on the part of 
global institutional investor s for relatively higher-yielding U .S. fixed-income assets, in 
particular following decreases in sovereign yields in Europe an d Japan.  Some of these 
factors may have been at work for some time now (for further di scussion, see the box 
“The Decline in Long-Term Treasur y Yields since the Start of th e Year”).  Most of the 
decline in nominal yields appears to be attributable to the dec line in real yields, as TIPS- 
and swaption-based measures of i nflation compensation were litt le changed on net.

 The Decline in Long-Term Treasury Yields since the Start of the Year 
In the aftermath of the United Kingdom ’s “Brexit”  referendum, U.S. long-term Treasury yields 
fell sharply, reaching new historical lows .  The initial sharp decline in yields added to the ir 
already significant drop since the beginning of the year .  The decline in long-term yields appears 
particularly remarkable over a period during which, on balance, broad equity prices have risen 
somewhat, corporate bond spreads are little changed, and the VIX is near the lower end of its 
distribution over the past few years .  This discussion reviews domestic factors, such as the long-
run outlook for U.S. growth and monetary policy, as well as foreign factors that seem to be 
important in explaining the decline in long-term yields since the start of the year.1 
Although yields have now largely retraced their declines since Brexit, the 10-year nominal yield 
has, on net, fallen 76 basis points (bps) since the beginning of 2016 (figure 1).   Even more 
pronounced is the 93 bps fall in the 5- to-10-year-forward rate, resulting in a substantial 
flattening of the yield curve.  Notably, the decline in long-term nominal yields is predominantly 
attributable to a decline in real yields.  T he staff’s term s tructure model attributes about one-
third of the decline in the 10-year nominal rate so far this year to a decline in average expected 
future short rates and the remaining two-thirds to a decline in term premiums (the black lines in 
figure 2 ).2   
The decline in t
he expected short-rate component of yields appears consistent with the steady 
decline in expectations for the long-term U.S. economic growth outlook as evidenced by various 
survey measures (figure 3).   Consistent with this outlook, long-horizon survey forecasts of the 
federal funds rate and the median of longer-run “SEP dot s” have also moved down (figure 4 ).3  
Because most measures of long-run inflation expectations have remained relatively stable, such 
revisions in long-run policy rate expectations should largely reflect decreases in the expected 
path of the real short rate , depressing long-term real yields.4 
Foreign economic and financial market developments appear to have also played a key role in 
the sharp decline in yields observed since the beginning of the year , mainly through a decline in 
term premiums .  In particular, the decline in long-term U.S. yields mirrors the declines in German 
and U.K. sovereign yields over the same period, as shown in figure 5 , which is a continuation of 
the strong co-movement in global yields evident since 2014.5  More specifically, rolling 
correlations of U.S. 10-year yield changes with their German and U.K. counterparts have been 
consistently high (figure 6). 
                                                 
1 Long-dated U.S. yields also fell sharply from 2010 to 2012, reaching then-historical lows in mid-2012.  While 
that occurred during the European debt crisis, the weak domestic economic outlook and the Federal Reserve’s 
increasingly accommodative stance of monetary policy at the time seemed to set the 2010 –12 period apart from 
the current period of low U.S. rates.  Notably, the swaption-implied skew of the 10-year swap rate is currently 
significantly lower than its level in 2010 through 2012, implying increased demand for protection against even 
further yield declines. 
2 In turn, about two-thirds of the decline in nominal term premiums can be attributed to the decline in real 
term premiums.  This proportion is roughly similar for both the pre- and post-Brexit samples.   
3 A related measure, the real rate consistent with the economy operating near potential (the “neutral” 
rate), has also declined steadily.  See Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of 
Interest,”  Review of Economics and Statistics , vol. 85 (4), pp. 1063 –70. 
4 If such downward revisions are associated with increased uncertainty regarding the long-run economic 
outlook, real term premiums may also fall.  Moreover, the decline in nominal yields reflects some decline in 
inflation compensation since the end of 2015. 
5 The staff’s March 2015 memorandum to the FOMC, “Recent Declines in Long -Term Interest Rates:  Causes 
and Possible Implications,” argued that global factors were important contributors to the decline in U.S. long -
term Treasury yields since the beginning of 2014.

 With the outlook for the U.S. economy still positive, the decline in estimates of U.S. term 
premiums, which appears to be more pronounced than in other countries (for example, in 
Germany, the blue lines in figure 2), is consistent with reported increased demand for relatively 
safe and higher-yielding Treasury securities at a time of extremely low and even negative yields 
in other advanced economies.  In turn, the decline in advanced foreign yields appears to stem, 
at least in part, from concerns over the ir local economic outlooks and expectations for a 
continuation of highly accommodative monetary policy .  Indeed, market commentaries have 
mainly pointed to concerns over the global economic outlook as the reason why U.S. yields fell 
sharply in January (in the wake of heightened uncertainty regarding China and the broader 
global economy) and again in late June (associated with the British referendum).6  Market 
commentaries h
ave also repeatedly pointed to foreign investors moving into U.S. Treasur y 
securities as sovereign yields in Europe and Japan have declined further.7  Staff analysis 
provides some statis
tical support for this hypothesis; for example, standard “Granger causality” 
tests show that the probability that changes in German or U.K. long-end forward rates can 
predict changes in U.S. long-end forward rates has recently increased to historically high levels 
(not shown). 
                                                 
6 In response to a special question in the July Desk surveys, respondents cited “spillo vers from 
low/ declining yields abroad” as the most important factor behind the decline in the U.S. 5 -to-10-year nominal 
forward rate in both the January 1 –June 14 and June 15 –July 12 periods, while the second most important factor 
was cited to be “changes in outlook for U.S. economic growth” for the January 1–June 14 period and “safe 
haven demand” for the June 15– July 12 period. 
7 The recent decline in the long-term cross-currency basis swap spreads for the dollar versus advanced 
economy currency pairs appears consistent with increased demand for dollar-denominated assets.

  Production-coupon agency MBS spread s to Treasury securities narrowed slightly, driven 
by demand from foreign and domestic banks. 
Broad stock price indexes increa sed moderatel y, on net, since the June FOMC 
meeting, supported by the same fact ors that appear to have boosted global equity prices.  
The VIX declined during the int ermeeting period, returning to t he lower end of its 
distribution over the past few  years.  U.S. bank stock prices dropped sharply after the 
Brexit vote but have s ince retraced that  decrease, supported by  better-than-expected 
earnings reports of some of the l argest domestic banks (see the  box “The Effect of Brexit 
on U.S. Bank Stocks” for additional discussion of the recent be havior of those bank 
stocks). 
Based on earnings reports for 12 per cent of firms in the S&P 50 0 index and Wall 
Street analyst forecasts for the  rest, second-quarter earnings per share are projected to 
increase slightly from the prev ious quarter, recovering only pa rt of their sharp decline 
earlier in the year.  Even so, the outlook for corporate earnin gs showed signs of 
stabilization, as analyst for ecasts for year-ahead earnings wer e revised down only slightly 
in July. 
Spreads of yields on investment-grade corporate bonds over thos e on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities ende d the period somewhat lower, o n net, and spreads of 
speculative-grade corporate bonds  declined notably. Speculative -grade near-term forward 
spreads dropped substantially more than their far-term forward counterparts, suggesting 
that the overall decline in specu lative-grade spreads was due i n part to a less negative 
credit outlook and not just an inc rease in investors’ risk appe tite.

Overall, financing conditions for  nonfinancial firms have remai ned 
accommodative since the June FOMC meeting.  In June, gross issu ance of corporate 
bonds remained robust, particularly for the investment-grade sector.  Issuance slowed 
significantly in early July for bot h investment- and speculate- grade bonds, in part 
reflecting seasonal factors.  A ggregate commercial and industri al (C&I) lending by banks 
continued to expand through early July, although such lending b y large domestic and 
foreign banks slowed in June.  This pattern is consistent with the responses to the July

 The Effect of Brexit on U.S. Bank Stocks 
Following the U.K. referendum to exit the European Union (EU), or “Brexit ,” the 
equity prices of U.S. banks declined significantly more than broader U.S. equity 
indexes.1  In particular, two days following the Brexit vote , the S&P 500 bank 
index, the set of bank stocks contained in the broader S&P 500 index, dropped 
10 percent, while the S&P 500 index as a whole fell 5 percent (figure 2).   In recent 
weeks, bank sto
cks largely retraced their post-Brexit declines but remain at price 
levels much below those witnessed one year ago (figure 1).       
The relative underperformance of bank stocks following the Brexit vote could 
reflect investor concerns regarding banks’ direct exposures to the United 
Kingdom and EU as well as more general concerns regarding banks’ future 
profitability ; for example , lower expected long-term interest rates, and a flatter 
yield curve, could reduce net interest margi ns on interest-bearing assets, such as 
loans.   We explore the extent to which such factors likely contributed to the 
performance of U.S. bank stocks following the Brexit vote .     
To gauge the extent to which lower expected profitability due to lower expected 
long-term interest rates, and a flatter yield curve, may have affected bank stock 
returns following the Brexit vote, we separately consider ed banks with a higher 
ratio of loa
ns to assets (a measure of commercial banking focus), those with a 
bigger duration gap (a measure of the degree of maturity transformation in a 
bank’s loan and securities portfolios), and those with higher current net interest 
margins .  To gauge whether concerns about lower future trading revenues and 
investment banking fees may have affected bank stock returns following the 
Brexit vote, we also separately consider ed banks for which trading and 
investment banking comprise a greater share of their income.    
 
                                                 
1 The declines in bank equity prices were greater than would be implied by the historical 
beta of bank stocks calculated over the period from 2011 to 2015.

 We then examined the correlations between these bank characteristics and 
banks’ relative stock returns.   As shown in the first and second columns of the 
table below, banks with larger loans- to-assets ratios and bigger duration gaps 
had lower relative stock returns following the Brexit vote , and banks with higher 
current net interest margins had higher relative returns.  The correlations are 
statistically significant for the loans- to-assets and duration gap measures.   
We did not find 
that banks with a greater share of trading and investment 
banking income experienced lower relative stock returns following the Brexit 
vote.  However, such banks have had lower relative returns year- to-date, a period 
which includes the bout of financial market volatility early in the year, as shown in 
the third column in the table .  We did find that banks with more specialized credit 
card lending or custodial business had relatively higher returns in all three 
periods considered.      
We also did not find that banks with greater exposures to the United Kingdom 
and EU experienced significantly lower relative stock returns following the Brexit 
vote.  Y ear-to-date, however, banks with greater exposures to the EU have 
experienced lower relative returns, perhaps reflecting more general concerns 
about the health of EU economies and financial institutions.2     
Overall, th
e relative returns of U.S. bank stocks following the Brexit vote appear 
to have been largely driven by concerns about the future profitabilitiy of banks 
more generally, rather than concerns about their direct exposures to the United 
Kingdom and EU.  Indeed, the banks whose stocks witnessed the largest price 
declines following the vote were those whose profitability seems to be most 
affected by lower U.S. economic growth and lower long-term interest rates.

  2016 SLOOS, in which a modest fr action of respondents indicated  that they had tightened 
their C&I lending standards and e xperienced weaker demand for such loans during the 
second quarter on net. 
On balance, the credit qualit y of nonfinancial corporations con tinued to weaken, 
though there are some indications that the pace of deterioratio n is subsiding.  The net 
volume of bonds downgraded in th e second quarter was notably sm aller than in the 
previous quarter.  Even so, actua l default rates of nonfinancia l bonds and the KMV 
measure of expected year-ahead de faults both remained elevated relative to the ranges 
that typically prevai l during expansions. 
Financing conditions in commercial real estate stayed fairly ac commodative, on 
balance, and bank lending in all m ajor categories was strong th rough June.  CMBS 
spreads did not appear to have b een affected by the Brexit vote.  They remain elevated, 
however, which has suppressed CMBS issuance markedly so far thi s year.  Meanwhile, 
CMBS delinquency rates have edged up for the third consecutive month, largely driven 
by the inability of some borrowe rs to pay off or refinance loan s that reached their 
maturity.  Relatedly, a significant net fraction of respondents  to the July SLOOS 
indicated that they had tighten ed their CRE lending standards o n all major loan categories 
during the second quarter.   
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained solid:  Gr oss issuance of 
municipal bonds in June was str ong, credit quality continued to be stable overall, and the 
ratio of yields on general oblig ation bonds over those on compa rable-maturity Treasury 
securities was little change d on net.  On June 30, President Ob ama signed into law the 
Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act, which provides Puerto 
Rico with a clearer path toward debt restructuring.  The next d ay, the commonwealth 
defaulted on debt payments on gene ral obligation bonds for the first time.  CDS spreads 
on debt issued by Illinois increase d to their highest levels si nce 2010 following the credit 
rating downgrade by Moody’s in ear ly June.  The default by Puerto Rico and the 
downgrade of Illinois both appeared to have only a limited effe ct on the broader 
municipal bond market.

  fixed mortgages fell 8 basis point s over the intermeeting perio d, on net, to a level of 
3.3 percent.  A number of large banks noted in the July SLOOS an easing of standards for 
GSE-eligible home-purchase loan s.  Respondents also noted a bro ad-based pickup in 
demand across most major categor ies of home-purchase loans.  In dicators suggest that 
refinance activity may be pick ing up in response to the recent drop in mortgage rates.   
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little cha nged and 
remained largely accommodative against a backdrop of stable cre dit performance across 
debt categories.  Growth in auto balances remained robust, though respondents to the July SLOOS indicated that they had tig htened their standards on auto  loans.  Credit card 
balances continued to grow moderately, on balance, and stand 5½ percent higher than 
levels seen a year ago.  Despite t he volatility in financial ma rkets in the early part of the 
intermeeting period, spreads for c redit card and auto loan ABS remained largely stable 
and ABS issuance is expected t o pick up in the coming weeks.   
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, th e effective federal funds and E urodollar rates 
traded within the target range.2  Overnight Treasury GCF and triparty GC repo rates rose 
notably on the day following the B rexit vote but quickly retrac ed to near pre-Brexit 
levels.  Secured and unsecured bor rowings by U.K.- and EU-based  borrowers were stable 
through the vote.  
Rates and volumes displayed the  typical quarter-end dynamics at the end of June.  
The federal funds rate and the E urodollar rate  declined to 30 b asis points on June 30.  The 
Treasury GC repo rate moved up a few  basis points, while the in crease in the GCF repo 
rate for Treasury collateral was more pronounced.  ON RRP take- up was $279 billion on 
June 30, representing a $136 billi on increase from the previous  day, slightly less than the 
daily changes recorded on the past few quarter-ends.  Following quarter-end, conditions in money markets quickly normaliz ed, but the effective federal funds rate remains 2 basis 
points higher compared with lev els prevailing before Brexit. 
                                                 
2 Both the effective federal funds and Eurodollar rates averaged 39 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our 
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, importantly because both monetary and fiscal 
policy appear to be better positioned  to offset large positive shocks than adverse ones.  
We also continue to view foreign developments and prospects as posing downs ide risk s 
to the U.S. economy:  F oreign authorities  face significant constraints in providing policy 
stimulus , and concerns about financial fragility in Europe could spur a new wave of 
financial turmoil.  We view the risks around our unemployment rate projection as aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to the upside.   
With regard to inflation, we see considerable uncertainty around our projection, 
but we do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  At the same time, we contin ue to view the risks around our inflation projection as tilted to the downside.  
Market -based measures of inflation compensation remain very low, as do some survey-
based measures of longer -term inflation expectations.  In addition, the realization of the 
downside risks to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar , thereby depressing import prices and inflation .  
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative survei llance assessment.  The vulnerability of the U.S. financial system 
appears moderate overall, reflecting strong capital and liquidity positions at banks, moderate leverage in the nonbank financial sector, and subdued borrowing by households .  These factors,  together with the preparations undertaken by many market 
participants ahead of the Brexit vote, have likely helped account for the relatively transient spillover effects of Brexit thus far to U.S. financial markets; even so, U.S. financial markets could be affected significantly if Europe experienced a deep and protracted crisis (as explored in the “Severe Financial Stress in Europe” scenario).    
Vulnerabilities stemming from asset valuation pressures remain contained , with 
risk premiums broadly similar to levels in the spring.  Although commercial real estate

prices continued to increase briskly, recent indicators may point to diminished risk 
appetite on the part of investors in this sector.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of 
alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first  
scenario explores the consequences of heightened financial stress in Europe that 
generates sizable s pillovers to the global economy .  In contrast, in the second  scenario, a 
positive outlook for consumer spending and upbeat consumer confidence signal that 
economic activity is stronger than in the baseline.  The third  scenario considers the 
possibility tha t a deterioration in long- term inflation expectations might be indicative of 
weaker aggregate demand.  Finally, the last two  scenario s explore the consequences of 
continued subdued labor productivity growth, with different implications for the outlook for inflation . 
The first  scenario is run in the multicountry SIGMA model, while the final four 
use the EDO model.  In all the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the same inertial policy rule as in the baseline , including the adjustments to t he intercept in the near 
term; these intercept adjustments are invariant to economic events in the scenarios.  In all 
cases, we assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow the baseline paths.  
Severe Financial Stress in Europe 
As discu ssed in the International Economic Developments and Outlook box 
“Global Implications of the U.K. Vote to Leave the European Union,” our baseline assumption is that the economic effects of Brexit outside Europe will remain fairly contained.  However, Brexit  may have substantially more- adverse consequences, either 
because it reinforces anti -EU sentiment and triggers other breakaway movements, or 
because it highlights vulnerabilities in the European banking system that undermine confidence in peripheral governments’ fiscal situation and EU financial backstops; either outcome could lead, in extreme circumstances , to another European financial crisis.  In 
this scenario, we consider the implications of severe financial stress in Europe that has substantial adverse spillovers to global financial conditions and confidence.   
Specifically, our scenario assumes that financial conditions in the EU tighten 
sharply and that confidence declines as  worries about the future of the euro zone re-

emerge.   EU corporate borrowing  spreads sh oot up 175 basis points, while household 
borrowing spreads rise about 90 basis points .  As a result, EU GDP falls  almost 6  percent 
below the baseline by the end of 2018.  The EU crisis has substantial adverse spillovers 
to the United States.  U. S. corporate bond spreads are assumed to rise about 60 basis 
points above the baseline , while flight- to-safety flows cause the trade -weighted dollar to 
appreciate by 10  percent and depress 10- year Treasury yields modestly .  Financial 
conditions tighten even more in the EMEs, and their currencies depreciate substantially.1   
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline while lower confidence and weaker financial conditions depress  
U.S. domest ic demand .  All told, U.S. real GDP expands only 1¼ percent in 2017—about 
1¼ percentage points less than in the baseline—and 1¾ percent in 2018.  The U.S. unemployment rate runs at around 5 percent in 2017 and 2018 and is about ¾ percentage 
point higher than in the baseline at the end of 2018.  Lower resource utilization and 
falling import prices reduce U.S. core PCE inflation to just under 1 percent by 2017.  The federal funds rate follows a shallow path, reaching only 1½ percent at the end of 2018. 
Consum er-Driven Expansion 
Although growth of consumer spending was weak earlier in the year, the staff 
estimates that PCE increased at a robust 4 ¼ percent annual rate last quarter.  Moreover, 
consumer confidence has remained reasonably upbeat, and there are signs of some wage acceleration, which could support households’ income and further boost confidence.   
In this scenario, we assume faster consumer spending growth that, in turn, spurs 
production and higher business investment.
2  As a result, real GDP rises 2¾ percent in 
2016, compared with 1¾ percent in the baseline projection.  The unemployment rate falls steeply , bottoming out at a touch below 4 percent by the end of 2018; it then edges up 
over the remainder of the forecast period but stays lower than in the baseline.  With 
resource utilization running tight, inflation is a little higher  than in the baseline, reaching 
2 percent in 2019.  The federal funds rate rises more steeply, reaching 4  percent by the 
end of 2019.   
                                                 
1 The increase in European and U.S. financial stresses featured in the scenario is broadly similar to 
the tightening of financial conditions observed during the 2011– 12 European debt crisis, except for the 
10 percent appreciation of the dollar, which is som ewhat larger. 
2 We generate this scenario by applying a one- standard -deviation positive shock to the model’s 
main driver of aggregate demand.

Lower Inflation Expectations from Weaker Demand  
Several measures of longer -run inflation expectations are currently near the lower 
end of the ir historical ranges.  In past Tealbooks , we have examined one interpretation of 
this declining trend in inflation expectations by assuming that it reflects, among other 
factors, a different expectations formation process than in the baseline.3  In this scenario, 
we take a different approach and consider the possibility that the deterioration of inflation 
expectations may be driven by perceptions of persistently weaker economic activity than  
in the baseline ; this outlook is ratified over the projection period.  We calibrate this 
scenario such that these forces depress  five-year expectations of inflation , as of the third 
quarter of 2016, by 25 basis points relative to  the baseline.   
Under these circumstances, actual inflation is only 1 ½ percent in 2017, 
¼ percentage point below  the baseline, and is still at 1¾  percent at the end of 2020.  
Inflation remains persistently below target in part because the  response to low inflation in 
the baseline policy rule is not very aggressive.  The moderately weaker path for aggregate 
demand that is associated with this lower path of inflation reduces GDP growth for 2016  
by ½ percentage point , with little effect on growth beyond mid-2017; the unemployment 
rate remains around 5 percent until the second half of 2017.  The federal funds rate runs about ½ percentage point lower than in the baseline for several years.   
Weaker Productivity with Higher Inflation  
Labor productivity growth has been weak over the past  several years, averaging 
less than ½  percent per year from 2011 through 2015.  In the baseline projection, 
productivity growth is assumed to pick up to an average annual rate of 1¼ percent in 2017 and 2018, about the average pace over the past 10 years.  However, the recent subdued growth of productivity may persist longer than in the baseline.  In this scenario, labor productivity growth is assumed to remain at only ½ percent per year over the first 
two years of the scenario before gradually moving up to the baseline pace.
4  The weaker  
                                                 
3 For example, in the April 2016 Tealbook scenario “Lower Long- Term Inflation Expectations,” 
we explored the impl ications of an initially lower level of inflation expectations than in the baseline 
followed by inflation expectations that are formed adaptively (rather than being anchored in the near term) 
and that eventually drift up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
4 Although the growth rate  of productivity returns to the baseline, the level of productivity remains 
permanently below the baseline in this scenario.  We judge that the deviation in the level of productivity in the simulation from the baseline after  two years is roughly at the lower 15th percentile of its distribution.

path of labor productivity is driven by a combination of lower total factor productivity 
growth and positive shocks to aggregate demand.5   
Although real GDP grows somewhat more slowly than in the baseline, the 
unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory, declining to 4 percent by the end of 2018, 
consistent with the weaker labor productivity and positive shocks to aggregate demand.  
These fo rces drive up firms’ marginal costs of production, leading to a higher path of 
inflation, which reaches 2½ percent in 2018 and remains above the Committee’s target in 
2020.  As a result, the path of the federal funds rate is steeper than in the baseline,  
reaching 5 perc ent by the end of 2020.  As noted in the previous scenario, the baseline 
policy rule does not react very aggressively to deviation s of inflation from target , and  
this relatively tepid reaction of monetary policy to inflation contributes to the persistence 
of high inflation.  A more aggressive policy reaction could mitigate both the persistence 
of inflation and the degree to which inflation rises in the first place.  
Weaker Productivity with Moderate Inflation  
In the past few years , sluggish gains in labor productivity have not been 
accompanied by the notable inflation ary pressures  portrayed in the preceding scenario; it 
is possible that the forces identified by the EDO model that  have prevented faster growth 
in wages and prices might also pe rsist in the future.  In this scenario, we assume that  the 
upward pressure on inflation, caused by the lower total factor productivity and positive 
demand  shocks of the previous scenario, manifests itself less  markedly.  
In particular,  we assume that labor productivity follows the same path as in the 
preceding scenario but that aggregate demand shocks are not as large , total factor 
productivity growth is slightly  weaker,  and wage growth is more restrained.  On balance, 
these forces temper the rise in inflation , which exceeds the baseline by less than 
¼ percentage point.  Under these circumstances , real GDP growth is  noticeably weaker 
than the baseline; however, the corresponding reduction in potential output growth yields an unemployment rate that is o nly a touch lower than in the baseline.  With little change 
to the path of inflation and the output gap, the federal funds rate is only ½ percentage point higher than the baseline projection by the end of 2020.   
                                                 
5 In EDO and many other DSGE models  with both labor and capital as inputs to production, labor 
productivity is countercyclical; labor hoarding is not a feature of these models, and dim inishing marginal 
returns to labor set in as hours worked increase.

In this scenario, the federal funds rate turns out to follow a trajectory broadly 
similar to the baseline despite substantial negative shocks to productivity over the next 
two years.  One reason is that aggregate demand falls essentially in line with aggregate supply without additional monetary policy intervention; another reason is that shocks were chosen to yield an inflation outcome that is little changed .  This scenario could have 
very different implications for monetary policy if total factor productivity growth were assumed to be permanently  weaker, along the lines of the secular stagnation hypothesis, 
and, hence, the implied  longer-run equilibrium federal funds rate were lower.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges
 for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
