Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Since the July Tealbook, incoming information about economic ac tivity has been 
close to our expectations, on balan ce, and corroborates our ear lier view that the pace of 
economic growth is picking up in t he second half of the year.  The July and August 
employment reports, taken togeth er, indicated slightly more imp rovement in labor market 
conditions than we had projecte d in July.  On the spending side, real GDP growth in the 
first half is estimated to have  been weaker than earlier antici pated, but growth in private 
domestic final purchases (PDFP)—w hich we view as a better indic ator of the underlying 
momentum in aggregate demand—has been solid and about in line w ith our previous 
projection.  The GDP shortfall re flected weaker inventory inves tment, which we expect 
to be mostly unwound by the end of t he year.  All told, our forecast for real GDP growth 
over the year as a whole is nearly unrevised at  1¾ percent.   
Beyond this year, our projection for  real GDP growth is a touch weaker than our 
previous forecast, reflecting a slightly slower assumed pace of  potential output growth.  
We expect real GDP growth to inc rease to a 2½ percent pace in 2 017 and then to edge 
down to around 2 percent in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019—rates s till sufficient to 
generate some further tighten ing of resource utilization.  At the end of 2018 and in 2019, 
real GDP is forecast to be 1½ percent above our estimate of its  potential.  
Correspondingly, we expect the une mployment rate to fall to 4¼ percent, ¾ percentage 
point below our estimate of its  natural rate.  These assessments are very close to our 
expectations in the July Tealbook. 
The inflation forecast is also ess entially unrevised from the J uly Tealbook.  We 
continue to project that PCE prices will increase 1.2 percent i n the second half of the 
year, similar to the first half , as a step-down in core inflati on is offset by an acceleration 
in food and energy prices.  Over th e following couple of years,  PCE inflation is projected 
to move up, reaching 1.9 percent in 2019, as the effects of ear lier energy and import price 
declines fade and as resource ut ilization continues to tighten in an environment of 
reasonably stable long-run i nflation expectations. 
We discuss our assessment of the  risks to real economic activit y and inflation in 
the Risks and Uncer tainty section.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth  is about in line with the median 
projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip 
consensus forecast in 2016, and it is slightly st ronger than that of the Blue Chip in 
2017.  (The SPF forecast is released quarterly and is about a month  old; we await the 
next release on  November 14 .)  The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is 
slightly above the others in 2016 and in line with t he Blue Chip in 2017.  The s taff’s 
projection for CPI inflation is  slightly  below the outside forecasters  in 2016 and 2017.  
The staff’s projections for total and core PCE price inflation  are also somewhat 
lower than the SPF  in 2016 and 2017.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following the 
June  FOMC meeting.  The table below  compares the staff’s current economic projection with the 
one we presented in the June  Tealbook.  
Over the projection period  through 2019, the cumulative growth of  real GDP is slightly lower than 
in the June forecast .  However, with potential output growth also having been revised a little 
lower over the medium term (as well as in the longer run), the output gap is unchanged through 
2018 and a bit higher in 2019 .  Correspondingly, t he unemployment rate is  unrevised through 2018 
and, at 4.2 percent , a tenth lower at the end of 2019 . 
The staff’s forecast  for PCE price inflation —both total  and core —is essentially unchanged from 
June.  W e continue to project that inflation will move up in the coming years , with total PCE price 
inflation  reach ing 1.9 percent by  2019.   
We have lowered the assumed longer-run value of the real equilibrium federal funds rate to 
0.75  percent in this forecast, down from 1.0 percent in the June Tealbook.  T he intercept -adjusted 
inertial Taylor ( 1999) rule  that we use in our baseline forecast  (introduced in the June Tealbook ) 
prescribes a path of t he nominal federal funds rate that  rises a bit more slowly  and reaches an 
average of 3. 19 perce nt in the fourth quarter of 2019 , 15 basis  point s less than in our June  
projection —primarily reflecting  the effect of the lower longer- run equilibrium rate.

  KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 In the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use to mechanically set the federal 
funds rate in our projection, we lo wered the real long-run equilibrium rate (r*) 
from 1 percent to ¾ percent.1  The path of the time-varying intercept 
converges to the new long-run value for r* on the same time fra me as 
before—namely, by the end of 2018.  However, these adjustments are small, 
and the resulting path of the federal funds rate is close to th e one in the July 
Tealbook.  All told, the current r ule calls for the federal fun ds rate to increase 
about 85 basis points per year ove r the projection period and t o average 
3.2 percent in the fourth qua rter of 2019, about 45 basis point s above its 
neutral level.   
 As in the July Tealbook, we assume that the SOMA portfolio will  remain at 
its current level until the thir d quarter of next year and then  begin to contract 
as the proceeds from maturing assets are no longer reinvested.   
Other Interest Rates  
 The projected path of the 10-year Treasury yield is lower than in the July 
projection, mostly reflecting our assessment that the factors h olding down 
term premiums will be more persis tent than we had previously assumed.  We 
revised down the medium-term path of the term premium between 1 5 and 
40 basis points and revised down its assumed long-run value 10 basis points.2  
Nevertheless, our projection contin ues to call for the 10-year Treasury yield to 
rise significantly over the medium term, as the 10-year valuati on window 
moves through the period of extre mely low short-term interest r ates and term 
premiums increase very graduall y toward more normal levels. 
 Investment-grade corporate bond s preads continued to trend down since late 
July, leading us to revise dow n our projection for investment-g rade corporate 
                                                 
1 See the September 9, 2016, mem o sent to the FOMC titled “Adjus tments to Some Long-Term 
Parameters of the Staff Judgme ntal Forecast” by Cristina Fuentes-Albero and Ashley Wang, which 
discusses our adjustments to the assumed long-run values of the real equilibrium interest rate, the term 
premium, and potential GDP growth.

  yields slightly more than that for 10-year Treasury yields.  By  contrast, the 
path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was revised down broadly i n line with 
Treasury yields. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Stock prices in the current quart er were revised down a touch c ompared with 
the forecast in the July Tealbook, reflecting recent decreases in broad equity 
indexes.  Equity prices are project ed to rise at an average ann ual rate of 
1¾ percent over the medium term.   
 Recent data on house prices were a bit softer than we had expec ted, leading us 
to slightly lower the projected increase for 2016 to 5½ percent.  Our 
projection for annual increas es averaging 3¾ percent from 2017 through 2019 
is close to pace in the July Tealbook. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We continue to assume that disc retionary policy actions at all levels of 
government will boost real GDP growth almost ½ percentage point  this year 
and next, with smaller cont ributions in 2018 and 2019.  We assu me that a 
continuing resolution will be  passed by the Congress to fund di scretionary 
federal spending and that a shutdown of the government will be avoided 
this fall.    
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign real GDP growth is esti mated to have slowed to an annua l rate of less 
than 1 percent in the second qua rter, held down by transitory c ontractions in 
Canada and Mexico.  We expect  growth to bounce back to 2½ percent in the 
second half of this year, the same as in the July Tealbook.  Al though the 
outlook for EME growth has weakened slightly, we pared back the negative effects we expect from Brexit  on the U.K. and euro-area economi es.  After 
this year, foreign growth is  projected to edge up toward 2¾ per cent for the 
remainder of the forecast, suppor ted in part by accommodative m onetary 
policy abroad. 
 The broad nominal dollar is ½ perc ent lower in the near term th an in the July 
Tealbook in light of dollar depreciat ion that has occurred agai nst the

  currencies of the advanced for eign economies.  However, we expe ct a steeper 
path of dollar appreciation over the forecast period, as we rea ssessed our 
assumption about the path of the C hinese renminbi and increased  the 
sensitivity of the dollar to proj ected market surprises in poli cy interest rates.  
All told, the broad real dolla r is about 1¼ percent higher by t he end of 2018 
than in the July Tealbook.  
o We now assume the dollar will appreciate against the renminbi a t a 
2 percent annual rate until th e end of 2016 and then at a 1 per cent pace 
through the end of the forecast period.  Previously, we had ass umed the 
dollar would depreciate at a 2 percent pace starting in the sec ond half 
of 2017.  
o We now assume the dollar will inc rease 3 percent against all fl oating 
currencies for each 100 basis points of policy rate surprise, c onsistent with 
the experience of the past seve n years.  We had previously assu med a 
sensitivity of 2.5 percent for AF E currencies and about 2 perce nt for 
floating EME currencies. 
Oil Prices  
 Over the past few months, spot oi l prices have fluctuated withi n a range from 
about $40 to just over $50 per barre l; they currently stand at $47 per barrel, 
unchanged relative to the close  of the July Tealbook.  Futures prices are down 
about $1 per barrel since the cl ose of the July Tealbook, with the December 
2019 Brent futures prices cu rrently at $56 per barrel.     
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Real GDP growth is expected to pick up from a 1 percent pace in  the first half of 
the year to a 2½ percent pace in  the second half, reflecting a modest step-up in PDFP 
growth and a more sizable upswing in inventory investment.3 
                                                 
3 As displayed in the table “Fede ral Reserve System Nowcasts of 2016:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projecti ons generated by the near-term forecastin g approaches used within the System, at 
2.6 percent, is close to the staff’s judgmental projection of 2 .7 percent in the third quarter.

   Recent information on consumer spending has been slightly stronger, on 
balance, than we expected in our previous projection.4  Our forecast of real 
PCE growth of about 3 percent in the third quarter also reflects upbeat 
consumer sentiment, continued solid gains in employment and household 
income, and past increases in household wealth.5  
 In contrast, incoming data on resid ential construction have bee n weaker than 
we had previously forecast.  Singl e-family permits—which we thi nk are the 
best indicator of the underlying tr end in residential construct ion—had been 
moving essentially sideways sin ce late last year and then declined sharply in 
July.  As a result, we marked dow n our forecast for residential investment in 
the near term and now anticipat e declines in each of the second  through fourth 
quarters of this year.  
 We expect business fixed investment to remain relatively subdue d in the 
second half of 2016, although not as dismal as over the past se veral quarters.  
After declining in the first half  of the year, investment in eq uipment and 
intangibles (E&I) appears t o be on track to rise about 2 percent in the current 
quarter.  The collapse in inve stment in drilling and mining str uctures is 
expected to end next quarter, as the effects of earlier declines in crude oil 
prices dissipate.  For other type s of nonresidential structures, recent indicators 
suggest investment has picked up i n the current quarter, in con trast to the 
decline we had expected in the July Tealbook.   
 The staff’s flow-of-goods invent ory system points to no major i nventory 
imbalances outside the energy s ector.  Partly on that basis, we  expect 
investment in business inventories to step up in the second half of the year, especially as PDFP growth remains solid. 
 Net exports, after contributi ng a small positive amount to GDP growth in the 
first half of the year, are proje cted to subtract about ¼ perce ntage point from 
real GDP growth in the second half, as imports increase and exp orts continue 
                                                 
4 A first estimate of retail sales for August will be released o n Thursday, September 15, the day 
after Tealbook A closes. 
5 Another indicator of income growth is a Census Bureau report r eleased on September 13, 2016, 
showing that real median household income rose more than 5 perc ent in 2015, the first increase since 2007.  
In addition, the poverty rate declined 1.2 percentage points, to 13.5 percent.

  to be held down by a strong dolla r and weak foreign demand.  Relative to the 
July Tealbook, we now project a s omewhat smaller drag on GDP gr owth from 
net exports in the second half, a s import growth continues to b e surprisingly 
weak, while export growth in July was stronger than we had expe cted.  
 Manufacturing production increas ed substantially  in July, but a vailable 
physical product data and readi ngs on production worker hours f or August 
suggest that production likely de clined last month.  Taking a longer view, 
manufacturing output has been l ittle changed, on net, since the  end of 2014, as 
weak export demand and the spillove rs from the decline in oil a nd gas drilling 
have weighed on industrial activit y.  We expect factory output to continue on 
this flat trajecto ry over the second half of the year, consiste nt with recent 
mixed readings on new orders from the national and regional man ufacturing 
surveys.   
After this year, real GDP growth is projected to step up to 2½ percent in 2017, 
mostly reflecting increases i n the pace of both residential and  business investment as well 
as a waning drag from the do llar appreciation since mid-2014.  GDP growth eases to 
2 percent in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019 as monetary policy gradually normalizes and 
the stimulus from fiscal policy diminishes.  
 Our projection for real GDP growth in 2017 through 2019 is a to uch weaker 
than in the July Tealbook, reflect ing a slightly slower assumed  pace of 
potential output growth.  Other changes in key financial and fo reign 
background factors were essentia lly offsetting, as the path of longer-term 
interest rates is somewhat low er, while the path for the dollar  is a little higher. 
 If long-term rates fa il to rise as much as is assumed in the baseline, then real 
GDP growth may be stronger and the  unemployment rate lower than  the 
Tealbook forecast.  (For more on thi s possibility, see the alte rnative view box 
“A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum” and the accompanying scen ario in 
the Risks and Uncer tainty section.)   
 With GDP growth expected to outp ace our estimate of potential g rowth over 
the medium term, real GDP at the end of 2018 and 2019 is projec ted to be 
1½ percent above its potential, essentially the same as in the July Tealbook.

 Alternative View:  A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum  
A well- known theorem in international monetary economics is the impossible tri nity:  A 
country cannot simultaneously have ( 1) a fixed exchange rate, ( 2) free capital mobility , 
and ( 3) independent monetary policy.  Hélène Rey (2013) argued that the globalized  
financial system  has transformed the impossible tri nity into an “impossible binity ”:  
With or without a fixed exchange rate , a small open economy cannot control its 
monetary condition s as long as its capital account is open.1  In this discussion , I take 
Rey’s line of thought a step further and consider the possibility that, regardless of the 
exchange rate regime, no country with  free capital mobility, even a large one, can fully 
control its own monetary  and financial conditions in today’s globalized financial 
system.  As I will show, some evidence for this  theory  has already manifested itself as 
the “Greenspan conundrum ,” a phenomenon in which long -term interest rates failed to 
rise in response to the steep monetary policy tightening from 2004 to 2006.   
In principle, monetary policy independence and flexible exchange rates could afford  a 
central bank considerable influence over interest rates across the maturity spectrum 
even if result ing in substantial divergence in long -term interest rates relative to other 
economies.  For example, the Federal Reserve might communicate that it expected to 
tighten policy while other central banks  sent no such signal, which could cause long -
term U.S. interest rates to rise relative to those abroad.  Under the assumption of  
uncovered interest parity (UIP), investors would have no reason to pile into U.S. assets 
and thus “arbitrage away” this higher yield , because t he higher U.S. yield would be 
offset by an expected dollar depreciation that was large enough to equalize expected returns across assets.   
This UIP -based rationale for sizable cross -country long -term interest rate differentials 
seems belied both by the well-known failure of UIP and by historical experience, 
however.  In particular, during the 2004 –06 U.S. tightening  cycle, a large interest rate 
gap opened between the U.S. economy and other advanced economies, especially Japan , creating a large carry -trade opportunity .  If UIP held, the carry trade would be 
unprofitable on average because any gains from the interest rate differential would be  
offset by a depreciation of the dollar.  In reality, this prediction failed  and the U.S. dollar 
appreciat ion and large capital inflow s continued, driving down long -term  yields  and 
leading to the Greenspan conundrum.  
The Greenspan conundrum can be shown econometrically.  The figures on the next 
page  show the impulse response functions from a bivariate vector autoregression 
using the monthly federal funds rate and 10 -year Treasury bond rate over two periods, 
1962  to 1995 and 1996  to 2006.  The two figures  show the impulse responses of the

 10-year Treasury yield to a shock to the federal funds rate.  In the left-hand figure, one 
can easily see the statistically significant and persistent effect  of the policy rate on the 
long -term yield.  The right -hand figure, however, shows that the response of the long -
term yield during the later period was much lower and statistically not distinguishable 
from zero.  C ontrol of the long -term yield by the policy rate appears to have been lost.  
To the extent that monetary policy works by affecting the slope of the yield curve, the Greenspan conundrum does not necessarily mean that U.S. monetary policy is 
powerless.  However, to the extent that monetary policy also works by affecting the 
levels of various long -term borrowing rates, the conundrum suggests that the Federal 
Reserve might have lost a substantial part  of the control of its monetary  and financial 
condition s, at least through the federal funds rate.  In fact, between the second half of 
2004 and the first half of 2006, the federal funds rate was raised as much as 450 b asis 
points .  However, this steep increase in the short -term interest rate failed to prevent 
market participants from overinvest ing in long -term U.S. assets . 
In today’s globalized financial system , the short -term  interest rate  of a local financial 
market  cannot perfectly control the fu nding c onditions faced by investors because 
money can be raised in any funding currency provided that market risk appetite is 
strong enough.  A s the federal funds rate rises over the next few years, the longer- term 
Treasury rate may not rise as much as is predicted in the baseline.  Dollar appreciation due to capital inflow s may not be enough to offset the stimulus effect of the low long -
term rat es.  This scenario suggests the importance of more direct control of longer-
term interest rates—for example, via the large-s cale asset purchase (LSAP) program.  
In the event that the U.S. economy face s significant  upward pressure on inflation, the 
Federal Reserve c ould consider a “reverse LSAP ” policy .

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
Labor market conditions have con tinued to improve this year, al beit more slowly 
than in 2015.  Taken together, t he July and August employment r eports indicate that 
conditions improved a little mo re than expected in the July Tea lbook.   
 Total nonfarm payroll employment  is currently reported to have increased 
151,000 in August after having risen 275,000 in July.6  We anticipate that total 
payrolls will increase 175,000 per month, on average, over the remainder of 
this year, 10,000 faster th an in our July projection. 
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in August, 
unchanged since June and down onl y 0.1 percentage point since D ecember of 
last year.  The labor force part icipation rate was unchanged in  August and has 
increased about 0.2 percentage point since last December.  We e xpect the 
unemployment rate to remain a t 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and the 
participation rate to declin e 0.1 percentage point by the end o f the year, 
roughly in line with its downward trend.  These forecasts are q uite close to the 
July Tealbook projections. 
 We continue to estimate that lit tle slack remains in the labor market.  In the 
current quarter, our projection pu ts the unemployment rate 0.1 percentage 
point below our estimate of its na tural rate, wh ile the participation rate and the 
employment-to-population ratio are  close to their trends.  In a ddition, we view 
the share of employees working part time for economic reasons, which has been little changed since late last year, as slightly elevated and likely 
representing a small source  of labor underutilization. 
 Taken at face value, the labor m arket conditions index (LMCI) points to a 
small deterioration in labor mar ket conditions so far this year , whereas the 
staff’s assessment is that labor market conditions have been gr adually 
improving, though at a slower pace than last year. 
                                                 
6 As we noted a year ago, in each  year from 2009 to 2014, the in itially reported changes in 
nonfarm payrolls for August were subsequently revised up, with an average revision of about 75,000.  In 
contrast, the payroll gain in August 2015 was subsequently revi sed down 20,000.  Given this information, 
we have penciled in an upward revision of 30,000 to the August payroll gain, but this point estimate has a 
wide confidence interval.

 We have lowered the projected pa ths for growth in structural pr oductivity and in 
potential GDP in this forecast.   
 In response to continued downward surprises to productivity gro wth over the 
past several years, we have rev ised down our assumptions for st ructural 
productivity growth to 1 percen t this year, 1.1 percent next ye ar and the year 
after, and 1.2 percent in 2019; this path is between 0.1 and 0. 2 percentage 
point lower than in our p revious forecast.   
 We have also lowered our assumed path for potential GDP growth to 
1.5 percent this year and next, 1.6 percent in 2018, and 1.7 pe rcent in 2019.  
This path is about 0.1 percentage point per year lower than in the previous 
projection.   
The medium-term outlook for the  labor market is close to our Ju ly projection. 
 We expect average monthly total pa yroll gains to slow from arou nd 180,000 
for 2016 as a whole to about 145,000 in 2018 and 110,000 in 201 9.  We 
estimate that the pace of payroll employment growth consistent with 
unchanged labor utilization is between 85,000 and 115,000 per m onth.  (For a 
discussion of this calculation, see the box “The Neutral Pace o f Payroll 
Employment Gains.”) 
 We continue to estimate that conditions will tighten further in  the next couple 
of years.   
o By the end of 2019, the unemployment rate is projected to be 
4.2 percent—0.8 percentage point bel ow our estimate of its natu ral rate. 
o In addition, we project the labor force participation rate to e dge down a 
touch more slowly than its trend ove r the medium term, as susta ined job 
gains and rising wages continue to draw individuals into the la bor force 
while also slowing outflows.  As a result, the participation ra te is projected 
to be about 0.2 percentage point above our estimate of its tren d level at the 
end of 2019.

The Neutral  Pace of Payroll  Employment  Gains
A useful  benchmark  for evaluating  the  strength  of monthly  payroll  employment  gains  
(measured  in the  establishment  survey)  is its “neutral  pace ”—the number  of jobs  
needed  per month  to holdlabor  market  conditionsunchanged,withtheunemployment  
rate  remaining  at its current  level  and  the  labor  force  participation  rate  (LFPR)  declining  
at its trendrate.  The  key determinants  of this  neutral  pace  are the  trend  rate  of labor  
force  growth  and  the  difference  between  monthly  job gains  in the payroll  and  
householdsurveys.  This  discussion  explains  how  assumptions  about  these  two  factors  
influenceestimates  for the  neutral  pace  of payrolljob  gains.
Labor  force  growth  is determined  by population  growth  and  changes  in the LFPR.  The  
table  below  provides  estimates  of employment  gains  needed  to hold  the 
unemployment  rate  unchanged  at 4.9 percent  over  the next  year,assumingthat  the 
populationgrows1percent  annually  (about  the  same  as its recent  five-year  average  and  
in line  with  the  staff's  expectation  for  the  next  few years)  and  allowing  for different  
assumptions  about  the  annualchangeintheLFPR. 1 The  estimates  in the  first  row  
assume  that  employment  gains  in the payroll  and  household  surveys  are the same  on 
average  (an assumption  that  will be relaxed  later).  With  these  assumptions,  the 
monthlypace  needed  to hold  the unemployment  rate  unchangedrangesfrom125,000  
jobs  when  the  LFPR  is flat  to 45,000jobs  when  the  LFPR  falls  0.4percentage  point  
per year.
Employment  gains,  however,  sometimes  differ  substantially  between  the  two  surveys,  
resulting  in a different  pace  than  what  is shown  in the  first  row  of the table.  For 
example,  during  an expansion,  employment  gains  in the  establishment  survey  typically  
exceed  those  in the  household  survey. 2 The  pace  of job gains  needed  to hold  the

1 A 0.2 percentage  point  deviation  in population  growth  from  this  assumption  in either  direction  
would  add  or subtract  about  25,000  jobs  per month  .
2 As shown  in Abraham  and  others  (2013),  two  important  factors  contributing  to faster 
employmentgains  in the establishment  survey  than  in the  household  survey  during  an expansion  are 
an increase  in short-duration  jobs  (which  are more  likely  to be captured  in the  payroll  survey  than  in 
the household  survey)  and  a decrease  in off-the-books  jobs  (which  could  be captured  by the

 unemployment rate unchanged can be adjusted for the expected difference in monthly 
employment gains between the surveys by simply adding the difference to the 
estimates in the first row.  Assuming that employment gains in the establishment 
survey outpace employment gains in the household survey by 20,000 to 50,000 per 
month —a range consistent with the central tendency of the monthly difference 
between the two surveys since 2013 —estimates of the monthly pace, as shown in the 
second row, are therefore 20,000 to 50,000 higher than those shown in the first row.3  
Given this range, and with the LFPR declining at the staff’s estimate of its trend, the 
neutral pace of job gains needed to hold the unemployment rate unchanged while 
absorbing steady-state growth in the labor force is between 85,000 and 115,000.  
Despite the cyclical regularity of the difference in employment gains between the two 
surveys, the realized difference can vary significantly at times.  For example, as shown 
in the figure, over the past few years, the 3-month moving average of the difference in 
monthly employment gains between the two surveys has ranged from plus 450,000 to 
minus 350,000, and the 12-month moving average of the difference has ranged from 
plus 150,000 to minus 100,000.  As a result, the neutral pace of payroll job gains can also 
vary widely.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
 Core PCE prices rose 1.6 percent in the 12 months ending in Ju ly, and we 
continue to expect that 12-mont h changes in core prices will re main close to this pace 
through the end of the year.  The 12- month change in total PCE prices was 0.8 percent in 
July, and we expect it to rise to 1.3 percent by December as th e large declines in gasoline 
prices late last year drop out  of the 12-month comparison. 
 Data on core PCE prices through Jul y are in line with our expec tations that 
core inflation, on a quarterly basis, will slow from an average  annual rate of 
1.9 percent in the first half of  the year to a 1.3 percent pace  in the second 
half.7  This step-down reflects a d eceleration in prices in some vola tile 
categories that showed outsize d gains early in the year as well  as some 
residual seasonality.8   
 PCE energy prices declined in July but are expected to edge up, on balance, 
over the second half of the year, as crude oil prices are proje cted to rise.  
 Consumer food price inflation is expected to continue running b elow the pace 
of core inflation over the second half of the year:  PCE food prices declined in July, and food commodity prices ha ve moved down further as harv ests are 
turning out to be more bountiful  than previously forecast.   
 Core import prices are projected to increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent in 
the third quarter, an elevated pace  that reflects recent dollar  depreciation.  
With the dollar expected to apprec iate, we project these prices  will rise at a 
more moderate ¾ percent pace thro ugh the rest of the forecast p eriod.  
 Recent readings on longer-term inflation expectations have rema ined 
relatively stable on balance.  E xpected PCE inflation over the next 10 years 
from the Federal Reserve Bank of  Philadelphia’s Survey of Professional 
Forecasters remained at 2 percent.  The median inflation expect ation over the 
next 5 to 10 years from the Michi gan survey, at 2.5 percent in August, was 
                                                 
7 Data for the CPI in August will be released on Friday, September 16. 
8 For example, nonmarket services  prices, a category from which we take little signal for future 
price changes, climbed at a 4 pe rcent pace in the first half of  this year compared with a 3¼ percent increase 
in 2015.  In addition, some catego ries of goods showed large in creases earlier this year that we expect to be 
transitory, such as an outsized jump in jewelry prices.

  again at its historical low, while the 3-year-ahead measure of expectations in 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York’s Survey of Consumer Expec tations, 
at 2.7 percent in August, is close to the average over the firs t half of the year.  
The TIPS-based measure of 5-year-forward inflation compensation  is 
1.5 percent, up 0.1 percentage point s ince the time of the July  Tealbook.  
The outlook for inflation beyond t he near term is essentially u nrevised from the 
July Tealbook.  Core PCE price inflation is expected to move up  to 1.9 percent by 2019, 
primarily reflecting the waning r estraint from earlier declines  in energy and import prices 
along with a further tightening i n resource utilization.  With consumer food and energy 
prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices after this year, we expect total 
PCE price inflation to run close to the same pace as core infla tion over the next few years 
and to reach 1.9 percent in 2019.  
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our  core inflation projection has been 
revised up in 2016 largely because of readings in the first couple months of 
the year that were higher than w e expected.  Core inflation has  receded over 
the past few months, however, and the projections for 2017 and 2018 are little 
changed. 
The incoming data on hourly labor compensation have been mixed.   We expect 
compensation per hour to pick up a  little over the projection p eriod but anticipate that the 
employment cost index (ECI) will remain near its current pace o f increase.9   
 Compensation per hour in the busine ss sector is estimated to have declined at 
an annual rate of 1 percent in t he first quarter of the year, a  notable downward 
revision to the estimate we had a t the time of the July Tealboo k.  Data through 
July suggest that wage growth has since picked up, and we expec t the growth 
in compensation per hour to move up from an average pace of abo ut 
2½ percent over the past eight  quarters to 3¼ percent in 2019.   
 Over the 12 months ending in June, the ECI for private workers rose 
2.4 percent, a pace we expect to continue through the end of th e medium term.   
                                                 
9 Increases in the ECI tend to be much less pro-cyclical than th e increases in business-sector 
compensation per hour.

   Average hourly earnings of all em ployees increased less than we  expected in 
August.  Nonetheless, over the  12 months ending in August, this measure rose 
about 2½ percent; the 12-month change has been trending modestl y upward 
since holding roughly steady at around 2 percent from 2012 to l ate 2014.  
 An alternative measure of hourl y wage growth calculated by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, which i s more pro-cyclical than averag e hourly 
earnings, has moved up from ar ound 3 percent to 3½ percent over  the past 
year and a half.  However, the p ace of increases in this measur e remains 
below pre-recession levels.10 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 Our assumption regarding the natu ral rate of unemployment in th e longer run 
remains at 5.0 percent.  The growth rate of potential GDP in th e longer run 
has been revised down 0.2 percenta ge point since the July Tealb ook to 
1.7 percent.  
 The long-run value of the real fe deral funds rate has been revi sed down from 
1 percent to ¾ percent since th e July Tealbook, which is also r eflected in the 
long-run value of the 10-year Treasury rate.   
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by 2022. 
 With output running above its potent ial and inflation at the Co mmittee’s 
2 percent objective, the nominal  federal funds rate is about ¾ percentage point 
above its long-run value of 2¾ percent in 2020 and 2021, then m oves back 
toward its long-run value thereafter.   
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates f urther and 
rises at an annual rate of 1.4 percent and 1.3 percent in 2020 and 2021, 
                                                 
10 The Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker is calculated using micr odata from the Current 
Population Survey.  It is the 3-month moving average of the median 12-month change in the hourly wage 
for all individuals who are employed both in the current month and in the same month one year earlier 
(though not necessarily at all times between those two dates or  at the same employer).

  respectively.  The unemploymen t rate is 4.3 percent in 2020 and  rises 
gradually toward its assumed natu ral rate in subsequent years. 
 PCE price inflation moves up fro m 1.9 percent in 2019 to the Co mmittee’s 
long-run objective in 2020.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign real GDP growth slowed  from a 2½ percent pace i n the first quarter to 
less than 1 percent in the second—its slowest pace since the Global F inancial 
Crisis (GFC) .  GDP  contracted in both Mexico and Canada—countries that represent 
40 percent of our U.S. export- weighted foreign  aggregate —as the decline in U.S. 
manufacturing production hit economic activity in Mexico  and as wildfires disrupted oil 
production in Canada.  Excluding Mexico and Canada, foreign GDP growth declined 
only slightly, to 2¼ percent, from 2½ percent in the first quarter. 
We expect foreign growth to bounce back from its second-quarter pothole to 
2½ percent in the second half of this year.  Oil production recently rebounded in Canada, and we expect the projected pickup in U.S. manufacturing to support Mexican activity.  Moreover, global financial conditions have improved since the July Tealbook, in part 
reflecting early indications that the near -term effects on the United Kingdom and euro 
area of the British vote for EU exit, or Brexit , are smaller than feared .  However, after 
this rebound in the second half , we se e little further strengthening , with growth abroad 
edging up t o a pace of only 2¾ percent , well below its pre -GFC  trend .  Relative to the 
July Tealbook, our projection is up a touch in the advanced foreign economies ( AFEs ) 
and down slightly in the emerging  market economies ( EMEs ).  
Aggregate AFE  inflation has remained near  an annual pace of  1¼ percent in 
recent months, while  measures of inflation expectations across the AFEs continue to run 
at persistently  low levels .  Moreover, although we lowered our estimates of potential 
output growth since the G FC, we still have output gaps closing only slowly in the AFEs, 
especially in the euro area.   Accordingly,  we expect AFE inflation to edge up to just 
above 1½ percent over the forecast pe riod.  With inflation low and growth tepid, 
monetary policy in the AFEs will remain highly accommodative for the duration of the 
forecast period. 
Expectations that interest rates will be “low for long” in the advanced economies  
are already generating financial market responses  that could have implications for the 
outlook—notably, there has been greater investor interest in EMEs, where equity prices 
are generally up, and sovereign and corporate bond spreads are nearing post- GFC  lows .  
Given already high corporate leverage and  slowing trend GDP growth, we do not expect 
the favorable financial market developments in EMEs to substantially boost growth in

 these economies.  In our baseline, U.S. monetary policy normalization leads to some, 
albeit muted , reversal of buoyant EME financial conditions.  However , we are still 
cognizant of the downside risk that U.S. monetary policy tightening could prove 
destabilizing for EMEs , weighing on global growth and leading to a more sizable and 
sustain ed appreciation of the dollar than we are assuming in our baseline projection; we 
explore this risk  in the “Stronger Dollar” scenario  in the Risks and Uncertainty section.   
Some other (now familiar ) downside risks to the global economy have not gone 
away.  Notably, although we continue to project a relatively orderly transition to slower growth in China, the risk of a financial crisis and severe slowdown remains significant.  
In addition, some longer- term risks associated with Brexit als o remain, in particular the 
risk that other EU countries follow the precedent set by Brexit and, in doing so , prompt a 
breakup of the euro area.  There are also s ome upside risks to our foreign growth outlook:  
Highly accommodative monetary policies, diminishing fiscal pressure, and ongoing 
balance sheet repair could spur faster growth in AFEs, while Latin American countries 
could shake off their malaise faster than we currently envision and EMEs more generally 
could benefit from easier financial conditions.  The implications of this upside are 
explored in the “ Faster Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar” scenario i n the Risks and 
Uncertainty section.    
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Canada.  Seco nd-quarter GDP growth was negative 1.6 percent, ¾ percentage 
point lower than estimated in the July Tealbook, and down from 2.5 percent in 
the first quarter.  The second- quarter surprise was  largely due to a greater -
than-anticipated effect  on the energy sector from the May wildfires .  
Accordingly, we now expect third-quarter growth to rebound to  3½ percent, as 
oil production had already started to recover in June.  However, other recent 
indicators—such as the manufacturing PMI , which is only modestly 
expansionary, and the unemployment rate, which remains at 7 percent —
suggest that the underlying pace of growth is moderate.  We thus project that GDP growth will step down to 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter and remain at 
that pace through 2017 before edging down further to a near -potential pace of 
1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period.  The expansion should be supported by ongoing accommodative monetary and fiscal policies and a

 weak Canadian dollar.  In this context, we continue to expect the B ank of 
Canada to begin removing monetary accommodation in late 2017. 
• United Kingdom.  Real GDP expanded 2.4 percent in the second quarter, up 
from 1.8 percent in the previous quarter.  Recent  indicators—such as retail 
sales in July as well as confidence and PMIs through August—suggest that the 
U.K. economy showed more resilience than had been anticipated just 
following the Brexit referendum.  Financial conditions have also been better 
than expected  and were likely supported by a stimulus packag e announced by 
the Bank of England ( BOE ) in early August.  Accordingly, we marked up the 
outlook for growth almost ½  percentage point through mid-2017 relative to 
the July Tealbook.  Even so, the surge in political and economic uncertainty due to the Brexit vote should still exert considerable drag on business 
investment and consumer spending.  We  thus project that GDP growth will 
step down to a 1¼ percent pace in the second half of this year before ris ing 
back to 1¾ percent by 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policy 
and a reduction in uncertainty as more details are known about the Brexit  process .   
Inflation should rise from 0.8 percent in the second quarter to almost 
2½ percent by year -end, reflecting the effects of the depreciation of the pound 
in the aftermath of the Brexit vote .  As these effects wane, inflation should 
edge down to 2 percent by 2018.  In line with this  assessment , the BOE will 
look through this  surge in inflation, as it has stated.   Indeed, the BOE 
announced a large stimulus package in August:  a 25 basis point reduction in 
the policy rate to 0.25 pe rcent;  a £60 billion expansion of the asset purchase 
scheme for U .K. government bonds, which will increase the stock of BOE 
holdings from £375 billion  to £435 billion ; purchases of up to £10 billion of 
U.K. corporate bonds; and a new Term Funding Scheme that provides long-
term funding for banks at interest rates close to the policy rate.  T he BOE also 
hinted its readiness to cut its policy rate further by the end of this  year.  
However , given the improved growth outlook, we assume that the policy rate 
will remain unchanged through the forecast period. 
• Euro Area.  Real GDP growth slowed from 2.1 percent in the first quarter 
to 1.2 percent in the second quarter, in line with our July Tealbook forecast.  
The slowdown reflected payback from temporary boosts to growth in the first

 quarter , including unusually warm weather that had lifted construction.  
Indicators for the current quarter  have been mixed.  On the negative side, 
consumer and business confidence have fallen noticeably , and industrial 
production has been weak.  On the positive side, PMI s and retail sales  have 
been more resilient.  Overall, the data suggest Brexit -related uncertainty is 
weighing on economic activity  but by slightly less than we anticipated .  In 
addition, financial market  conditions have improved more quickly than 
anticipated .  Therefore, we revised up our growth estimates for the second half 
of 2016 a touch , to 1¼ percent.  We  still expect unresolved weaknesses in the 
banking sector and rising anti- EU sentiment to trigger further bouts of 
uncertainty and volatility, which will weigh on the recovery.  Thus, in spite of 
lower  financial stress, the forecast  beyond the current year is little changed:  
We expect GDP growth to increase to 1¾ percent in 2017, supported by 
accommodative monetary policy and slightly expansionary fiscal policy , and 
to settle at about that pace over the rest of the forecast period .  Given t he very 
subdued inflation outlook, we now believe that the European Central Bank 
(ECB ) will continue to purchase assets through the end of 2017.  However, 
because financial stress related to Brexit has moderated , we no longer expect 
the ECB  to cut its deposit rate  further.  
• Japan.  Second -quarter growth was 0.7 percent, in line with the July Tealbook 
estimate  and down from 2.1 percent in the previous quarter.  The slowdown 
partly reflected the disruptions caused by the earthquake in April, and we project that  GDP growth will pick up to  1 percent  in the third quarter.  
However, with the manufacturing PMI remaining slightly contractionary, we continue to expect growth to slow to ¾ percent in the fourth quarter and 
remain near that pace over the next couple of years.     
At its July meeting , the Bank of Japan ( BOJ) disappointed markets by easing 
its policy stance  only modestly .  The BOJ’s September policy meeting will 
coincide with  the release of a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness 
of its policies.  With inflation  running close to zero—partly owing to recent 
yen appreciation—we assume that the BOJ will moderately  increase asset 
purchases , but we do not expect any major changes in the BOJ’s monetary 
policy strategy.  Even so, we continue to see inflation rising to only 1 percent 
by late 2018.

 EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
• Mexico.   Real GDP contracted 0.7 percent in the second quarter following an 
expansion of 2 percent  in the first.  U.S. manufacturing production, which 
shrank 1 percent in the second quarter, weighed on Mexican exports.  
Furthermore, p rivate consumption declined , and fiscal consolida tion efforts 
pushed down public- sector  investment.  We see growth returning  to about 
2¼ percent  in the second half of this year, supported by improving U.S. 
manufacturing production and reboundi ng household demand.  Consistent 
with this view, manufacturing PMIs rose in August and labor market conditions continued to improve amid robust credit growth.  Although our forecast  for the second half of the year is down only a touch from the July 
Tealbook, the continued disappointing pace of growth, together with greater expected fiscal consolidation through 2018 and downward revisions to U.S. 
manufacturing production, has  made us more pessimistic about Mexico’s 
medium-term outlook.  We now see growth rising only slightly over the 
forecast period, reaching 2¾ percent by 2019, supported by some improvement in external demand over the next two years, and, later in the period, by diminishing fiscal drag.  
• Brazil.   Brazil’s recession deepened in the second quarter, with economic 
activity contracting 2.2  percent (somewhat less than we had expected) after a 
1.7 percent contraction in the first quarter.  Private consumption continued to decline, and net exports fell .  But after 10  consecutive quarters of contraction, 
fixed investment finally grew, supported by improving business and consumer confidence.  We expect investment to strengthen further, in part because the conclusion of impeachment proceedings against President Dilma Rousseff , 
which confirmed  her removal from office,  has reduced political uncertainty.  
Still,  consumption will likely  remain weak  amid rising unemployment and 
tight credit conditions.  Fiscal consolidation is also expected to restrain growth, give n that the government recently succeeded in pushing a bill 
through its Congress that limits spending growth at the state level to the rate of inflation for the next two years.  All told, we see the economy climbing out of recession by the fourth quarter, w ith growth increasing to a modest 
2¼ percent pace by the end of 2019.

 Inflation, although quite elevated at nearly 9 percent on a 12-month basis, fell 
substantially in recent quarters and is expected to reach 5½ percent by the end of next year.  W e expect that the central bank of Brazil will start easing policy 
next year.   
• China.  After rising to 7.1 percent in the second quarter, real GDP growth is 
expected to slow to 6½ percent in the second half of the year.  This forecast is 
a touch weaker than in the July Tealbook, as slowing investment growth 
suggests that the effects of earlier monetary and fiscal stimulus are taper ing 
off a bit more quickly than we had expected .  Recent data also  show a 
significant adjustment under way in heavy industry , likely reflecting the 
authorities’ efforts to reduce excess capacity in some sectors of the economy .  
Exports, however, have grown briskly in recent months after slumping earlier 
in the year , suggesting that the  depreciation of the renminbi against the 
currencies  of China’s trading partners over the past several months may be 
having some effect .  (As explained in the Domestic Economic Developments 
and Outlook section, in light of continued downward pressure on the 
renminbi, our forecast now calls for more depreciation of the Chinese currency .)  All told , we expect the Chinese economy to grow 6.7 percent in 
2016, within the authorities’ target range of 6½ to 7 percent.  Thereafter, we 
continue to see growth slowing to  5¾ percent by 2019. 
Falling food prices pushed down inflation to an estimated 1½ percent in the third quarter from  2¼ percent in the second .  We expect inflation to rebound 
as food prices normalize before it settles at around 2½ percent by early next year.  
• Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that real GDP growth picked up to 
3¾ percent  in the second quarter , a bit higher than estimated in the July 
Tealbook and up from 2½ percent in the first quarter.  The step -up was mainly 
driven by a sharp rebound in Hong Kong , led by a resurgence in trade with 
China and other emerging Asian countries, following Hong Kong’s surpris ing 
output contraction in the first quarter.  For the region as a whole, exports, export orders, and PMIs—although significant ly improve d relative to  last 
year—suggest  that growth will edge down to 3½ percent in the current 
quarter .  We expect growth to move up a bit further to 3¾ percent in 2017, 
supported by accommodative policies and strengthening exports.

Financial Developments 
Markets were relatively calm fo r much of the intermeeting perio d, and asset 
prices moved within a fairly n arrow range, although volatility increased somewhat in the 
last few days of the period as ma rket participants focused on c entral bank 
communications in the United States and abroad.  Market expecta tions for a policy rate 
increase by the end of this year ros e a bit since the July FOMC  meeting, primarily 
reflecting Federal Reserve co mmunications that were viewed, on balance, as somewhat 
less accommodative than expected.   Nominal Treasury yields acro ss the curve edged up.  
Concerns over the impending comp liance deadline for money marke t fund (MMF) 
reform continued to drive additi onal net outflows from prime MM Fs and put upward 
pressure on some term money market rates. 
 Based on a straight read of mark et quotes, the probability of a n increase in the 
target range of the federal f unds rate by the end of the year rose to 52 percent, 
from 43 percent just prior to the July FOMC meeting.  The proba bility of an 
increase at the September m eeting declined to 14 percent.  
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities incre ased, on net, 
7, 13, and 17 basis points, respectively.  
 The broad dollar index decline d about ½ percent on balance.  Lo ng-term 
sovereign yields rose about 25 basis points in Japan and 10 bas is points in 
other AFEs. 
 Assets under management for prime MMFs dropped $205 billion mor e over 
the intermeeting period, while thos e for government MMFs increa sed 
$211 billion.  Most of t he declines in assets at prime funds ha ve occurred at 
prime institutional funds, and such funds have also reduced wei ghted-average 
maturities to historically low levels.  Interest rate spreads o ver OIS rates rose 
further for LIBOR, CDs, and fin ancial CP at three-month horizons.  
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained generally 
accommodative, though outstanding C&I loans and CP both decline d 
somewhat in August.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Domestic Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, Fed eral Reserve communications pu shed market 
expectations for a r ate increase this y ear a bit higher on net.   However, domestic 
economic data releases appeared t o be a little softer, on balan ce, than investors had 
expected.  Whereas the data relea sed early in the intermeeting period were seen as mixed, 
data released toward the end of t he period, particularly the Au gust employment report 
and the August ISM surveys, were below expectations.  Based on a straight read of 
federal funds futures, the probabi lity of an increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate occurring at the September meeting was volatile but ended the period slightly 
lower at 14 percent, while the p robability of an increase by th e end of the year rose to 
52 percent.  In the medium term, t he federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of 
market quotes edged up on net.  The implied federal funds rates  at the end of 2017 and 
2018 increased 6 and 7 basis points, respectively.  
Consistent with market-based es timates, respondents to the Desk ’s September 
surveys of primary dealers and mar ket participants assigned a p robability of about 
15 percent to a rate hike at the September meeting.  The median  respondent in each 
survey continues to expect only one hike in 2016, with responde nts generally expecting 
the rate hike to occur at the December meeting.  The most likel y path of the target federal 
funds rate in 2017 and 2018 was relatively little changed for the median respondent. 
Nominal Treasury yields increas ed, on net, since the July FOMC meeting, with 
yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year Tre asury securities 7, 13, and 17  basis points higher,

  the lower end of its historical r ange.  Measures of liquidity c onditions in the Treasury 
market were stable over the intermeeting period. 
The S&P 500 stock price index declined 1.9 percent, on net, sin ce the July FOMC 
meeting.  Stock prices of sectors that benefit from lower inter est rates, such as REITs and 
utilities, underperformed the broader market, while those of se ctors that benefit from 
higher interest rates, such as banks, outperformed the broader market.  Realized and 
implied volatilities i n various asset markets were relatively l ow during most of the 
intermeeting period, with the VIX remaining near the lower end of its historical range, 
but increased somewhat in the l ast few days of the period as ma rket participants digested 
global central bank communications. 
Spreads on yields of nonfinancial corporate bonds over those on  comparable-
maturity Treasury securities dec lined somewhat to levels fairly  close to their historical 
norms.  Mutual funds that invest in investment-grade corporate bonds experienced 
notable inflows in recent weeks. 
Foreign Developments 
Low volatility also prevailed in i nternational financial market s, and global risk 
assets broadly appreciated ami d improving risk sentiment, altho ugh late in the period 
volatility increased somewhat .  Equity prices in the AFEs and E MEs generally rose.  In 
the EMEs, capital inflows continued, and sovereign and corporate spreads narrowed 
further.  Consistent with this “risk on” tone in foreign market s, the staff’s broad dollar 
index declined about ½ percent, on net, since the July FOMC meeting.  European 
financial markets remained resil ient after the Brexit vote, as downside economic and 
financial risks did not materia lize.  European bank equity pric es increased 7 percent, on 
balance, and more than retraced t heir initial declines followin g the European bank stress-
test results but still remained down 25 percent this year.   
Investor reaction to news from th e ECB and Bank of Japan (BOJ) contributed to 
the pickup in volatility at th e end of the period.  The ECB lef t rates unchanged at its 
September meeting as expected bu t disappointed some investors b y not announcing an 
extension of its asset purchase program.  Global yields moved h igher and the euro 
strengthened after the meeti ng, with German 10-year yields movi ng back into positive 
territory.

  At its July meeting, the BOJ announ ced easing measures that lef t investors 
underwhelmed, causing the yen to appreciate and bond yields to jump.  The BOJ left its 
deposit rate unchanged and chose only to expand its purchases of exchange-traded stock 
funds.  The BOJ also established a  facility to lend Japanese so vereign bonds for use as 
collateral at the BOJ’s swap -related dollar funding operations to counter potential dollar 
funding pressures in Japan and address possible stigma concerns.  In subsequent days, the BOJ’s asset purchases were also more concentrated than had been  expected on the short 
end of the maturity spectrum, prom pting a further increase in longer-term yields.  Over 
the period, long-term Japanese  yields were up about 25 basis po ints, while the yen 
appreciated about 2½ percent against the dollar.   
In contrast, at its early Augus t meeting, the Bank of England a nnounced a rate cut 
of 25 basis points to 0.25 percent , a resumption of its asset p urchase program, and a new 
bank funding program.  Long-term yields and the pound fell imme diately following the 
announcement but retraced on the back of positive economic data  later in the period. 
Short-Term Funding Markets and Federal Reserve Operations 
MMF reform, intended to make th e MMF industry more resilient, continued to 
affect several short-term funding markets in advance of the October 14, 2016, compliance 
deadline for a number of substantive reforms.2  While total assets under the management 
of MMFs changed little over the intermeeting period, investors continued to shift from 
prime funds to government funds.3  As a result, MMF holdings of CP and CDs continued 
to decline.  Indeed, net fractions of about one-fourth and two-fifths of the September SCOOS respondents reported a dec rease in the use of CDs and CP, respectively, pointing 
to MMF reform as a somewhat important factor driving the decline.
4  Most of them also 
expected higher rate s on CDs, CP, and repo collateralized by no n-Treasury or agency 
securities during the remainder  of the year, resulting from MMF  reform.  In addition, in 
anticipation of more la rge outflows before the compliance date,  prime institutional funds 
further reduced their weighted-average maturities to a historic ally low level of 12 days, 
relative to an average of about  40 days over the past few years .     
                                                 
2 The reform imposes floating NAVs  (net asset values) for instit utional prime funds and municipal 
funds and permits liquidity fees a nd redemption gates for all n ongovernment funds. 
3 The drop in assets under management for prime MMFs was steep, with $205 billion this 
intermeeting period, compared with the decline of $120 billion over the previous intermeeting period.  
4 The respondents indicated that funding for CDs increased from corporations, foreign banking 
organizations, and other lenders.

  Reflecting MMFs’ reduced appet ite for term lending, spreads ove r OIS of longer-
term money market rates—including LIBOR, CDs, and financial CP at three-month 
horizons—were higher during t he intermeeting period.5  Short-term municipal rates and 
tax-exempt money funds’ net yields  also increased sharply, prim arily because of outflows 
from these funds.  These increases  in spreads, particularly tho se resulting from a rise in 
LIBOR, which serves as a refer ence rate for trillions of dollars in adjustable-rate loans, 
will likely increase the financing costs for some nonfinancial firms (for more details, see 
the box “Floating-Rate Debt of N onfinancial Corporations”).6   
MMF reform also has affected the  banking sector.  Higher CD rates and LIBOR 
may not only increase funding costs for some banks, but also boost revenues from 
floating-rate loans (for additional information, see the box “S ome Effects of Money 
Market Reform on U.S. Banks”).  Foreign banks faced increased dollar funding costs 
associated with the new rules, a s MMFs reduced their holdings of unsecured debt issued 
by foreign banks.  Japanese banks exp erienced the largest decre ases in unsecured debt, 
close to $30 billion—or 20 percen t of their unsecured debt—over  the past three months.  
Foreign banks’ three-month CD spreads over OIS and the three-mo nth dollar–yen FX 
swap basis rose modestly, although the one-month dollar–yen FX swap basis rose more 
steeply. 
Reflecting the increased flows  into government money funds, ave rage daily 
ON RRP usage by such money funds in creased modestly compared with the previous 
intermeeting period.  Daily take-up of ON RRPs by government money funds was more 
volatile this intermeeting peri od, as these funds reportedly pu t cash inflows into the 
ON RRP initially before shifting some of this new cash back into market instruments.  
Overall, ON RRP take-up increased slightly, averaging just unde r $80 billion, excluding 
month-ends.7  
MMF reform, however, has yet to m aterially affect overnight rat es.  The 
overnight triparty repo rate for Treasury collateral stayed abo ve the Federal Reserve’s 
ON RRP offering rate of 25 basis points over the intermeeting p eriod.  The effective 
                                                 
5 Nonfinancial CP spreads remained low. 
6 The median respondent in the Sep tember Desk surveys predicted the three-month LIBOR–OIS 
spread to be 40 basis points after the October 14 deadline, abo ut the same as that implied by market quotes. 
7 The Desk reinvested $19 billion of maturing Treasury securitie s, purchased $50 billion of 
15- and 30-year MBS under the reinvestment program, and did not  roll any expected MBS settlements over 
the intermeeting period.

Floating -Rate Debt of Nonfinancial Corporations  
The increase in  the three- month London interbank offered rate ( LIBOR ) since mid -
June  has raised concerns about a potential increase in borrowing costs for 
nonfinancial corporations.  The t able below  shows these  corporations have roughly 
$2 trillion of outstanding debt  with rates linked to LIBOR , about one- fourth of these 
firms’ $7.5 trillion in total debt outstanding .  We consider how the prevalence of 
interest rate floors, infrequent resetting of rate s, and the hedging behavior of firms 
limits the increase in interest costs for nonfinancial borrowers  as a result of  an 
upward shift  in LIBOR .  We conclude by providing an estimate of the increase in 
interest costs under  different LIBOR scenarios.1  
Although  the vast majority of outstanding corporate bonds have fixed interest rates, 
we estimate that  75 percent of corporate loans  have  floating rates that  typically 
reference three-month LIBOR.2  Of corporate loans benchmarked to LIBOR, about 
two -thirds ( $1.4 trillion) are term loans .  Almost all term loans  have  LIBOR floors, 
which stipulate the minimum level for the reference rate and thus eliminate 
variability in interest payments when the reference rate is below the floor.3  The 
median interest rate floor for term loans is  currently  1 percent , while LIBOR is 
currently about  85 basis points .  Additionally, the floating rate that determines a 
loan’s interest rate is  customarily reset quarterly .  Both  factors are likely to soften  the 
reaction of interest expense to changes in LIBOR .  
The remaining one- third of floatin g-rate loans  are revolving lines of credit. Borrowers 
incur interest costs only when they draw on the credit facility.4  Although  lines of  
1 This analysis draws on regulatory loan -level data  in the Y -14 for a large subset (about 
80 percent of the universe) of floating -rate corporate loan s.  The breakdown of interest rate floor 
and rate reset timing characteristic s from this sample of loans is extrapolated to the universe of 
nonfinancial corporate loans in the Z1 Fina ncial Accounts.  See “Some Effects of Money Market 
Reform on U .S. Banks” for a discussion of how these loans a ffect bank profitability. 
2 For more details on the effect of increases in interest rates on corporate bonds, see Richard 
Ogden, Francisco Palomin o, Nitish Sinha, and Youngsuk Yook (2016), “Corporate Bond Issuers ’ 
Swap Exposure to Rising Interest Rates,” FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, May 26),  https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-
notes/2016/corporate -bond -issuers- swap -exposure- to-rising -interest -rates- 20160526.html . 
3 Recall that the interest rate on floating -rate loans includes both LIBOR and a constant spread; 
the floor described here applies only to the LIBOR component.  
4 In aggregate, nonfinancial corporate borrowers have only used $564 billion of $2 trillion 
committed as revolving lines of credit.

 credit do not typically have interest rate floors , they do  typically reset the level of 
their reference rate quarterly , similar to term loans .  This factor tend s to weaken  the 
reaction of interest expense to changes in LIBOR.  
 
The f igure below shows estimates of the additional interest expense from loans for 
nonfinancial borrowers  given different increases in LIBOR, taking into account the 
effect of interest rate floors .  We consider four scenarios , including the current 
20 basis point increase since mid -June ( Scenario 1 in the f igure)  as well as three larger 
increases in three-mon th LIBOR, up to 80 basis points (Scenario 4).  Th is exercise 
assumes that the increase in LIBOR persists for one year and that loan reference rates reset instantaneously.  As such, this estimate provides an upper bound of 
additional interest expense for nonfinancial borrowers.   
 We estimate the increase of LIBOR in Scenario 1 (+20 basis points)  causes 62 percent 
of outstanding loans  to adjust to the prevailing value of three-month LIBOR.
5  
Further, almost all loans will adjust their LIBOR component to the prevailing rate if  
LIBOR was to move above 100 basis point s (Scenario 2).  Nonetheless, the additional 
interest expense of even an 80 basis point increase in LIBOR  relative to its value in 
mid-June (Scenario 4) would  equal about $12 billion, which is less than 1 percent of 
earnings  of nonfinancial corporations  (shown by the black line) .  Quarterly resetting 
of interest rates further damp s these estimates of the interest expense.   
 Finally, t hese calculations do not take into account some firms ’ use of derivatives to 
hedge interest rate risk , which could further limit the effect of higher interest rates 
on their net interest expenses.
6  However, in  recent years corporations do not 
appear to be actively engaged in interest rate hedging .  In fiscal year 2015, we 
estimate only around 15 percent of nonfinancial corporations  were actively hedging 
interest rate risk.7  
 
 
                                                 
5 This percentage is the combined total for both categories of loans discussed in the table :  
revolving lines of credit and term loans.  
6 The increase in net interest expense may also be offset by returns from investments the 
company has made in short -term instruments, which we have not taken into account.  
7 This estimate is based on a textual analysis of 10 -K filings to the SEC by nonfinancial 
corporations with outstanding bank  debt.

 Some Effects of Money Market Reform on U.S. Banks 
This discussion examines three ways in which U.S. banks might be affected by money market 
fund (MMF) reform:  the ability to raise funds through negotiable certificates of deposit 
(CDs); the reallocation of funds by investors from money funds into bank deposits; and 
upward repricing of bank loans, given increases in short-term rates, such as LIBOR (London 
interbank offered rate).      
As the money fund industry’s demand for very short -term investments has increased and its 
demand for longer-term private securities has decreased, 60- and 90-day CD yields have risen 
relative to OIS (overnight index swap) rates, suggesting that some banks are paying more to 
obtain funding at those terms.  Even with the higher yields , outflows of large time deposits 
have occurred in July and August, largely at U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks 
(figure 1).  These branches and agencies, which depend on large time deposits for about 
30 percent of their funding, have responded since June by raising funds through borrowed 
money, such as fed funds and repo.  In contrast to the experience of foreign banks, large time 
deposits have been mostly stable at domestic banks, which raise about 7 percent of their 
funds through such deposits.  However, data on the eight LISCC (Large Institution 
Supervision Coordinating Committee ) banks show a noticeable decline since mid-August in 
outstanding negotiable CDs —that is, wholesale CDs held by institutional investors such as 
MMFs and that account for about 1 percent of LISCC bank s’ liabilities.  Nevertheless, the 
LISCC banks have not significantly altered the maturity composition of their negotiable CDs, 
as the weighted-average maturity of these CDs has fluctuated in a range from 100 to 120 days 
in recent months (even as the weighted-average maturity of prime MMF holdings has 
decreased substantially).     
U.S. banks appear to be receiving stepped-up inflows of other types of deposits.  Figure 1 
shows that banks received a net inflow of about $115 billion in core deposits in August, the 
highest monthly increase at banks in the past five years.  Some of these inflows may be 
reallocations of investments away from prime funds , although to date, government funds 
appear to have been the main recipients of such outflows .  Figure 2 shows that the eight 
LISCC banks have received steady net inflows from nonfinancial businesses in particular, 
 
    Note:  Core deposits comprise all deposits except large 
time deposits.

 while deposits from “nonsupervised financial entities”— including mutual funds —have been 
roughly flat in the past two months.  Overall, the deposit inflows have been relatively small 
compared with the decline of several hundred billion dollars in assets under management at 
prime money funds over the past year.  In addition, whether these deposits will stay in the 
banking system is unclear.  Investors will likely take some time to reach a new equilibrium 
allocation of their liquid assets.   
Some bank loan rates may reprice higher in response to the 20 basis point increase in the 
three-month LIBOR since June, as many loan rates are set as spreads over LIBOR.  The table 
below shows that LIBOR is used as a reference rate for about 60 percent of large banks’ 
business loans, which we focus on because they tend to reset more frequently than 
household loans .  Rising loan rates could buoy bank profitability given sticky deposit pricing 
but would also represent a tightening of financial conditions for borrowers.  The extent to 
which bank loan rates move up depends on the specific reference rate, the duration of the 
rise in rates, how frequently the loan rates reprice, and the extent to which interest rate 
floors are binding.  Such calculations and the potential effect on nonfinancial corporations 
are explored further in th e Financial Developments box “Floating Rate Debt of Nonfinancial 
Corporations. ”         
In summary, as the cost of term funding via CDs has increased, declines in CD funding in the 
U.S. banking system to date have been largely confined to branches and agencies of foreign 
banks.  Domestic banks have received stepped-up inflows of other deposits.  Many banks are 
positioned to benefit from increased revenue from existing loans on their balance sheets 
should the recent rise in LIBOR persist.  Looking forward, further reallocation of investments 
out of prime funds is expected to occur as additional fund conversions are pending.  Whether 
such outflows will continue to have relatively small effects on U.S. banks will depend on the 
magnitude and the timing of those withdrawals and also on the extent to which investors 
decide to abruptly pull out of prime money funds instead of more smoothly reallocating their 
investments over time or even staying put.1

1 The median primary dealer survey respondent expects the three-month LIBOR-OIS spread to be 
45 basis points, near its current level, in the week prior to October 14, 2016, suggesting that funding 
pressures associated with prime money fund outflows may not worsen significantly prior to the 
compliance date. Market quotes suggest that the spread will also remain at a similar level after 
October 14.

FINANCING CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESSES , MUNICIPALITIES ,  
AND HOUSEHOLDS  
Business and Municipal Finance  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained generally accommodative.  
While aggregate C&I loan balanc es and CP outstanding at nonfina ncial firms both 
declined somewhat, gross issu ance of corporate bonds was quite brisk in August, bucking 
the seasonal trend of slow issuan ce in the summer months.  Corp orations issued equity 
through seasoned offerings at a somewhat faster pace than that observed over the past 
few years.  In contrast, equit y issuance through initial public  offerings remained subdued, 
and share repurchase volumes slowed. 
The credit quality of nonfinanci al corporations, which had dete riorated a bit over 
the past few quarters, showed s igns of stabilization in the cur rent intermeeting period.  
The volume of corporate bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of  downgrades in August.  
Further, both the six-month t railing bond default rate and the KMV expected year-ahead 
default measure edged down, although they remained elevated com pared with their 
ranges in recent years.  Projec tions by Wall Street analysts fo r year-ahead earnings for 
S&P 500 companies, which had been lowered significantly early in the year, were little 
changed over the in termeeting period. 
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets re mained 
accommodative.  CMBS issuance picked up in August, likely refle cting the narrowing of 
CMBS spreads—albeit to still wide r-than-typical levels—over the past few months.  
Growth in CRE loans at banks continued to be strong. 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also remained accom modative.  
Gross issuance of municipal bonds in July and August was strong, and credit quality 
remained stable.  On net, yiel ds on general obligation bonds edged down, while those on 
comparable-maturity Treasury s ecurities moved up, leaving their  ratios a touch lower on 
net.  On August 1, Puerto Rico missed a small amount of debt pa yments, though prices of 
Puerto Rico’s benchmark genera l obligation bonds were roughly unchanged over the 
intermeeting period.

  Household Finance 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage and consumer c redit markets 
were broadly unchanged over the intermeeting period and remaine d accommodative on 
balance.  The interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages mov ed higher, in line with 
comparable-maturity Treasury yiel ds, but remained at a low leve l of about 3.4 percent.  
Refinancing activity in August wa s the highest in three years, reflecting low mortgage 
rates during June and July.  Inter est rates on consumer loans, such as variable-rate credit 
cards and new auto loans, were al so little changed.  Consumer l oan balances stood 
6.5 percent higher in July than a  year earlier.  Auto and stude nt loan originations 
remained solid, though the rate of  growth of student loans tren ded down further.  Credit 
card balances continued to expand at a robust pace. 
Household delinquency rates were generally little changed acros s loan categories.  
Mortgage delinquency rates con tinued to decline, reflecting in part the relatively tight 
mortgage underwriting conditions for less creditworthy borrower s over the past several 
years, continued solid house pric e gains, and improved economic fundamentals.  Credit 
card delinquency rates remained near historically low levels, w hile student loan 
delinquency rates were little cha nged at elevated  levels.  Auto loan delinquency rates, 
however, continued to edge up, par tly as a result of the broad availability of auto loans to 
subprime borrowers.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as broa dly in line with the average o ver the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  We ha ve maintained our assumption  that the risks to our 
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, importantly because both monetary and fiscal 
policy appear to be better positio ned to offset large positive shocks than substantial 
adverse ones.  Foreign developments and prospects also pose som e downside risk to the 
U.S. economy.  Although near-term concerns associated with Brex it have diminished, 
downside risks to the global economy remain.  Notably, the tran sition to slower growth in 
the Chinese economy could turn into a severe slowdown.  Moreove r, in the event of 
adverse developments, foreign aut horities would likely face sim ilar constraints in 
providing policy stimulus as in t he United States.  We view the  risks around our 
unemployment rate projection as  aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as tilted to 
the upside.   
With regard to inflation, we see considerable uncertainty aroun d our projection, 
but we do not view the current level of uncertain ty as unusuall y high.  At the same time, 
we continue to view the risks around our inflation projection a s tilted somewhat to the 
downside.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain very low, as do 
some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectation s.  In addition, the 
realization of the downside risk s to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar, thereby depressing U.S. i mport prices and inflation.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct si x alternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario explores the 
consequences of continued restr aint in business investment.  In  the second scenario, long-
term rates fail to increase de spite the rising policy rate feat ured in the base line—a repeat 
of the phenomenon sometimes refe rred to as the “Greenspan conun drum.”  The third 
scenario explores the effect s of continued subdued labor produc tivity growth over the 
next two years.  By contrast, in the fourth scenario, productiv ity growth is permanently 
faster than in the baseline.  The f ifth scenario considers the possibility that ongoing U.S. 
policy normalization leads to a s tronger appreciation of the do llar, while the sixth and

 final scenario considers the possibility that stronger growth abroad may cause the dollar 
to depreciate relativ e to the baseline.  
The first and second scenarios are simulated in the FRB/US mode l.  The third 
scenario uses the EDO model, and the fourth scenario uses the S mets-Wouters model.  
The fifth and sixth scenarios are  run in the multicountry SIGMA  model.  In all the 
scenarios, the federal funds r ate is governed by the same inert ial policy rule as in the 
baseline, including the adjustmen ts to the intercept in the nea r term.  In all cases, we 
assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio foll ow the baseline paths. 
Weak Business Investment 
Business investment has recently surprised us on the downside.  The BEA 
estimates that, over the past three quarters, fix ed nonresident ial investment (including 
both equipment and intangibles as well as structures) and inven tory investment have 
taken about 1 percentage point, on a verage, off of GDP growth a t an annual rate.  In the 
staff forecast, the downturn in bus iness investment spending is  short lived, with positive 
growth contributions from fixe d and inventory investment resumi ng in the second half of 
this year.  However, this reversal  may fail to materialize, and , in this scenario, we assume 
that whatever factors have led to the weak pace of business inv estment experienced in 
recent quarters prove more persistent than in the baseline.  Sp ecifically, the scenario 
assumes that fixed business inve stment declines at an average a nnual rate of 1 percent 
over the next four quarters before  starting to increase again, while inventories continue to 
run off through the end of this year.  
Real GDP rises at an almost 2 percent annual rate in 2017, ½ pe rcentage point 
less than in the baseline.  The  unemployment rate moves down mo re gradually than in the 
baseline and is just above  4½ percent by the end of 2019.  Give n the low responsiveness 
of inflation to aggregate demand i n the FRB/US model, inflation  is little changed.  With 
less resource utilization, the f ederal funds rate rises more gr adually than in the baseline 
projection. 
A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum 
The staff projects the federal funds rate to rise steadily over the next several years, 
reaching 1½ percent by the end of next year and 2½ percent by t he end of 2018.  Given 
the lackluster recoveries exp ected in many leading foreign econ omies, policy rates in 
these areas are unlikely to rise in line with the federal funds  rate.  The resulting interest 
rate differentials may increas e capital inflows to the United States, which could affect the

 conventional workings of moneta ry policy.  In particular, long- term interest rates may fail 
to rise in response to monetar y policy tighteni ng, a situation similar to the Greenspan 
conundrum of the mid-2000s.1 
This scenario simulates the macroeconomic consequences of such a disconnect 
between the policy rate and long- term rates.  Consistent with t he original Greenspan 
conundrum period, we keep long rat es fixed over the next six qu arters at their levels as of 
the third quarter of this year; the short rate evolves accordin g to the inputs of the Taylor 
rule.  Starting in the first quarter of 2018, the conundrum slo wly unwinds, and the link 
between short and long rates i s fully restored by the end of th e simulation period. 
In this scenario, lower long-te rm rates boost asset prices and spur consumption 
and investment spending.  As a re sult, real GDP growth reaches 3 percent in 2018, about 
1 percentage point above the base line.  With a buoyant economy,  the trajectory for the 
unemployment rate is lower than in the staff forecast, reaching  3¼ percent in 2019, 
whereas inflation moves up only mar ginally above the baseline t o 2 percent.2  By the end 
of 2019, consistent with output wel l above potential, the feder al funds rate has increased 
steeply to 4¼ percent, 1  percentage point hi gher than in the Tealbook projection.  As the 
conundrum unwinds and long rates s tart to rise along with the s hort rate, GDP growth 
declines and the unemployment ra te returns to the baseline, alt hough inflation still 
remains a little higher. 
Temporarily Weaker Productivity 
Labor productivity growth has been  weak over the past several y ears, averaging 
less than ½ percent per y ear from 2011 through 2015 and posting  a decline over the most 
recent four quarters.  In the baseline projection, productivity  growth is assumed to pick 
up to an average annual rate  of 1.1 percent between 2017 and 2019, similar to the average 
pace over the past 10 years.  However, the recent subdued growt h of productivity may 
persist longer than we envision in the baseline.  In this scenario, labor productivity 
growth is assumed to remain at  only ½ percent per year over the  next two years before 
gradually moving up to the baseline pace.3  The weaker path of labor productivity is 
                                                 
1 The alternative view box “A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum”  in the Domestic Economic 
Developments and Outlook section details possible mechanisms be hind this phenomenon. 
2 The small rise in inflation depe nds importantly on the flatnes s of the wage and price Phillips 
curves used in this scenario.  Ha d we used alternative coefficients that make inflation more sensitive, as in 
some DSGE models, inflation would have peaked at about 3 percen t.  
3 Although the growth rate  of productivity returns to the baseline, the level of productivity remains 
permanently below the baseline in  this scenario.  We judge that  with a forecast error of this magnitude, the

 driven by a combination of lower t otal factor pro ductivity (TFP ) growth and positive 
shocks to aggregate demand.4 
Although real GDP rises more slow ly than in the baseline, the u nemployment rate 
follows a lower trajectory, d eclining to 4 percent by the end o f 2018, consistent with the 
weaker labor productivity and posi tive shocks to aggregate demand.  These forces drive 
up firms’ marginal costs of pr oduction, leading to a higher path for inflation, which 
reaches 2¼ percent by the end of 2018, ½ percentage point highe r than in the baseline.  
As a result of both the tighter  resource utiliz ation and higher inflation, the federal funds 
rate rises faster th an in the baseline and reaches 4¼ percent at the end of 2020.   
Permanently Stronger Productivity 
Some recent research suggests that productivity growth over the  past few years 
may have been depressed by a slowdown in start-up activity and a weakening of firms’ 
efforts to fully exploit positive productivity shocks—both poss ibly a result of difficulties 
accessing financing.5  With financing conditions for firms much improved from the 
immediate aftermath of the financi al crisis, these restraints m ay no longer bind and 
productivity growth may rise fast er than has been typical in re cent years.  This scenario 
illustrates the implications of such stronger productivity grow th by assuming that 
structural productivity permanen tly grows ½ percentage point faster than in the baseline. 
The higher path for productivit y encourages households and firm s to spend more, 
which causes output growth to pick up to 2¾ percent at the end of 2017.  However, 
because this more rapid growth is matched by a pickup in potential output, the 
unemployment rate is little cha nged from the baseline for the entire simulation period.  
Inflation is ½ percentage  point lower in 2017 and 2018, as the productivity shock reduces 
firms’ marginal costs of produc tion and, hence, price pressure.6  In the model used for 
this simulation, a permanent in crease in TFP growth of ½ percen tage point raises the 
long-run real federal funds r ate by just under  ¾ percentage poi nt.  In this scenario, the 
                                                 
deviation in the level of productivity in the simulation from t he baseline after two ye ars is roughly at the 
lower 15th percentile of outcomes. 
4 In EDO and other DSGE models with both labor and capital as in puts to production, a positive 
shock to aggregate demand typically leads to lower labor produc tivity because the marginal product of 
labor declines with a n increase in hours.

Business Dynamism:  What We Know and the Way Forward,” American Economic Review,  vol. 106 
(May), pp. 203–07. 
6 Inflation in the Smets-Wouters m odel is relatively responsive to costs, compared with FRB/US 
and some other estimated DSGE m odels.  In those models, the eff ects of faster productivity growth on 
inflation could be significantly smaller.

 increase in the long-run real f unds rate is recognized immediat ely by monetary 
policymakers, who adjust their estimates of r* accordingly.  Th is increase in r* almost 
exactly offsets the effects of  lower inflation on the Taylor ru le prescription for the federal 
funds rate.  Consequently, the f ederal funds rate path remains similar to the Tealbook 
forecast. 
Stronger Dollar 
The staff baseline projects that the broad real dollar will app reciate 1½ percent per 
year over the forecast period as the federal funds rate rises f aster than markets currently 
appear to expect.  However, ongoing U.S. policy normalization could cause a much 
larger and more persistent appr eciation of the dollar, especial ly if higher U.S. interest 
rates generate financial turbul ence in vulnerable EMEs.  In thi s scenario, we assume that, 
relative to the baseline, the br oad real dollar appreciates 10 percent by the end of next 
year, the term premium on U.S . long-term bonds increases slight ly, and EME corporate 
borrowing spreads rise substantially in the face of capital out flows from EMEs.7  All told, 
foreign GDP growth runs about ¾ p ercentage point below the base line in 2017, 
notwithstanding the sizable depreciation of foreign currencies.  
The stronger dollar and weaker  foreign growth depress U.S. real  net exports. 
Consequently, U.S. real GDP gr owth is 1¾ percent in 2017, almost ¾ percentage point 
less than in the baseline.  Lower  import prices and weaker econ omic activity cause core 
PCE inflation to be only 1 percen t in 2017.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower 
path than in the baseline, ris ing to about 2¼ percent by the end of 2019. 
Faster Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar 
In our baseline forecast, we see the headwinds facing the foreign economies as 
diminishing only gradually as fore ign output expands at a modest pace and inflation 
slowly edges closer to central  bank targets.  However, the reco very abroad might be 
faster if highly accommodative fo reign monetary policies, abati ng fiscal pressures, and 
ongoing improvements in financial  conditions—including in the EMEs—generate a 
bigger impetus to household and bus iness spending than assumed in the baseline.  In this 
                                                 
7 In this scenario, the term premium on longer-term U.S. Treasur y securities is assumed to rise 
slightly, as might occur if invest ors were disappointed that mo netary policy was not more accommodative 
than implied by the inertial Tayl or rule.  However, if flight-t o-safety flows into dollar-denominated assets 
were sufficiently large, the ter m premium could well decline.

 scenario, we assume that fore ign GDP growth rises to above 3 pe rcent over the next two 
years and thus averages about  ½ percentage point per year highe r than under our baseline 
projection.  Increased optimism a bout the durability of the foreign recovery—and the 
perception of diminish ed tail risks—causes the broad real dollar to depreciate 8 percent 
by the end of next year, reversing about half of the appreciati on that has occurred since 
the middle of 2014. 
U.S. real GDP expands 2¾ percent in 2017, nearly ½ percentage point more than 
in the baseline, as the weaker  dollar and stronger foreign grow th boost U.S. real net 
exports.  The unemployment rate falls to 3¾ percent by the end of 2019.  Higher import 
prices and heightened resource pres sures cause core PCE inflation to move persistently 
above 2 percent by early 2018.  The f ederal funds rate rises mo re quickly than in the 
baseline, reaching almost 4 percent by the end of 2019.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent rang
es for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. 
Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions
to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
