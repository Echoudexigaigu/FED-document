Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming data indicate that the economy is expanding at a moderate rate.  Real 
GDP growth remains on track to pick up from its weak first-half pace, as business 
investment turns up and the drag f rom inventory investment ends .  However, the 
projected rate of growth in the s econd half—at 2¼ percent—is a bit lower than in the 
September Tealbook, reflecting the somewhat softer-than-expected readings on consumer spending in recent months.  Meanwhile, labor market conditions have continued to 
improve, and we view the economy as essentially at full employm ent. 
Beyond this year, we project rea l GDP to increase 2¼ percent in 2017, 
½ percentage point stronger than  this year, with continued soli d gains in consumer 
spending and a pickup in both resid ential and business investme nt.  Over 2018 and 2019, 
output growth slows gradually  to its longer-run trend of 1¾ per cent, as monetary policy 
tightens and the stimulus from fiscal policy diminishes.  Our m edium-term projection for 
real GDP growth is a bit weaker  than in the September Tealbook,  reflecting the effects of 
both a slightly stronger dolla r and higher oil prices, but grow th is still sufficient to tighten 
resource utilization further.  In particular, GDP is projected to be 1¼ percent above its 
potential level at the e nd of 2018 and in 2019.  Correspondingl y, we project the 
unemployment rate to fall to  around 4½ percent by mid-2018—abou t ½ percentage point 
below our estimate of its natur al rate—and the labor force part icipation rate to continue to 
run above its trend.  Consistent with the slightly weaker pace of output growth in this 
projection, these measures of res ource utilization show a littl e less tightening than in the 
September Tealbook. 
The near-term inflation forecast is somewhat higher than in the September 
Tealbook, reflecting upside surprise s in the incoming data for both core and energy 
prices.  We now expect the 12-month change in total PCE prices to move up from 
1.0 percent in August, the most recent published data, to 1.6 p ercent by December, as 
energy prices pick up.  The 12-month c hange in core PCE prices is projected to edge up 
from 1.7 percent in August to 1.8 pe rcent in December, a path that is slightly higher than 
in the September Tealbook.  We also nudged up our forecast of both total and core PCE 
inflation for next year by 0.1 percentage point to 1.7 percent;  otherwise, the medium-term 
inflation forecast is little change d from the September Tealboo k.  We continue to project 
that PCE price inflation will move up gradually to 1.9 percent in 2019, as the effects of

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth  is close to the median projection from 
the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 
2016  as well as  the Blue Chip in 2017.  (The SPF forecast is released quarterly and is 
about two month s old; we await the next release on  Nov ember 14.)  The staff’s 
forecast for the unemployment rate is slightly above the others in 2016 and in line 
with the Blue Chip in 2017.  The s taff’s projection for CPI inflation is  slightly  above 
the outside forecasters  in 2016 but in line with them  in 2017.  The staff’s projections 
for total and core PCE price inflation  are somewhat lower than the SPF  in 2016 
and 2017 .

  earlier energy and import price d eclines fade and as resource utilization continues to 
tighten.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule (with the intercept adjustments  introduced in 
the June Tealbook) that we use t o mechanically set the federal funds rate in 
our projection calls for the feder al funds rate to increase abo ut 80 basis points 
per year over the projection pe riod and to average about 3 perc ent in the 
fourth quarter of 2019.  The federal funds rate at that time is  about 25 basis 
points above our assumption for its long-run equilibrium level as a result of 
the positive output gap.  Even so, the path for the federal fun ds rate is a bit 
lower than in the September Tealbook due to the slightly lower output gap in 
the current projection.   
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at it s current 
level until the third quart er of 2017 and then begin to contrac t, as the proceeds 
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates  
 Compared with the September T ealbook, we have revised down the projected 
path of the 10-year Treas ury yield through 2019 in response to the lower path 
of future short-term interest ra tes.  Nevertheless, we continue to expect that 
the 10-year Treasury yield will rise significantly over the med ium term, 
reflecting both the movement of t he 10-year valuation window th rough the 
period of extremely low short-term  interest rates and a rising term premium.   
 Investment-grade corporate bond spreads have narrowed more than  we 
anticipated, leading u s to revise down our projection for inves tment-grade 
corporate yields slightly more than that for 10-year Treasury y ields in the near 
term.  The path of 30-year fixed m ortgage rates was revised dow n in line with 
the revision to Treasury yields.

  Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 The projected path of stock prices is little c hanged.  Equity p rices are 
projected to rise at an average  annual rate of about 1½ percent  over the 
projection period.   
 Recent data on house prices were as expected.  We continue to p roject a 
modest deceleration i n home values from an increase of 5½ perce nt in 2016 to 
an average annual increase of 3¾ pe rcent over the medium term.  
Fiscal Policy 
 We assume that discretionary pol icy actions at all levels of go vernment will 
boost real GDP growth by 0.3 percen tage point this year and nex t, with 
smaller contributions in 2018 and 2019.  The support from fisca l policy is 
slightly less in the near term than in the September Tealbook, primarily 
reflecting weaker-than-expecte d state and local government purc hases.  As we 
had anticipated, the Congress pa ssed a continuing resolution in  September to 
fund the government through early December, and we expect furth er 
extensions in funding thereafter t o occur without major disrupt ion.  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that foreign real GDP growth rebounded from an annual rate of 
just under 1 percent in the s econd quarter to an estimated 2½ percent pace in 
the third quarter, as economic activity in Canad a and Mexico bo unced back.  
Foreign economic growth is proj ected to stay at  about this rate  over the 
remainder of the forecast period, supported in part by accommodative 
monetary policies abro ad.  The near-term outlook is slightly we aker relative to 
the September Tealbook, with softer data in some emerging marke t economies 
and a markdown in growth prospects for Canada and the United Ki ngdom. 
 The broad nominal dollar has appr eciated about 1 ¼ percent since the time of 
the September Tealbook.  The dolla r rose against nearly all of the currencies 
of the advanced foreign economie s, with an especially pronounce d 
appreciation against the British pound.  In contrast, the dolla r is close to 
unchanged against the currencies  of emerging market economies.  We expect 
the broad nominal dollar to apprec iate at an annual rate of abo ut 2¼ percent 
over the medium term, as market expectations for the federal fu nds rate move

  up toward the staff’s assumption.  T his rate of increase in the value of the 
dollar is slightly lower than i n the September Tealbook, as the difference 
between the staff’s assumptions a nd market expect ations for U.S . monetary 
policy narrowed somewhat duri ng the intermeeting period.   
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oi l has increased more than $4 si nce the 
September Tealbook to $51.50 per barrel, supported by news that  OPEC 
member countries and Russia may cut oil production.  Futures pr ices have 
increased since the previous Tealbook, with the December 2019 B rent futures 
prices at $59 per barrel , up about $3 per barrel.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Real GDP growth is expected t o pick up from an annual rate of a bout 1 percent in 
the first half of this year  to 2¼ percent in the second half, r eflecting an upturn in business 
fixed investment and a positive swing in the contribution from inventory investment.  
This projected rebound in GDP growt h is slightly l ess than in t he September Tealbook, 
with the downward revision concentrated in consumer spending. 
 We currently estimate that real GDP increased 2½ percent in the  third 
quarter.1  For the fourth quarter, we fo recast real GDP growth of 2 perc ent.2  
GDP growth in both quarters is abou t ¼ percentage point lower than in the 
previous Tealbook; the downward revisions were concentrated in private 
domestic final purchases (PDFP), w hich we think provides a bett er indication 
of the underlying pace of economic activity than overall GDP, so we have also 
nudged down GDP growth early next year.   
                                                 
1 The median of the t hird-quarter forecasts within the System, a s displayed in the table “Federal 
Reserve System Nowcasts  of 2016:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” is 2.1 per cent, which is a bit lower than the 
staff’s estimate.     
After the close of the forecast for this Tealbook, the Census B ureau released an advanced estimate 
of September goods trade.  Our preliminary analysis suggests th at the net export contribution to GDP 
growth increased to ¾ percentage point in the third quarter, as  imports were weaker  than expected and 
exports were stronger.  Our strai ght read of these data would i mply third-quarter GDP  growth of 3 percent.  
However, the BEA will publish its advance estimate of third-qua rter GDP on Friday, October 28. 
2 We estimate that Hurricane Matth ew will subtract 0.1 percentage point from GDP growth in the 
fourth quarter and that growth in the first quarter will be hig her by a similar amount.

   We expect business fixed inve stment to turn up in the second ha lf of this year 
following notable declines in the  first half.  New orders for n ondefense capital 
goods appear to have stabilized in recent months, and we expect  a modest 
increase in equipment investment in the second half.  Meanwhile, intangible 
investment appears to have c ontinued growing steadily.  With re gard to 
nonresidential structures, recent increases in the number of dr illing rigs in 
operation indicate that investment in energy-related structures  is on track to 
move up in the fourth quarter follo wing seven consecutive quarterly declines.  
Outside of drilling and mining, recent indicators suggest that outlays for 
nonresidential structures are increasing at a modest pace.  Ove rall, our 
forecast for business investment in the second half is little c hanged from the 
September Tealbook.  
 As in the September Tealbook, inventory investment is expected to slightly 
boost GDP growth in the second half of the year after subtracti ng 
¾ percentage point in the first  half.  Nominal book values through August 
suggest less of a decline in inve ntory investment in the third quarter than in 
the second quarter, and the sta ff’s flow-of-goods inventory sys tem shows no 
significant inventory imbalances  outside of the energy sector.  Partly on this 
basis, and w ith steady growth in P DFP, we expect a slow rebuild ing of 
inventories to begi n this quarter.   
 Growth in consumer spending is ex pected to average 2¼ percent i n the second 
half of this year, supported by con tinued solid gains in employ ment and 
household income as well as ear lier increases in household wealth.  Even so, 
the incoming data on consumer spending have been somewhat weake r, on 
balance, than expected in the  September Tealbook, with disappoi nting retail 
sales for both August and September more than offsetting an ups ide surprise 
to light motor vehicle sales i n September.  In response, we mar ked down 
consumer spending growth t hrough early next year.   
 We continue to expect residential  investment to flatten out in the fourth 
quarter after declining in the two previous quarters.  As we had anticipated, 
single-family starts recovered f rom their sharp decline in August, but taking a 
somewhat longer view, single-fa mily construction still seems to  be moving

continues to grow, supported by lo w mortgage rates and further improvements 
in the labor market.  Given the  very low levels of homes availa ble for sale, we 
expect the rising demand to resu lt in a pickup in residential c onstruction 
activity starting early next year.  
 Net exports are projected to be f lat in the sec ond half, wherea s we had 
expected them to subtract ¼ percen tage point from GDP growth in  the 
September Tealbook.  Unseasonabl y strong soybean exports alone flipped the 
net export contribution in the thi rd quarter from a negative to  a positive 
¼ percentage point, though we expect that a drawdown in farm-pr oduct 
inventories will offset som e of the topline GDP effect.  In the  fourth quarter, 
we continue to expect net exports  to subtract about ¼ percentag e point from 
GDP growth.  W e continue to view  the underlying pace of export growth as 
being held down by a strong dolla r and weak foreign demand.   
 The level of manufacturing produc tion has changed little, on net, in recent 
months (or, indeed, since lat e 2014), restrained by weak export demand, 
spillovers from earlier declines in oil and gas drilling, and s low domestic 
capital investment more genera lly.  We expect factory output to  continue on 
this flat trajectory in the four th quarter despite some modest improvement 
recently in the readings for new orders from the national and r egional 
manufacturing surveys.   
Relative to its pace over 2016 as whole, GDP growth is projecte d to step up to 
about 2¼ percent in 2017, r eflecting continue d solid gains in c onsumer spending and a 
pickup in both residential and bus iness investment.  GDP growth  then eases to 2 percent 
in 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019 as mone tary policy gradually tig htens and the stimulus 
from fiscal policy diminishes.  
 Our projection for real GDP grow th over the medium term is a bi t weaker than 
in the September Tealbook, refl ecting a small reaction to disap pointing 
spending data this year as well as the anticipated effects on e conomic activity 
from a slightly stronger do llar and higher oil prices. 
                                                 
3 Multifamily starts recorded an outsized decline in September, but given the volatility in this 
series, we took no signal from  these data for our forecast.

   As in the September Tealbook, we expect potential output growth  to pick up 
gradually from 1½ percent this  year to 1¾ percent at the end of  the medium 
term, driven primarily by an acceleration in structural product ivity.   
 With GDP growth expected to outp ace our estimate of potential g rowth over 
most of the medium term, aggreg ate output moves above our estim ate of its 
sustainable level.  At the end of 2019, we forecast real GDP to  be about 
1¼ percent above potential—a slightly smaller gap than in the S eptember 
Tealbook.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
Labor market conditions have con tinued to improve so far this year, with solid job 
growth as well as an increase in  labor force participation rela tive to its downward trend, 
and we are projecting further imp rovements through the medium term.   
 Total nonfarm payroll employ ment rose 156,000 in September.4  While 
private payrolls grew in line wi th our September forecast, state and local 
government employment, particul arly in educatio n, declined unexpectedly. 
We view the recent weakness in state and local education employ ment as 
payback for unusual strength ear lier in the summer and thus too k little signal 
from the September data for thi s sector.  Accordingly, we anticipate that total 
payrolls will increase 175,000 per month, on average, in the fo urth quarter, 
about the same as in our September projection.5  
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate rounded up to 5.0 percent in 
September, whereas we had proj ected it to hold at 4.9 percent.  We expect the 
unemployment rate to edge bac k down to 4.9 percent in the fourt h quarter, 
which would put it at the same leve l as it was at the beginning  of this year. 
 In response to the surprising str ength in the labor force parti cipation rate so far 
this year—including another uptick in September to 62.9 percent —we nudged 
                                                 
4 Nonfarm payrolls were revised up  nearly 20,000 in August, clos e to the 30,000 revision we 
penciled in to the September Teal book based on th e sizable upwa rd revisions to August employment in 
recent years. 
5 We estimate that Hurricane Matth ew, which struck during the re ference week for the October 
employment report, depressed payrolls by 10,000 and will boost payroll gains by the same amount in 
November, leaving no imprint on the average monthly change in t he fourth quarter.

  up our forecast for the participa tion rate slightly over the ne xt year and a half 
to show a little more overshooti ng relative to its trend.  We n ow expect the 
participation rate to average  62.8 percent in the fourth quarte r before declining 
gradually next year.   
 It continues to be our view that  the labor market is now essent ially at full 
employment.  In the fourth quarter, we expect the unemployment rate to be 
0.1 percentage point below our estim ate of its natural rate, while the 
participation rate and the emplo yment-to-population ratio will be slightly 
above our estimates of their tre nds.  Meanwhile, the share of e mployees 
working part time for economic reasons, even with its decline i n September, 
remains slightly elevated and lik ely is a small source of labor  underutilization. 
(As discussed in the box “The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on 
Employer Health-Care Costs a nd Part-Time Employment,” we do not  see 
much convincing evidence, at leas t as of yet, that the new health insurance 
mandates required by the Affordable Care Act have boosted the s hare of part-
time employment.)   
 The labor market conditions inde x, or LMCI, declined further in  September, 
partially because of the uptick in the unemployment rate, and remains at odds 
with the staff’s assessment that  labor market conditions have c ontinued to 
improve.  
The medium-term outlook for the l abor market is a bit softer th an our September 
projection, reflecting the sma ll downward revision to the forec ast for GDP growth over 
the next three years. 
 We expect average monthly total pa yroll gains to slow from abou t 170,000 in 
2017 to about 130,000 in 2018 and 100,000 in 2019.  By 2019, the pace of employment growth is expected to have moved down into the range  that we 
view as consistent with uncha nged labor utilization.  The path of monthly job 
gains over the medium term is about 10,000 lower than in the Se ptember 
Tealbook. 
 Labor market conditions are exp ected to tighten further over th e next couple 
of years, though by slightly less than in our previous forecast .

  o By the end of 2019, the unemployment rate is projected to be 4. 4 percent, 
0.2 percentage point above its lev el in the September Tealbook but still 
0.6 percentage point below our estimate of its natural rate. 
o In addition, we project that the l abor force participation rate  will edge 
down a bit more slowly than its t rend over the medium term, as sustained 
job gains and rising wages continue to slow outflows from the l abor force 
while also drawing some individuals in.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
The incoming data on consumer prices have been somewhat higher than we had 
anticipated in the September T ealbook, which led us to revise up our projection for both 
core and total PCE infl ation this year and next. 
 We expect that swings in ener gy prices will cause the 12-month change in 
total PCE prices to move up from 1.0 percent in August to 1.6 p ercent by 
December, with a further small increase early next year.  In co ntrast, the 
trajectory for core PCE price in flation is relatively flat, wit h the 12-month 
change expected to remain n ear its August reading of 1.7 percen t through the 
end of 2017.  The projections for total and core PCE price infl ation are revised 
up 0.3 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point, respectively,  in 2016.  
 Measured on a quarterly average b asis, core PCE price inflation  is expected to 
slow in the second half of this year relative to the first half , when inflation was 
boosted by some volatile price categ ories and what appears to b e residual 
seasonality.  Nevertheless, cor e goods prices have surprised us  to the upside, 
partly reflecting unusually large increases in prescription dru g prices.  In 
addition, core services prices—bo th market- and non-market-base d—have 
slowed less in recent months than we expected.  As a result, we  now project 
core PCE price inflation t o be 1.6 percent in the second half, ¼ percentage 
point higher than in our previous forecast.6  
 PCE energy prices are projected t o jump at an annual rate of ab out 25 percent 
in the fourth quarter, a much fas ter pace than in the September Tealbook, 
                                                 
6 By contrast, core CPI prices have come in about as expected, a nd we did not change our second-
half forecast for core CPI inflation.

 The Effects of the Affordable Care Act on Employer Health-Care  
Costs and Part-Time Employment 
There are concerns that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has raised health insurance costs for 
employers and is leading firms to shift full-time workers to part-time status to avoid ACA penalties .  
However, we find little convincing support in the data that employer health-care costs have 
increased as a result of the ACA mandates or that employers have raised the share of part-time 
employment in response to the ACA, although workers appear to be facing a higher share of 
health-care costs .  Nevertheless, it is not possible to observe what would have happened in the 
absence of the ACA, and the effects of the implementation of the ACA mandates may take 
additional time to ful ly appear.  For both of these reasons, drawing firm conclusions remains 
difficult. 
After various delays, the employer mandate began in 2015 for firms with 100 or more full-time 
equivalent (FTE) employees and in 2016 for firms with 50 to 99 FTEs.1  The mandate requires 
employers to offer heal
th insurance coverage to employees working 30 or more hours per week or 
pay a penalty of $2,000 per FTE per year .  Even if insurance is offered, the employer can still be 
penalized if the insurance fails to provide “ mini mal essential coverage,” be af fordable (the 
employee contribution can be no more than 9½ percent of earnings), and cover family members 
through age 26.    
The aggregate data do not provide convincing evidence that the ACA has significantly pushed up 
employer s’ health insurance  costs.  As shown in figure 1, employers ’ health insurance costs (as 
measured by the employment cost index) increased at an annual rate of about 3 percent in 2015 
and over the first half of 2016, similar to the pace of increase seen over the preceding several years.   
Nonetheless, there are a number of actions that employers may have undertaken in response to 
the ACA to help reduce their costs per employee covered.  Indeed , the Kaiser Family Foundation’s 
annual Employer Health Benefits Survey documents greater use of high deductible plans —from 
20 percent of w
orkers with health insurance coverage in 2014 to 29 percent in 2016.  These high 
                                                 
1 Firms with fewer than 50 FTEs are exempt from the employer mandate. Figure 1:  Growth in health insurance costs (ECI, private 
employers, 12-month percent change in employer costs

 deductible plans generally cost employers less by shifting more of the cost of health care on to the 
employee .   
An additional way to lower costs is to decrease the number of employees that are newly eligible for 
health insurance either by replacing full-time workers with part-time workers or by simply 
eliminating full-time positions.  However, the Kai ser Family Foundation’s survey shows that, on net, 
more firms reported to have switched workers from part-time to full-time status in response to the 
ACA rather than vice versa.2  Further, only 3 percent of responding firms indicated that they 
intended to red
uce hiring for full-time positions in order to contain health insurance costs due to 
the ACA.    
Following the approach taken in several academic studies, figure 2 compares the share of people 
working 30 to 34 hours with the share working 25 to 29 hours.3  If the ACA were causing employers 
to shift workers’ hours below the threshold, we would expect to see a decrease in the share 
working above 30 hours relative to the share working below 30 hours a week.  However, there is 
no clear evidence that such a shift has occurred.   Figure 2 shows that the relative share displays a 
pronounced cyclical 
pattern, spiking upward in 2008 but recovering to its average level over 2005 
to 2007 by the beginning of 2015.  The relative share has roughly moved sideways since th e 
mandate went into effect in 2015, both in the aggregate (the red line) and among workers in the 
lowest wage quintile (the blue line), who are the most likely to be affected by the employer 
mandate.4  In contrast, the relative share would likely have shown a steep decline if employers 
were shifting la
rge numbers of workers below the 30-hour threshold in response to the ACA. 
Finally, a survey of recent empirical studies conducted by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond concludes that there is little evidence that the ACA has had an effect on part-time 
status.5  However, a s suggested in a st udy of the Massachusetts health-care law that passed in 
2007 —which has many similarities with the ACA —an increase in part-time employment due to the 
ACA may 
emerge over a longer time horizon.6   
                                                 
2 While the survey offers no explanation for this surprising finding, one possibility is that the individual 
mandate may have led workers to place more value on employer-provided health insurance; from the employer’s 
perspective, it is typically more cost effective to insure full-time workers.

Kosali I. Simon (2016), “Little Change Seen in Part -Time Employment a s a Result of the Affordable Care Act,” Health 
Affairs,  vol. 35 (1), pp. 1 19–23. 
4 Among other reasons, workers in the lowest wage quintiles likely cost more for employers to insure because 
the affordability requirement of the ACA limits the cost sharing based, in part, on the earnings of the worker.

  reflecting both the rise in crude oil prices and an upward adju stment to our 
forecast of gasoline price margins.  
 In contrast, PCE food prices dec lined in September by somewhat more than 
we were anticipating.  Agricultural prices for both crops and m eat have 
continued to decline , reflecting recor d U.S. production of corn , soybeans, 
poultry, and pork.  We now expect  consumer food prices to decrease 
1¼ percent in the second half of t his year, nearly 1 percentage  point more of a 
decline than in the  September Tealbook. 
 Core import prices are estimat ed to have increased at an annual  rate of 
1¾ percent in the third quarter , a slight downward revision rel ative to the 
September Tealbook but nevertheless the largest increase in ove r two years.  
We expect core import prices t o rise at a moderate ¾ percent pace through the 
remainder of the forecast, he ld down by projected dollar apprec iation. 
 Recent readings on longer-term inflation expectations have rema ined 
relatively stable on balance.  T he median of inflation expectations over the 
next 5 to 10 years from the prelim inary Michigan survey moved d own to 
2.4 percent in early October, whi ch, if maintained in the final  report, would 
represent a new historical low.  In contrast, expected PCE price inflation over 
the next 10 years from the Federal  Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s Survey of 
Professional Forecasters remained at 2 percent in the third qua rter.  The 
3-year-ahead measure of inflati on expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was 2.6 percent in S eptember, 
close to its average over the fi rst half of the year but below its level in 
preceding years.  The TIPS-based m easure of 5-year-forward infl ation 
compensation, while still low at 1.6 percent, has moved up sinc e the time of 
the September Tealbook.  
Beyond the near term, we continue  to project a gradual rise in inflation toward the 
FOMC’s objective of 2 percent.  Given the cum ulative surprise in the inflation data so far 
this year, we decided to adjust up our forecast of core PCE pri ce inflation in 2017 by 
0.1 percentage point to 1.7 percent.  Core PCE price inflation is then projected to move 
up to 1.9 percent by 2019, primarily ref lecting the waning restraint from earlier declines 
in energy and import prices al ong with a further tightening in resource utilization.  With 
consumer food and energy prices p rojected to rise roughly in line with core prices after

  this year, we expect total PCE price inflation to run close to core inflation over the next 
few years and to rea ch 1.9 percent in 2019.  
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our  core inflation projection  for 2016 has 
been revised up 0.3 percentage po int, with both market and nonm arket prices 
coming in higher than we expecte d.  (See the exhibit “Sources o f Inflation 
Forecast Revisions since the  December 2015 Tealbook” for additi onal 
information on revisions to our i nflation forecast this year.) 
Hourly labor compensation growt h is projected to gradually pick  up from 
2½ percent this year to 3¼ percen t in 2019, as the labor market  tightens further.  
Incoming data led to an upward revision of ¼ percentage point i n the rate of 
compensation growth this year rel ative to the September Tealboo k.  Over the medium 
term, compensation growth is re vised down slightly, reflecting the somewhat smaller 
projected decline in the  unemployment rate. 
 Average hourly earnings of all employees in September rose a li ttle faster than 
we had expected, boosting the 12-month change to 2.6 percent.  In general, 
this measure of wage growth has  been trending up in recent quar ters relative 
to its 2 percent range from 2012 to late 2014. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker, a measure of 
hourly wage growth that is constructed from Current Population Survey data 
and that is more pro-cyclical t han average hourly earnings, has  moved up 
from around 3 percent to 3½ percent over the past year and a ha lf but remains 
below pre-rece ssion levels.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 The natural rate of unemploymen t remains at 5.0 percent, and potential GDP 
increases at about its long-r un value of 1.7 percent per year s tarting in 2020.  
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Recent data point to a bounceback in foreign real GDP growth to  an estimated  
2½ percent in the third quarter, up from just below 1 percent in the second.  Indicators in 
Canada and Mexico, where the second -quarter dip was concentrated,  strengthened 
notably.   Foreign growth should remain at about this near -trend pace over the remainder 
of the forecast period , supported by  continuing  highly accommodative monetary polic ies 
in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and  a shallow  recovery in South  America.  
The o verall foreign outlook is slightly weaker in the current quarter and the next , relative 
to the September Tealbook , as a result of  softer  data in some emerging market economies  
(EMEs)  as well as  markdowns in Canada and the United Kingdom . 
Given the mild pace of economic activity , inflation in most AFEs is expected to 
remain  below central bank targets.  The United Kingdom is a  prominent  exception, where 
the sharp depreciation of the pound has already begun to pass through into consumer 
prices and should push  inflation well above the Bank of England’s (BOE’s) target in 
2017.  More broadly, the recent rise in oil prices will boost AFE inflation in the current quarter and next.  Thereafter, the whittling away of resource slack should keep AFE inflation at just above 1½  percent for the remainder of the forecast period.   In the EMEs , 
inflation has also been lifted by higher energy prices, notably in Mexico, and by  the 
fading effects of previous declines in food prices in China .  We expect EME inflation to 
settle at around 3 percent .   
With inflation low and growth subdued, we continue to assume that monetary 
policy in the AFEs and some  emerging Asia n economies  will remain highly 
accommodative through 2019 .  Such stances ha ve raised some  concerns in AFEs about 
the limits to asset purchases and the costs to financial sectors of very flat yield curves.  
To address these concerns  and in recognition of low inflation and inflation expectations, 
the Bank of Japan (BOJ)  announced a number of  new policies at its September meeting , 
including a  target for 10 -year government bond yields  and its intention to overshoot its 
2 percent inflation target.  (For further details, s ee the box “ The Bank of Japan’s New 
Policy Framework ” in this section of the Tealbook.) 
Over the intermeeting period , we saw renewed  focus on risks emanating from  
Europe.  First, harder negotiating stances taken by British and European officials on

 The Bank of Japan’s New Policy Framework   
At its September meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) introduced “ Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary 
Easing (QQE)  with Yield Curve Control.”  Under this new framework, the BOJ commits to overshooting its 
inflation target by expanding the monetary base until total inflation exceeds 2  percent  for some time.  In 
addition, the BOJ intends  to control the yield curve by targeting short - and long -term interest rates.  T he 
BOJ introduced a new target for the yield on 10 -year Japanese government b onds (JGBs) at “around zero 
percent ,” which it indicated could be adjusted at future policy meetings, and kept the deposit rate at 
negative 0.1  percent.  To facilitate yield curve control, the BOJ introduced two new tools:  long -term 
discount window credit for a period of up to 10 years  and fixed -rate purchase operations that allow the 
BOJ to buy unlimited amounts of JGBs at a specified rate.  In addition, the BOJ  removed its target for the 
average remaining maturity of its JGB purchases (which had been “about 7  to 12 years”), and Governor 
Kuroda indicated flexibility in the size of total future purchases.  I n its monthly purchase plan for October, 
the BOJ slightly  reduced purchases of JGBs with maturities over 5 years while leaving unchanged 
purchases of shorter- term JGBs.  This shortening of average maturities and reduction in total purchases 
was likely an attempt to reduce downward pressure on the long end of the  yield curve.  
This  new policy is the most recent of several adjustments to the BOJ’s monetary policy framework since 
Prime Minister Abe was elected in December 2012  with a promise to end deflation.  Figure 1 shows that 
inflation expectations and actual inflation rose after the BOJ announced an inflation target of 2 percent  in 
January 2013 and initiated QQE in April 2013.  However, inflation fell back, in part because of lower oil 
prices, and inflation expectations moved lower as well despite an expansion of asset purchases under 
QQE in October 2014.  The introduction of a negative policy rate in January 2016 contributed  to a further 
flattening of the yield curve, rais ing concerns that the reduced  profitability of banks, insurance 
companies, and pension funds  could impair the transmission of monetary stimulus  (figure 2) . 
The new framework has  several potentially attractive features.  First, it ma y allow the BOJ to keep long -
term yields very low with a smaller overall quantity of asset purchases and also to shift the composition 
of its purchas es toward  shorter- maturity assets ; these elements are desirable given ongoing concerns 
that the scale of BOJ purchases may  exhaust the supply of eligible long -maturity JGBs.  Second, the yield 
curve control may induce a somewhat more upward -sloping yielding curve while still delivering a 
commensurate degree of economic stimulus and thus pose less risk to the health of the financial sector.  Third, the overshooting  commitment may succeed in boosting inflation  expectation s through forward -
looking channels, which could help raise inflation directly (to the extent the Phillips c urve depends on 
inflation expectations) and indirectly through the stimulative effect of lower real interest rates 
on activity.  
The BOJ’s new framework also presents challenges.  By target ing the 10-year bond yield, the BOJ is giving 
up control over the size of its balance sheet.  If there is sharp upward pressure on long -term yields —for 
example, if market participants anticipate a change in the BOJ’s target rate —the BOJ could be forced to 
purchase long -term JGBs at a much more rapid rate.  In contrast, if  the recent downward pressure on  
10-year yields grows, the BOJ may have to slow purchases well below its current pace, in which case it will 
need to c ommunicat e clearly so that this action is not misinterpreted as a removal of stimulus.  Finally, 
there is  uncertainty over the BOJ ’s commitment to overshooting its target and how long it will maintain 
highly expansionary policy  even as inflation rises.

 Looking ahead, we expect the BOJ to return to a wait -and-see approach as it assesses  the effect on 
inflation expectations of the overshooting commitment and of dissipating temporary factors that have 
held inflation down.  As  such, we see the BOJ keeping short -term interest rates at negative 0.1  percent for 
the foreseeable future.  We also expect the BOJ  to maintain the 10-year JGB yield at 0 percent by shifting 
its JGB purchases to shorter maturities and potentially slowing or quickening its total purchases , as 
needed.  Although we project that inflation will rise to only 1¼ percent during the forecast period, we 
expect the BOJ to forgo substantial further easing and to instead maintain its current highly 
accommodative stance and reiterate its aspirations for higher inflation.  
All told, the market response has been  minimal, consistent with little change i n the stance of BOJ policy.  
The yen has depreciated modestly, market -based inflation expectations have barely moved, and markets 
expect only slight further cuts to the deposit rate.  Although 10-year bond yields are  little changed  at 
around negative 5 basis points , actual and implied volatility of 10-year yield s have declined notably, 
suggesting some confidence in the BOJ’s ability to control long -term bond yields .  The overall muted 
response of markets to the new framework may reflect skepticism over the BOJ’s ability to raise inflation 
in the absence of substantial new easing measures  as well as doubts about the credibility  of the BOJ’s 
commitment to overshoot its 2  percent inflation target.

 Brexit  point to rockier talks and , ultimately , less economic integrati on in any U.K. –EU 
deal.  As such , we have lowered the outlook for the United Kingdom slightly  despite a 
sharp de preciation of the pound .  Second, attention has turned again to the low 
profitability and poor capitalization of Europe’s banking sector, which increases the risk 
of restrain ing the economic recovery  and leaves institutions vulnerable to shocks.  A  
failure of a large and systemic ally important  European bank  could  trigger financial 
distress  with pronounced international spillovers , a risk  we explo re in the “Banking Crisis 
in Europe” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
Other risks to the global economy that we have highlighted in the past also remain 
a source of concern.  Although Chinese growth has been resilient, risk s to financial 
stability remain significant.  And, as discussed in the “Stronger Dollar  and EME 
Turbulence ” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section, U.S. monetary policy 
tightening could still prove destabilizing for EMEs, weighing on global growth and 
leading to a mor e sizable appreciation of the dollar than in our baseline projection.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• United Kingdom.  Recent indicators suggest t hat U.K. growth slowed from 
2.7 percent in the second quarter to just above  1½ percent in the third quarter  
amid sign s of f alling construction output.  In recent weeks, U.K. and European 
officials adopted more -confrontational stances regarding the future U.K. –EU 
relationship.  Of note, Prime Minister May suggested that restoring U.K. 
sovereignty would be a higher pri ority than maintaining full access to the EU 
single market.  As a result, the likelihood of a “harder” Brexit —involving a 
bumpier transition in the near term and less economic integration over the lon g 
term—increased .  The associated drag on growth will only be partly offset by the 
weaker pound and slightly less contractionary fiscal policy.  As a result, we  
mark ed down the growth outlook a touch for most of  the forecast period.  Thus, 
growth slow s further to 1 percent in the fourth quarter before pick ing up to 
1¾ percent by late 2018, supported by accommodative monetary policy , a 
depreciated currency,  and a gradual resolution of uncertainty about the Brexit 
process.   The depreciation of the pound has led to a pickup in inflation , which w e 
expect  to peak at 3½ percent in the current quarter.  T he BOE has said it will look 
through this surge , and we assume it will keep its policy rate unchanged through 
the forecast period  and purchas e a total of £70 billion in assets , as announced 
in August .

 • Euro Area.  Data o n industrial production through August and other more -recent 
indicators suggest that real GDP growth remained near 1¼ percent  in the third 
quarter .  Going forward, w e continue to project  that accommodative monetary 
policy and slightly expansionary fiscal policy will support a gradual pickup  in 
growth .  However, we also expect deep -seated  weaknesses in the banking sector 
and elevated anti -EU sentiment to trigger bouts of uncertainty and volatility, 
which will likely weigh on the recovery.  All told, we see GDP growth increasing 
to 1¾ percent in 2017  and remaining near  this pace through 2019.  With  inflation 
lingering near 1½ percent throughout the forecast period, we believe that the 
European Central Bank will continue to purchase assets through the end of  
2017— beginning  to taper a few  months before that  time —and will keep policy 
rates at their current levels until late 2019.   
• Canada.  Monthly GDP for July  and oil production through August suggest that 
real GDP grew 3½ percent in the third quarter after contr acting 1.6  percent the 
quarter  before .  Going forward, h owever, survey indicators, such as September ’s 
manufacturing PMI, point to a moderat ion in growth.  Thus , we project GDP 
growth to average a bit more than  2 percent through mid-2017, supported by a 
weak Canadian dollar and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies , before 
settling at its potential pace of 1¾ percent by mid -2018.  This projection is 
slightly weaker than in the September Tealbook , as the government  enacted  new 
macroprudential measures t o cool an overheated  housing market , including more 
restrictive qualifications for mortgage insurance (for high loan-to-v alue, or LTV , 
borrowers) and for portfolio insurance (for banks with low -LTV  mortgages ) as 
well as  the clos ure of  a tax loophole fo r foreign buyers .  Even so, with the output 
gap gradually closing, we continue to anticipate  that the Bank of Canada (BOC) 
will begin increasing its policy rate in late 2017.  
As part of its agreement with the government , reviewed every five years,  to ren ew 
its 2 percent inflation target for headline inflation, the BOC also replaced its 
operational measure of core inflation with three new measures.  These measures 
are a trimmed mean, a “weighted median ,” and a “common component” (derived 
from a factor mode l), which are similar to the measures produced by the Dallas, 
Cleveland, and New York Federal Reserve Banks, respectively .  The BOC felt 
that its old core measure was no longer an accurate measure of underlying

 inflation and thought it was more a ppropriate  to look at several measures to gauge 
inflationary pressures.  
• Japan.  As in the previous Tealbook, we estimate real GDP growth edged  up to 
1 percent in the third quarter as the economy recovered from the disruption s 
caused by an earthquake in April.  W ith the manufacturing PMI modestly  
expansionary, we expect growth to slow to ¾  percent in the fourth quarter and to 
remain near that pace over the next couple of years.  As noted earlier, the BOJ 
introduced a new policy framework at its September meeting.  As explained 
further in the box in this section of the Tealbook, our assessment is that this decision did not fundamentally alter  the prospective path  of monetary policy .  
We assume the BOJ will purchase assets and keep its policy rates at their current 
level s through the end of the forecast period.   Inflation is projected to increase 
from negative ½  percent in the third quarter to ½ percent in 2017, reflecting 
higher oil prices and a weaker yen, and to reach 1¼ percent by 2019.   Our 
outlooks for both growth a nd inflation are little changed.  
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
• China .  Real GDP g rowth edged down to 6 .8 percent in the third quarter , as we 
expected, after expanding at a 7 .1 percent rate in the second.  In the face of rapid  
credit growth and rising house pri ces, the authorities are increasingly focusing 
less on macroeconomic stimulus and more on address ing financial stability 
concerns .  These concerns , which  have been highlighted in recent speeches by 
senior Chinese officials , have led to  a coordinated in troduction of 
macroprudential policies to rein in credit and cool the housing market .  The drag 
from the external sector  has diminished in recent quarters, and we expect the 
depreciating RMB to support a positive contribution of net exports  in the near 
term.  All told , we maintain our September Tealbook forecast of growth 
continuing to moderate , in line with potential growth,  to 5½ percent by the end of 
2019.  Falling food prices pushed dow n inflation to an estimated 1.4 percent in the 
third quarter.  We ex pect inflation to rebound as food prices normalize , settling  at 
around 2½ percent by early next year.  
• Other Emerging Asia.  Growth in the region is estimated to have slowed to 
3 percent in the third quarter after rebounding to 3½ percent in the second.  This 
moderation partly reflect s some expected payback for outsized second -quarter

 growth  in Hong Kong.  Additionally, indicators for activity in the third quarter 
were weaker  than  expected, especially Singapore an GDP .  In Korea, a temporary 
labor strike and the ongoing corporate restructuring in  the shipping industry 
slow ed down growth in the third quarter .  All told, we expect the region’s growth 
to remain near 3  percent in the current quarter before edging up to a near -trend 
pace of 3½ percent by mid-2017.  Relative to the September Tealbook projection, 
this out look is down ½ percentage point in the near term and ¼  percentage point 
thereafter .  
• Mexico. We estimate that Mexican real GDP growth increased to  2¼ percent in 
the third quarter , in line with the reb ound in U.S. manufacturing production , from 
a disappointing ¾ percent decline in GDP in the second.  Exports picked up through August , and PMIs increased  through September.  Household demand also 
firmed in the three months ending in July amid rapid credit growth and improving labor market conditions .  We see growth  moving up to 2¾ percent by  the end of 
the forecast period, with the effects of the peso’s depreciation —which is  about 
30 percent lower in real effective term s since mid -2014—and energy -sector 
reforms  more than offsetting a substantial fiscal drag .  Headline inflation jumped 
to 3.8 percent in the third quarter from about 2 percent in the second, reflecting , in 
part, the pass -through from the peso depreciation and increases  in gasoline prices.  
In late September , the Bank of Mexico hiked its policy rate  50 basis points to 
4.75 percent, citing concerns that currency depreciation would fuel inflationary 
pressures.   
• Brazil.  Brazil’s recession appears to have deepened more than we expected, and 
we have increased the pace of contraction of real GDP in the third quarter  to 
2 percent .  Monthly GDP, i ndustrial production, and r etail sales all declined 
through August amid rising unemployment  and still- low consumer confidence.  
We now see the economy bottoming  out in the fourth quarter rather than in the 
third, with a slow recovery thereafter  led by rising investment on the back of 
improving business confidence .  However, tight fiscal and monetary policies will 
continue to weigh on activity.  The central bank l owered  its rate 25 basis points to 
14 percent amid signs that inflationary pressures are abating ; however, w e expect 
further policy rate cuts to be very gradual .  Headline inflation declined to 
8½ percent (on a 12 -month basis) in September from double -digit levels earlier 
this year  and should fall further to 4½ percent by 2019.

Financial Developments 
Domestic financial markets have been relatively calm since the September FOMC 
meeting.  U.S. economic data relea ses and Federal Reserve communications were 
generally interpreted as in line with market expectations, and foreign macroeconomic 
data continue to support expecta tions of modest growth.  Based on a straight read of 
market quotes, the implied probabil ity of an increase in the target range of the federal 
funds rate before the end of the year rose modestly to about 70  percent.  The nominal 
Treasury yield curve moved up a touch on net. 
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities edged  up, on net, by 
6, 8, and 7 basis points, respectively.  
 Five-year TIPS-based inflation c ompensation rose 24 basis point s, and the 
five-year, five-year-forward m easure moved up 16 basis points.  
 The federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of market quotes 
steepened slightly on balance. 
 Nonfinancial corporate bond spr eads narrowed a bit, and broad equity indexes 
were little changed amid mostly low option-implied volatility ( VIX).  
 Although broad U.S. equity price in dexes were about flat, forei gn equity 
indexes moved higher while the broad dollar appreciated ½ perce nt. 
 No market disruptions were obs erved around the October 14 compliance 
deadline for money market f und (MMF) reform, though flows out of prime 
funds and into government funds continued.  Prime funds’ weight ed-average 
maturity increased after the c ompliance day but remains low com pared with 
historical averages. 
 Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms and households rema ined 
accommodative on balance.  The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations 
showed signs of stabilization.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Domestic Developments 
Domestic U.S. economic data relea ses were generally interpreted  as in line with 
market expectations.  While the S eptember employment report was  reportedly slightly 
below expectations, it was generally not considered weak, and some other data releases 
during the period—in pa rticular, the September ISM surveys—were  viewed as above 
expectations.  Communications immediately following the Septemb er meeting, notably 
the Summary of Economic Projecti ons, were interpreted as slight ly more accommodative 
than expected, while later Feder al Reserve communications were seen as in line with 
expectations.   
The expected path of policy appeared to steepen slightly, on ne t, over the 
intermeeting period.  Based on a s traight read of market quotes , the implied probability of 
an increase in the target range  of the federal funds rate befor e the end of the year rose 
modestly to about 70 percent.  Res pondents to the Desk’s Novemb er surveys of primary 
dealers and market participan ts assigned a probability of about 60 percent to a rate hike 
by the end of this year.  The most  likely path of the target federal funds rate in 2017 and 
2018 was little changed for the me dian respondent relative to t he September survey.  
Both primary dealers and investor s generally do not expect a ra te hike to occur at the 
November meeting.  
Nominal Treasury yields have edge d up since the September FOMC meeting, 
with yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury securities rising 6 , 8, and 7 basis points, 
respectively.1  Yields declined early in the period following the September F OMC 
communications and amid concerns about Deutsche Bank, but they subsequently 
increased as markets calmed on dome stic economic news and the r elaxation of some of 
the Deutsche Bank concerns.   
Nominal yields were also pushe d up a bit by an increase in infl ation 
compensation.  Five-to-ten-year TI PS-based forward inflation compensation rose 16 basis 
points over the intermeeting period and has now moved up about 28 basis points from its 
low immediately following the U nited Kingdom’s Brexit vote in J une.  Measures of 
                                                 
1 Since the September FOMC meeting, the Treasury has auctioned $ 170 billion of Treasury 
nominal fixed-rate securities, $ 16 billion of Treasury Inflatio n-Protected Securities, and $13 billion of 
2-year Floating Rate Notes.

  inflation compensation based on i nflation swaps increased by similar amounts.  The 
recent increase in far-forward i nflation compensation appears attributable to a 
combination of factors, including the recent rise in oil prices  and a decline in investors’ 
concerns about the risk of very low inflation outcomes, as implied by quotes on inflation 
caps and floors. 
The S&P 500 stock price index was  little changed, on net, since  the September 
FOMC meeting.  Energy was among the best-performing sectors ove r the period, 
consistent with rising oil pri ces.  Stock prices of sectors tha t benefit from low interest 
rates, such as real estate and utilities, underperformed the broader market.  Realized and implied volatilities in equity mar kets remained relatively low.  
Over the intermeeting period, s preads of yields on nonfinancial investment- and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds  over those of comparable-matu rity Treasury securities 
declined a bit, with both spr eads now standing around their med ian levels during 
economic expansions over the past two decades.  The narrowing i n credit spreads mainly 
reflected tightening in spreads for bonds issued by firms in the energy sector. 
Foreign Developments 
Since the September FOMC meetin g, foreign macroeconomic data ca me in 
generally in line with market expectations.  Foreign equity ind exes moved moderately 
higher, while credit spreads we re little changed.  That said, m arkets were occasionally 
affected by news about the upcomin g negotiations between the Un ited Kingdom and the 
EU surrounding the U.K. exit a nd by continued concerns about th e European banking 
sector, particularly Deutsch e Bank.  Although market sentiment toward the European 
banks improved over the period, s ignificant risks remain.  
In the United Kingdom, the pound d epreciated by roughly 6 perce nt, and 10-year 
gilt yields increased along with inflation compensation.  These  moves were driven by 
indications that a tougher negotia ting stance would be taken by  British and European 
officials, increasing the odds  of a U.K.–EU deal with much less  economic integration 
than at present, a so-called har d Brexit; the rise in yields ma y also have reflected Prime 
Minister May’s remarks on the sid e effects of quantitative easi ng and the greater 
possibility of near-term U.K . fiscal expansion.  In the other a dvanced foreign economies 
(AFEs), interest rates were l ittle changed, on net, having decl ined early in the period 
following the FOMC meeting but la ter recovering as rising oil prices boosted the

  inflation outlook.  The ECB left its  policy rates unchanged at its October meeting but 
acknowledged that an abrupt end to asset purchases is unlikely,  and it signaled that 
further changes to the asset  purchase program could be announce d at its December 
meeting.  At its September 21 meeting, the Bank of Japan announ ced that it would seek 
to stabilize the 10-year yiel d around zero percen t, and that it  would seek to conduct 
policy so as to push inflation above the 2 percent inflation ta rget.  Japanese sovereign 
yields were little change d, on net, but measures of implied volatility for longer-term 
interest rates declined.  
In addition to the sharp move a gainst the pound, the dollar als o appreciated by 
2 to 3 percent against most other AFE currencies.  Although the se moves were in line 
with a relative increase in U .S. policy expectations, the magni tude of the change in 
exchange rates was somewhat outsized.  In contrast, the dollar fell against many 
commodity currencies, including the Mexican peso and Russian ruble.  On balance, the 
broad index of the dollar rose  ½ percent over the period. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS , FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS , AND 
BANKING -SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS  
The compliance deadline for the recent MMF reforms was October 14.2  In the 
weeks leading up to the deadline, institutional prime MMFs cont inued to experience 
significant outflows, while government MMFs attracted similarly  sized inflows.  
However, these flows slowed significantly in the days just prio r to the compliance day 
and have since remained subdued (see the box “The Effect of Mon ey Market Fund 
Reform over the Past Year” for a longer-term retrospective).  
 The outflows from institutional prime funds continued, on bala nce, to lead to 
lower overall outstanding amounts of commercial paper, negotiab le certificates of 
deposit, and large time deposits ov erall during the intermeeting period.  While 
government funds appear to be the largest recipients of the out flows from prime funds, 
core deposits at banks also increased.    
Measures of the liquidity of institutional prime funds, which h ad increased 
substantially ahead of the comp liance deadline, have since decl ined.  In particular, the 
                                                 
2 The reform is intended to red uce money funds’ susceptibility t o destabilizing runs by requiring 
institutional prime funds and tax-exempt funds to trade shares at floating net asset values and by allowing 
nongovernment funds to impose liquidity and redemption fees.

 The Effect of Money Market Fund Reform over the Past Year 
As a direct result of recent money market fund (MMF) reforms, the MMF industry 
has seen a transfer of more than $1 trillion from prime funds to government 
funds and other entities over the past year, while total MMF assets under 
management (AUM) have declined only slightly.1  Overall, the transition has been 
smooth with no market stresses, as market participants were able to efficiently 
absorb the flow of cash.   This analysis provides additional details regarding 
changes in MMF holdings.   It also discusses related changes in the funding costs 
and structure of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks (FBOs) over the 
past year. 
Prime funds responded to the significant decline in their AUM by reducing 
holdings of all major asset classes .  As shown in figure 1, negotiable certificates of 
deposit (CDs) and unsecured commercial paper (CP) fell $340 billion and 
$212 billion, respectively, over the past year.  These reductions were coincident 
with a rise in rates on CD and CP with maturities over 30 days. 
Prime funds also substantially reduced their lending in the Eurodollar market 
(included in the “ other instruments ” category  in figure 1) .  Figure 2 highlights 
that FBOs are the main borrowers of Eurodollars from prime funds; their 
borrowing dropped $120 billion, as MMFs reduced their supply in the Eurodollar 
market compared with a year ago.2  Over this period , rates in the Eurodollar 
market have crept up marginally. 
Government funds responded to the significant increase in their AUM by 
expanding holdings of all eligible assets , as shown in figure 3 .  In particular, their 
holdings of agency debt have more than doubled, and holdings of Treasury bills 
have risen $274 billion.  Still, rates on these instruments have traded at their usual 
spreads to the IOER (interest on excess reserves) rate, as Treasury bill issuance 
has increased significantly .  Government fund holdings of agency repos and 
Treasury repos are also higher.  Finally, in recent weeks, daily take- up by 
government funds at the ON RRP (overnight reverse repurchase agreement 
facility) has been moderately elevated compared with typical 2016 levels , 
perhaps reflecting the large inflow of cash that has not yet been invested in 
higher-yielding money market instruments.   
                                                 
1 Detailed MMF data are through September 30, 2016, as the data are only available with a 
monthly lag.  Prime funds saw an additional $288 billion of outflows through October 14, 2016. 
2 As lending by non-MMF entities remained steady in both the Eurodollar and federal 
funds markets, this observation suggests that the reduced volumes in the Eurodollar market 
were the result of less supply from prime funds rather than less demand from FBOs.   Lenders 
in the federal funds market are primarily federal home loan banks that were not affected by 
the MMF reform.  Thus, there was no supply shock in this market.

 Collectively, FBOs experienced significant shifts in funding costs and liabilities as 
a result of MMF reform.  Higher longer-term CD and financial CP rates increased 
FBO funding costs.  In addition, outstanding large time deposits at FBOs 
decreased $172 billion and financial CP issuance slowed considerably .  And, as 
mentioned previously , FBOs borrowed fewer funds in the Eurodollar market.  
Reflecting, in part, these contractions in liabilities, FBO reserve balances dropped 
roughly $360 billion over the past year (figure 4).3   
 
                                                 
3 Over the same period, domestic banks’ outstanding large time deposits, borrowing in 
unsecured overnight money markets, and reserve balances were little changed.

  weighted-average maturity of pr ime fund assets jumped from a lo w of 11 days prior to 
October 14 to 25 days, although this level remains below its av erage of about 40 days in 
recent years.  As a share of prime funds’ total assets, liquid assets also moved notably 
lower.  The average net yield f or such funds has risen sharply,  driven in part by lower 
account fees and the reduce d liquidity levels.   
Looking more broadly at money mark ets, the effective federal fu nds rate and 
Eurodollar rate continued to average about 40 basis points over  the intermeeting period, 
while the overnight triparty re po rate for Treas ury collateral stayed above the ON RRP 
offer rate of 25 basis points.  Four-week Treasury bill yields declined to a low of 9 basis 
points, likely a result of the inflows to government funds that  sought to invest additional 
cash in shorter-term Treasury securities.  More recently, however, the four-week bill 
yield has returned to levels mor e in line with other money mark et interest rates. 
Some of the rise in the total  assets of government funds over t he intermeeting 
period appeared to contribute t o a moderately elevated ON RRP t ake-up of about 
$177 billion, on average, excluding September quarter-end.3  Take-up reached 
$413 billion on quarter-end and fell a bit more slowly than after previous quarter-ends.  
Eurodollar volumes fell substant ially in the weeks preceding the MMF reform 
compliance deadline and have rem ained at this lower level as pr ime money funds pulled 
back from lending in this market.  D espite these volume changes , there has been little 
effect on overnight money market rates, though three-month LIBO R–OIS spreads 
remained elevated.

  to the October SLOOS indicate d that, on net, standards and dema nd for C&I loans 
remained unchanged in the third quarter.   
Equity issuance was robust in S eptember, with mature corporatio ns issuing equity 
through seasoned offerings at a somewhat faster pace than that observed over the past 
few years and issuance through i nitial public offerings picking  up from August’s low 
level.   
About 25 percent of firms in the  S&P 500 index have reported th ird-quarter 
earnings.  Based on these reports and estimates implied from Wa ll Street analyst forecasts 
for the rest of the firms in t he index, earnings per share appe ar to have continued to 
rebound in the third quarter and ar e now projected to come in a bit higher than year-
earlier levels.  The rebound in earnings appears to reflect imp rovements across a wide 
range of industries, including t he energy sector.  Year-ahead e arnings projections by Wall 
Street analysts for S&P 500 compa nies were revised little, on b alance, over the 
intermeeting period.  
The credit quality of nonfinanci al corporations, which had dete riorated some over 
the past few quarters, showed s igns of stabilization.  The volu me of corporate bond 
upgrades was only slightly outpace d by that of downgrades in Se ptember.  Both the six-
month trailing bond default rate and  the KMV expected year-ahead default measure 
edged down, although they remained e levated compared with their ranges in recent years.   
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also remained accom modative, and 
gross issuance of municipal  bonds was brisk.  Yields on general obligation bonds edged 
up, on balance, leaving their ratios to comparable-maturity Tre asury securities somewhat 
higher than their levels at the t ime of the September FOMC meet ing.  There were no 
signs of deteriorations in the credit quality of state and local governments.   
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) also rema ined largely 
accommodative but have shown some signs of tightening.  CMBS is suance in the third 
quarter picked up relative to its  pace in the first half of the  year, and spreads on CMBS 
were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Growth in CR E loans on banks’ books 
continued to be strong in the thi rd quarter.  However, signific ant numbers of banks again 
reported in the October SLOOS t hat they had tightened lending s tandards on CRE loans 
(see the box “Banks’ Commercial Real Estate Lending Standards a nd Loan Growth” for a 
discussion of this trend).

 Banks’ Commercial Real Estate Lending Standards and Loan Growth 
Commercial banks indicated in  the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices (SLOOS)  that they had tightened their lending standards across all major 
categories of commercial real estate (CRE) loans during the third quarter on net (black line in 
figure 1).  This quarter is the fourth consecutive  one in which survey respondents have 
indicated a tightening of their CRE lending standards following several years of reported  
easing.  At the same  time , growth of banks’ CRE loan s has continued at a robust pace 
(figure 2).   Here we examine the question of  whether the recent tightening of banks’ CRE 
lend ing standards will eventually translate to lower aggregate CRE loan growth  at banks .  
The answer depends importantly on two factors:  the evolution of the demand for CRE loans 
(as measured by the red line in figure 1) a nd the size of the banks that engaged in tightening 
their CRE lending standards.   
First, w e find  in both aggregate and bank -level regressions that banks’ assessments of their 
lending standards and loan demand, as  reported in the SLOOS , are each  significant 
predictors of future loan gr owth .1  While the third -quarter SLOOS results  displayed in figure 1 
sugge st that demand for CRE loans remained unchanged  and that banks, on net, tightened 
their CRE lending standards, we should expect, based on the statistical relationships  among 
these dat a series , to see continued CRE loan growth  at banks  over the next several quarters.   
Second,  we consider how bank size may affect  a translation from survey -based  tighten ing of 
CRE lending standards to lower aggregate CRE loan grow th.  Unlike commercial and 
industrial lending , in which  the majority of loans that are made and held on banks’ balance 
sheets are held by large banks, the majority of CRE loans that are made and held  directly  
                                                 
1 In particular, lagged net tightening and net demand SLOOS measures partially explain aggregate 
movements in outstanding loans at banks.  Bank -level regressions show that individual banks’ responses to 
standards and demand questions in the SLOOS are also p redictive of growth in CRE loan originations.

 on banks’ balance sheets  are held by smaller banks  (defined as those outside the top 25 
domestic banks by total assets ).  In addition, while the SLOOS surveys up to 80 domestic 
commercial banks each quarter, l arge banks are disproportionately represented in the 
survey panel.2  Thus, the net tightening in CRE lending standards observed in the SLOOS 
panel of banks may be more reflective of changes in standards at large banks than at smaller 
banks.   In this case , the growth in banks’ aggregate CRE loans may not slow as quickly in the 
wake of a tightening in CRE lending s tandards —as reported in the SLOOS —as  the growth in  
large banks’ CRE loan s. 
Indeed, as shown in the table below, thus far in 2016, large banks  have  disproportionately  
reported tightening  their CRE lending standards  on all three major categories of CRE loans  
relative to small banks , on average, and have  also  reportedly  experienced relatively weaker 
demand for such loans.  Two  interesting question s, which we do not explore here, are the 
following:  (1)  What factors caused large banks to disproportionately tighten  CRE lending 
standards  relative to smaller banks  so far in  2016 ? and (2) W hat factors  are continuing to 
drive stronger loan demand at smaller banks ?   
The reportedly  more widespread tightening in CRE lending standards  at large banks in 2016  
has, in fact,  been accompanied by a gradual slowing in loan growth at such  banks over this 
same period, as can be seen by the blue portion of the bars in figure 2.  In contrast, CRE loan 
growth at smaller banks, as measured by the red portion of the bars in figure 2, has 
remained brisk.   
In sum , the reported tightening of CRE lending standards by banks in the SLOOS over the 
past several quarters and the continued strong aggregate growth in CRE loans at banks  are 
consistent with continued reports of strengthening demand for CRE loans at  smaller banks  
and lower net fractions of small banks reporting t ightening  of their CRE lending standards  
compared with large banks  so far this year.   
                                                 
2 The SLOOS panel was recently expanded to include many additional smaller institutions in order to 
improve the survey’s coverage of such institutions.  Nonetheless, the survey is predominantly focused on 
large institutions.

Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little cha nged and 
remained accommodative on balance.  Consumer loan balances incr eased at a year-over-
year rate of about 6.7 percent th rough August, reflecting stead y growth in both revolving 
and nonrevolving consumer credit.  However, credit card lending  standards remained 
tight for subprime consumers .  Indeed, respondents to the Octob er SLOOS indicated that 
they became less likely over the past quarter to approve credit  cards for borrowers with 
below-prime credit scores.  In contrast, auto credit remained b roadly available to 
subprime consumers.      
Consumer credit quality has lar gely been stable.  Delinquencies  of credit card 
loans in securitized pools cha nged little in August and remaine d near historical lows.  
Auto loan delinquencie s have crept upward.    
ABS spreads for credit card and auto loans, which have been nar rowing off and 
on since late March, were littl e changed, on balance, in recent  weeks.  ABS issuance 
picked up somewhat in the third qua rter from the levels seen ea rlier this year.  
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were li ttle changed over 
the intermeeting period and remained accommodative.  Interest r ates on 30-year fixed 
mortgages edged up but remained a t a low level of about 3.3 percent.  Several large banks 
indicated in the October SLOOS that lending standards on GSE-el igible home-purchase 
loans continue to ease, though standards on most other types of  home-purchase loans 
reportedly remained unchanged on ne t.  Spurred by mortgage rates that were at the lower 
end of their range over the past  few years, refinancing activit y climbed in August and 
inched up further in September, reaching its highest level sinc e 2013.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as broa dly in line with the average o ver the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  We ha ve maintained our assumption  that the risks to our 
GDP projection are tilted to the downside, importantly because both monetary and fiscal 
policy appear to be better positio ned to offset large positive shocks than substantial 
adverse ones.  Foreign developments and prospects also pose downside risks to the U.S. 
economy.  For example, the Chinese economy continues to face th e possibility of a hard 
landing, many corporations in emerging market economies (EMEs) are highly leveraged 
and sensitive to global financial conditions, and Europe remain s rife with political and 
economic risk.  Moreover, in the event of an economic downturn,  foreign authorities 
would likely face similar constraints in providing policy stimu lus as in the United States.  
We view the risks around our unemp loyment rate projection as aligned with those for 
GDP and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.   
With regard to inflation, we do not  view the current level of u ncertainty as 
unusually high.  We see importa nt risks to inflation on both the upside and the downside, 
and we view those risks as roughly balanced—a change from previous Tealbooks, when we viewed the risks as weighte d somewhat to the downside.  Some  survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are near histori cally low levels, and the 
realization of the downside risk s to economies abroad could put upward pressure on the 
foreign exchange value of the dollar, thereby depressing U.S. i mport prices and inflation.  
However, this year’s inflation da ta have been somewhat firmer than we had expected, 
suggesting that upside risks may be greater than we had previou sly thought.  One such 
risk is the possibility that , with the economy projected to be operating above its long-run 
potential, inflation may increas e more than the staff expects, consistent with the 
predictions of models that empha size nonlinear effects of econo mic slack on inflation.  
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveilla nce assessment, whic h judges the vulnerabilities in the U.S. 
financial system as moderate.  This assessment reflects strong capital and liquidity 
buffers at U.S. banks and, according to the somewhat limited av ailable data, moderate 
leverage at nonbank financial i nstitutions.  Additionally, the recent implementation of

 money m arket fund reform has reduc ed the risk of investor runs on such funds.  Although 
leverage in the corporate sect or is elevated, the pace of borro wing by the private 
nonfinancial sector as a whole re mains moderate.  Notably, borr owing by households 
remains far below levels experi enced late in the  previous decade.  Valuations across a 
range of asset markets appear moderate, albeit only when evalua ted relative to Treasury 
yields.  As a result, the possibi lity that long-term interest r ates could rise more rapidly 
than expected poses a downside r isk to prices of a wide range o f risky assets.  Finally, the 
European banking sector remains weak, and an intensification of  strains, particularly at a 
large institution, coul d lead to disruptions and a tightening in financial conditions abroad 
with significant implications  for the U.S. economic outlook. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct se veral alternatives to 
the baseline projection using sim ulations of staff models.  The  first two scenarios explore 
possible risks to the forecast fr om a tight labor market.  In the first scenario, running the 
economy “hot” for a while leads to persistent positive effects on the productive capacity 
of the economy.  By contrast, in the second scenario, the tight  labor market results in 
inflation notably above the FOMC’ s 2 percent objective.  The th ird scenario illustrates 
the effects of a more positive outlook for consumer confidence and household spending 
than in the baseline.  In the f ourth scenario, aggregate demand  is persistently weaker, 
consistent with a substantially lower long-run equilibrium real  interest rate.  The fifth 
scenario considers the effect  of a banking crisis in Europe, an d the sixth and final 
scenario analyzes the case where U.S. policy normalization lead s to a much stronger 
appreciation of the dollar and financial turbulence in the EMEs . 
The first, second, and fourth scenarios are simulated in the FR B/US model, while 
the third scenario uses the EDO model.  The fifth and sixth sce narios are run in the 
multicountry SIGMA model.  In all of  the scenarios, the federal  funds rate is governed by 
the same inertial policy rule as  in the baseline, including the  adjustments to the intercept 
in the near term.  In all cases, we assume that the size and co mposition of the SOMA 
portfolio follow th e baseline paths. 
Positive Hysteresis 
In the staff baseline projection, the unemployment rate remains  below its assumed 
natural rate of 5 percent for a  number of years.  This extended  period of labor market

 tightness m ay have persistent pos itive effects on the productiv e capacity of the 
economy—a phenomenon referred to a s “positive hysteresis.”  In this scenario, we 
assume that by running the economy hot for a while, exits from the labor force are held 
down and additional workers are drawn into the labor force, res ulting in an increase in the 
trend labor force participation rate that accumulates to 1 perc entage point above the 
baseline by the end of 2021.  Furthermore, we assume that the e xperience workers gain 
through greater employment reduces the natural rate of unemployment ½ percentage 
point below the base line by the end of 2021.1   
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ½ percentage point more 
per year over the projection peri od than in the baseline.  This  additional room to grow 
allows real GDP to also increas e about ½ percentage point per y ear more than in the 
baseline.  As a result, the out put gap is about unchanged.  The unemployment rate 
follows a lower trajectory and is almost ½ percentage point bel ow the baseline by 2021.  
With inflation and the output gap roughly at the baseline, the federal funds rate is little 
changed.2 
Higher Labor Costs 
In the Tealbook projection, the extended period of undershootin g of the natural 
rate of unemployment is not projected to result in  substantial inflationary pressure, 
consistent with the subdued res ponse of prices to economic activity seen in rec ent years.  
However, it is possible that inflation will rise more than we h ave assumed in the baseline, 
which could happen if wages prove more sensitive to a tight lab or market than to a slack 
market.  Furthermore, the projecte d improvements in the labor m arket might be 
accompanied by continued weak productivity growth if those workers who find jobs in a 
hot labor market are relatively  less productive than those who find jobs in more normal 
conditions.  
This scenario considers the possi bility that labor costs grow a t a faster rate than in 
the baseline as labor market c onditions tighten further in the medium term.  In particular, 
                                                 
1 We modeled this alternative scen ario by augmenting the usual s pecifications in FRB/US for the 
natural rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-
generating components. 
2 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly abou t the improvement in potential 
output, the federal funds rate w ould follow a steeper trajector y than shown in this scenario, reaching almost 
3¾ percent at the end of 2021.  In that case, real  GDP growth would be ¼ percentage point lower, on 
average, between 2019 a nd 2021 than in this scenario, with the unemployment rate ¼ percentage point 
above this scenario at the end  of 2021.  Inflation would still remain close to the baseline.

 we assum e that hourly labor compensation rises ½ percentage poi nt per year faster during 
the projection period.  We also a ssume that the pickup in labor  productivity growth 
projected by the staff betw een 2017 and 2018 is not realized, a nd growth remains at the 
same subdued pace seen in recent years.   
In the FRB/US model, the resulti ng higher labor costs pass through to prices, and 
PCE price inflation reaches 2.6 percent by 2021.  Real GDP rise s about 1½ percent, on 
average, from 2017 through 2019, com pared with 2 percent in the baseline projection, 
because of the weaker path of labor productivity.  As a result of higher inflation, the 
federal funds rate rises more steeply, reaching 3¾ percent at t he end of 2021.  The 
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher than the baselin e, on average, between 
2019 and 2021.     
Brighter Expectations 
Although many indicators of inve stment and production have rece ntly been weak, 
the labor market has continued t o improve.  Moreover, consumer confidence has 
remained upbeat, and there are signs of wage acceleration, whic h could support 
households’ income expectations and further boost consumer conf idence.   
In this scenario, we assume tha t these conditions lead to a fur ther improvement in 
the sentiment of firms and households, boosting consumer spendi ng growth and spurring 
additional business investment.3  As a result, real GDP r ises 2¾ percent per year, on 
average, in 2017 and 2018, compared with 2 percent in the baseline projection.  The 
unemployment rate falls steep ly, bottoming out at a touch above  3¾ percent by the end of 
2018; it then edges up over the remainder of the forecast perio d but stays lower than in 
the baseline.  With resource  utilization running tight, inflati on is a little higher than in the 
baseline, reaching 2 percent by t he end of 2019.  The federal f unds rate rises more 
steeply, reaching 4 percen t at the beginning of 2020. 
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate 
Aggregate demand has been weak du ring the recent recovery, refl ecting both 
domestic and global factors.  In t he baseline, these factors ar e expected to dissipate, 
causing the equilibrium real fed eral funds rate to rise over ti me.  However, some 
observers have argued that the factors depressing demand are es sentially permanent.  
                                                 
3 We generate this scenario by applying a one standard deviation  positive shock to the model’s 
main driver of aggregate demand, spread over the first three qu arters of 2017.

 Accordingly, this scenario assu mes persistently weaker domestic aggregate demand over 
the next decade than in the base line, consistent with a long-ru n equilibrium real federal 
funds rate of zero.4  We assume that policymakers  only gradually recognize the lowe r 
trajectory of the equilibrium int erest rate over the projection  period.  
In the longer run, monetary policy fully responds to the lower equilibrium real 
federal funds rate.  By 2021, the f ederal funds rate is almost 1 percentage point lower 
than in the baseline and the unemp loyment rate has nearly retur ned to the baseline.  In the 
short run, however, the federal funds rate does not fall enough  to fully offset the weaker 
aggregate demand both because the policy rule is very inertial and because policymakers 
are assumed to recognize the lower long-run equilibrium interes t rate only gradually.  As 
a result, output expands more slow ly than in the baseline, and the path for the 
unemployment rate is slightly hi gher.  Real GDP growth through 2017 and 2018 is 
¼ percentage point lower than in t he baseline projection; the u nemployment rate is about 
¼ percentage point higher in 2017 and 2018.  With resource util ization only slightly 
weaker, inflation remains close to the baseline.5  
Banking Crisis in Europe 
Europe’s banking sector has many underlying vulnerabilities, in cluding tepid 
earnings prospects, weak capit al positions, and a high level of  nonperforming loans.  
Accordingly, we think there is so me chance that a major Europea n bank will experience a 
severe deterioration in its liquidity and capital conditions, r equiring the bank to be 
resolved and restructured.  A lthough it is possible that this s cenario could have relatively 
muted spillovers, the resoluti on of a systemically important Eu ropean bank could 
precipitate a loss in confidence in Europe’s banking system more generally and in the 
authorities’ abilities to address these problems.  In this scen ario, we consider the 
possibility that a resolution of a major European bank leads to a banking crisis that 
produces sizable adverse financial spillovers to both the United States and the rest of the world.  
                                                 
4 This very low level of the long-run equilibrium real federal f unds rate is consistent with the 
estimates in Thomas Laubach and  John C. Williams (2016), “Measu ring the Natural R ate of Interest 
Redux,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-011 (Washi ngton:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, February), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.011 . 
5 If we instead assumed that policymakers immediately recognized  the lower long-run equilibrium 
federal funds rate, the federal funds rate would be almost ¼ pe rcentage point lower and real GDP growth 
almost a tenth higher, on average, per year  relative to this scenario over the projection period; the 
unemployment rate would return to the baseline by the end of 20 21.

 Specifically, this scenario assumes that financial conditions i n Europe tighten 
significantly and that household a nd business confidence declin e amid rising 
unemployment and heightened disinflationary pressures.  European corporate borrowing 
spreads rise over 100 basis poi nts, and household borrowing spr eads also rise noticeably.  
With little scope for the ECB to reduce long-term sovereign yie lds, Europe falls into a 
recession, with GDP bottoming out a t about 4 percent below the baseline by the end of 
2018.  The crisis has adverse spil lovers to the United States:  U.S. corporate bond spreads 
rise about 50 basis points, while  flight-to-safety flows cause the trade-weighted dollar to 
appreciate 5 percent.  Financial  conditions tighten even more in the EMEs, and their 
currencies depreciate substantially. 
Weaker foreign activity and the s tronger dollar cause U.S. real  net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  U.S . domestic demand also declines relative to the baseline as a 
result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions.  All told, U.S. real GDP only 
grows about 1½ percent in 2017 a nd 2018.  The U.S. unemployment  rate runs at about 
5 percent in 2017 and 2018, ½ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Lower resource utilization and falling im port prices reduce U.S. core  inflation to slightly above 
1 percent by 2017.  The federal funds  rate follows a shallower path, reaching only 
1½ percent at the end of 2018, compa red with about 2½ percent i n the baseline. 
Stronger Dollar and EME Turbulence 
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate abo ut 5 percent over the 
forecast period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster  than markets currently 
appear to expect.  However, ongoing U.S. policy normalization c ould well cause a much 
larger and more persistent appr eciation of the dollar, especial ly if higher U.S. interest 
rates generate financial turbul ence in vulnerable EMEs.  In thi s scenario, we assume that 
the broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by t he end of next year above its 
baseline path and that EME corpor ate borrowing spreads rise sub stantially—about 
100 basis points—in the face of persistent capital outflows fro m EMEs.6  All told, foreign 
GDP growth runs about ¾ percentage  point below the baseline in 2017, notwithstanding 
the sizable depreciation of foreign currencies. 
The stronger dollar and weaker  foreign growth depress U.S. real  net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP grow th moderates to 1½ percent in 2 017, about 
                                                 
6 The increase in EME corporate sp reads is similar to what happe ned to those spreads following 
the “taper tantrum” in the spring of 2013.

 ¾ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Lower import prices and weaker economic 
activity cause core PCE price inflation to be only slightly abo ve 1 percent in 2017.  The 
federal funds rate follows a sh allower path than in the baselin e, moving up to about 
1½ percent by the end of 2018, 1 percen tage point less than in the baseline.

Appendix  
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors ”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food away from home ” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further 
back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is  not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead.  
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
