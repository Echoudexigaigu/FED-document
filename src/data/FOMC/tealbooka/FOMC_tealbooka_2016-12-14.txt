Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming data indicate that the economy is expanding at a moderate rate.  Real 
GDP growth appears to have picked up from its weak first-half pace, as the drag from 
inventory investment has ended a nd growth in private domestic f inal purchases (PDFP) 
has remained solid.  The estimat ed rate of GDP g rowth in the se cond half—at an annual 
rate of 2½ percent—is a bit higher  than in the October Tealbook , mainly reflecting 
somewhat stronger incoming data on consumer spending, residenti al investment, and net 
exports.  Meanwhile, labor market conditions have tightened fur ther:  Payrolls have 
continued to post solid gains, and the unemployment rate is estimated to have fallen to 
4.6 percent in November.  Overall, we now view the economy as o perating a touch above 
its sustainable level , a slightly stronger assessment than in the previous Tealbook.  
Over the medium term, the main change to the forecast stems fro m our 
assumptions about fiscal policy.  W hile there is substantial un certainty about the size and 
composition of any potential fiscal changes that may be enacted  in coming years, in our 
view the modal outlook for fiscal  policy has shifted toward a more expansionary stance.  
As a placeholder pending further details, the forecast assumes a persistent cut in personal 
income taxes equivalent to 1 perc ent of GDP beginning in the third quarter of 2017.  The 
assumed fiscal stimulus is pa rtially offset by the reaction of financial markets and 
monetary policy to that stimulus, resulting in a net boost to t he level of real GDP of about 
½ percent at the end of 2019.  The R isks and Uncertainty sectio n illustrates the 
consequences of either no additi onal fiscal stimulus or of a la rger fiscal package with a 
different composition than we have assumed in the baseline.   
Turning to the trajectory for the economy over the medium term,  we continue to 
project real GDP to increase  2¼ percent in 2017, with solid gai ns in consumer spending 
and a pickup in business invest ment.  Growth then slows to 2 percent in 2018 and 
1¾ percent in 2019 as monetary poli cy continues to tighten.  Wi th GDP growing faster 
than potential over most of the medium term, the output gap wid ens to 1½ percent at the 
end of 2019, an upward revision of nearly ½ percentage point re lative to the October 
Tealbook.  Correspondingly, the unempl oyment rate is projected to fall to 4.2 percent by 
2019—about ¾ percentage point below our  estimate of its natural  rate and ¼ percentage 
point lower than in October—and the labor force participation rate is projected to decline 
somewhat more slowly than its trend.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is the same as the median projection 
from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus 
forecast in 2016 and in 2017.  The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is equal to 
the forecast s of the SPF and Blue Chip in 2016 and lower in 2017. The s taff’s projection 
for CPI inflation is slightly above the other forecasts in 2016 and at or above them at 
longer horizons.  The staff’s projection s for core and total PCE inflation are similar to 
the SPF forecast s in 2016 but lower than the SPF in 2017 and 2018.

Revisions  to the Staff  Projection  since  the Previous  SEP
The  FOMC  most  recently  published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections,  or SEP,  following  
the September  FOMC  meeting.  The  table  below  compares  the staff's  current  economic  
projection  with  the one  we presented  in the September  Tealbook.
We have  strengthened  the projection  this round  by about  the same  amount  as we weakened  
it in the October  Tealbook,  and,  on net,  the projection  is little  changed  from  September.  
GDP  growth  is about  the same,  and  the unemployment  rate  still  reaches  4.2 percent  at the 
end  of 2019.
PCE  inflation  (both  total  and  core)  has come  in higher  in the second  half  of this  year  than  we 
anticipated  in September,  and  we have  carried  forward  a bit of that  surprise  into  the 
projection  for next  year. But the inflation  forecast  is otherwise  unrevised,  and  we continue  
to project  that  PCE  inflation  will move  up and  reach  1.9 percent  by 2019.
We have  raised  our  assumed  longer-run  value  of the real  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  to 
1.0 percent  in this  forecast,  up from  0.75  percent  in the September  Tealbook.  But  with  the 
outlook  little  changed  and  this  higher  equilibrium  rate  phased  in gradually,  the  funds  rate  
path  from  the intercept-adjusted  inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule  that  we use  in our baseline  
forecast  is about  the same  as in September  through  most  of the projection  period.

Given how flat the Phillips cur ve appears to be and our judgmen t that inflation 
expectations will remain well anchored, we have barely revised our forecast for inflation 
from the October Tealbook despit e the modestly stronger economic outlook.  We 
continue to project that both tot al and core PCE price inflatio n will move up gradually to 
1.9 percent in 2019, as the effects  of earlier energy and impor t price declines fade and 
resource utilization continues to tighten.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 Considerable uncertainty prevai ls about the size, timing, and composition of 
any potential fiscal policy changes that may be enacted in coming years.  
Nonetheless, relativ e to our October proj ection, we have assume d an increase 
in annual federal “primary” budget deficits (that is, the defic it excluding 
interest costs) of 1 percent of  GDP.  For now, we have assumed this fiscal 
expansion takes the form of a cut in personal income taxes that  commences in 
the third quarter of 2017.1 
 The tax cut is estimated to have essentially no effect on potential output, but it 
boosts aggregate demand and hence would raise the growth rate o f real GDP 
roughly ¼ percentage point per year in each of 2017, 2018, and 2019 absent 
any multiplier effects and offsets from higher interest rates and the dollar.  We 
now project that discretionary pol icy actions at all levels of government, 
including the aforementioned tax cut, will provide a partial-eq uilibrium boost 
to real GDP growth of ½ percenta ge point in 2017 and more than 
¼ percentage point in both 2018 and 2019.2 
Monetary Policy 
 In the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use to mechanically set the federal 
funds rate in our projection, we in creased the real long-run eq uilibrium federal 
funds rate from ¾ percent to 1 perc ent in response to the persi stent fiscal 
1 A decrease in personal taxes serves as a useful placeholder pa rtly because some plausible policy 
actions (such as an increase in government purchases) would lik ely have larger effects on GDP growth, 
while other plausible actions (su ch as corporate tax cuts) woul d likely have smaller effects. 
2 Aside from the tax cut, we have built in no additional changes  to our policy assumptions in this 
projection.

policy changes.3  The path of the rule’s time-va rying intercept converges to 
this new real long-run equilibrium value by the end of 2019.4 
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule calls for the federal funds rat e to increase a 
little less than 1 per centage point per year  over the projectio n period and to 
average 3.3 percent in the  fourth quarter of 2019, about 30 basis points higher 
than in the October Tealbook.5 
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at it s current 
level until the third quart er of 2017 and then begin to contrac t, as the proceeds 
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is re vised markedly higher in this p rojection, 
reflecting the upward revisions t o the projected path of future  short-term 
interest rates over the valuation window as well as higher proj ected term 
premiums.  We project the 10-year  Treasury yield to rise signif icantly over the 
medium term, reaching 3.9 percent by the end of 2019—about 70 b asis points 
higher than in the October projection. 
 We have revised up the projected pa ths for the triple-B corpora te bond yields 
and 30-year fixed mortgage rates  by about as much as those of T reasury 
securities.  
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Since the previous Tealbook, broad equity indexes have increased about 
4 percent.  As a result, we  nudged up the path of stock prices over the 
3 The fiscal assumptions influen ce the long-run equilibrium fede ral funds rate because the policy 
changes are persistent and boost demand in the longer run.  We assume that the dual mandate is achieved in 
the long run via a combination of a higher real federal funds r ate and a rise in term premiums.  The 
magnitude of the assumed overall increase in the 10-year Treasu ry rate is broadly consistent with the 
empirical evidence regarding the effects of increased governmen t debt on interest rates and is in line with 
simulations of the revised fisc al assumptions conducted using the FRB/US model.  The decomposition of 
the overall increment to the 10- year rate into its funds rate a nd term premium components is highly 
uncertain. 
4 One argument for phasing in the adjustment to the long-run equ ilibrium rate rather than 
assuming that it prevails immediately is that the boost to cons umer spending is likewise assumed to phase 
in over three years. 
5 Compared with its prescription for the October Tealbook, a non -inertial rule would have revised 
up about 65 basis points at the end of 2019.

projection period.  At the end of the medium term, equity price s are projected 
to be 1 percent higher relati ve to the October Tealbook. 
 We continue to project that home values will decelerate from an increase of 
5¾ percent in 2016 to an average an nual increase of 3¾ percent over the 
medium term, leaving the level  of house prices only marginally above its 
historical relationship with rents at the end of the forecast p eriod.  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign real GDP growth rebounded to an annual rate of 3 percen t in the third 
quarter, ½ percentage poin t higher than estimated in the Octobe r Tealbook.  
This rebound was driven by stronge r growth in Canada, Mexico, a nd Japan.  
Growth abroad is projected to a verage about 2½ percent over the  remainder of 
the forecast period, supported by acc ommodative monetary policies in the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs ) and a moderate recovery in So uth 
America.  This outlook is revi sed down slightly in the near ter m as a result of 
tighter financial conditions a nd weaker data in the emerging ma rket 
economies (EMEs) but revised up later in the forecast period in  response to 
stronger U.S. demand.   
 The broad nominal dollar has appr eciated about 3  percent since the time of the 
October Tealbook, with the rise o ccurring subsequent to the U.S. election and 
coming more against EME currencies than against AFE currencies.   We 
expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at about a 1¼ percen t annual rate 
through the forecast period, as market expectations for the federal funds rate 
move up toward the staff forecast .  Relative to the October Tea lbook, our 
projection for the broad real  dollar by the end of 2019 is 2¼ percent higher. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oil has increased about $3.50 per  barrel since 
the close of the October Tealbook and is now trading at $55 per barrel.  This 
increase is mostly explained by the OPEC agreement reached on N ovember 
30 to cut oil production.6  This agreement extends only through the middle of 
6 OPEC countries agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels  per day, and some non-OPEC 
countries are expected to agree at their December 10 meeting to  cut production by 0.6 million barrels per 
day.

2017, leaving it unclear what happe ns afterward.  In fact, Dece mber 2019 
Brent futures prices are down about $1.25 per barre l since the close of the 
October Tealbook and currently s tand at $58 per barrel.  All to ld, the average 
price of oil over the forecast period is little changed from th e October 
Tealbook.     
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We estimate that real GDP is in creasing at an annual rate of 2½  percent in the 
second half of the year after r ising only 1 percen t in the first half.  The step-up reflects 
the stabilization of inventory inve stment as well as larger gai ns in government spending 
against a backdrop of continued s olid increases in PDFP.  Real GDP is then projected to 
grow 2½ percent in the first quart er of next year.  Our GDP for ecast for the second half of 
this year is slightly stronger than in the October Tealbook. 
 We estimate that consumer spendi ng is rising at an average annu al rate of 
2½ percent in the second half of t his year, and we expect it to  rise at the same 
pace in the first quarter of next year, supported by continued gains in 
employment and household income as w ell as earlier increases in  household 
wealth.  Our near-term forecast for consumer spending is a litt le higher than in 
the October Tealbook, reflecting stronger incoming spending dat a and an 
upward revision to the BEA’s estimate of disposable income in t he second and 
third quarters.   
 The BEA reported that investment  for equipment and intangibles declined at 
an annual rate of 2½ percent in the third quarter, well below o ur projection in 
the October Tealbook.  However , with orders of nondefense capit al goods 
rising recently and business sent iment generally supportive, we  expect 
moderate growth in equipment inve stment this quarter and the next.  In 
addition, we still expect investment in drilling and mining str uctures to start to 
move up this quarter after having d eclined for the past two years.  On net, our 
near-term forecast for business investment is little changed fr om the October 
Tealbook.  
 Single-family housing starts jump ed in October and were well ab ove our 
expectations.  Together with upwar d revisions to other incoming  source data, 
these data suggest that reside ntial investment will show an overall increase in

the second half of this year, compared with the roughly 3 percent rate of 
decline that we projected in the October Tealbook.  Given lean inventories of 
homes for sale and ongoing solid ga ins in house prices, we expe ct 
construction activity to increas e further in early 2017, albeit at a modest rate. 
 Very little inventory data are yet available for the fourth qua rter, but the 
staff’s flow-of-goods system show s inventory-to-sales ratios ne ar comfortable 
levels in most sectors outside of  energy (inventories of energy  products 
remain very high).  Consequently, w e expect inventory investment to change 
little on net over this  quarter and the next , consistent with t he projected steady 
growth in final sales, and to ha ve little effect on GDP growth. 
 Net exports boosted real GDP grow th more than ¾ percentage poin t in the 
third quarter, largely becaus e of unseasonably strong soybean exports.  In the 
fourth quarter, net exports are p rojected to subtract ½ percent age point, as 
exports are projected to declin e moderately (reflecting in part  a more normal 
pace of soybean exports).  More broadly, we continue to view net exports as being held down by a strong dollar,  weak foreign demand, and fi rming U.S. 
growth.  This drag extends for several years and is a bit larger than in the 
previous forecast. 
 The level of manufacturing produc tion has changed little, on net, in recent 
months (indeed, since late  2014), restrained by weak export dem and, 
spillovers from earlier declines in oil and gas drilling, and s low domestic 
capital investment more genera lly.  We expect factory output to  continue on 
this flat trajectory over the n ear term despite some modest improvement 
recently in the readings for new orders from the national and regional 
manufacturing surveys.   
Over the medium term, GDP growth  is expected to ease gradually from its pace in 
the second half of this year, eventually slowing to 1¾ percent in 2019, as monetary policy 
continues to tighten.   
 The projection for real GDP growth has been boosted by our assu mption of 
more expansionary fiscal polic y.  After taking into account multiplier effects 
as well as the offset from higher interest rates, these tax cuts raise the level of 
real GDP ½ percent by the end of  2019.  Interest rates have alr eady risen in

anticipation of a change in fiscal policy, and the associated restraint on 
activity is relatively front-l oaded in our projection.  By cont rast, the stimulus 
is relatively back-loaded, a s we do not—for example—have househ olds 
spending any of the additional dis posable income associated wit h the assumed 
tax cut in advance of its implementation; on the contrary, we h ave them 
adjusting the level of their s pending upward over a period of three years, 
consistent with the response fr om earlier episodes.  Other fact ors affecting the 
medium-term projection are a slight drag on balance. 
 As in the October Tealbook, we expect potential output growth t o pick up 
gradually from 1½ percent this  year to 1¾ percent at the end of  the medium 
term, owing to an acceleration i n structural labor productivity .  
 With GDP growth expected to outp ace our estimate of potential g rowth over 
the medium term, aggregate outpu t moves further above our estim ate of its 
sustainable level.  At the end of 2019, we forecast real GDP to be 1½ percent 
above potential—an output gap that is nearly ½ percentage point  higher than 
in the October Tealbook.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The two employment reports we ha ve received since the October T ealbook 
indicate that the labor market  has continued to tighten.   
 Total nonfarm payroll employment  is currently reported to have increased an 
average of 176,000 per month over th e three months through Nove mber, 
which was very close to our forecast in the October Tealbook. This pace is 
above the range of 80,000 to 110,000 per month that we see as c onsistent with 
unchanged labor market conditions—that is, a flat unemployment rate and 
labor force participation declin ing in parallel with its trend path. 
 The unemployment rate is esti mated to have fallen from 4.9 perc ent in 
October to 4.6 percent in November, ¼ percentage point below ou r 
expectation in the October Tealbook.  We expect that some of last month’s 
decline will be unwound in the months ahead; the unemployment r ate is 
projected to be 4.7 percent in December and in the first quarte r of next year, 
0.1 percentage point lower tha n our previous forecast.

 The labor force participation rate declined 0.1 percentage poin t in both 
October and November; at 62.7 perc ent, the November level was 
0.1 percentage point below the previous forecast.  We expect th e participation 
rate to remain at this level t hrough the first quarter of next year, unchanged 
from our previous projection.  The  employment-to-population rat io has edged 
up, on net, in the second half of thi s year and, relative to it s declining trend, 
has improved 0.3 percentage point.   
 Other indicators of labor marke t conditions have continued to improve.  The 
share of employed individuals working part time for economic re asons edged 
down, on balance, this year, as has the share of long-term unem ployed.  The 
rate of layoffs, as measured by initial claims and JOLTS data, has remained 
low, and households’ assessments of job availability have conti nued to rise.  
 The labor market conditions index, or LMCI, ticked up over the past three 
months, driven by improvements both in unemployment and hiring indicators 
and in consumer and business assess ments of the jobs situation. 
 We view the labor market as a  touch beyond full employment.  In  the fourth 
quarter, we expect the unemploym ent rate to average ¼ percentag e point 
below our estimate of its natural  rate and the employment-to-population ratio 
to be ¼ percentage point above our estimate of its trend.   
 Labor productivity in the business sector is now estimated to h ave increased 
3¾ percent in the third quart er, about ¾ percentage point stron ger than in the 
previous Tealbook, but was unchanged relative to its level four  quarters 
earlier. 
The medium-term outlook for the  labor market is stronger than i n the October 
Tealbook, reflecting the stronge r projection for real GDP.  
 The path of monthly job gains is about 20,000 higher than in th e October 
Tealbook, bringing the level of payrol l employment at the end o f 2019 to 
about 700,000 above the previous p rojection.  We now expect average 
monthly total payroll gain s to slow from about 180,000 in 2017 to about 
160,000 in 2018 and 120,000 in 2019.

 We project that labor productivity growth will move up to an average annual 
pace of about 1 percent over the projection period, a touch low er than our 
estimate of its trend. 
 By the end of 2019, the unemployment rate is projected to be 4. 2 percent, 
¾ percentage point below our estim ate of its natural rate and ¼  percentage 
point below the Octobe r Tealbook projection.  
 We project that the labor force pa rticipation rate will decline a little more 
slowly than its trend over the medi um term, reflecting the sust ained job gains 
and rising real wages in this  projection.  Compared with the Oc tober 
Tealbook, we have nudged up the part icipation rate projection a  bit.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The incoming data on consumer prices have been about in line wi th our 
expectations in the October Tealbook, and our inflation forecas t is little revised.  
 The 12-month change in total PCE  prices, at 1.4 percent in October, is 
expected to move up, reflecting both recent increases in crude oil prices and 
the effect of earlier declin es in gasoline prices dropping out of the calculation; 
the 12-month change briefly reaches 2 percent in March 2017 before easing to 1.8 percent in the second quarter .  The 12-month change in core PCE prices 
was 1.7 percent in October and is projected to remain at about that level over 
the near term. 
 Measured on a quarterly average b asis, core PCE price inflation  is estimated 
to be lower in the second half of  this year (at 1.6 percent) relative to the first 
half (1.9 percent), when inflation was boosted by some volatile price categories and by what appears to b e residual seasonality.  We now project 
core PCE price inflation to be  1.7 percent in the first quarter  of next year, 
essentially unchanged from the October Tealbook. 
 Headline PCE inflation is estimated to be above core inflation in the second 
half, as energy prices have risen appreciably in recent months amid increases 
in gasoline prices driven by supply disruptions and higher crud e oil costs.

 Core import prices are project ed to decline slightly in the fou rth quarter of 
2016, little changed from the October Tealbook, as a boost from  higher metals 
prices offsets the recent dolla r appreciation.  In the first qu arter of 2017, an 
ongoing drag from the recent apprec iation of the dollar is expe cted to cause 
core import prices to continue e dging down.  Thereafter, we expect import 
price inflation to turn positive and move up to a ¾ percent rat e by the end of 
2017, consistent with moderate fore ign inflation a nd relatively  flat projected 
trajectories for the dolla r and commodity prices.   
 With regard to longer-term inflation expectations, the median o f expectations 
over the next 5 to 10 years from t he Michigan survey moved up f rom its 
historical low of 2.4 percent i n October to 2.6 percent in November.  
Similarly, the TIPS-based measur e of 5-to-10-year-forward infla tion 
compensation has risen to 2 percent, a noticeable increase from  its reading of 
1.6 percent at the time of the  October Tealbook.  In contrast, some other 
survey measures remained unchanged.  Expected PCE price inflati on over the 
next 10 years from the Federal Res erve Bank of Philadelphia’s S urvey of 
Professional Forecasters remained at 2 percent in the fourth qu arter, and the 
3-year-ahead measure of inflati on expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York’s Survey of Consumer E xpectation remained at 2.6 perce nt in 
October.   
Both total and core PCE infla tion are anticipated to trend up t o 1.9 percent by 
2019 as resource utilization tight ens and the drag from earlier  energy and import price 
declines wanes.  As in previous Tealbooks, we have assumed a sm all pickup (5 basis 
points in each of 2018 and 2019) in the prevailing level of inflation expectations relevant 
for wage and price setting. 
 These projections are essentia lly unchanged from the October Tealbook 
despite the modestly stronger out look for resource utilization,  as we estimate 
the Phillips curve to be quite flat.  
 Since the December 2015 Tealbook, our  core inflation projection  for 2016 has 
been revised up 0.3 percentage poin t in response to factors tha t we consider 
largely transitory.  Our proje ction for 2017 core inflation is unrevised.  (See

The data on labor compensation r eceived since the previous Teal book have been 
mixed; taken together, we view t hese data as broadly consistent  with a labor market that 
is operating close to its sustain able level against a backdrop of very sluggish trend growth 
in productivity.  The box “Measures of Labor Compensation” disc usses the primary 
differences in these measures. 
 Average hourly earnings for a ll employees edged down in Novembe r 
following a relatively large gai n in October.  Over the past 12  months, this 
measure of wages has increased 2½ percent after rising at a rel atively steady 
pace of 2 percent earlier in the recovery period.  
 With an upward revision to wages a nd salaries in the latest NIP A data, 
compensation per hour in the business sector is now estimated to have risen 
2¾ percent over the four quart ers through 2016:Q3, up from our estimate in 
the October Tealbook but about the  same rate as seen, on averag e, in the past 
four years.  
 The employment cost index rose about 2¼ percent over the 12 mon ths ending 
in September, up just slightly f rom an average pace of 2 percen t in recent 
years. 
 The Wage Growth Tracker from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlant a suggests 
the median growth in wages has  been 3.9 percent over the past 1 2 months.  
This movement continues an upward trend seen over the past year  and brings 
the increases in this measure of  wage growth close to pre-recession levels. 
We continue to project that hourl y labor compensation growth in  the business 
sector will pick up gradually as the labor market tightens further; we have revised up the 
medium-term projection a bit, r eflecting the lower unemployment  rate in this Tealbook.7 
(See the box “Alternativ e View:  The Rise in Real Wages” for an  argument that wage 
pressures are greater than judged by the staff.) 
7 Our models find a notably str onger effect of resource utilizat ion on compensation growth 
(especially compensation per hour in the business sector) than on price inflation.

 Measures  of Labor Compensation  
The staff closely monitors  several measures  of labor compensation  constructed  by the 
Bureau  of Labor Statistics:   the employment  cost index for private  industry workers (ECI),  
compensation  per hour  in the business  sector (CPH), and average hourly earnings of  all 
employees  (AHE).  Additional  measures  of compensation  that the staff follows  include the  
Wage Growth Tracker (WGT) constructed  by the Federal Reserve  Bank of Atlanta and a few 
indicators  derived from  other surveys.   
Although  these measures  of labor compensation  tend to move in a broadly  similar manner 
over longer  horizons,  they often send different signals  over shorter  periods, as shown in 
figures 1 and 2.  Since mid‐ 2014, those focusing  on wages and salaries only (the AHE, the 
WGT, and  a component  of the ECI) suggest that nomi nal wage growth has been picking up, 
with the WGT showing  the most pronounced  increase;  for the broader  compensation  
measures  (overall ECI  and CPH), the evidence  of a pickup is less clear.   While the distinction  
between total  compensation  and the narrower concept  of wages and salaries can account  
for some  of the disparities  across the  measures,  other differences  in the concepts  and 
methodologies  used to construct these  measures  are also important.  
The table  on the last page of this box compares  the four series across some  key dimensions.   
In particular,  the various measures differ in their focus in the following  ways:  
 The AHE is designed  as a timely monthly measure  of wages (no benefits included)  
and is released  as part of the monthly employment  report.  It  is calculated  as total 
wages divided by total hours paid for all employees  in private nonfarm  
establishments.   As a result, an increase in  wages for high earners moves the 
measure more than a similarly  proportioned  increase  for lower‐wage  workers.  
 The WGT  is designed  to measure  the median change in hourly wages (no benefits 
included)  of individuals, based on  self‐reported  usual earnings  by households  in the 
Current Population  Survey (CPS).  The index covers only  individuals  who were  
earning at a rate of less than  $150,000  per year and  who were  in the sample and 
employed  full time both in the current month of the CPS and one year earlier.  It  is

the only measure constructed from the perspective of the household (as opposed to 
the employer). Unlike the AHE and CPH, this measure does not give more weight to 
high earners than low earners. 
 The ECI is designed to measure the change in the cost (both wages and benefits) of 
hiring labor services. It is calculated as an average change in compensation, holding 
fixed industry and occupation weights, as well as most changes in overtime hours 
worked and benefits usage.1 As a result, it captures increases in compensation for 
particular jobs, but it is designed to exclude the effects of increased overtime use or 
a faster pace of job promotions during expansions, as well as shifts toward higher
productivity, higher wage occupations or industries. This is one possible reason why 
the ECI has had a lower average growth rate than the CPH and the WGT over the 
past 20 years. The ECI is the only measure that includes detail on the components of 
benefits (for example, health insurance).2 In recent quarters, relatively muted 
increases in the growth of these benefits costs have balanced out a modest pickup 
in wage growth in the ECI. 
 The CPH is a measure of overall compensation received by employees in the 
business sector, calculated as total compensation (including some components not 
found in the ECI, such as stock options) divided by hours, based on the quarterly 
national income and product accounts (NIPA) data. It is the most inclusive of all the 
different measures of labor compensation, but it is also far more variable at a 
quarterly frequency than any of the other measures. This variability may occur, in 
part, both because the CPH is influenced by the changing mix of jobs and because it 
includes highly volatile components such as stock options and bonuses. Of all the 
measures discussed here, the CPH covaries most strongly with the unemployment 
gap. Unlike the other series, it is suscept ible to large revisions. 
Each of these measures has strengths and weaknesses, and there is no single preferred 
measure. The CPH, being the most comprehensive measure of total compensation, is 
probably the most useful for questions regarding consumption behavior. It is also the only 
measure with an associated and directly comparable measure of labor productivity, so it is 
convenient for measuring unit labor costs. The ECI is probably the most relevant measure 
for gauging wage pressure experienced by firms, and it is the only comprehensive 
compensation measure that the staff has found to have some explanatory power for price 
inflation in recent years.3 The AHE is a timely and straightforward measure. The WGT is 
relatively new and we are still learning about its properties, but bringing in information from 
the CPS would seem to represent a useful complement to the other measures. 
1 There are some features of the ECI that are not fixed. For example, the experience profile of the 
workforce within particular job categories and the use of incentive pay affect the ECI and are likely to 
change depending on the economic climate. 
2 With the exception of health insurance, the benefits detail is unpublished and confidential.

 Alternative View :  The Rise in Real Wages1 
The unemployment rate has fallen considerably over the past several years .  
However, there has been only a modest  pickup  in nominal wage growth , which  
some  consider a puzzle .  The staff view is that nominal wage growth has not been 
surprisingly weak over this period but has been consistent with long -run trends for 
inflation  and  productivity and  with labor  market  slack.  This alternative vie w 
questions whether those long -run trends are the right benchmark and notes that  
nominal wage  growth has actually been stronger  than one would expect based on  
the recent  behavior of inflation and productivity .  Accordingly, recent wage growth 
may be indicati ve of more wage pressures than the staff recognizes . 
Frictionless real business cycle  models  imply that wages should move one -for-one 
with inflation and productivity.  While these models are clearly counterfactual, they 
do motivate comparing real w ages to productivity as a means of gauging wage 
pressures in the economy.  The labor share, which equals  the ratio of real wages per 
hour to output per hour, provides a convenient means of making that comparison .   
Figure 1  plots the labor share on a four -quarter moving average basis from 1972 :Q2 
to 2016 :Q3.  As the figure indicates, there has been a modest pickup in the share of 
output accruing to labor over the past several quarters.  While this pickup follows an extended decline, it is worth noting that over the past 45 years, there have been 
only three prior episodes of a rise in the labor share.
1   
The extended decline in the labor share over the past 15 years indicat es that a stable 
one -for-one relationship between output and wages  may not exist .  Indeed, in a 
simple regression of log  real wages per hour on log output per hour , the estimated 
coefficient on output per hour equals 0. 91, which is well below  the expected  
                                                 
Note:   This alternative view was p repared by Missaka Warusawitharana.

Hobijn , and  Aysegul Sahin (2013 ), “The Decline of the U.S. Labor Share, ” Brookings Papers on 
Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 1 –63, https://www.brookings.edu/wp -

coefficient of 1.00, consistent with the fact that over the sample period, wage 
growth has not kept pace with output growth. Figure 2 presents the regression 
residual s, which are referred to as the wage –productivity gap. A positiv e (negative) 
gap implies that wages are elevated (depressed) relative to the relationship implied 
by the regression model. A potential implication of this residual is that when the 
wage gap is depressed, wages are not putting a great deal of pressure on firm costs, 
thus hold ing down pressures on price inflation. 
As figure 2 indicates, real wag es were depressed relative to productivity in the 
aftermath of the financial crisis. The wage –productivity gap remained negative for 
several years and began to turn up in 2014. Since then, it has increased about 
3 percentage points. This rise indicates a noticeable improvement in real wages 
relative to productivity , sugges tive of greater wage pressures in the economy . As of 
2016 :Q3, the gap is close to zero, implying that the level of wages is close to that 
implied by the estimated relationship between productivity and wages. 
This perspective differs from the staff view . The staff framework evaluates nominal 
wage gains relative to judgmental long -run trends for inflation and productivity , 
both of which exceeded realized values over the past three years , as energy prices 
fell and productivity growth was especially weak . 2 As shown in the table , according 
to the staff view, wage growth over the past three years was consistent with these 
long -run trends .  In contrast, relative to recent inflation and produ ctivity, wages 
rose about 1 percent per year over the past three years , a notable rate of increase . 
To conclude , the staff view is that wage growth over the past several years has been 
consistent with slack and long -run trends for inflation and productivity . However , 
when compared with recent inflation and productivity , wage growth has been quite 
strong .  If firms were to pass these higher wages into prices, inflation would exceed 
that of the baseline forecast.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We continue to assume a natural rate of unemployment in the longer run of 
5 percent and a longer-run growt h rate of potential GDP of 1.7 percent. 
 In response to the assumption of pe rsistently more stimulative fiscal policy, 
the long-run value of the real f ederal funds rate has been revi sed up from 
¾ percent to 1 percent.  The fis cal policy assumption also is the reason for a 
⅛ percentage point upw ard revision to the term premium due to t he additional 
supply of Treasury debt that would be forthcoming with a more e xpansionary 
fiscal stance.  All to ld, the yield on 10-y ear Treasury securit ies is 3½ percent 
in the long run, ⅜ percentage point h igher than in the October Tealbook. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by 2022. 
 With output running above its potent ial and inflation at the Co mmittee’s 
2 percent objective, the nominal  federal funds rate is about ¾ percentage point 
above its long-run value of 3 pe rcent in 2020, increases to nea rly 4 percent in 
2021, and then moves back toward its  long-run value thereafter. 
 As monetary policy continues to tighten, real GDP decelerates f urther, 
growing 1.5 percent in 2020 a nd 1.3 percent in 2021.  The unemployment rate 
is 4.3 percent in 2020 and rises gradually toward its assumed n atural rate in 
subsequent years.  
 PCE price inflation moves up f rom 1.9 percent in 2019 and sligh tly 
overshoots the Committee’s long-run objective in 2020 and 2021 before 
gradually convergi ng to 2 percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign real GDP growth rebounded to 3 percent in the third quarter from an 
unusually subdued 1¼ percent pace in the second quarter.  This bounceback, which was 
½ percentage point greater than we had expected, was primarily  driven by stronger 
growth in Canada and Mexico, where the second -quarter pothole was concentrated.  We 
see foreign growth slowing to 2¼ percent in the current quarter. 
Over the remainder of the forecast period, we project foreign growth to edge up  to 
2½ percent , supported by accommodative monetary policies in the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) and a moderate recovery in South America. An important 
development affecting the foreign outlook has been the prospect of U.S. fiscal expansion, 
which has several distinct and offsetting effects in our baseline.  First, higher U.S. GDP 
growth  boosts U.S. imports and thus economic activity abroad, a lthough, as discussed in 
the Domestic Economic Deve lopments and Outlook section, it will take a couple of years 
for the benefits to materialize .  Second, anticipation of looser U.S. fiscal policy has likely 
already contributed to strengthening the dollar, which should raise foreign 
competitiveness and growth.  But such anticipation  has also pushed up interest rates here 
and abroad, which should re strain foreign growt h, especially in some vulnerable 
emerging market economies ( EMEs ) where higher i nterest rates have i ncreased financial 
stresses.  All told, relative to the October Tealbook, the foreign outlook is down slightly 
in the near term as the tighter financial conditions are felt,  but up later in the forecast 
period as the effect of tax cuts on U.S. spending and imports more fully shows through. 
As usual, considerable uncertainty attends the foreign outlook.  Much of this 
uncertainty is now about the course of U.S. policy.  A stronger fiscal expansion than we 
are assuming would likely boost foreign growth, while less expansion would lower it.  
As there is a wide range of possible trade policy actions that the new U.S. government 
could take, w e are not assuming any changes in trade policy  in this forecast, but actions 
that raise barriers to international trade would likely lower foreign growth.  Moreover , the 
higher interest rates and stronger dollar built into our current outlook may lead to greater 
financial stress in EMEs —and , thus, greater shortfalls in their growth —than we are 
assuming in our baseline projection; see the “Stronger Dollar and EME Financial 
Turbulence” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. In addition, a number of risks 
to European growth remain salient, including negotiations over Brexit, possible gains by

anti-EU parties in upcoming elections, and difficulties in recapitalizing the banking 
system (particularly following the failed constitutional referendum in Italy).  Finally , 
risks associated with the vulnerable Chinese financial sector are never far from 
our mind s. 
Inflation in most AFEs has increased in recent months but remains significantly 
below central bank targets.  In line with still-muted core inflation readings and sluggish 
elimination of slack, we see AFE inflation rising only gradually, reaching 1½ percent in 
the euro area and 1¼ percent in Japan in 2019.  By contrast, in the United Kingdom, 
where the substantial depreciation of the pound since the summer is pushing up consumer 
prices, we expect inflation will be well above the Bank of England’s (BOE) 2 percent 
target  in 2017.  In the EMEs, as food prices stabilize in China and as exchange rate 
depreciation in some countries passes through to prices , inflation is expected to increase 
to 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter and stay slightly above this rate thereafter .  All told , 
our outlook for inflation abroad is little changed despite the recent OPEC agreement to 
cut oil production.  Although this agreement led to an  increase in spot oil prices, this 
increase merely reversed declines that had taken place earlier in the intermeeting period, 
and the overall  projected path of oil prices is little changed from the previous Tealbook. 
Given the subdued outlook for inflation, we  continue to assume that monetary 
policy in the AFEs will stay highly accommodative through 2019.  W e expect that the 
BOE will raise the Bank Rate 25 basis points in late 2017 in response to above- target 
inflation , but only to ½ percent.  In the EM Es, the central banks of Turkey and Mexico 
raised policy rates to counteract inflationary pressures from recent exchange rate 
depreciation, while the central banks of Brazil and Argentina, with some improvement in 
their inflation situation, cut their policy ra tes to support growth. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Canada.  Real GDP grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter after contractin g 
1.3 percent in the second quarter.  The expansion was led by private consumption 
and a strong rebound in energy exports following di sruptive wildfires in May.  
More -recent indicators , such as manufacturing PMIs through November, suggest a 
moderation in growth in the current quarter.  W e expect GDP growth to average 
2 percent in 2017, supported by a weak Canadian dollar and accommodative 
monetary and fiscal policies, before settling a bit below 2 percent by mid -2018.  
Relative to the October Tealbook, this projection is a touch weaker through

mid-2017, reflecting somewhat tighter financial conditions, and slightly stro nger in 
2019 on the markup in U.S. growth. 
• Euro Area.  Real GDP grew 1.4 percent in the third quarter.  More -recent indicators , 
such as rising c omposite PMIs and strong retail sales , suggest that growth picked up 
to 1¾ percent in the current quarter.  Moving forward , we expect growing political 
backlash against fiscal austerity to lead to slightly more expansionary fiscal polic ies, 
such as in France and Italy.  Accordingly, with monetary policy remaining 
accommodative, we see GDP growth  edging up close to 2 percent by 2019.  Overall, 
this projection is slightly higher than in the October Tealbook, reflecting better -than-
expected indicators and more-expansionary fiscal policy both in the United States 
and the euro area.  That said , our growth projections for Italy and other vulnerable 
economies are slightly weaker than in the previous Tealbook, reflecting tighter 
financial conditions. 
With anti- EU sentiment prevalent across the euro area and with national elections in 
France, Germany, and possibly Italy looming next year, elevated political 
uncertainty is likely to trigger bouts of volatility and financial stress.  Moreover, 
deep -seated  weaknesses in the banking sector persist . In particular, Ital ian banks 
have been struggling to raise capital, and their efforts will likely be complicated by 
political uncertainty following the Italian referendum .  Our projection assumes that 
these headwinds will weigh on the euro-area recovery  but not derail it.  H owever, 
more -dire outcomes for European banks remain a significant risk, as discussed in the 
“Banking Crisis in Europe” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
As core inflation and inflation expectations remain persistently low, inflation is 
projected to rise only slowly , from just above 1 percent in the third quarter to 
1½ percent in late 2018.  Accordingly , we expect that this week the European 
Central Bank (ECB) will commit to purchasing assets at least through 
September  2017.  We assume that the ECB will wait until late 2017 to begin tapering 
purchases and until early 2018 to cease them entirely . 
• Japan. Real GDP growth rebounded to 2.2 percent in the third quarter, 
1¼ percentage points higher than estimated in the October Tealbook.  However, this 
rebound largely reflects a plunge in imports and payback from earlier earthquake-
related disruptions, while domestic demand was disappointing.  Indeed, m ore-recent 
data, such as industrial production for October, point to only moderate underlying

momentum.  Accordingly, we expect growth to slow to about 1 percent through the 
end of 2018 before decelerating to zero in 2019 as a result of  a planned consumption 
tax hike.  This projection is slightly higher than in the October Teal book, primarily 
owing to a weaker yen. 
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth slowed to 2 percent in the third quarter from 
2.7 percent in the second quarter because of somewhat weaker domestic demand .  
Stronger- than-expected indicators suggest growth edged down just a little in the 
current quarter, but we still see it falling to 1¼ percent earl y next year.  Thereafter, 
growth recovers  to 1¾ percent by 2019.  O ur medium- term growth projection is a 
touch weak er than in the October Tealbook:  A recent U.K. government fi scal plan 
that is more contractionary than we previously anticipated as well as less-
accommodative monetary policy are only partially offset by spillovers from expected 
U.S. fiscal expansion and news that a “hard” Brexit may be less likely .1 
Although inflation is projected to slow to 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter, given 
weak incoming data, we still expect quarterly inflation to peak at 3½ percent in the 
first quarter of 2017 because of past pound depreciation and to remain above the 
BOE’s 2 percent target through the end of the year.  Accordingly, we now expect 
that the BOE will increase the Bank Rate 25 basis points in the second half of 2017.  
We also assume the BOE will complete its sovereign bond purchase program early 
next year and continue purchasing corporate bonds through the first quarter of 2018. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• Mexico.  Mexican real GDP grow th bounced back from its earlier pothole much more 
sharply than we anticipated, surging to 4 percent in the third quarter from just 
1 percent in the first half of the year, almost 2  percentage points above our October 
Tealbook estimate. Household demand was robust , supported by rapid credit growth 
amid low unemployment.  However, we see Mexican GDP growth moderating to 
2 percent in the current quarter , consistent with recent declines in consumer and 
business confidence as well as manufacturing PMI .  Growth should remain at this 
pace over most of 2017 before picking up to 2¾ percent by 2019, supported by the 
1 The lower likelihood of a hard Brexit partly results from a ruling in early November by the U.K. 
High Court that the U.K. parliament must consent before the government begins the exit process from the 
European Union by triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty . The government appealed the decision , and 
the U.K. Supreme Court is expected to unveil its final decision early next year.

peso’s depreciation, a pickup in U.S. manufacturing, and energy -sector reforms. 
Relative to the October Tealbook, we have lowered growth a bit in the near term as a 
result of tightened financial conditions.  Inflation should edge up to almost 4 percent 
in the current quarter, pressured by pass-through from the peso’s  depreciation.  To 
keep inflationary pressures in check , the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate in mid -
November and is expected to tighten its stance further at its next meeting in mid -
December.  With medium - and long- term inflation expectations well- anchored, we 
see inflation settling down to about 3¼ percent by early 2018. 
• Brazil.  Brazil’s deepest recession on record continued in the third quarter, with real 
GDP declining 3.3 percent.  Investment plunged at a double- digit rate amid a cutback 
in access to  subsidized credit and resurfacing worries about the political situation, 
while household demand continued its decline amid rising unemployment. The 
disappointing tone of incoming data— especially the step -down in industri al 
production in October and in consumer confidence in November—prompted us to 
factor in a further GDP decline in the current quarter.  We expect Brazil’s recovery to 
begin in 2017 but to be very gradual, with restrictive monetary and fiscal policies 
weighing on demand.  In late November, the central bank cut its policy rate 25 basis 
points to 13.75 percent in response to the weak economy and some signs that 
inflationary pressures are abating.  We expect inflation to ease to the 4.5 pe rcent 
inflation target by 2019. 
• China. After slowing to  6.8 percent in the third quarter, real GDP growth is expected 
to ease further to 6 ¼ percent in the current quarter.  Most of this slowdown reflects 
continued decline in investment as fiscal and monetary stimulus tapers off. 
Macroprudential  measures introduced in October are starting to reduce house sales , 
and we also expect real estate investment to slow.  Meanwhile, growth of both 
exports and imports has been sluggish in recent months.  All told, growth for 2016 is 
projected to be 6¾ perce nt, within the authorities’ target range of 6½ to 7 percent.  
Growth should slow to 5¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, in line with 
declin ing potential growth.   Falling f ood prices pushed down inflation to an estimated 
1½ percent in the third quarter .  We expect inflation to rebound as food prices 
stabilize before settling at around 2½ percent by early next year. 
• Other Emerging Asia . Growth in the region held at 3½ percent in the third quarter, 
as the payback in Hong K ong from outsized second- quarter growth was offset by a

surge in India linked to strong private consumption.  In line with recent indicators 
pointing to a slowdown in economic activity, especially in India and South Korea, w e 
expect growth in the region to moderate to 3 percent in the current quarter.  Going 
forward, growth should rise to 3½ percent by mid-2017 as both domestic and external 
demand firm. 
o During the intermeeting period, the Indian government,  in an effort to combat 
corruption and tax evasion, demonetized overnight the two highest 
denomination bank notes, equivalent to $7.50 and $15, which accounted for almost 90 percent of the value of currency in circulation .
2  Since this move, 
we have received November PMI indicators, which have led us to revise down 
growth in the current and next quarter s. 
o In South Korea, a scandal involving President Park, combined with the ongoing crisis in the shipping industry related to the bankruptcy of one of 
Korea’s largest shipping f irms, has contributed to a plunge in consumer 
confidence.  These developments have led us to revise down a touch Korean growth in the current quarter. 
2 Under this demonet ization program, holders of the bank notes have until December 30 to trade in 
their old bank notes at any bank branch. However, if holders cannot justify how they accumulated the bank 
notes, they h ave to pay a penalty of around 60 percent of the ir value. As of early December, around 
55 percent of the estimated bank notes in circulation, representing $ 130 billion , have been traded in.

Financial Developments 
The U.S. election results were t he primary catalyst for develop ments in financial 
markets during the intermeeti ng period.  Overall, asset price m ovements and the policy 
path in the United States app eared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansive 
fiscal policy, as well as potenti al changes to trade, regulator y, and other policies.  In 
addition, prices of some risky ass ets may have reflected an improvement in risk 
sentiment.  Global markets also responded strongly to U.S. developments.  Meanwhile, 
incoming U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve communications reinforced market 
participants’ expectations for  a policy rate incr ease at the De cember meeting.   
 Based on a straight read of mark et quotes, the probability of a rate hike in 
December increased to about 90 percent from around 60 percent j ust prior to 
the November FOMC meeting.  Furth er out, the market-implied pat h of the 
policy rate moved up 55 basis points at the end of 2018, to its  highest level 
since early January.   
 Yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury securities incre ased 30, 55, 
and 60 basis points, respectively, a nd the 5-to-10-year forward  rate rose 
67 basis points, amid higher uncerta inty for longer-dated inter est rates.  Both 
the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year  TIPS-based measures of inflatio n 
compensation continued to move up, climbing 24 basis points and  34 basis 
points, respectively.   
 The S&P 500 stock price index i ncreased 5 percent, on net, and measures of 
stock price volatility declined.  Credit spreads on corporate b onds narrowed.     
 The broad dollar index appreciat ed 2¾ percent, with the dollar strengthening 
against nearly all major and e merging market currencies. 
 Most private borrowing rates als o rose, but available indicator s suggest that 
financing conditions for nonfinan cial firms and households rema ined broadly 
accommodative.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Domestic Developments 
Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period and  domestic 
economic data releases reportedl y reinforced investors’ expecta tions of an increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting , with a straight read of 
federal funds futures contrac ts suggesting a 90 percent probabi lity of a rate hike in 
December.  Looking further ahea d, investors marked up considera bly their expected path 
for the policy rate over the intermeeting period, with the fede ral funds rate implied by 
OIS quotes at the end of  2017 and 2018 moving up 26 basis points and 55 basis points, 
respectively.  Most of the steepening of the market-implied policy path occurred 
following the election, apparentl y reflecting i nvestors’ percep tion of greater-than-
expected fiscal stimulus.  Marke t-based measures of uncertainty  regarding monetary 
policy at horizons beyond one year  moved up, suggesting that so me of the firming in OIS 
rates could reflect a rise in t erm premiums.  Indeed, after adj usting for term premiums 
using the staff’s preferred m odel, the expected policy rate by the end of 2017 and 2018 
rose 13 basis points and 36 basi s points, respectively.1 
Nominal Treasury yields moved up, on net, since the November FO MC meeting, 
with 2-, 5- and 10-year yield s rising 30, 55, and 60 basis points, respectively.  Medium-
and longer-term yields were boos ted by roughly equal increases in real yields and 
inflation compensation.  In part icular, 5-year and 5-to-10-year  TIPS-based measures of 
inflation compensation rose 24 ba sis points and 34 basis points, respectively, continuing 
their upward trajectory over th e second half of this year.  Mar ket-based measures of 
inflation compensation based on i nflation swaps posted similar gains.  Quotes on 
inflation caps and floors suggest  that the rise in inflation co mpensation reflects in part 
higher costs of protection again st above-target inflation outco mes.  In addition, some of 
the rise in inflation compensat ion appears related to the recen t climb in oil prices, with a 
notable boost after OPEC’s agreem ent at its November 30 meeting  to cut production.   
Staff models suggest that a sizable portion of the run-up in me dium- and long-
term nominal yields reflected i ncreases in real term premiums a nd inflation risk 
premiums, which jumped immediately following the election.  Part of the increase in 
term premiums may stem from t he upward pressure on yields arisi ng from the expected 
1 These model-based increases are somewhat larger than the revis ions to the staff’s projection for 
the federal funds rate based on the inertial Taylor (1999) rule at these horizons.

expansion in Treasury debt asso ciated with deficit-financed fis cal stimulus, as well from 
the increase in uncertainty about  the future level of long-term  rates, as evidenced by the 
rise in implied volatilitie s from swaptions.   
Respondents to the Desk’s December surveys of primary dealers a nd market 
participants assigned a proba bility of near 90 percent to a rat e hike in December , up from 
55 percent in the November surveys.  The most likely path of th e target federal funds rate 
was unchanged through the end of 2017 but shifted up about 25 b asis points in 2018 for 
both the median dealer and the med ian investor relative to the November surveys.  
Survey respondents were also ask ed to rate the importance of a range of factors that 
potentially contributed to the re cent increase in the 10-year Treasury yield.  The median 
respondent in each survey rated changes in the outlook for U.S.  growth and inflation as 
the most important factors drivi ng the rise in the 10-year yiel d, which were primarily 
linked to changes in the outl ook for federal government expenditures and for tax policy.   
Broad U.S. equity price indexes appreciated about 5 percent sin ce the November 
FOMC meeting, boosted by expectati ons of stronger growth and by  improved risk 
sentiment, with much of the rise coming after the election.2  Share prices for the financial 
sector outperformed the broade r market.  Bank equities, in part icular, surged about 
21 percent, reportedly in response to investors’ expectations o f greater future bank 
profitability.  These expectations likely reflect in part the s teepening of the yield curve 
and the possibility of a less stri ngent future regulatory environment.  Meanwhile, stock 
prices of sectors that typically b enefit from lower interest ra tes, such as utilities, 
decreased somewhat.   
One-month-ahead option-implie d volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—declined 
since the election and ended the period close to its lowest lev el this year.  Implied 
volatilities at longer horizons also fell, though by less.  In addition, spreads on yields of 
nonfinancial corporate bonds over th ose of comparable-maturity Treasury securities 
narrowed for both investment- and speculative-grade firms.   
2 Immediately following the close of the polls, global stock prices moved down sharply; however, 
these moves reversed within hour s for U.S. equity prices.  And despite notable price volatility, overall 
market functioning was characterized as generally “orderly.”

Foreign Developments 
Since the November FOMC meeting, movements in foreign financial  markets 
have been largely driven by U.S. de velopments, as investors assessed potential policy 
changes resulting from the U.S. presidential election.  Spillov ers from U.S. markets lifted 
yields and equity prices in most a dvanced foreign economies (AF Es).  However, the U.S. 
election weighed on investor sentim ent toward the emerging mark et economies (EMEs), 
where currencies depreciated and asset prices declined.      
Following the U.S. election, AFE s overeign yields moved up alon g with U.S. 
yields, albeit by less.  On net , 10-year yields ended the inter meeting period 42 basis 
points higher in Canada, nearl y 20 basis points higher in Germany, and about 10 basis 
points higher in Japan and the  United Kingdom.  In Italy, the “No” vote at the 
constitutional referendum and e xpectations of the Italian prime  minister’s resignation 
raised concerns that the recap italization of the Italian banking sector would become more 
difficult.  In the event, Italian bond and bank equity prices quickly reversed some initial 
declines, and markets outside of  Italy were largely unaffected. 
The dollar appreciated notably a gainst most AFE currencies as i ncreases in U.S. 
yields and policy expectations ou tpaced the corresponding movem ents abroad.  In 
addition to expectations for great er policy divergence, the dol lar may have been boosted 
by expectations for additional U. S. policy changes, such as a t ax holiday on profits 
earned abroad, which could increas e U.S. firms’ repatriation of foreign cash reserves.  On 
net, the dollar is about 3 percen t stronger against the euro an d about 9 percent stronger 
against the yen.  In contrast, the dollar depreciated against the pound following a 
statement by the Bank of England t hat suggested less accommodat ive monetary policy 
and following other po litical developments that were interprete d by investors as 
suggesting a softer Brexit.    
In the emerging market economies, markets turned down following  the U.S. 
election.  Market participants a ttributed EME currency deprecia tion and asset price 
declines to a number of factors,  including higher global intere st rates and the possibility 
of more protectionist U.S. trade policy.  EME bond and equity m utual funds (as measured 
by Emerging Portfolio Fund Research ) saw very large outflows as  sovereign spreads 
widened and equity price indexes declined.  In addition, EME cu rrencies depreciated 
sharply, with the Mexican peso and Brazilian real falling by about 6 percent on net.  The 
Chinese renminbi also weakene d against the dollar but by less than 2 percent.  Capital

outflows from China have picked up again in the past few months , leading Chinese 
authorities to tighten capital c ontrols.  Currency weakness pro mpted the Bank of Mexico 
and the Central Bank of Turkey to r aise their key interest rate s 50 basis points, and Asian 
central banks reportedly intervened in foreign exchange markets .  Investor sentiment 
toward oil producers improved som ewhat later in the period following OPEC’s decision 
to reduce supply.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS , BANKING -SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS , 
AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
Money market flows continued to stabilize over the intermeeting  period after 
experiencing outsized movements in the lead-up to the money mar ket fund (MMF) 
reforms in mid-October.  Governme nt MMFs had modest inflows, wh ile assets under 
management at prime MMFs wer e little changed.  In addition, outstanding levels of 
commercial paper (CP) and nego tiable certificates of deposit (C Ds) were stable, and 
holdings of CP and CDs by prime MMF s changed little.  Outflows of large time deposits 
from banks reversed modestly in November.  Moreover, ON RRP tak e-up declined 
substantially to an ave rage of about $135 billion.3 
Over the intermeeting period, th e effective federal funds and o vernight Eurodollar 
rates traded within the target range.4  Overnight Treasury repo  rates declined in mid-
November but generally stayed above the ON RRP offering rate.  The volume of triparty 
repo trades at rates below 25 basi s points stayed small, and some evidence suggests these 
trades mostly reflected lenders  without access to the ON RRP fa cility.  
Rates on term money ma rket instruments appear consistent with firming 
expectations for a December rate  hike.  In particular, the term  structure of CP and other 
term money market instruments rotated up over the intermeeting period (see the box 
“Expectations for Money Market Ra tes in Coming Weeks” for a bro ader discussion).   
3 The Desk reinvested $24 billion of maturing Treasury securitie s, purchased $42 billion of 
15- and 30-year MBS under the reinvestment program, and has rol led $0.1 billion of expected MBS 
settlements over the intermeeting period.  To test operational readiness, the Desk successfully conducted 
two small-value agency MBS sales operations on November 29 and December 1 and a small-value 
Treasury sales operation on December 6. 
4 Both the effective federal funds and Eurodollar rates averaged 41 basis points over the 
intermeeting period.

Expectations for Money Market Rates in Coming Weeks 
Term money market rates can be used to calculate implied forward short -term 
interest rates that will prevail following the December 2016 FOMC meeting as 
well as around year -end. As reported in the following table s, term money market 
rates seem to embed an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at 
the December FOMC meeting . Most forward rates point to only modest year-
end pressures in U.S. money markets , but there are some signs of year -end 
pressures evident in global dollar funding markets based on FX basis swaps. 
Table 1 calculates expected money market rates for the week after the December 
FOMC meeting. Implied one -week forward rates, as shown in column 1, are 
derived from the difference in spot money market rates with three- and two -
week maturities. As shown in column 2, assuming 90 percent probability of a 
policy tightening and adjusting for term premiums, investors appear to anticipate 
that money market rates will rise about 25 basis points after the FOMC meeting. 1 
Around year -end, m oney market rates typically deviate from their normal levels , 
as market participants try to make their balance sheets ap pear safer than usual .  
Consistent with past years , as shown in the top panel of table 2, the OIS and 
Treasury bill rates are expected to decline at year -end , while the commercial 
paper rate is expected to increase. However, these anticipated moves are fairly 
modest. In contrast, there have been clear signs of year -end pressures in global 
funding markets. As shown in the bottom panel of table 2, one -month FX swap -
implied basis spreads moved up sharply when the ir maturity date s crossed year -
end , comparable in magnitude to what was o bserved last year . 
1 Assuming a higher probability of a policy rate hike or a more negative term premium

FINANCING CONDITIONS FOR BUSINESSES , MUNICIPALITIES , AND 
HOUSEHOLDS 
Business and Municipal Finance 
Since the November FOMC meeting, financing conditions for nonfi nancial firms 
remained generally accommodative.  Although gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed 
notably in October and November from the brisk pace in the thir d quarter, the decrease in 
corporate bond spreads after the election, which was larger for  speculative-grade bonds, 
suggests that the lower issuance likely does not reflect a tigh tening of financial 
conditions.  In addition, over th e past two months, growth in c ommercial and industrial 
borrowing from banks picked up aft er having dipped some during the third quarter, 
issuance of leveraged loans f rom nonbanks was robust, and CP ou tstanding at 
nonfinancial firms increased on balance.   
Third-quarter earnings for fir ms in the S&P 500 index are estim ated to have 
increased about 8 percent from the previous quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.  The improvement in earnings was gene rally broad based across sectors.  The outlook for 
corporate earnings continued t o show signs of stabilization over the intermeeting period, 
as projections by Wall Street ana lysts for year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 companies 
were revised down only slightly.    
Overall, the credit quality of nonf inancial corporations remained solid.  The 
volume of corporate bond rating dow ngrades in October and Novem ber outpaced that of 
upgrades but was moderate compared with levels seen in the firs t half of the year.  The 
six-month trailing bond default rate edged down in October, and  the KMV expected year-
ahead default measure also declin ed modestly over the intermeet ing period; however, 
both indicators remained somewhat elevated compared with their ranges in recent years. 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative on 
balance.  Gross issuance remai ned solid in October, and yields on general obligation 
bonds rose somewhat more than tho se on comparable-maturity Trea sury securities over 
the intermeeting period, reportedl y reflecting expected reductions in the tax benefit of 
municipal bonds.  The credit qua lity of state and local governm ents remained stable as 
the number of ratings downgrad es has only moderately outpaced t he number of upgrades 
thus far in the fourth quarter.

Available indicators suggest that financing conditions in comme rcial real estate 
(CRE) also remained largely accommodative.  The average rate of  growth of CRE loans 
at banks continued to be strong i n October and November.  Over the intermeeting period, 
spreads on CMBS narrowed a little  and CMBS issuance continued t o outpace the low 
levels seen in the first half  of 2016.  The CMBS delinquency ra te continued to move up 
but remained low.   
Overall, small business credit  supply conditions were generally  stable over the 
past quarter.  Small businesses’ c redit demand was little changed but remained weak, and 
anecdotal reports indicate that demand will continue to be subd ued in coming quarters.   
Household Finance 
The interest rate on 30-year fix ed mortgages moved up in line w ith comparable-
maturity Treasury yields to its h ighest level since the summer of last year, although the 
rate remained at a low level by hi storical standards and mortgage availability appeared 
little changed.  Partly owing to the i ncrease in interest rates, indicators and staff models 
suggest that refinance origin ations decreased in November and a re likely to fall further in 
December.  Purchase originations, which are typically less sens itive to changes in interest 
rates, are likely to be lit tle changed through December.    
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative, on 
balance, through the third quart er.  Consumer loan balances increased at a year-over-year 
rate of about 6 percent through Sep tember.  Consumer credit con tinued to be broadly 
available, although credit card loa n growth at banks moderated over October and 
November.  Moreover, extensions of new credit to subprime auto loan borrowers edged 
down in the third quarter, and cre dit card lending  standards ap peared to remain tight for 
subprime borrowers.  Consumer ABS spreads were little changed o ver the intermeeting 
period, and ABS issuance so far i n the fourth quarter has roughly matched its third-
quarter pace.  Meanwhile, measures of consumer credit quality w ere little changed in the 
third quarter.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as broa dly in line with the average o ver the past 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  One new source of uncertainty pertains to the question 
of what policy changes may follow from the recent U.S. election  outcomes.  Uncertainty 
about policy is evident in the opt ions-implied expected volatil ity associated with longer-
term Treasury securities, which has moved up since the election .  The Baker, Bloom, and 
Davis index of economic policy un certainty has fluctuated widel y since the election and, 
as of this writing, is substantia lly higher than before the election.  This heightened 
uncertainty about policy does not appear to have spilled over to the main private-sector 
measures:  Options-based indexe s of expected stock market volatility remain at subdued 
levels, as do corporate bond spreads.  Moreover, in the staff’s  October quarterly 
quantitative surveilla nce assessment, the vul nerabilities in th e U.S. financial system 
continued to be judged as moderate.  
We have maintained our assumption t hat the risks to our GDP pro jection are tilted 
to the downside, importantly beca use monetary policy appears be tter positioned to offset 
large positive shocks than subs tantial adverse ones.  Foreign d evelopments and prospects 
also pose net downside risks to t he U.S. economy.  For example, the Chinese economy 
continues to face the possibility of a hard landing, and Europe  remains rife with political 
and economic risk.  Moreover, in the event of an economic downturn, foreign authorities 
would likely face similar constraints in providing policy stimu lus as in the United States.  
We view the risks around our unemp loyment rate projection as aligned with those for 
GDP and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.   
With regard to inflation, we do not  view the current level of u ncertainty as 
unusually high.  We see importa nt risks to inflation on both the upside and the downside, 
and we view those risks as roughly balanced.  To the downside, some survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are near histori cally low levels.  In 
addition, as shown in one of the alternative scenarios, the pro jected divergence between 
domestic and foreign monetary poli cies could generate greater a ppreciation of the dollar 
than we have anticipated in the  baseline forecast.  To the upside, with the economy

projected to be operating above its long-run potential, inflati on may increase more than 
the staff expects, consistent with the predictions of models th at emphasize nonlinear 
effects of economic slack on inflation.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario explores the 
consequences of continued subdued l abor productivity growth, wh ile the second scenario 
couples this low productivity grow th with faster increases in w ages.  The third scenario 
considers the effects of a future fiscal stimulus that is large r and that has a different 
composition than in the staff ba seline.  By contrast, in the fo urth scenario, the tax cut 
assumed by the staff in the baseline does not materialize.  In the fifth scenario, we 
analyze the effects of an expa nsion of credit supply by the U.S . financial sector.  In the 
sixth scenario, we consider the  possibility that U.S. policy no rmalization leads to a much 
stronger appreciation of the dolla r and to financial turbulence  in the EMEs.  The final 
scenario analyzes the effect of  a banking crisis in Europe.  
The first four scenarios are simulated in the FRB/US model.  Th e fifth scenario 
uses a version of the Gertler–Kar adi DSGE model, which attempts  to describe explicitly 
the behavior of leveraged f inancial intermediaries.1  The sixth and seventh scenarios are 
run in the multicountry SIGMA mod el.  For the two fiscal scenar ios, we assume different 
adjustments to the intercept i n the inertial policy rule used i n the baseline, as we will 
describe in further detail.  In t he other five scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed 
by the same rule as in the baseline.  In all cases, we assume t hat the size and composition 
of the SOMA portfolio fo llow the baseline paths. 
Weaker Productivity 
Labor productivity growth has av eraged only about ½ percent per  year over the 
past six years.  In the baselin e projection, productivity is as sumed to rise at an average 
annual rate of 1 percent i n 2017 and 2018.  However, the recent  sluggish productivity 
gains may persist longer than w e envision in the baseline.  In this scenario, lower trend 
1 Specifically, this scenario is performed using an estimated DS GE model that includes financial 
frictions in the banking sector as described in Mark Gertler an d Peter Karadi (2011), “A Model of 
Unconventional Monetary Policy,” Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 58 (January), pp. 17–34.

total factor productivity growt h is assumed to cause labor prod uctivity growth to remain 
at only ½ percent per year over the next two years before movin g up to the baseline pace.  
The slower growth rate of productivity results in real GDP grow th that is 
½ percentage point lower than in t he baseline.  The revised exp ectations about future 
productivity depress aggregate  demand by a little more than agg regate supply over the 
intermediate term as households  recognize the reduction in their permanent income; as a 
result, labor market conditions  deteriorate, yielding an unempl oyment trajectory that is a 
bit higher than the baseline path.2  Inflation reaches 2 percent by 2019, reflecting the 
increase in firms’ marginal costs from weaker productivity.  The path for the federal 
funds rate is essentially unchange d from the baseline, as the effect of a slightly higher 
path for the unemployment rate  is offset by mildly higher inflation. 
Weaker Productivity and Faster Wage Growth 
In the baseline, although the unemp loyment rate is persistently  below the natural 
rate of unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consistent wit h the modest response of 
prices to economic activity seen i n recent years.  However, there is considerable 
uncertainty about the relations hip between resource slack and w age setting, and it is 
possible that wages may prove more sensitive to a tight labor m arket than we have 
assumed and that the resulting h igher wages may pass through in to higher prices.  In this 
scenario, wage inflation responds  more to economic slack than assumed in the baseline, 
resulting in larger gains in labor compensation.  Additionally,  as in the previous scenario, 
we assume that the pickup in lab or productivity growth projecte d by the staff in 2017 and 
2018 does not materialize.3 
Higher wages and lower productivity imply higher marginal costs  of production, 
and in the FRB/US model, these higher costs pass through to pri ce inflation.  
Accordingly, PCE prices accelerate more than in the baseline an d more than in the 
preceding scenario, rising 2.7 percent in 2019.  Similar to the  preceding scenario, the 
weaker path of labor productiv ity holds down real GDP growth.  The steeper path of 
2 A different version of this sce nario, in which lower labor productivity is associated with tighter 
labor market conditions, can be found in the April 2016 Tealboo k scenario “Weaker Labor Productivity, 
Stronger Labor Market.”

inflation turns out to be the str onger influence on the federal  funds rate, which moves up 
½ percentage point more th an in the baseline.   
Larger Fiscal Stimulus 
In the baseline projection, the  staff is assuming a cut in pers onal income taxes 
equal to 1 percent of GDP debu ting in 2017:Q3.  In this scenari o, we study the effect of a 
fiscal stimulus that is larger and that has a different composition:  In addition to the tax 
cut considered in the baseline , we assume an increase in government purchases equal to 
1 percent of GDP, phased in from 2017:Q3 onward.4  We assume that half of the 
additional government spending is directed to public infrastructure.5  In the long run, the 
intercept of the policy rule c onverges to a level that is 25 ba sis points higher than in the 
baseline, and the 10-year Treas ury rate is revised up about twi ce as much as in the 
baseline.   
Real GDP growth is 0.3 percentage  point higher than in the baseline, on average, 
in 2018 and 2019, reflecting the e ffect on aggregate demand of the additional government 
spending.  The unemployment rate follows a lower path, bottomin g out at 3.7 percent in 
2019.  The tighter resource utiliz ation puts upward pressure on inflation, which reaches 
2.4 percent by the end of 2021.6  As a result, the federal funds rate follows a steeper path 
than in the baseline, passing 5 percent in 2021. 
No Fiscal Stimulus 
There is substantial uncertai nty regarding the degree of possible additional fiscal 
stimulus.  This scenario posits t hat the tax cut assumed in the  baseline does not 
materialize.  As a consequence , we also unwind the adjustments to the rule for setting the 
4 In particular, we assume that the additional government spendi ng is phased in over a four-year 
period.  Spending returns gradually to the baseline thereafter.
5 To capture possible supply-sid e effects of additional governme nt spending, we assume that 
government investment in physical capital has an annual rate of  return of 7 percent, c onsistent with the 
estimate in Congressional Budget Office (2016), The Macroeconomic and Budgetary Effects of Federal 
Investment (Washington: CBO, June), www.cbo.gov/publication/51628 .  This rate of return, together with 
the size and gradual implementation of government spending on i nfrastructure assumed in this scenario, 
implies only a negligible additional effect on output.  
6 In this scenario and the next one, the responses of inflation are likely larger than the revisions 
that the staff would implement using its judgmental apparatus, as inflation in FRB/US generally moves 
more with demand than it does in  the staff judgmental projectio n.

federal funds rate and to the l ong-term interest rate term prem ium made in the baseline 
projection.7 
Without the tax cut, real GDP gr owth is slightly weaker than in  the baseline and 
unemployment is higher; by 2020, the difference in the unemployment rate relative to the 
baseline reaches ¼ percentage point.  In addition, inflation fo llows a lower trajectory.8 
These developments—as well as the adjustment to the policy rule —imply a lower path of 
the federal funds rate, which i s 0.7 percentage po int below the  baseline at the end 
of 2021. 
Financial-Sector Expansion 
In the third quarter of 2016 U.S . banks reported strong profits  relative to the 
recent past, and share prices for U.S. financial intermediaries have increased more than 
30 percent in the second half of the year, turning what had bee n a year-to-date decline 
into a gain of more than 20 percent.9  In this scenario, we cons ider the possibility that 
investor sentiment toward the fin ancial sector continues to imp rove.   
In particular, we calibrate positiv e financial shocks that indu ce a 20 percent 
increase in the market capitaliz ation of the financial sector, compared with the baseline, 
over the first two quarters of 2017.  In the model used to generate this scenario, the net worth of financial-sector firms is a key determinant of their a bility to provide funds to 
nonfinancial firms, so that a high er value increases credit supply and leads, in turn, to 
higher investment.  As a conse quence, GDP rises 2¾ percent over the next four quarters, 
compared with 2¼ percent in the baseline, and the unemployment rate decreases to 
4.1 percent by 2018.  In this scenario , the movement of inflati on is limited in part because 
of a flat Phillips cu rve estimated in the model, but also becau se higher investment causes 
downward pressure on marginal cost s by increasing the marginal product of labor.  
Consequently, the path of the federal funds rate is only a touch higher than in the 
baseline.
10 
7 See the discussion on key background factors in the Domestic Economic Developments and 
Outlook section. 
8 The delta in the unemployment rate relative to the baseline co mes very close to unwinding the 
effect that was built into the baseline; for inflation, the Phi llips curve in the model is a bit steeper than in 
the staff judgmental apparatus so the inflation effect is a little larger. 
9 These numbers refer to the performance of the S&P 500 bank ind ex. 
10 This scenario may represent a “ best case,” as we only consider  a short-lived expansion of the 
financial sector and abstract from the possible adverse effects  for financial stability arising from a 
prolonged credit boom.

Stronger Dollar and EME Financial Turbulence 
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate abo ut 5 percent over the 
forecast period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster  than markets currently 
appear to expect.  The normaliza tion of U.S. mo netary policy, h owever, could well cause 
a more pronounced and persistent appreciation of the dollar, es pecially if higher U.S. 
interest rates generate  financial turbulen ce in vulnerable EMEs.  In this scenario, we 
assume that the broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the end of next 
year and that EME corporate borrowing spreads rise substantiall y in the face of persistent 
capital outflows from EMEs.  Despi te weakening macroeconomic co nditions in EMEs, 
EME central banks are assumed to tighten monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure 
on inflation arising from the de preciation of their currencies.   All told, foreign GDP 
growth runs, on average, about ¾ pe rcentage point below the bas eline over the next 
two years. 
The stronger dollar and weaker  foreign growth depress U.S. real  net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP grow th moderates to just 1.5 percen t in the second half of 
2017, about ¾ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Lowe r import prices and 
weaker economic activity cause  core PCE inflation to be, on ave rage, only 1¼ percent in 
2017.  The federal funds rate follow s a shallower path than in the baseline, rising to about 
2½ percent by the end of 2019. 
Banking Crisis in Europe 
Europe’s banking sector has many underlying vulnerabilities, in cluding tepid 
earnings prospects, weak capit al positions, and high levels of nonperforming loans.  
Accordingly, we think there is so me chance that a major Europea n bank will experience a 
severe deterioration in its liquidity and capital conditions, r equiring the bank to be 
resolved and restructured.  The need to resolve a systemically important European bank, 
especially if the process is me ssy, could well precipitate a lo ss in confidence in Europe’s 
banking system more generally and i n the authorities’ abilities  to address these problems.  
In this scenario, we consider t he possibility that a resolution  of a major European bank 
leads to a banking crisis that pr oduces sizable adverse financi al spillovers to both the 
United States and the r est of the world.  
Specifically, this scenario assumes that financial conditions i n Europe tighten 
significantly and that household a nd business confidence declin e amid rising 
unemployment and heightened disinflationary pressures.  European corporate borrowing

spreads rise more than 100 basis points, and household borrowin g spreads also rise 
noticeably.  With little scope for the ECB to reduce long-term sovereign yields, Europe 
falls into recession, with GDP  bottoming out about 4 percent be low the baseline by the 
end of 2018.  The crisis has adverse spillovers to the United S tates:  U.S. corporate bond 
spreads rise about 50 basis points , while flight-to-safety flow s cause the broad real dollar 
to appreciate 5 percent.  
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline.  U.S . domestic demand also declines r elative to the baseline as a 
result of lower confidence and weaker financial conditions. All told, U.S. real GDP 
growth moderates to ju st under 1.5 percent in 2017 and 2018.  T he U.S. unemployment 
rate runs at nearly 5 percent in 2018, ½ percenta ge point highe r than in the baseline.  
Lower resource utilization and fa lling import prices reduce U.S . core inflation to 
1 percent in the second half of  2017.  The federal funds rate f ollows a shallower path, 
reaching only 2¼ percent at the end of 2019, compared with 3¼ p ercent in the baseline.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Prediction Intervals Derived from 
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors
This technical note provides additional details about the exhibit “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent values of four key economic variables: 
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year and the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out software and intellectual property 
products from the currently published data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the food away from home component for years 
before it was included in core.) 
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of the series during the indicated time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are plotted for each series. To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data 
going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; we used estimates from Lebergott (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts with the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated for 1980 through 2014, yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 
1998 through 2014 were used.  This shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the distribution of inflation since the m id-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast. The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range to 90 percent. The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for only a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chip consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congressional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average cha nge to the staff’s one -year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year-ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limitations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemployment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a similar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on 
forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are much more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-back, and three-year-back values as of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corresponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions, which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the prediction intervals are created.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
