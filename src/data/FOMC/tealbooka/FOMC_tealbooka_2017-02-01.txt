Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Our assessment of the broad macroeconomic situation has not cha nged materially 
since the time of our previous projection, and incoming data su ggest that the economy is 
continuing to expand at a moderate  rate.  Over the second half of 2016, real GDP now 
appears to have increased about 2¾ percent at an annual rate, a  little faster than in our 
December forecast.  However, the  additional strength reflects f actors that we think will 
prove transitory and reverse ear ly this year.  Consequently, th e level of GDP in the 
second quarter of this year is roughly unrevised from our earlier projection.  Moreover, 
the labor market continued to improve gradually through year-en d, much as we had 
anticipated.  Overall , we view the econom y as currently operati ng a little above its 
sustainable level, with rea l GDP about ½ percent above potential output and the 
unemployment rate—a t 4.7 percent—¼ percenta ge point below its n atural rate.  
 Over the medium term, we con tinue to project that real GDP will increase about 
2 percent per year in 2017 and 2018—about the same as its pace in 2016—before 
slowing slightly to 1¾ percent i n 2019 as monetary policy continues to tighten.  With 
GDP increasing faster than potential, the output gap widens to 1¾ percent at the end of 
2019, which is a tick wider than in the December projection.  C orrespondingly, the 
unemployment rate is project ed to fall to 4.1 percent in 2019—j ust a touch lower than in 
the December projection and near ly 1 percentage point below our  estimate of its natural 
rate.  
Our inflation projection is also little revised relative to Dec ember.  We continue to 
project that total PCE price inflation will move up gradually t o 1.9 percent in 2019; core 
PCE inflation also drifts h igher and now rounds up to 2.0 percent in 2019.  Relative to 
2016, a variety of small factors  push up core inflation over th e medium term, including 
the fading effects of earlier  declines in energy prices and non -energy import prices and 
tightening resource  utilization.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff ’s projection for real GDP growth  in 2017 and 2018 is a touch below the 
project ions from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip 
consensus forecast .  The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is a bit below Blue 
Chip in 2018 and the rather outdated SPF survey  in 2017 .  The s taff’s inflation 
projection is  rough ly in line with the outside forecasters for the CPI  but below the SPF 
forecast s for PCE price inflation  in 2017 and 2018 .

  coming months and years.  As a re sult, we have retained our pla ceholder 
assumption that the new Administration will implement adjustmen ts to fiscal 
policy that increase the annual “primary” budget deficit (that is, the deficit 
excluding interest costs) by 1 per cent of GDP; for now, we also  continue to 
assume that this fiscal expansion takes the form of a cut in pe rsonal income 
taxes that begins in the thir d quarter of 2017.  This fiscal ex pansion is 
projected to boost the growth rate of real GDP about ¼ percenta ge point per 
year in 2017, 2018, and 2019 (exclusive of multiplier effects a nd any offsets 
from higher interest rates and the dollar).1 
 We continue to project that all discretionary policy actions ac ross federal, 
state, and local governments will  increase real GDP growth ½ pe rcentage 
point in 2017 and roughly ¼ percen tage point in both 2018 and 2 019.    
Monetary Policy  
 The intercept-adjusted inertia l Taylor (1999) rule, which we us e to 
mechanically set the federal f unds rate in our projection, calls for the federal 
funds rate to increase about 1 percentage point per year, on av erage, over the 
projection period and to average  3.4 percent in the fourth quar ter of 2019.2  
The path for the federal funds r ate is essentially unchanged fr om our 
December projection. 
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at it s current 
level through the third quarter of 2017 and then begin to contr act, as the 
proceeds from maturing assets are no longer reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise significantly o ver the medium 
term, from an average of 2.5 percen t in the current quarter to 3.9 percent by 
                                                 
1 We estimate that delaying the i ntroduction of the fiscal polic y change until the beginning of 2018 
would lower the level of real G DP at the end of  2019 by about 0 .1 percent (inclusive of multiplier effects 
and offsets from higher interest  rates and the dollar) and raise the unemployment ra te by roughly half a 
tenth.  In the Risks and Uncertainty section, we present scenar ios exploring some alternative possibilities 
regarding the size and composition of the fiscal expansion. 
2 We have maintained the upward adjustment introduced in the December Tealbook that boosted 
the intercept in the longer run b y ¼ percentage point to take a ccount of the greater  fiscal stimulus.

  the end of the projection period, the same endpoint as in the D ecember 
Tealbook.   
 The paths for triple-B corporat e bond yields and 30-year fixed mortgage rates 
are also little revised. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 Equity prices have risen about 2¾ percent since the December Te albook.  The 
increase was a little larger t han we had anticipated, and we vi ew it as reducing 
the scope for further stock pric e appreciation over the medium term.  As a 
result, we now project that equity prices will rise about 1 per cent per year on 
average over the projection pe riod, compared with the 1¼ percen t rate of 
appreciation in the December Tealbook.   
 According to the latest data, hous e prices have been rising fas ter in recent 
months than we had expected and faster than the average growth rate over the 
previous year.  We think that th e brisk pace of house price gro wth partly 
reflects a stronger effect of  housing supply constraints than w e previously 
anticipated.  Because we expect these constraints to abate only  gradually, we 
have raised our projection for  house price growth through 2019.   We now 
project that home values will rise at an annual average rate of  4½ percent over 
the medium term.  By the e nd of 2019, the projected level of ho use prices is 
2½ percent higher than in the December Tealbook.  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign real GDP rose at an est imated annual rate of 2¼ percent  in the fourth 
quarter—up slightly from its avera ge growth rate over the prior  couple of 
quarters.  Consistent with conti nued solid readings on activity, we expect 
foreign growth of 2½ percent in the current quarter.  Growth sh ould remain at 
about that pace through the rest of the forecast period, suppor ted by 
accommodative policies in the advanced foreign economies and a moderate 
recovery in Latin America.  Thi s forecast is little changed rel ative to the 
December Tealbook.   
 The broad nominal dollar has a ppreciated about ½ percent since the time of 
the December Tealbook, primarily reflecting a further sizable a ppreciation 
relative to the Mexican peso.  W e expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at 
Domestic Econ Devel & Outlook

  roughly a 1¼ percent annual rate through the forecast period, a s market 
expectations for the federal f unds rate move up toward the staf f forecast.  
Relative to the December Tealbook, our dollar projection is lit tle changed. 
Oil and Commodity Prices 
 Oil markets have been relativel y quiet since the agreements lat e last year 
between OPEC and some non-OPEC  countries to cut production.  Th e spot 
price of Brent crude oil is now  trading at $55 per barrel, and the December 
2019 futures price is currently  just over $56.50 per barrel—bot h little changed 
since the December Tealbook.  Fo llowing these futures quotes, w e continue to 
project that oil prices will re main roughly flat over the mediu m term.   
 Prices for industrial metals, a fter increasing sharply in late 2016, have edged 
higher since the time of the December Tealbook on concerns abou t labor-
related supply disruptions and s ome greater Chinese demand.  Fo od and 
agricultural prices also edged up a bit because of concerns abo ut both the 
supply of sugar from Brazil and dr y conditions in the Great Pla ins, which may 
affect the supply of wheat.    
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the second half 
of 2016 after rising only 1 percent in the first half.  The ste p-up in growth from the first to 
the second half of last year, whi ch is a little larger than we projected in December, 
reflected the stabiliz ation of inventory inve stment as well as bigger gains in government 
spending and private domestic f inal purchases.  The upward revision to output growth in 
the second half of last year i s roughly mirrored by weaker grow th in the first half of this 
year, leaving the average pace essentially unchanged.  We now p roject real GDP to grow 
at a little less than a 2 percent rate in the first half of thi s year.  
 By our estimate, consumer spendi ng rose at an annual rate of 2¾  percent in 
the fourth quarter.  We expect g rowth in the first half of this year to be only 
slightly less brisk, supported by continued gains in employment and 
household income, earlier inc reases in household wealth, and up beat

  consumer sentiment.3  We were somewhat sur prised by the strength of 
consumption growth in the fourth quarter (which we have revised up almost 
¾ percentage point since the December Tealbook).  But the surpr ise reflected 
stronger-than-expected increases  in the consumption of energy s ervices and 
purchases of motor vehicles, whi ch we expect to largely unwind this quarter.  
This downward revision to grow th of consumer spending accounts for much 
of the small downward revisi on to near-term GDP growth.  
 Incoming indicators suggest that investment in equipment and in tangibles 
(E&I) rose moderately in the fourth quarter following net declines earlier in the year.  Given recent increases in orders of nondefense capital goods and a 
widespread improvement in busines s sentiment, we project E&I in vestment 
will grow at about a 4 percent pace in the first half of this y ear.
4  We also 
project nonresidential structures  investment will grow at a 4½ percent pace 
over the first half of this year as investment in drilling and mining structures 
starts to rebound somewhat following two years of steep decline s. 
 After falling back in the middle of 2016, residential investmen t now appears 
to be increasing at a moderate pace.  In the fourth quarter, st arts and permits 
for single-family housing remaine d above their average pace in the first half 
of 2016; sales of new and existing h omes also remained solid th rough 
November.5  However, with mortgage rates ha ving risen notably since early  
                                                 
3 While we view the level of cons umer sentiment as supportive of  consumption growth, we have 
taken little signal from the sharp improvement in sentiment in December.  The Decembe r jump, which was 
sustained in the preliminary January Michigan survey release, a ppears to be related to the election.  A 
recent research paper examines presidential elections since 200 0 and finds that such election-related 
movements in sentiment have had little effect on consumer spend ing (see Atif Mian, Amir Sufi, and Nasim 
Khoshkhou (2015), “Government Economic Policy, Sentiments, and Consumption,” NBER Working Paper 
Series 21316 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Re search, July), 
www.nber.org/papers/w21316?sy=316 ).  However, in the Risks and Uncertainty section we explore th e 
implications of a more pronounced upshift in aggregate demand. 
4 In addition to solid improvements in the activity indexes from  the ISM and the Philadelphia Fed, 
from which we usually take signal for investment spending, we h ave also seen outsize d gains in business 
sentiment in other surveys, such as the one from the National F ederation of Independe nt Business and the 
Conference Board’s CE O confidence survey.  We will continue to monitor these surveys to see whether the 
recent gains persist. 
5 We received data on housing sta rts for December too late for i nclusion in the staff baseline 
forecast.

  November, we expect residential  investment to essentially flatten out over the 
first half of this year.6   
 Inventory investment added about ¼ percentage point to GDP grow th in the 
second half of last year after subtracting ¾ percentage point f rom growth in 
the first half.  The staff’s flow-of-goods system shows invento ry-to-sales 
ratios near comfortable levels i n most sectors outside of energ y (inventories of 
energy products remain very high), and thus we expect inventory  investment 
to have little effect on GDP growth in the first half of this y ear. 
 After adding nearly 1 percentage point to U.S. G DP growth in th e third 
quarter, net exports are current ly estimated to have subtracted  about 
1 percentage point in th e fourth quarter—a bi t more than expected in the 
December Tealbook, as recent export data have been weak.  Net e xports are 
projected to subtract just over  ½ percentage point from real GDP growth in 
the first half of 2017 as imports  continue to respond to firmin g U.S. demand 
and as a strong dollar boosts im ports and restrains exports.  
 The level of manufacturing produc tion has changed little, on net, in recent 
months (indeed, since late  2014), restrained by weak export dem and and slow 
domestic capital investment.  To r eflect the recent strengtheni ng in the new 
orders indexes in the national and regional manufacturing surve ys, we have 
marked up slightly manufacturing p roduction in the first half o f this year, but 
growth is projected to be mode st, given ongoing headwinds from weak 
foreign demand. 
Over the medium term, real GDP i s projected to increase 2 perce nt in 2017 and 
2018 before easing to 1¾ percent in 2019, as monetary policy co ntinues to tighten.   
 As in the past couple of Tealbooks, we expect potential output growth to creep 
up gradually from 1½ percent this  year to 1¾ percent at the end  of the 
medium term, owing to a small acceleration in structural labor productivity.  
                                                 
6 Consistent with our models and t he experience of the “taper ta ntrum” in 2013, we expect higher 
rates to reduce sales and constr uction with a lag of a few mont hs.  Such a delay may partly reflect a 
temporary offsetting boost to demand from prospective homebuyers who jump into the market before rates 
increase further.  Indeed, in the  Michigan survey there has bee n an increase in the number of respondents 
reporting that it is a good time  to buy a home in advance of ra te increases.

   With GDP growth expected to outp ace our estimate of potential g rowth over 
the medium term, aggregate outpu t moves further above our estim ate of its 
sustainable level.  At the end of 2019, we forecast real GDP to be 1¾ percent 
above its potential level. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The incoming data suggest that the labor market continued to ti ghten gradually 
through the end of last year.   
 Total nonfarm payroll employment is reported to have increased an average of 
165,000 per month from October through December, about as expec ted and 
well above the range of 80,000 to 110,000 per month that we jud ge is 
consistent with an unchanged unemployment rate and labor force participation 
declining in parallel  with its trend path.   
 After dropping to 4.6 percent in Nove mber, the unemployment rat e ticked up 
to 4.7 percent in December.  For the  quarter as a whole, the un employment 
rate averaged 4.7 percent—down 0.3 per centage point from the sa me period a 
year earlier.  Looking ahead, we expect the unemployment rate t o remain at 
this level through the middle of  this year, unrevised from the December 
Tealbook. 
 The labor force participati on rate (LFPR) edged back up to 62.7 percent in 
December, the same level as its average in the fourth quarter.  Over the past 
year the LFPR has moved up a bit,  which, when judged relative t o its 
declining trend, represents a ti ghtening in the labor market.  We expect the 
participation rate to remain a t 62.7 percent through the first half of 2017. 
 Combining the unemployment rate  and the LFPR, we see the employ ment-to-
population ratio as currently a lit tle above its structural trend. 
 Other indicators of labor marke t conditions have also continued  to improve.  
The share of employed individua ls working part time for economi c reasons 
declined over 2016, as did the share of the long-term unemploye d in overall 
unemployment.  In December, both we re at their lowest levels si nce the 
recession, albeit still somewhat above their averages prior to the recession.  
Layoffs, whether measured by eithe r initial claims or JOLTS dat a, have

  remained low, and households’ assessments of job availability h ave continued 
to rise.  Further, the labor market conditions index, or LMCI, increased 
slightly over the past three months, driven by improvements both in 
employment and hiring indicators and in consumer and business assessments 
of the jobs situation. 
 Labor productivity in the business sector is now estimated to h ave increased at 
an annual rate of about 2½ percent in the second half of 2016 after having declined at a ½ percent pace in  the first half of the year.  Th e resulting 
1 percent increase for 2016 as a whole exceeds the average pace  seen over the 
preceding five-year period by about ½ percentage point.   
The medium-term outlook for the  labor market is for continued improvement 
through 2019 but at a gradually slowing pace—a projection that is essentially unrevised 
from the December Tealbook. 
 As real GDP growth slows toward i ts potential rate, average mon thly payroll 
gains are expected to slow from about 180,000 in 2016 and 2017 to about 
160,000 in 2018 and 120,000 in 2019.   
 We project that labor productivit y will increase at an average annual rate of a 
bit less than 1 percent over the projection period, similar to its estimated pace 
in 2016 and close to our estimate  of its structural rate. 
 After falling 1 percentage point cumulatively over the past two  years, the 
unemployment rate is projecte d to continue to decline, but at a  slowing pace—
the unemployment rate falls a  total of only ½ pe rcentage point over the next 
three years.  Similarly, over th e next three years both the lab or force 
participation rate and the emplo yment-to-population ratio conti nue to improve 
relative to their declining trends, but at a slowing pace. 
 By the end of 2019, the unemploymen t rate is projected to reach  4.1 percent, 
nearly 1 percentage poin t below our estimate of its natural rat e.  The level at 
the end of 2019 is just a few basis points lower than our proje ction in the 
December Tealbook.  Both the labor force participation rate and  the 
employment-to-population ratio also end the medium-term project ion 
somewhat above our estimates of their trends.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
On a 12-month-change basis, total  PCE price inflation has continued to rise 
toward the FOMC’s 2 percent obje ctive in recent months, mainly reflecting movements 
in energy prices, while core PCE  price inflation has stayed aro und 1.7 percent.   
 Movements in the price of oil  have pushed up the 12-month chang e in total 
PCE prices from 0.2 percent in the middle of 2015 to an estimat ed 1.6 percent 
at the end of 2016 (based on PPI and CPI data through December) .  We expect 
this 12-month measure to move  up to 2 percent in February and M arch, 
mainly reflecting the effect of  earlier declines  in gasoline pr ices dropping out 
of the calculation; it then eases to 1.8 percent in the second quarter. 
 Based on the most recent data, we estimate that core PCE prices  rose 
1.7 percent in the 12 months through December, a touch below our projection 
in the December Tealbook.  We exp ect core inflation to remain c lose to this 
level over the near term.7   
 Core import prices are now estimated to have declined just slig htly for 2016 
as a whole, and in the first  quarter of 2017 the ongoing drag f rom the dollar is 
expected to push core import prices down at a ¼ percent pace.  Thereafter, we 
expect import price inflation to turn positive and move up to a  ¾ percent rate 
by 2018, consistent with moderate f oreign inflation, a graduall y appreciating 
dollar, and slowly declining commo dity prices.  This path for c ore import 
prices is estimated to have hel d down core PCE price inflation by 
0.2 percentage point in 2016 and is e xpected to reduce core inf lation by 
0.1 percentage point per year over the remainder of the medium term. 
 With regard to longer-term inflation expectations, the incoming  data have 
been mixed.  Median expectations over the next 5 to 10 years fr om the 
University of Michigan Surve ys of Consumers dropped to a histor ic low of 
2.3 percent in December before rebounding to 2.5 percent in the January preliminary report.  The TIPS-base d measure of 5-to-10-year-for ward 
inflation compensation, at about  2 percent, is little changed s ince the 
                                                 
7 Continuing the general pattern in previous years, monthly core  PCE inflation in the first half of 
2016 exceeded its pace in the seco nd half of the year, and we h ave built some residual seasonality into the 
projection.

  December Tealbook after rising notably in the prior couple of m onths.  
Meanwhile the 3-year-ahead measur e of inflation e xpectations in  the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York’s Surv ey of Consumer Expectations tick ed up to 
2.8 percent in December.   
Total PCE inflation is antic ipated to move up to 1.9 percent by 2019, unchanged 
from the December Tealbook.  Core PCE price inflation reaches 2 .0 percent in 2019.  A 
tightening of resource utilizati on and the wani ng pass-through from earlier declines in 
core import and energy prices each contribute a small amount to  the ¼ percentage point 
acceleration in core inflation between 2016 and 2019.  Further,  as in previous Tealbooks, 
we assume a small pickup (5 basis points in each of 2018 and 20 19) in the prevailing 
level of inflation expectations r elevant for wage and price set ting.  In this Tealbook, we 
nudged up the core PCE inflation p rojection a few basis points in 2018 and 2019 to better 
balance the inflation risks in light of the low unemployment ra te, persistently rising house 
prices, and continued strong rent increases.  This adjustment c aused the core inflation 
projection—when rounded to one de cimal place—to edge up 0.1 per centage point in 
2018 and 2019. 
The data on labor compensation r eceived since the previous Teal book have been 
mixed; taken together, however, t hey strike us as broadly consi stent with a labor market 
that is operating close to its sustainable level against a back drop of sluggish trend growth 
in productivity.   
 Average hourly earnings for a ll employees rose 0.4 percent in D ecember 
following a decline in November.  We expect another relatively strong reading 
in January, partly driven by inc reases in minimum wages in a nu mber of 
states.8  Over the past 12 months, this m easure of wages has increased 
2.9 percent after rising at a re latively steady pace of 2 perce nt earlier in the 
recovery period.  
 Compensation per hour in the busine ss sector (as measured in the Productivity 
and Costs release) is now estim ated to have risen 2.9 percent over the four 
                                                 
8 The average state minimum wage is estimated to have risen from  roughly $8.25 to $8.50 per 
hour in January.  Because a small percentage of workers will be  affected by this change, the increase is 
expected to add about 0.1 percentage point to the change in ave rage hourly earnings in January.

  quarters through 2016:Q3.  Based on t he available monthly indic ators, we 
expect the four-quarter change for 2016 as a whole to be 2.5 percent.     
 The latest reading from the Fede ral Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s W age Growth 
Tracker was 3.9 percent in November 2016.9  This movement continues an 
upward trend seen over the past ye ar and brings the increases i n this measure 
of wage growth close to pre-recession levels. 
We continue to project that hourl y labor compensation growth in  the business 
sector (as reflected in the productivity and cost measure) will pick up gradually and reach 
3½ percent by 2019 as the labor mar ket tightens further.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 In the longer run, we continue t o assume a natural rate of unem ployment of 
5 percent and a growth rate of  potential GDP of 1.7 percent. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by the beginning of 2021. 
 With output above its potential and inflation at the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective, the nominal federal f unds rate is about 1 percentage  point above its 
long-run value of 3 percent in 2021 and then moves back toward its long-run 
value thereafter. 
 Real GDP slows to 1.5 percen t in 2020 and 1.3 percent in 2021 as the federal 
funds rate is above its neutral level.  The unemployment rate is 4.2 percent in 
2020 and rises gradually toward its a ssumed natural rate in subsequent years.  
 PCE price inflation moves up f rom 1.9 percent in 2019 and sligh tly 
overshoots the Committee’s long-run objective in 2020 and 2021 before 
gradually convergi ng to 2 percent. 
                                                 
9 The data are 3-month moving averages of the median 12-month ch ange in hourly wages of 
individuals, based on self-reported usual earnings in the Curre nt Population Survey (CPS).  The index 
covers only individuals who earn less than $150,000 per year an d who were employed in both the current 
month of the CPS and one year earlier.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
After rebounding strongly in the third  quarter from the second -quarter pothole, 
total foreign growth moderated to  an estimated  2¼ percent  pace in the fourth  quarter .  
In line with the  recent upbeat  indicators on economic activity, w e project that  foreign 
growth will edge up to 2½ percent—its estimated potential rate —over the next couple of 
quarters and hold at about that pace through 2019, supported by accommodative 
monetary  policies in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and a moderate recovery in 
Latin  America.  This forecast is little changed relative to the December Tealbook.  
Over the past year, markets were recurrently roiled by concerns emanating from 
abroad , but the global economy appears to have weathered the shocks in  2016 fairly well  
and seems to be better positioned going forward.  Some of the global risks  that 
preoccupied markets and policymakers have subsided to some extent, including those associated with further declines in commodity prices, the fallout from Brexit, and  the 
financial stresses in the European banking system.  However, other concerns rema in.  
One such concern is possible turmoil in the emerging market economies (EMEs) in the face of rising U.S. interest rates , further dollar appreciation , and uncertainty regarding 
trade policies.  (See the “Stronger Dollar  and EME Turbulence ” alternative scenario in 
the Risks and Uncertainty section.)  Additionally , the possibility  of a hard landing in 
China remains an important risk , as the credit -easing undertaken by authorities to bolster 
economic growth has heightened the vulnerabilities of the corpora te and financial sectors  
to future shocks.    
Overall, the abatement of some downside risks , along with signs  of strengthening 
industrial production and trade abroad, have led us to contemplate upside risk to our foreign outlook.  Accommodative monetary policy abroad, progress on balance sheet repair, and reduced  fiscal pressures could spur faster foreign  growth than we are currently 
projecting, as discussed in our “Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar” alternative scenario  in the Risks and Uncertainty section .    
Inflation in the AFEs has increased in recent months but remains significantly 
below central banks’ targets.  Overall, we estimate that AFE inflation picked up in the 
fourth  quarter to  an annual rate of  almost 1½ percent, up from ¾ percent in the third 
quarter, largely reflecting an increase in retail energy prices caused  by a lagged pass -
through of higher oil prices.  Going forward, and in line with still- subdued core inflation

 readings, we expect inflation in most of the AFEs to increase only gradually , and in the 
euro area and Japan to remain well below 2 percent even in 2019.  Given the restrained 
outlook for inflation , we continue to expect monetary policy in the AFEs to remain 
accommodative through 2019.  In line with this view, the European Central Bank (ECB) at its December meeting, which occurred just after the close of last  month’s Tealbook, 
announced the extension of its asset purchase program until at least December  2017.   
Inflation also rose in  most EMEs in the fourth quarter, bringing aggregate EME 
inflation to an estimated 3 percent , up from  2¼ percent in the third quarter .  An increase 
in retai l energy prices helped raise inflation from very low levels in emerging Asia, while 
the sharp depreciation of the peso continued to put upward pressure on inflation in Mexico.  In contrast, in South America, growing resource slack as well as  some 
stabilization of currencies in the region helped push inflation down faster than predicted .  
Going forward, EME inflation is expected to average about 3 percent over the forecast period, with declines in Latin America roughly offsetting moderate  increases in Asia.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro Area .  Recent indicators —such as November industrial production and PMI s as 
well as confidence readings  through December —suggest that GDP growth moved up 
to nearly 2 percent in the fourth quarter from 1.4 percent  in the third.  Thereafter, we 
project that  GDP growth will slow  to a still-above-potential pace of 1¾ percent in the 
first quarter  before edging up to almost 2 percent by 2019, supported by 
accommodative monetary policy.  This forecast is a touch stronger than in the December Tealbook as a result of a weaker euro and higher equity prices .  This 
projection takes into account that, with anti-EU sentiment prevalent across the euro area and with national elections in France, Germany , and possibly Italy in 2017, 
elevated political uncertainty is likely to trigger bouts of volatility and financial stress.   
On December 8, the ECB  announced the extension of its asset purchase program —
originally scheduled to last at least through March 2017—until at least 
December  2017; starting in April, however, it will lower  its monthly pace of 
purchases from €80 billion to €60 billion .  Relative to our expectations  at the time of 
the December  Tealbook, the ECB extended the program for a longer period a lbeit at a 
slower pace of purchases.  With core inflation below 1 percent at the end of  2016 and 
headline inflation projected to linger near  1½ percent through 2019, we anticipate that

 the ECB will star t tapering its purchases at the beginning of 2018 and cease them 
entirely by the middle of that year .  We also assume that  the ECB will continue to 
reinvest the proceeds of its progra m during the forecast period  while  keep ing policy 
rates at their  current levels until late  2019.  These assumptions are in line with the 
official statement and press conference that followed the ECB’s January 19 meeting.   
• United Kingdom.  Strong PMIs and confidence indicators thr ough December suggest 
that economic activity was stronger than expected in the fourth quarter , with real 
GDP growing slightly below the 2.3 percent pace recorded in the third  quarter .  We 
project  growth to slow to 1½ percent in 2017 and remain subdued through the rest of 
the forecast period  as still- elevated uncertainty related to Brexit weighs on household 
and business spending.  Formal Brexit talks are expected to start this March, and we 
assume  the U.K. authorities will not reach a deal with the EU  until the end of the 
allotted two -year period in March 2019.  We expect less economic integration post-
Brexit and , thus, a weaker pace of U.K. potential growth .  The projected outlook is a 
touch higher than in the December Tealbook because of further depr eciation of 
sterling, which should support exports, and our sense that Brexit uncertainty  has been 
exerting less drag on growth than we had previously estimated. 
Inflation is expected to rise from 2 percent in the fourth quarter  to 3½ percent in the 
first quarter  and to remain above the Bank of England’s (BOE) 2  percent target 
through early 2018 as past exchange rate depreciation passes  through to consumer 
prices .  We expect the BOE to  complete  its sovereign bond purchase program early 
this year  and to increase its policy  rate 25 basis points in late  2017 but to continue 
purchasing corporate bonds through the first quarter  of 2018. 
• Canada.  After a strong rebound in activity in the third quarter, led by a recovery in 
oil production, we estimate that Canadian GDP growth moderated to 2 percent in the 
fourth quarter, little changed from our December forecast.  Monthly GDP  for October 
contracted  unexpectedly , but more -recent indicators —such as manufacturing 
production and PMIs through December—were more buoyant.  Going forward, w e 
project GDP growth to remain at around 2 percent in 2017, supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, before edging down  in 2018.  Relative 
to the December Tealbook, this projection is a touch weaker in 20 17, primarily  
reflecting a stronger Canadian dollar.

 • Japan.  Following a major revision of the national accounts data, t hird-quarter  real 
GDP growth was revised down to 1.3 percent from 2.2 percent.  However, growth in 
the first half of 2016 was marked up almost 1  percentage point to 2.3 percent.  R ecent 
data—including consumer confidence, PMIs, and industrial production—suggest that GDP rose  1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, about ¼ percentage point higher than 
previously projected.  W e expect GDP growth to decline to just under 1 percent 
through the end of 2018 before stalling in 2019 as a result of a planned consumption tax hike.   Japanese inflation was barely positive in the fourth quarter and is projected 
to rise to only 1¼ percent by 2019.  We anticipate the Bank of Japan will continue its 
aggressive asset purchases and keep the 10 -year yield near zero during the forecast 
period but not introduce further easing measures.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China.   We have revised up our estimate of real  GDP growth in the fourth quarter  to 
6¾ percent, ½ percentage point above our December Tealbook estimate, and in line with recent data for i ndustrial production, manufacturing PMIs, and foreign trade.  
We expect some of this additional momentum in the industrial sector to carry over into the first half of 2017.  Nonetheless, we see growth edging down to 6¼ percent in 
2017 and slow ing further  to 5¾ percent by 2019 as policy stimulus fades , with 
authorities tak ing further steps to rein  in credit growth .  Although downside risks are 
significant—including the possibility of a sharp adjustment in the property market, a 
run on the financial system, and  a destabilizing  currency  depreciation —in our 
baseline we continue  to expect authorities to be able to manage these risks.  
Consumer price i nflation in China increased to an estimated 2½ percent in the fourth 
quarter  from 1 .3 percent in the third as previous declines in food prices faded.  We 
expect inflation to hover around 2½ percent over the forecast period.  Meanwhile, producer price inflation rose sharply in recent months after years of deflation , but the 
increases in producer prices are concentrated in the mining and raw materials sectors,  
which have generated little pass -through to consumer prices in the past. 
 
• Other Emerging Asia .  Real GDP g rowth is estimated to  have declined from 
3¾ percent in the third quarter  to 3¼ percent in the fourth quarter , largely driven by a 
sharp slowdown in India following outsized third- quarter growth .  The slowdown in 
India is due importantly to the negative effects of the demonetization effort.  For the other economies in the region, fourth -quarter growth was revised up, as incoming

 indicators—such as PMI s, industrial production, and exports—point to an upturn in 
their export- oriented manufacturing sector s, including the high -tech sector .  We 
expect growth  in the region to pick up to 3¾ percent  in the first half of 2017, a touch 
higher than our December forecast , and to remain roughly at that pace through the 
end of 2019.  
Inflation in emerging Asia ex cluding China is e stimated to have increased to 
2¾ percent in the fourth quarter , up from 1 per cent in the third  quarter , on the back of 
higher retail  energy prices.  W e project  inflation  to pick  up to 3½ percent by the end 
of the forecast period , driven by higher commodity prices and  currency  depreciation. 
• Mexico.   Incoming data support our view that real GDP growth decreased  to 
2 percent in the fourth quarter —down ½ percentage point from the December 
Tealbook—from 4 percent in the third.  Manufacturing PMIs and exports have been 
disappoint ing recently, consistent with the ongoing weakness in U.S. manufacturing, 
while  deteriorating  consumer confidence suggests that household demand is 
softening.  We see GDP growth dropping further to 1½ percent  this quarter  as 
heightened uncertainty over U.S. trade policy weighs on private investment and January’s 15 percent hike on fuel prices crimps household demand.  Thereafter, we 
expect growth to  move gradually  up to 2¾ percent by 2019, supported by the peso’s 
30 percent real depreciation since mid -2014 and a boost from reforms to the  energy 
sector.  The first -quarter projection is revised down ½ percentage point relative to the 
December Tealbook. 
 
We expect Mexican headline inflation to step up further to 6½ percent in the first  
quarter  from about 4 percent in the fourth, largely driven by sharp  hikes in gasoline 
prices.  These hikes are part of t he government’s deregulation plan, which would 
allow  gasoline and diesel prices to  reflect market conditions  by the end of this year.  
With  the peso depreciation and gas oline price  increases putting upward pressure on 
inflation, we expect the Bank of Mexico  to tighten monetary policy further, on top of 
the 275 basis point increase in the policy rate  since late  2015 (including a 50 basis 
point rate hike in December ).  W e see inflation settling at 3¼ percent , a little above 
the 3 percent mid point of the target range, by 2018.  
• Brazil.   Recent data—including weak industrial production, falling manufacturing 
PMI, low confidence readings, and rising unemployment—suggest that the Brazilian 
economy remained mired in recession in the fourth quarter , but the pace of

 contraction was slower than in the third quarter.  In the current quarter  we expect the 
economy to bottom out, with GDP rising a tepid 1½ percent for 2017 as a whole and 
2¼ percent in 2019.  Growth will be supported by accommodative monetary policy 
and fiscal reform s.  Despite periodic bouts of political tension  in the aftermath of the 
Petrobras scandal and the impeachment of the previous president, the government has 
succeeded in making progress on fiscal reform, including a cap on government 
spending growth equal to the inflation rate.   
A faster -than-expected decline in inflation in December to  a 12-month rate of 
6.3 percent , just below the upper bound of the central bank’s target range, has offered 
some respite .  Against the backdrop of weak economic activity, a strengthening 
currency,  and declining inflation, we expect  more monetary easing than previously 
anticipated .  Indeed, the Brazilian Central Bank reduced its policy rate 75 basis points 
at its January meeting , a larger -than-expected cut .  
• Turkey.   Throughout 2016, financial pressures on Turkey had been growing  in the 
wake of a failed coup attempt, general geopolitical and security concerns , and rating 
downgrades by Moody’s and S&P .  As a result , real GDP shrank at a double- digit 
annual rate in the third quarter , the largest quarterly decline since the Glob al Financial 
Crisis.  Since the beginning of the year, market concerns about Turkey have 
intensified, including an 8½ percent depreciation of the Turkish lira against the dollar.  
The pressures on Turkish assets appear to be exacerbated by recent terrorist  attacks  
and concerns about the government’s response to inflation risks .  These developments 
are occurring  amid an environment of significant external financing needs, slowing 
economic growth , and escalation of political and geopolitical uncertainty.   With  
12-month inflation rising to 8.6 percent in December, significantly above the 7 percent upper bound of the central bank’s target range, the central bank is widely 
expected to raise its policy rate at its next meeting on January  24.  However, some 
observe rs fear that political pressures could limit the central bank’s ability to take the 
steps necessary to contain inflation.

Financial Market Developments 
 Financial asset prices were  generally little changed, on balan ce, over the 
intermeeting period.  Nominal Treasury yields moved up notably across the curve in the 
days following the December FOM C meeting, but yields mostly tre nded down during the 
remainder of the period.  Although m arket commentaries offered a variety of 
explanations for the decline, it is difficult to identify a cle ar catalyst.  Meanwhile, broad 
domestic equity price indexes were about flat amid low volatility.  Conversely, the dollar 
exhibited considerable volatility and ended the period somewhat  higher. 
 Based on a straight read of mark et quotes, the probability of a n increase in the 
target range for the federal f unds rate at or before the March meeting was little 
changed at about 25 percent, while  the cumulative probability o f an increase 
at or before the June meeting ticked up to about 70 percent. 
 Yields on 2- and 5-year nominal Tre asury securities were little changed, while 
10-year yields decrease d 9 basis points on net.  
 TIPS-based inflation compensa tion was essentially unchanged, on  balance, at 
the 5-year horizon and increase d 5 basis points at the 5-to-10- year horizon. 
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes were little changed on net.  Me asures of 
option-implied stock price volat ility remained near the lower e nds of their 
ranges over the past several years, as did corporate bond sprea ds. 
 The broad dollar index was up somewhat, on balance, largely ref lecting a 
sizable appreciation of the dolla r against the Mexican peso. 
 Year-end dynamics in money markets  largely followed the pattern  of recent 
quarter-ends, although the upward pressure on repo rates at som e past quarter-
ends was absent at this year-end.

  communications were interpreted as less accommodative than expe cted.  In particular, 
market commentaries focused on t he upward revision to the media n projection for the 
path of the federal funds rate th is year in the Summary of Economic Projections.  
Investors also took note of referen ces in the December minutes to an elevated level of 
uncertainty surrounding future fis cal policies a nd their potent ial effect on the economic 
outlook.  Meanwhile, market particip ants appeared to interpret economic data releases 
over the period as a touch above  expectations on balance. 
Indicators of near-term expecta tions for the path of the federa l funds rate 
generally appear little changed over the intermeeting period.  Based on a straight read of 
quotes on federal funds futures, th e risk-neutral probability o f an increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at or before the March meeting  was little changed at about 
25 percent, while the cumulative probability of an increase at or before the June meeting 
edged up to about 70 percent.  Both a straight read of the expected federal funds rate path 
from OIS quotes and the estimate d path from a staff model that adjusts for term 
premiums were little changed, on net, suggesting no material ch ange to expected policy 
rates over the medium term.  
Treasury yields moved up immediately following the December FOM C meeting 
but generally decreased during the  remainder of the intermeetin g period, leaving 2- and 
5-year yields little changed, on ne t, while the 10-year yield m oved down 9 basis points.  
While market commentary offered various explanations for the de cline, a clear catalyst is 
difficult to identify.  Despite the decrease, the 10-year Treas ury yield remains about 
50 basis points higher than on the  day before the elections.  T IPS-based inflation 
compensation at the 5-to-10-year horizon moved up moderately, o n net, since the 
December FOMC meeting and is now about 40 basis points higher t han pre-election 
levels.  One-year-ahead option-implied volatilities on swap rates showed that the 
uncertainty about the future leve l of long-term rates also rema ined elevated relative to 
pre-election levels. 
Corporate capital markets were r elatively tranqu il over the per iod.  Broad U.S. 
equity price indexes were li ttle changed, on net, since the December FOMC meeting and 
fluctuated in a relatively narro w range.  However, equity price s remain notably higher 
than pre-election levels, due in part to expectations for more expansionary fiscal policy in 
the medium term (see the box “E xpected Dividend Growth since th e Election”).

 Expected  Dividend  Growth since  the Election 
Since the U.S. presidential  election, broad measures  of equity prices have increased  
significantly.   In this discussion,  we use prices of equity derivatives—specifically,  dividend 
futures contracts  based on dividends  paid by firms in the S&P 500 stock price index—to 
interpret  this move.  They suggest that the recent increase in equity valuations  appears 
to have been largely driven by a change in market participants’  expectations  regarding  
the growth rate  of dividends  over the next  two years and, to a lesser extent, by an 
increase in the expected  growth rate  of dividends  further out.  
 
The holder of a long position in a dividend futures contract receives  at maturity the 
difference  between  the dividends  paid out by the companies  in the S&P 500 over the 
year before expiration  and the futures quote at the initiation of the long position.1  
Figure 1 plots the time series of the market quotes  for contracts  expiring during the 
period from 2017 through 2021.  Market  quotes fluctuated  in a narrow  range in the 
second half of 2016 and then increased  markedly after  the U.S. election; quotes for 
longer‐dated contracts  rose  the most.2 
 Given the nature of these  futures contracts,  we can extract information  from their prices 
about investors’  views of future equity dividends.
3  In particular,  using contracts  with  
  
                                                 
1 Dividend futures contracts  are expressed  in S&P 500 index points.   For example,  on December  15, 
2016, the 2017 dividend futures contract was trading at 48 while  the S&P 500 index closed at 2,262, 
which implies an expected  dividend yield of 2.1 percent at the end of 2017. 
2 Market quotes  for contracts  maturing  in 2016 were also available during 2016, but as dividends  are 
announced  much earlier than they are paid out to equity  holders,  they do not incur much uncertainty  
and are excluded  from this analysis.   
3 The analysis assumes that dividend futures quotes  do not reflect margin requirements,  short‐ sale 
constraints,  or any other form of limits to arbitrage.

 different  maturities,  we can construct  two measures  of expected  dividend growth:  a 
“near term” expected  average dividend growth measure for the  years 2017  and 2018  and 
a “medium  term” forward expected  average dividend growth measure for the  years 
2019, 2020, and 2021.  
 
As shown in figure 2, the near‐term measure  of expect ed dividend growth rose  gradually  
but significantly  between  mid‐February  and early November  of last year.  In contrast,  the 
medium‐term measure increased  appreciably  less, on balance, over the same period.  
Since the U.S. election, implied near‐term dividend growth has jumped more than 
3 percentage  points, while medium‐term growth has stepped up more moderately.  
 The increase in the medium‐term measure  could potentially  reflect both a decline in the 
premium  required by investors  to hold  equity risk  and a revision  in their forecasts  for 
medium‐term dividend growth.  The fact that the near‐term measure  increased  
substantially  more  than the medium‐term measure  suggests that the run‐up in the S&P 
500 since  the election mostly reflects investors’  expectations  of appreciably  higher 
dividend growth over  the next two  years, perhaps reflecting  a potential  decrease  in 
corporate  taxes that would increase the level of after‐tax profits and therefore dividends 
paid out.  To put this revision  in investors’  expectations  into historical  perspective,  the 
increase in the expected  dividend growth rate  would correspond  to a movement  in the 
two‐year  dividend growth rate  for the  S&P 500 from the 20th  percentile  to the 
67th percentile  of its historical  distribution  since  1985.  Of course,  a great  deal of 
uncertainty  remains about the eventual effect of potential  changes in fiscal policy on 
corporate  earnings and dividends.

  as 10-year investment- and specu lative-grade corporate bond spr eads, edged down over 
the intermeeting period to near the  lower ends of their ranges over the past several years. 
Bank equity prices slightly underper formed the broader market l ate in the 
intermeeting period, despite better- than-expected earnings rele ases from several large 
banks, as investors apparently reassessed the large rise in ban k equity prices seen after 
the election.  CDS spreads for the six largest BHCs declined a bit over the intermeeting 
period.  In December, banks as a group reported net unrealized losses on securities 
holdings for the first time sin ce 2014.  Despite the large incr ease in yields for many 
fixed-income assets since the  election, banks’  net unrealized l osses were rather small as a 
share of their total holdings.  
Foreign Developments 
Although the dollar moved up immediately following the December FOMC 
meeting, it subsequently depreci ated against the backdrop of so lid foreign economic data 
and a reassessment of the post-el ection gains by investors, whi ch seemed to be driven in 
part by uncertainty about the incoming Administration’s fiscal and trade policies.  On 
balance, the broad dollar index rose somewhat, with notable mov ements against some 
currencies.  The dollar appreci ated by 8¼ percent against the Mexican peso despite a rate 
hike and intervention activity by t he Bank of Mexico; it rose 8 ¾ percent against the 
Turkish lira in the face of political and economic woes.  Amid ongoing concerns about a 
“hard” Brexit, the dollar appreciated against the British pound  by about 3¼ percent on 
net.  Later in the period, the dolla r rose sharply against the Canadian dollar and ended the 
period 1 percent higher.  In contra st, the Chinese renminbi (RM B) appreciated against the 
dollar by about ¾ percent.  Some market commentary suggested th at Chinese authorities 
were engineering “two way” volatility in the RMB exchange rate to stem speculative 
capital outflows, as RMB fixing rates were set at unexpectedly strong levels and liquidity 
conditions in the offshore RMB market tightened noticeably during the first week of 
January. 
On balance, asset price movements in foreign financial markets were consistent 
with a slight improvement in risk sentiment.  Global equity pri ces were supported by 
better-than-expecte d economic data and, in Europe, by the passa ge of major risk events.  
Deutsche Bank reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on MBS-related 
charges, and the Italian gove rnment approved a funding package and other measures to 
support struggling domestic banks.  Despite the improvement in the economic outlook in

SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Similar to developments in December 2015, money market rates re sponded 
quickly to the change in the targ et range for the federal funds  rate, and there were some 
temporary pressures on money mark et rates evident at year-end.  The effective federal 
funds rate printed at 66 basis poi nts every day, except for year-end, when the rate 
dropped to 55 basis points.  The ove rnight repo rate for Treasu ry collateral increased to 
about 50 basis points in the days f ollowing the FOMC meeting an d remained around that 
level in the days leading up to year-end.  In contrast to recen t quarter-ends , Treasury repo 
rates fell to just below the ON RRP rate at year-end.  Market participants partially 
attributed this decline to the larger amount of cash available in the repo market from 
government MMFs, consistent with t he large shift in assets from  prime to government 
MMFs associated with money mark et funds reform.  In the days leading into year-end, 
ON RRP take-up rose steadily, with ON RRPs outstanding reaching $468 billion at 
year-end.  Subsequently, take-up retraced to levels seen earlie r in December. 
Abroad, year-end dynamics in most foreign money markets were ge nerally 
orderly.  However, very short-term  FX swap bases at year-end wi dened notably, leading 
to modest increases in the take -up of dollar auctions at the Ba nk of Japan and the 
European Central Bank.  Shortly t hereafter, FX swap bases returned to levels closer to 
recent norms.  
Conditions in other domestic shor t-term funding markets were ge nerally stable 
over the intermeeting period.  Reflecting the federal funds rat e hike and associated rise in 
money market rates, net yields on money market fund investments  moved up.  Assets 
under management for MMFs changed little in recent weeks, with government funds 
experiencing modest net outflows and prime funds staying about flat.  Flows into and out 
of large time deposits at banks  were modest after having experi enced large outflows in 
the lead-up to the deadline for i mplementation of money market funds reform.

Financi ng Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households have remained 
generally accommodative in recent months and continue to be supportive of economic 
activity. 
 Bank credit and nonbank credit remain ed largely available for small and large 
businesses and for most households.  However, mortgage standards continue d 
to be tight for households with low credit scores or harder- to-document 
income,  and credit card standards remain ed tight for subprime borrowers.  
 The January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
(SLOOS) indicates that standards reportedly tightened for consumer loans and 
commercial real estate (CRE) loans but eased  for commercial and industrial 
(C&I) loans and residential real estate loans.1 
 Overall credit flows remain ed solid in recent months.  The available data 
suggest that the net rise in interest rates since the summer has not had  a 
substantial effect on the flow of credit, although CRE  and household lending 
by banks slowed a bit in the fourth quarter. 
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms have stayed accommodative in recent 
months, and credit remains widely available both from banks and from nonbank lenders.   
Commercial and Industrial Lending 
After a slowdown in the third quarter, C&I loan growth at banks picked up in the 
fourth quarter, although it expanded at a pace that was lower than  that of earlier in the 
year.  In the January SLOOS,  a modest net share of domestic banks reported easing C&I 
lending standards to large and medium-sized firms over the fourth quarter, while lending 
                                                 
1 For each loan category, SLOOS results are calculated by weighting each bank’s response by the 
size of its loan portfolio in that category.  For detailed information on the results of the January survey, see 
Maya Shaton (forthcoming ), “Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices,” 
memorandum to the FOMC, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Monetary Affairs.

  standards for small firms remained about unchanged.  On net, surveyed banks also 
reported expecting their standards for C&I loans to ease somewhat in 2017. 
Nonfinancial Corporate Debt and Equity Issuance 
Nonfinancial corporations continued to find it relatively easy to raise funds in 
bond and equity markets.  While aggregate corporate leverage remain ed very elevated, 
cash holdings are high,  and debt service payments are low, due in part to interest rates 
that are still low by historical standards.  
After a slowdown in November, gross issuance of corporate bonds rebounded in 
December to about its robust average pace over the past few years.  Although early 
estimates suggest that issuance has weakened somewhat in January, relatively low yields 
indicate that bond financing conditions have remained accommodative overall.   
Institutional leveraged loan issuance was very strong in December.  Gross equity 
issuance by nonfinancial firms was also solid in November and December, primarily 
reflecting a robust pace of seasoned offerings.    
Commercial Real Estate Finance 
Financing conditions in CRE markets remain ed largely accommodative, although 
results from the SLOOS indicate that banks tightened their lending standards somewhat 
over the course of 2016, especially for construction and land development loans, and are 
expected to tighten them a bit further in 2017.  CRE loans at banks continued to grow in 
the fourth quarter, although at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year. 
The commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market has also remain ed 
broadly supportive of CRE financing, and CMBS issuance was solid in the fourth quarter, 
in part because issuers tri ed to complete deals before the implementation of new risk 
retention rules in late December.  The delinquency rate on CMBS moved up further in 
November, but this increase in delinquencies did not affect financing conditions, as it 
reflected delinquencies on loans originated before the financial crisis. 
Small Business Finance 
Credit supply to well-established small businesses remain ed generally 
accommodative.  Although indicators of small business loan performance deteriorated 
slightly in recent months, they remain ed generally strong, and any credit quality concerns 
did not appear to hurt the ability of small businesses to obtain credit.  Credit demand,

  however, continued to be weak despite some signs of strengthening in November.   More 
recently, after the presidential election, indexes of small business optimism moved up 
significantly.  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit appear ed generally available for state and local governments as well.  
Although gross issuance of municipal bonds decreased somewhat in December, early 
indications suggest that issuance is on pace to post a typical volume for January.  In 
addition, ratios of yields on 20-year general obligation bonds to those on comparable-
maturity Treasury securities have changed little, on net, in recent months, suggesting that 
financing conditions have not tightened for state and local governments. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit remain ed largely available to households with good credit scores, but 
mortgage lending was still very tight for households with low credit scores or harder- to-
document income; credit card lending wa s still tight for households with low credit 
scores.  Bank lending to households was  solid in the fourth quarter, although somewhat 
slower than earlier in the year. 
Household balance sheets remain ed supportive of credit provision.  Total 
household debt, the sum of residential mortgages and consumer credit, increased at a 
moderate pace in the third quarter, leaving the ratio of household debt to disposable 
personal income little changed at around its 2002 level.     
Residential Mortgages 
Financing conditions for residential mortgages remain ed accommodative for most 
households.  Our measure of the maximum debt- to-income ratio allowed for residential 
mortgages suggests that mortgage credit was broadly available to households with high 
and average credit scores.2  However, mortgage credit conditions continued to be very 
tight for lower-score households, and improvements in recent years have been very slight.  
In early January, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that the 
Federal Housing Administration is planning to reduce the insurance premium on new 
                                                 
2 Our measure is a weighted average of the estimated maximum ratio of debt service to income 
that mortgage lenders will allow across a given set of borrower characteristics, including credit score.  As 
such, it is a measure of mortgage credit supply.

  loans 25 basis points, which would represent a small easing of credit for lower-score 
households.   The January SLOOS indicated  that banks eased lending standards across 
several categories of residential real estate loans in the fourth quarter.   
In recent months, the interest rate on 30-year fixed mortgages has moved in line 
with that on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, rising notably after the election but 
retracing part of its increase since mid-December.  Although the mortgage rate is higher 
than it was last summer, it is in the middle of the range seen over the past five years and 
remains low by historical standards.  Available indicators suggest that purchase 
originations changed little in recent months despite higher mortgage rates, while 
refinance originations fell sharply.  Bank lending for residential mortgages was solid in 
the fourth quarter, though its rate of growth w as a touch lower than in the previous 
quarter.  Issuance of mortgage-backed securities was also robust. 
Consumer Credit 
Consumer credit continued to be broadly available to households, although credit 
card lending standards remain ed tight for subprime borrowers.  The average credit score 
of auto loans originated in recent quarters has trended up gradually across various types 
of lenders.  A significant net fraction of January SLOOS respondents reported tightening 
standards on auto lending.3  Moreover, a slightly smaller net fraction reported tightening 
credit card standards.  On net, banks also reported expecting standards to tighten further 
on auto and credit card loans in 2017.  Total consumer loan balances from both bank and 
nonbank sources increased at a robust rate through November, with credit card loans, 
student loans, and auto loans all increasing at a similar pace. 
Delinquencies on credit card loans and on auto loans remained low through the 
third quarter.  Delinquencies on student loans continued to move down gradually from 
elevated levels (see the box “Recent Dynamics of Student Loan Delinquencies ” for a 
broader discussion).

 Recent Dynamics of Student Loan Delinquencies  
Unemployment rates for young individuals have been decreasing from an elevated level 
for several years, suggesting that economic conditions for the young have been  improving  
(figure 1).  As a result, borrowers currently repaying their student  loans should be better 
positioned to pay back those debt s than cohorts of several years ago.  However, staff 
estimates derived from the FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax (CCP) indicate that the delinquency rate of  total student debt outstanding has remained  stubbornl y high  in recent 
years (f igure 2).  Th ese estimates raise the question of why we have  not see n a decline in 
student loan delinquenc ies given the considerable improvements in the labor market as 
well as  the debt repayment relief offered by the Department of  Education’s  (DOE)  income -
driven repayment (IDR) plans  for federal student loans .
1  
New staff analysis points to the  shifting composition of student debt in the CCP data as 
having masked a decline in student  loan delinquency rates since 2012 .  One distinctive 
characteristic of student loans is that, unlike other types of consumer debt,  the repayment  
period  is postponed until after a borrower has left school (rather than right after the loan 
is originated ).2  Thus, in th e CCP data , student loans cannot be recorded as delinquent 
while borrowers remain in school.  Holding all other factors constant, a material rise in the 
fraction of borrowers transitioning from school to the repayment period for their student 
debt could, mechanically, boost the est imated overall delinquency rate.  And, as discussed 
later, a significant rise in the share of outstanding student debt requiring repayment does 
appear to have occurred in recent years . 
A limitation of the CCP is that it does not contain school enrollment information , so it is 
impossible to know with certainty which student  borrowers are already in  the repayment  
period of their student loan obligations.  To measure the delinquency rate among this 
category of borrowers, we construct an indicator of being in the repayment period based 
on the recency of their student debt.  More specifically, we treat  all borrowers in the CCP 
who opened their most recent  student loan more than 365 days ago as being in  the 
repayme nt period .3  Figure 3 shows that this approximation results in a similar rate of 
balances in the CCP categorized as  being in the repayment  period  as in the  DOE data  for 
federal loans .4  Moreover, f igure 3 shows that the percent age of balances in the 
repayment  period  has increased significantly in recent years , likely  reflecting the outsized 
                                                 
1 IDR plans are student loan repayment plans that help borrowers manag e their debt by tying their 
monthly payments to their incomes.  According to the DOE’s data, enrollment in these plans  for direct loan 
borrow ers more than doubled in the last two  years, from 2.5 million to 5.3 mil lion. 
2 More precisely, student loan borrowers in general do not have to start repaying their student loans 
immediately  after exit ing school (or after their enrollment status drops to less than part time ).  The 
“waiting” period after exiting school and before repayment begins is known as the grace period and 
typically lasts six months. 
3 Additionally , if borrower s are delinquent on at least one student loan in a given quarter, all of their  
balances are treated as  being  in the repayment  phase. 
4 For comparability reasons, given the impossibility of knowing which loans are in deferment or 
forbearance statuses in the CCP (which, ideally, should not be included in the calculation of the 
delinquency rate for balances in the repayment period), the calculated rate of federal loan balances in 
repayment includes loans in deferment (for reasons different than being in school or in  a grace period), 
forbearance, default, and other status es.

 cohort enrolled in higher education in the latter 2000s leaving school and entering  the 
repayment period for their student debt .  Specifically, we estimate that th e fraction of 
total student loan balances in the repayment period climbed from about 55 percent at  the 
end of 2010 to 80 percent in 2016:Q2.   
Thus , as shown in figure 4 , focusing only on student debt in the repayment period  in the 
CCP , the delinquency rat e has been decreasing gradually, but steadily, for almost four 
years —a pattern more consistent with the improvements seen in the labor market .  In 
particular, the delinquency rate for student  loans in the repayment  period —the solid blue 
line—decreased from  18.6 percent in 2012:Q 2 to 14. 6 percent in 2016:Q2.   (The dashed  line 
represents the delinquency rate when all loans are considered, including those in school 
deferment or in a grace period, already shown in f igure 2.)  This decrease suggests that 
much -improved job prospects, increased take- up in IDR plans, and perhaps other factors 
have contributed to better student loan performance in recent years.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
The evidence regarding the magn itude of the uncertainty around our projections 
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate is mixed.  On balance, we now see that 
uncertainty as being somewhat higher than before the recent U.S . elections but 
nonetheless reasonably well in lin e with the average over the p ast 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  On the one hand, the Baker, Bloom , and Davis index of 
economic policy uncertainty—altho ugh fluctuating widely from da y to day and week to 
week—has, on average, been higher since the election than in th e months prior.  The 
options-implied expected volatili ty associated with longer-term  Treasury securities has 
also moved up since the election, a lbeit only modestly.  On the  other hand, options-based 
indexes of expected stock market volatility (for example, the V IX) remain at subdued 
levels, as do corporate bond spreads.   
We have maintained our assumption that the risks to our medium- term GDP 
projection are tilted to the dow nside, primarily because moneta ry policy is likely better 
positioned to offset large positive shocks than substantial adv erse ones.  While a rising 
federal funds rate implies incr easing room for conventional mon etary policy actions, in 
the staff’s baseline outlook, the re is not much room for accomm odation in the event of a 
moderately large adverse shock ove r the next couple of years.  Although we continue to 
view the risks as tilted to the downside, we view those risks a s less pronounced than in 
the recent past, importantly because risks to the foreign outlo ok have subsided somewhat.  
We view the risks around our unemp loyment rate projection as aligned with those for 
GDP and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.   
With regard to inflation, we do not  view the current level of u ncertainty as 
unusually high.  We see importa nt risks to inflation on both the upside and the downside, 
and we view those risks as roughly balanced.  To the downside, some survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are near histori cally low levels.  In 
addition, as shown in one of the alternative scenarios, the pro jected divergence between 
domestic and foreign monetary poli cies could generate greater a ppreciation of the dollar 
than we have anticipated in the  baseline forecast.  To the upside, with the economy 
projected to be operating above its long-run potential, inflati on may increase more than

 the staff expects, consistent with  the predictions of models th at emphasize nonlinear 
effects of economic slack on inflation.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveilla nce assessment, whic h judges the vulnerabilities in the U.S. 
financial system as moderate.  T he rise in prices in real estat e and equity markets, as well 
as the narrowing of corporate bond s preads, signals an uptick in valuation pressures to a 
notable level.  But the stabil ity implications of these buildin g pressures are mitigated by a 
number of factors.  One is that  capital and liquidity buffers a t U.S. banks are strong and, 
according to the somewhat limited available data, leverage is m oderate at nonbank 
financial institutions.  Moreover, the reduction in assets unde r management at prime 
money funds that occurred through Oc tober in anticipation of mo ney market fund reform 
has not reversed and points to a m odest reduction in the risks associated with maturity 
transformation in the money marke t fund sector.  Finally, the volume of credit being 
extended to the private nonfinancial sector as a whole remains moderate despite increased 
indications of high leverage in the corporate sector, as borrow ing by households remains 
far below levels experienced late in the previous decade. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario considers the 
effects of a future fiscal expansion that is larger and that ha s a different composition than 
in the staff baseline, while the  second scenario assumes that t he tax cut included in the 
staff baseline does not materialize.  The third scenario illust rates the effects of greater 
momentum in private demand.  In the  fourth scenario, we examine  possible consequences 
of lower long-term inflation expe ctations.  We then consider th e implications of subdued 
labor productivity growth paired w ith larger increases in wages  in the fifth scenario.  In 
the sixth scenario, we consider t he possibility that U.S. monetary policy normalization 
leads to a much stronger apprec iation of the dollar.  The seventh and last scenario 
analyzes the consequences of stronger foreign growth and a weak er dollar.

 We simulate these scenarios i n a variety of staff models, which  are indicated in 
the scenario headings.1  For the two fiscal policy scen arios, we assume different 
adjustments to the intercept i n the inertial policy rule used i n the baseline, as we will

by the same rule as in the baseline.  In all cases, we assume t hat the size and composition 
of the SOMA portfolio fo llow the baseline paths. 
Larger Fiscal Expansion (simulated in FRB/US) 
In the baseline projection, the  staff is assuming a cut in pers onal income taxes 
equal to 1 percent of GDP debu ting in 2017:Q3.  In this scenari o, we study the effect of a 
fiscal expansion that is larger and has a different composition :  In addition to the tax cut 
considered in the baseline, we assume an increase in government  purchases equal to 
1 percent of GDP, phased in from 2017:Q3 onward.2  We assume that half of the 
additional government spending is directed to public infrastructure.3  In the long run, the 
intercept of the policy rule govern ing the federal funds rate converges to a level that is 
25 basis points higher than in the  baseline, and the 10-year Tr easury rate is revised up 
38 basis points.4   
Real GDP growth is ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseli ne, on average, in 
2018 and 2019, reflecting the effect  on aggregate demand of the  additional government 
spending.  The unemployment rate follows a lower path, bottomin g out at 3¾ percent in 
2020.  The tighter resource utiliz ation puts upward pressure on inflation, which reaches 
2½ percent by the end of 2021.5  As a result, the federal funds rate follows a steeper path, 
reaching 5½ percent in 2021, about 1½ percentage points higher than in the baseline.  
                                                 
1 The models used are FRB/US, which  is a large-scale macroeconom etric model of the U.S. 
economy; EDO, which is an estimat ed medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model; and SIGMA, which is 
a multicountry open-economy model. 
2 In particular, we assume that  the additional government spendi ng is phased in over a four-year 
period.  Spending returns gradually to the baseline path therea fter. 
3 In an effort to capture supply- side effects of additional gove rnment spending, we assume that 
government investment in physical capital has an annual rate of  return of 7 percent, c onsistent with the 
estimate in Congressional Budget Office (2016), The Macroeconomic and Budgetary Effects of Federal 
Investment  (Washington:  CBO, June), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51628 .  This rate of return, 
together with the size and gradual implementation of government  spending on infrastructure assumed in 
this scenario, implies only a sm all increment to potential outp ut.   
4 These intercept adjustments are consistent with the adjustment s that were made in the December 
Tealbook to the intercept in the policy rule and the longer-run  value of the term premium. 
5 In this scenario and the next one, the responses of inflation are likely larger than the revisions 
that the staff would implement using its judgmental apparatus, in part because inflation in FRB/US

 No Fiscal Expansion (simulated in FRB/US) 
Enactment of fiscal expansion is  not assured.  This scenario po sits that the fiscal 
expansion assumed in the baseline  does not materialize.  As a consequence, we also 
unwind the adjustments to the rul e for setting the federal fund s rate and to the long-term 
interest rate term premium made  in the baseline projection in t he December Tealbook. 
Without the fiscal expansion, rea l GDP growth is slightly weake r than in the 
baseline and unemployment is h igher, by about ¼ percentage poin t starting at the end of 
this year.  In addition, inflation f ollows a lower trajectory.6  These developments—as 
well as the adjustment to the pol icy rule—leave the federal funds rate about ½ percentage 
point below the baseline at the end of 2020. 
Stronger Aggregate Demand (simulated in EDO) 
Several indicators of consumer and business confidence have increased 
significantly in the past month or two.  Furthermore, motor veh icle sales in December 
were strong, and there are increasing signs of wage acceleratio n, which could support 
household income and further boost  confidence.  Motivated by th ese upbeat 
developments, this scenario assumes a considerable improvement in animal spirits, which 
spurs faster consumer and business spending.7 
In this scenario, real GDP ris es 3 percent in 2017, compared wi th 2¼ percent in 
the baseline projection.  The unemp loyment rate falls faster th an in the baseline, 
bottoming out at around 4 percent  by the end of 2018; it then e dges up over the remainder 
of the forecast period and returns to the baseline level by lat e 2021.  Inflation is little 
changed, while the federal funds r ate rises more steeply and is  as much as ½ percentage 
point higher than the b aseline in late 2018.8   
                                                 
generally moves more with demand than it does in the staff judg mental projection.  More important, to 
better capture the long-lasting changes to fiscal policy, we as sume model-consistent expectations as 
opposed to VAR expectations that are more typical for alternati ve simulations in FRB/US.  It turns out that 
the inflation response in these scenarios is larger with model- consistent expectations than with VAR 
expectations. 
6 For the unemployment rate, this No Fiscal Expansion scenario c omes very close to unwinding 
the effect of the fiscal policy that was built into the baselin e in the December round.  F or inflation, as noted 
previously, the inflation effect is larger than in the staff ju dgmental apparatus.   
7 We generate this scenario by ap plying a positive shock of one standard deviation to the model’s 
main driver of aggregate demand.  
8 In some respects, this scenario  is similar to the Larger Fisca l Expansion scenario in that both 
feature an increase in aggregate  demand.  However, their macroe conomic consequences are notably

 Lower Inflation Expectatio ns (simulated in FRB/US) 
The University of Michigan Surve ys of Consumers measure of long er-run 
inflation expectations of households has been trending down for some time.  As we have 
noted in the past, it is not alt ogether clear that these survey -based readings are relevant 
for actual wage and price setting, and other measures have not moved in this direction.9  
However, in this scenario, we assume that the downtrend is rele vant, and we illustrate the 
risks from inflation expectati ons that are ½ percentage point l ower than in the baseline in 
the first quarter of 2017.  Thereaf ter, longer-run expectations  are affected by the 
economy’s experience of inflati on but return to the FOMC’s obje ctive in the long run. 
Under these circumstances, h eadline inflation is only 1½ percen t in 2017, 
¼ percentage point below the ba seline, and rises to only 1¾ percent in 2019.  Inflation 
remains persistently below targ et in part because the baseline policy rule does not 
respond very aggressively to infla tion deviations.  The federal  funds rate runs about 
¼ percentage point lower than the baseline for several years.  Real GDP growth and the 
unemployment rate are roughly at the baseline, in part because real interest rates on 
longer-dated bonds are little changed.  
Weaker Productivity and Faster Wa ge Growth (simulated in FRB/US) 
In the baseline, despite an unemplo yment rate that is persisten tly below the 
natural rate of unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consis tent with the modest 
response of prices to economic activity seen in recent years.  However, we do not claim 
to know the relationship betwee n resource slack and inflation w ith great precision.  It is 
possible, for example, that wages may prove more sensitive to a tight labor market than we have assumed, and the resulting higher wages may pass throug h into higher prices.  In 
this scenario, wage inflation r esponds more to economic slack t han assumed in the 
baseline, resulting in larger ga ins in labor compensation.  Add itionally, we assume that 
labor productivity growth is slow er than in the baseline.   
Higher wages and lower productivity imply higher costs of produ ction, and in the 
FRB/US model, these higher cost s pass through to price inflatio n.  Accordingly, PCE 
                                                 
different, in part because they are simulated in different mode ls.  Furthermore, the shocks in the Stronger 
Aggregate Demand scenario are ca librated to a typical aggregate  demand shock, while the shocks in the 
Larger Fiscal Expansion scenari o are calibrated to a very speci fic and long-lasting fiscal expansion. 
9 For example, the Federal Reserve  Bank of Atlanta’s measure of longer-run expectations of unit 
costs reported by businesses in the Sixth District is near the middle of its range since  its introduction in 
2012.

 prices accelerate more than in the baseline and rise 2¾ percent  in 2019.  The weaker path 
of labor productivity lowers aggregate demand because of reduce d permanent income 
and raises the unemployment rate  above the base line.  At the en d of 2020, the 
unemployment rate is ½ percentage point higher than in the staf f projection.  The federal 
funds rate rises ½ percentage poi nt above the baseline, largely  because of higher 
inflation.  
Stronger Dollar and EME Turbulence (simulated in SIGMA) 
The staff baseline projects that the dollar will appreciate abo ut 5 percent over the 
forecast period as the federal funds rate rises somewhat faster  than markets currently 
appear to expect.  The normaliza tion of U.S. mo netary policy, h owever, could well cause 
a more pronounced and persistent appreciation of the dollar, es pecially if higher U.S. 
interest rates generate  financial turbulen ce in vulnerable EMEs.  In this scenario, we 
assume that the broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the end of the 
year and that EME corporate borrowing spreads rise substantiall y in the face of persistent 
capital outflows from EMEs.  Despi te weakening macroeconomic co nditions in EMEs, 
we assume EME central banks tighten monetary policy to mitigate  upward pressure on 
inflation arising from the depreciation of their  currencies.  A ll told, foreign GDP growth 
runs, on average, about ¾ percenta ge point below the baseline in 2017 and 2018. 
The stronger dollar and weaker  foreign growth depress U.S. real  net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP grow th moderates to about 1½ percen t in 2017, nearly 
¾ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Lower import prices and weaker economic 
activity keep core PCE inflation below 1½ percent through 2018.  The federal funds rate 
follows a shallower path than in the baseline, rising to only 2½ percent by the end of 
2019, nearly 1 percentage point lower  than in the baseline. 
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar (simulated in SIGMA) 
In our baseline forecast, we see the headwinds facing the foreign economies as 
diminishing only gradually as fore ign output expands at a modes t pace and underlying 
inflation slowly edges closer  to central bank targets.  However, some foreign industrial 
production and trade indicators have  come in somewhat stronger than expected in recent 
months, and the expansion abroad m ay prove faster, especially i f highly accommodative 
monetary policies in the AFEs boos t aggregate demand more than assumed in the 
baseline.  In this scenario, we assume that foreign GDP growth rises to about 3½ percent 
in 2017 and 2018 and thus averages a bout 1 percentage point per  year higher than under

 our baseline projection.  Increa sed optimism about the durabili ty of the foreign 
recovery—and the perception of dimi nished tail risks—causes the broad real dollar to fall 
8 percent relative to the  baseline by the end of 2018.  
U.S. real GDP expands 2½ percent in 2017 and 2018, nearly ½ percentage point 
more than in the baseline, as the weaker dollar and stronger fo reign growth boost U.S. 
real net exports.  The unemployme nt rate falls to 3¾ percent by  the end of 2019.  Higher 
import prices and heightened resou rce pressures cause core PCE inflation to move 
persistently above 2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  The federal fun ds rate rises more quickly, 
increasing to 4¼ percent by the  end of 2019 compared with 3½ pe rcent in the baseline.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 1998 through 2014 were used.  Thi s shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the dist ribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range  to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this discussion, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal 
funds rate and compare the associated policy paths and macroeconomic outcomes with 
those in the Tealbook baseline forecast.  The prescriptions of s imple rules and optimal 
control exercises are generally little changed from the December 2016 Tealbook, 
reflecting largely unchanged economic projections.  As in December, most simple rules and optimal control exercises call for a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than assumed in the staff forecast.  We  also present a box in which we review the evolution of 
Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* over the past decade and examine its relationship with 
other notions of the stance of monetary policy. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first- difference rule.1  These prescriptions 
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output gap and inflation in the near 
term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and middle panel s also include the staff’s 
baseline assumption fo r the path of the federal funds rate.  
• The near -term prescriptions of each of the policy rules are slightly below 
those in the December Tealbook, reflecting a small downward revision to the 
staff’s projection of core PCE inflation in 2017. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which feature no interest rate 
smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the nea r 
term than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, the first -difference rule, or the 
Tealbook baseline. 
A MEDIUM -TERM  EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATE   
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model, given 
the staff’s baseline projection.  This Tealbook- consistent FR B/US r*  corresponds to the

  level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period, would 
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• The current -quarter estimate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  is 
0.1 per centage point higher than it would have been if the staff projection of 
the output gap over the next 12 quarters had not changed since the December 
Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revision to the projected output gap.  
Moreover, the current- quarter estimate is 0.4 percentage point higher than the 
estimate reported in the December Tealbook; this increase primarily reflects 
the rolling over of the reference period, which, given a rising path of the 
output gap in coming years , now requires the closing of a larger output gap 
than in December . 
• At 1.5 percent, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  is more than 1 percentage 
point above the average level of the real federal funds rate in the staff forecast 
for the same 12 -quarter period and ½ percentage point above the staff’s 
estimate of the real federal funds rate in the long run . 
• The real federal funds rate in the baseline staff forecast is, on average, below 
Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  because the policy reaction function assumed 
by the staff encompasses  several policy considerations in addition to closing 
the output gap, most importantly returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
• The increase in Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  in this projection is the most 
recent in a series that reflects the gradual improvement in the real economy 
since 2011.  In the box “Mind the (Output) Gap:  A History of Tealbook-
Consistent FRB/US r *,” we examine the real -time history of Tealbook-
consistent FRB/US r*  in relation to the average level of the real federal  
funds rate.

 Mind the (Output) Gap:  
A History of Tealbook -Consistent FRB/US r* 
The Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* (henceforth , FRB/US r*) is the level of the real 
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period , closes  the output gap 
at the end  of that period , according  to the FRB/US model  and given the staff 
projection .  As such , FRB/US r* summarizes , in a single number, a stance of policy  that 
focuses on  eliminating resource slack over the medium term in the model.  Over  time , 
FRB/US r* has provided information about the current and projected strength of the 
economy .  FRB/US r* can be at a level that is unattainable  by the actual real federal 
funds rate because the effective lower bound (ELB) on nom inal interest  rate s is not 
imposed in the computation of FRB/US r* .  Moreover, when the ELB is binding , the 
gap between the FRB/US r* and the real federal funds rate in the staff projection can 
be interpreted as an indicator of the extent to which conventional monetary policy is 
constrained in its ability to return the economy to its potential level.1 
 
However, FRB/US r*  is not necessarily a measure of the appropriate  stance of 
monetary policy.  For example, it differs from the real interest rate path s derived from 
optimal control simulation s in several ways:  FRB/US r* does not take into account any 
gap between projected and targeted inflation , it compels closing the output gap over 
a fixed time frame regardless of the initial magnitude and sign of the gap , and it 
requires that the real interest rate remain s fixed over this time frame.2 
 In figure 1, we show the real- time evolution of  FRB/US  r* since 2006 , along with the 
corresponding  real- time 12-quarter average of the real federal funds rate in the 
contemporaneous baseline staff forecast  (henceforth , the average real rate) .  The 
color- shaded areas in the figure indicate the Great Recession and the periods over 
which the Federal Reserve conducted its asset purchase programs.  In figure 2, we 
report t he real- time projected 12-quarter averages of the output gap  and of headline 
inflation (the latter measured in deviation s from 2 percent) . 
 
In the years before the Great Recession , the staff saw the economy as likely to 
operate close to its potential level over the medium term under its baseline monetary 
                                                 
1 The FRB/US r* measure is largely a function of two factors :  the staff projection for the output 
gap 12 quarters ahead and the staff assumption for the average real value of the federal funds rate 
over the next 12 quarters.  In this sense, FRB/US r* is simply a summary measure of the underlying 
strength of aggregate demand over the medium term in the staff projection, assuming that the staff 
assessment of the interest sensitivity of aggregate demand is similar to that embedded in the FRB/US model.  For a discussion of how FRB/US r*  relates to other equilibrium interest rate 
concepts, see  Christopher J. Gust, Benjamin K. Johannsen, David J. Lopez -Salido, and Robert J. 
Tetlow (2015), “ r*: Concepts, Measures, and Uses,” memorandum to the Federal Open Market 
Committee, October 13. 
2 That said, the outcomes associated with a policy that implem ented FRB/US r* could be close 
to those derived from an optimal control simulation, at least in some circumstances.  For example, if 
demand shocks were the only source of variation in the output gap, optimal control simulations 
would seek to prevent the ou tput gap from opening up and would simultaneously keep inflation 
near the Committee’s long -run objective at all times.  This nexus ceases to exist when supply shocks 
are also inducing fluctuations in the output gap.

 policy assumptions ; accordingly, the average real rate in the staff projection was near 
FRB/US r*.  This proximity between the average real rate and FRB/US r*  continued 
into the early phase of the recession .  Although the economic outlook deteriorated 
appreciably in the first half of 2008, the assumed conventional monetary policy easing  
in the staff project ion was seen as sufficient to eliminate economic slack in the 
medium term. 
 
The worsening of the Global Financial Crisis in late 2008 and early 2009 led to a 
marked deterioration of the economic outlook  and sharp declines in FRB/US r*.  As 
the nominal federal funds rate reached the ELB late in 2008, a wide and persistent 
disparity opened up  between FRB/US r*  and the average real rate.  Subsequently, the 
staff viewed the combination of large- scale asset purchase programs , reinvestment of  
maturing principal, and forward guidance regarding the path of the nominal federal 
funds rate as bolstering  the economic outlook and  prevent ing an even  larger disparity 
between FRB/US r*  and the average real rate.3 
 
By the end of 2013, domestic and global headwinds had abated somewhat.  C losing 
the output gap over the medium term once again became a plausible scenario, even 
without additional asset purchases , allowing FRB/US r* to catch up with the average 
real rate in the staff projection.  As a consequence of the Committee’s  decision to 
maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy ( to support further 
improvements in economic conditions and a return of inflation to 2 percent ), the staff 
projection for the output gap began to turn  positive over the medium term , and 
FRB/US r* has exceeded  the average real rate noticeably since mid -2015 . 
 
The period since 2013 illustrates  why FRB/US r* is not necessarily a measure of the 
appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Although higher real policy rates c ould 
prevent  the projected overshooting of  output relative to potential output  shown in 
figure 2 , such a decision would further delay the return of inflation to the Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  With realized inflation having trended below 2 percent since the 
onset of the Great Recession, some policymakers may see a strong commitment to 
achieving the inflation objective in the coming years  as important for ensuring the 
credibility of t hat objective.   Moreover, t he FRB/US r*  concept does not account for 
the limits of conventional monetary policy in responding to downside risks  in a low 
interest rate environment , so risk -management considerations might be playing a role 
in the average real rate remaining below FRB/US r* . 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
3 In figure 1, a s the anticipated effects of the asset purchase programs were incorporated into 
the staff projection , the average projected output gap became smaller and the disparity between 
FRB/US r* and the average real rate narrowed.  The timing of the incorporation  of new progams 
within the  staff projection  varied.  The large -scale asset purchase programs announced in March 
2009 and September 2012 were not incorporated into the staff forecast until the subsequent 
Tealbook round s.  By contrast, the staff forecasts in November 2010 and September 2011 already 
anticipated much of the effects of the second large- scale asset purchase program and the maturity 
extension program, respectively .

  and the first- difference rule.2  These sim ulations reflect the endogenous responses of the 
output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows the paths implied by the 
different policy rules.3  Given only small changes to the staff projection since the 
December Tealbook, the policy paths prescribed by each rule and the associated 
macroeconomic outcomes a re also little changed.  
• The policy path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the 
intercept.  In the Tealbook baseline, the nominal federal funds rate increases, 
on average, about 80 basis points per year through the first quarter of 2020, 
when it reaches 3.5 percent.  The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 4 percent in 2021 before eventually returning to its long er-run level of 3 percent.  
• The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a constant intercept prescribes a slightly 
higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than the version 
with a judgmental intercept adjustment used to construct the Tealbook 
baseline.  The difference in policy rates arising from this alternative intercept assumption is small and dissipates too rapidly to have marked effects on the real longer -term interest rates that influence economic activity in the FRB/US  
model.  Thus, macroeconomic outcomes under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are similar to those in the Tealbook baseline. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp 
tightening in policy and  produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie 
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years , largely 
because these two policy rules do not incorporate any interest rate smoothing.  Despite these initially higher policy pa ths, the macroeconomic outcomes 
under these two rules are not far from those under the Tealbook baseline because of the assumption s that the public immediately understands the 
                                                 
2 Unless otherwise noted, the policy rules and optimal control simulations assume that 
policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future and that financial market participants, price 
setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy but als o 
fully understand the macroeconomic implications of that policy strategy.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation
rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

  macroeconomic effects of following the rules and believes the policymakers’ 
comm itment to stabilize the economy in the future.  The Taylor (1999) rule 
calls for slightly higher policy rates than the Taylor  (1993) rule over the 
period shown because it responds more strongly to the projected rise in output 
above its potential level over the next several years.  As a consequence, the Taylor  (1999) rule generates a higher trajectory for the unemployment rate 
and a slightly lower trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor (1993) rule.   
• The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate through the end of 2019 than the Tealbook baseline.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate slowly drifts down to near its long er-run level of 3 percent.  
By contrast, the federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline continue s to rise 
for a while after 2019.  This divergence occurs because the first -difference 
rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the slower pace of economic growth projected late in the decade and bey ond.  The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2020, in 
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflation in the future, implies lower longer -term real rates over the entire projection period as well 
as higher levels of resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first- difference 
rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are markedly below the unemployment rate paths generated under the other policy rules and further below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  
OPTIMA L CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.4  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy choices in a way that improves overall economic outcomes, given the baseline outlook.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

  control under each of the four loss functions and their associated macroeconomic 
outcomes are nearly the same as in the December Tealbook.   
• The first simulation, “ Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on changes in the federal funds rate.  Under this strategy, 
the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline policy path.  This higher path arises because, in the current baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s  estimate of the 
natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that the “equal weights” loss function judges to be costly.  A tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook 
baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of inflation (in the model) to lower levels of resource utilization.  
• The second simulation, “ Asymmetric weigh t on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemploy ment rate 
is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is considerably below both the path for the case of equal weights and the Tealbook baseline path.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this 
outcome.  The tighter labor market causes inflation to reach 2  percent more 
quickly than in the case of equal weights; inflation then runs 10 to  20 basis 
points above the Committee’s longer -run objective for the next decade.

6 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term is time inconsistent in the sense that, given the 
opportunity to reoptimize the path of the federal funds rate without regard to past policy commitments, 
policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter monetary policy.  Under the assumption of 
optimal control under discretion with “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences, policy rates and

  • The third simulation, “ Large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function 
that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times 
larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise identical.  
The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in the “equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with undershooting the inflation objective in coming years are larger.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds little to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers 
would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of 
unemployment, which this specification of the loss function sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount. 
• The fourth simulatio n, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the specification with equal weights over the next few years in an effort to contain the projected 
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment.  The paths for the real 
federal funds rate and the real 10 -year Treasury yield are also higher for a 
couple of years than in the case of equal weights.  While this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation almost unaffected, it keeps the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations described previously. 
                                                 
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook baseline and optimal control under 
commitment.   For the other three  specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under 
commitment and discretion ar e not much different from each other .

Appendix  
Implementation of  the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds ra te 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations assume that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future and that 
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers 
will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic implications.  
Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merit s and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respon d to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more 
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together, possibly along with others, as a means to assess the various tradeoffs 
policymakers may face when pursuing their mandated objectives.  
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY  POLIC Y STRATEGIES ” 
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported 
in the Monetary Policy Strategies  section .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t , 
and the right-hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the outpu t gap estimate 
for the current period ( ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead annual change in the 
output gap ( ∆4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted πLR, 
is 2 percent.

  Simple Rules  
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 
2 percent longer -run inflation objective and a longer-run real federal funds rate of 1 percent, a 
value used i n the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer -run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).  
Near -term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given  the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters .  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand- side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal f unds rate for the second quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL  FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staf f Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The “Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US  r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter 
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large- scale econometric model 
of the U.S. economy.
3  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others ( 2012).  
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.  
3 For a discussion of this and other conce pts of equilibrium interest rate s, see Gust and 
others  (2016).  Taylor (1993) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+0.5𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡

  which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  It is generated after 
the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they match those in 
the extended Tealbook forecast.  A model simulation then determines the va lue of the real federal 
funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the extended baseline forecast.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate unde r the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* .  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US  r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic 
outcomes even when their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US  r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter 
period to close the output gap at the end of this time frame , whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  Distinct paths of real short -term rates can, in turn, 
generate different paths for inflation and economic activity.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this peri od extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as price and wage setters have perfect foresight and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealb ook 
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large- scale asset 
purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations 
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quar ter, all of the simulations begin 
in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the diff erence between four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, 
measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the resulting loss 
function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount 
factor 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

  components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate o f the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, “Minimal weig ht on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
4  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than t he absolute) values of the weights.   
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal in terest rates, under the assumption of perfect 
foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policyma kers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that policymakers in the model 
see this path as being a binding commitment on their future decisions; the optimal control policy 
takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwis e unconstrained by 
policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a period that ends sufficiently far in the future that extending that period fu rther would not affect 
the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits. 
  
                                                 
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.  Loss Functions

    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
