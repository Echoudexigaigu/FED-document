Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming data since the time of the January Tealbook suggest th at the economy is 
continuing to expand at a moderate pace.  In general, our asses sment of the economic 
situation is little c hanged from our prev ious projection.  
Real GDP is estimated to have i ncreased at an annual rate of 2 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2016, the same as in the January Tealbook.  W e expect GDP growth to 
slow to about 1½ percent in the current quarter, reflecting wha t we judge to be 
transitorily weak data for J anuary, and to move back up to 2 pe rcent in the second 
quarter.  Meanwhile, labor market conditions have continued to improve at a pace 
broadly consistent with our expectations.  We view the economy as currently operating 
slightly above its sustainable  level, with real GDP about ½ percent above potential output 
and the unemployment rate—at 4.8 percent in January—0.2 percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate.  
 For the medium-term projecti on, we have pushed back the start of the assumed 
expansion in fiscal policy t o the beginning of 2018.  Neverthel ess, by the end of 2019, the 
level of real GDP is essentially the same as in the January Tea lbook, as the negative 
effect of the fiscal policy timing change and the weaker-than-e xpected first-quarter data 
are offset by the boost from the higher path for equity prices and the lower path for the 
dollar assumed in this project ion.  Real GDP growth is now projected to be 2 percent in 
2017, which is a little less th an previously forecast, and 2¼ p ercent in 2018, ¼ percentage 
point more.  Real GDP growth is then projected to slow to 2 per cent in 2019, partly 
reflecting the further gradual  normalization of monetary policy assumed in our forecast.  
With GDP increasing faster than potential outpu t, the output gap widens to 1¾ percent at 
the end of 2019, and the unemploymen t rate falls to 4.1 percent—nearly 1 percentage 
point below our estimate of its  natural rate.  B oth the output gap and the unemployment 
rate gap show the same tightne ss in resource utilization by the  end of 2019 as in the 
previous projection.   
The January inflation data were s tronger than we had anticipated.  Total PCE 
price inflation (measured on a 12- month change basis) is now estimated to have been 
1.9 percent in January, and core inflation was 1.7 percent; bot h measures are 
0.1 percentage point higher than w e expected in our previous fo recast.  However, we

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth  in 2017 is below the project ions from the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast  and 
slightly lower than the Blue Chip in 2018 .  The staff’s forecast for the unemployment 
rate is a bit above both the Blue Chip  and SPF surveys  in 2017 and a little below the 
Blue Chip in 2018.  The s taff’s inflation projection is  the same as  that of outside 
forecasters for the CPI but below the SPF forecast s for both overall and core PCE price 
inflation  in 2017 and 2018 .

 Revisions  to the Staff Projection  since  the Previous  SEP 
The FOMC  most recently published  its Summary  of Economic  Projections,  or SEP, following  
the December  FOMC meeting.   The table  below compares  the staff’s current economic  
projection  with the one we presented  in the December  Tealbook.  
Since December, we  have revised down  our projection  for real economic  activity in 2017 by 
about the same amount as we have strengthened  it in 2018.  The downward  revision this  
year reflects  our assumption  that the fiscal policy expansion  that we had been  expecting  this 
year will instead  materialize  next year.  In 2018, we  have revised up  the projectio n because of  
a higher stock price path and a weaker dollar as  well as the assumed  onset of the fiscal 
expansion.   On net, the GDP projection  is only a touch stronger  since December, and  the 
unemployment  rate reaches  4.1 percent  at the end  of 2019, 0.1 percentage  point below our 
projection  in December.  
Reflecting  the core PCE price data for Ja nuary, we have revised up  our projection  for this 
year to 1.8  percent.   Our projection  for core PCE inflation has  also been revised up  slightly in 
2018 and 2019, but the forecast  for total PCE inflation is little changed:  We  continue  to 
project that total  PCE inflation will  move up modestly  and reach 1.9  percent by 2019.   
With both  the outlook  for total PCE inflation and  the  output gap little changed, the  funds 
rate path from  the intercept ‐adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline 
forecast is about the same as in December through  most of the projection  period.

  attribute most of the January surprise to transitory factors, a nd our inflation projection 
beyond this year is not materiall y different from what we showe d in the January 
Tealbook.  In particular, we conti nue to project that core PCE price inflation will move 
up to 2.0 percent in 2019, and that headline inflation will be 1.9 percent.  This projected 
pickup in core inflation from its current level primarily refle cts the fading effects of 
earlier declines in energy prices  and non-energy import prices and the further tightening 
in resource utilization.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Fiscal Policy 
 Considerable uncertainty remains  about the potential size, timi ng, and 
composition of federal fiscal policy changes that may be enacted.  As a result, 
we have retained our placeholder assumption that adjustments to  fiscal policy 
will increase the annual primar y budget deficit (that is, the d eficit excluding 
interest costs) by 1 percent of GDP, and that this fiscal expan sion will take the 
form of a cut in personal income taxes.  However, given that th e Congress and 
the Administration have not yet coalesced around a specific set  of policy 
changes, we have pushed back the assumed start of this fiscal e xpansion from 
the third quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018.1  This fiscal expansion is 
projected to boost the growth rate of real GDP about ¼ percenta ge point per 
year in 2018 and 2019; these estimates are exclusive of multipl ier effects and 
any offsets from higher interest rates and the dollar.   
 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government 
will increase real GDP growth about ¼ percentage point in 2017,  
½ percentage point in 2018, and ¼ pe rcentage point in 2019.  As  a result of 
the adjustm ents to our assump tions for federal fiscal policy, t he contribution 
of policy actions to real GDP grow th is nearly ¼ percentage poi nt less in 2017 
and 0.1 percentage point larger in 2018 than in the January Tea lbook.2   
                                                 
1 We also incorporated an estimat e of the effects of the federal  government hiring freeze that was 
announced after the January Tealbook, which slightly lowers our projected paths for both federal 
employment and real fed eral government purchases of goods and s ervices.  (Compensation of federal 
employees is part of these purchases.) 
2 By the end of 2020, the effect o f the assumed fiscal expansion  on the level of real GDP is 
unrevised relative to the January projection.

  Monetary Policy  
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that is used  in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than  1 percentage point 
per year, on average, over t he projection period and to be 3.4 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2019.3  The path for the federal f unds rate is little changed 
from the January projection.  
 We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at it s current 
level until the third quart er of 2017 and then begin to contrac t, as the proceeds 
from maturing assets are no longer reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield for the current quarter is essential ly in line with 
our January projection.  Over the medium term, the 10-year Trea sury yield is 
still projected to rise signif icantly, from an average of 2.5 p ercent in the 
current quarter to 3.9 per cent by the end of 2019.   
 Triple-B corporate bond spreads are about 20 basis points narrower than we 
projected in the January Teal book, and we carried forward part of the 
narrower spread in the forecast .  The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was 
revised up slightly, but only because of a methodological chang e in the 
calculation of these rates.4   
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 Equity prices have risen around 5½ p ercent since the January Tealbook, more 
than we had anticipat ed.  We view this increase as having raise d valuation 
pressures, which reduces slightl y the scope for further stock p rice appreciation 
over the medium term.  As a resul t, equity prices are projected  to rise at an 
average annual rate of about ¾ pe rcent over the projection period, compared 
                                                 
3 We have maintained the upward adjustment (introduced in the De cember Tealbook) of 
¼ percentage point to the long er-run equilibrium real federal funds rate, which is th e intercept of the 
baseline policy rule in the long r un, to take account of the as sumed fiscal expansion.  We also maintained 
the upward adjustment of ⅛  percentage point to the long-run term premium reflecting the ad ditional supply 
of Treasury debt that would be forthcoming with this expansion.  
4 The change in methodology raised  historical and p rojected mort gage rates by 18 basis points.  
The new method adjusts for the average points and fees paid by prime borrowers of 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages at origination.  Our old method assumed points and fe es were constant a t 1 percent.

  with a 1 percent rate of increas e in the January Tealbook.  Eve n so, stock 
prices at the end of 2019 are abou t 4¾ percent above the previo us projection.   
 Recent data on house prices have come in as expected.  Prices r ose at an 
annual rate of 8 percent in the  fourth quarter after several ye ars of increases in 
the range of 5 to 6 percent.  Give n that house prices are somew hat above their 
historical relationship with ren ts, we continue to project that  growth in home 
valuations will slow to an average annual rate of 4½ percent ov er the medium 
term.  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 After an unusually strong increase in the third quarter, total foreign real GDP 
growth stepped down to an annual rate of about 2¾ percent in th e fourth 
quarter of 2016.  Recent data suggest that activity is expandin g at a moderate 
rate of 2½ percent in the current  quarter.  We expect foreign GDP growth to 
stay at that near-potential pace over the forecast period, litt le changed relative 
to the January Tealbook.   
 The broad nominal dollar has depr eciated about 1  percent since the time of the 
January Tealbook, primarily reflec ting a sizable depreciation r elative to 
emerging market currencies.  We expect the broad real dollar to  appreciate at 
an annual rate of roughly 1¼ percent over the forecast period, as market 
expectations for the federal funds rate are assumed to move up toward the 
staff forecast.  Relative to t he January Tealbook, the projecte d path of the 
dollar is somewhat lower, reflecting recent dollar depreciation . 
Oil and Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil has increased about $1 per ba rrel since the 
time of the January Tealbook and is now trading at $56 per barr el, in line with 
our January forecast.  Spot prices have been supported by repor ts that OPEC 
countries implemented 90 percen t of their agreed-upon productio n cuts in 
January.  In contrast, the December 2019 futures price has dipped about 
$1.50 per barrel and is currently at $55 per barrel, reflecting  an upward 
revision to the forecast for U.S. oil production over the mediu m term.  In line 
with these futures quotes, we fo recast that oil prices will decline very 
gradually over the p rojection period.

   Prices for industrial metals ha ve risen nearl y 5 percent since the January 
Tealbook, driven mostly by recent supply shortages for copper, nickel, zinc, 
and aluminum but also supported by a  pickup in demand from Chin a.  Lumber 
prices are up nearly 11 percent so far in 2017 because of conce rns that the 
U.S.–Canada trade dispute over softwood lumber will restrict Ca nadian 
exports to the United States later this year.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
After rising at an annual rate  of about 2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, 
real GDP growth is expected to slow to 1½ percent in the curren t quarter.  Our estimate 
of real GDP growth in the curre nt quarter is a bout ½ percentage  point lower than in the 
January Tealbook, reflecting unexpectedly low consumer outlays for services and surprisingly weak state and lo cal government construction spend ing data for January.  
We offset some of this surprising weakness over the coming months and raised our 
projection for real GDP growt h in the second quarter to 2 perce nt.  All told, GDP growth 
for the first half of this year , at 1¾ percent, is slightly les s than in the January Tealbook.  
Meanwhile, indicators of consumer sentiment and of business sen timent and activity have 
remained high and, for some measures, have increased further.  As in the previous 
Tealbook, we have tempered our res ponse to the elevated level o f these indicators, which 
presents an upside risk to the projection (one that is discusse d in the alternative scenario 
“Stronger Aggregate Demand” in t he Risks and Uncertainty sectio n).
5   
 After increasing 3 percent i n the fourth quarter and for 2016 as a whole, real 
PCE is expected to rise only 1½ percent in the first quarter.  The slow pace of 
first-quarter growth reflects a step-down in motor vehicle sale s from their 
brisk year-end pace, further declin es in energy services due to an 
unseasonably warm winter, and genera l softness in the January s pending 
data.6  We expect spending growth to pick up in the second quarter, i n part 
                                                 
5 The median of the first-quart er forecasts within the System, a s displayed in the table “Federal 
Reserve System Nowcasts  of 2017:Q1 Real GDP Growth,” at 2.2 per cent, is 0.8 percentage point higher 
than the staff’s judgmental projection of 1.4 percent.  Some of  these nowcasts have taken considerable 
signal from the recent increases in consumer and business senti ment and in indicators of business activity. 
6 Beginning this year, federal legislation required the IRS to hold any tax refund that includes an 
earned income tax credit or a child tax credit until after Febr uary 15.  The new policy is intended to reduce 
fraud and identity theft by allowing time for income verificati on.  Data through late February suggest that 
this change has delayed some federal tax refunds relative to ea rlier years.  Analysis b y the Joint Committee

  because we anticipate a rebound in energy services.  Smoothing through the 
quarterly swings, we expect real  PCE growth of 2¼ percent in th e first half of 
this year.  Consumption growth continues to be supported by ongoing gains in 
employment and household incom e and by increases in household w ealth.  
Had we fully taken onboard the h igher levels of sentiment, projected PCE 
growth in the first half would be  about ¼ percentage point faster.7   
 E&I investment rose at an annual rate of 3 percent in the fourt h quarter 
following declines earlier in 2016.  Given the indicators of bu siness 
spending—such as recent net gain s in new orders of nondefense c apital goods 
and further improvements in measures of business sentiment—we e xpect a 
further step up in E&I growth in t he first half of this year.8  Investment in 
drilling and mining structures al so rose in the fourth quarter, its first increase 
in two years, but overall spending on nonresidential structures  declined as 
investment in other structures pu lled back from a sizable gain in the third 
quarter.  We expect spending on nonr esidential structures to ri se at a 
5¼ percent pace over the first half of this year as investment in drilling and 
mining structures continues to recover and investment in other structures turns 
back up. 
 The recent data on housing activity have been above our expectations. Starts and permits for single-family homes strengthened in the fourth quarter and 
remained near that level in Ja nuary; in addition, sales of exis ting homes 
moved up sharply in January.
9  As a result, we expect real residential 
investment to rise 8 percent in  the current qu arter, 6½ percent age points more 
than in the January Tealbook.  How ever, we expect increases in mortgage 
                                                 
on Taxation suggests that the eff ect on the overall level of re funds will be small, and we expect any 
shortfall in consumer spending in February to be made up in Mar ch.   
7 Our reluctance to raise our nea r-term PCE forecast in response  to the higher sentiment figures 
reflects our view that a portion of the sentiment boost was lik ely related to the election, and that some 
academic research finds that elec tion-induced movements in sent iment have had little effect on consumer 
spending in the past (see Atif Mian, Amir Sufi, and Nasim Khosh khou (2015), “Government Economic 
Policy, Sentiments, and Consumpti on,” NBER Working  Paper Series  21316 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National 
Bureau of Economic Research, July), www.nber.org/papers/w21316?sy=316 ).   
8 We have taken only partial signal from the upbeat business sen timent readings, as these measures 
have, for some time, been somewhat strong relative to the spend ing data. 
9 Some of the recent increase in e xisting home sales—which affec t residential investment (and, 
therefore, GDP) through brokers’ commissions—may reflect a boos t from prospective homebuyers who are 
jumping into the market before mortgage rates increase further.

  rates to restrain starts and sal es in coming months, causing re al residential 
investment spending to decline slightly in the second and third quarters.  
 Real government purchases were not ably lower than expected in t he fourth 
quarter of 2016.  Moreover, structu res investment by state and local 
governments fell sharply in Janua ry.  These public construction data are both 
volatile and prone to large revi sions.  Consequently, we expect  state and local 
construction outlays to bounce  back and to end the year only mo derately 
below the January Tealbook projection.   
 Net exports subtracted almost 1¾ pe rcentage points from the rate of real GDP 
growth in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a sharp incr ease in imports of 
goods and services.  For the first half of 2017, net exports ar e projected to 
subtract about ½ percentage point from GDP growth as imports rise further, in 
line with U.S. demand, and as U.S. exports continue to be restr ained by past 
dollar appreciation.  
 After being little changed, on ne t, since late 2014, manufacturing production 
has risen at a modest pace since September.  These increases, t ogether with 
the continued strengthening in the  new orders indexes in the na tional and 
regional manufacturing surveys , suggest that factory output mig ht be 
expanding on a more sustained basis.  We now project that manuf acturing 
production will increase at a n annual rate of 1¾ percent in the first half of this 
year, 1 percentage point faster  than in the January Tealbook.  (See the box 
“Recent Developments in the Manufacturing Sector.”)   
Real GDP growth is projected  to be 2 percent in 2017, to pick u p to 2¼ percent in 
2018 as our assumed fiscal expansio n kicks in, and then to slow  to about 2 percent in 
2019, reflecting the further gradua l normalization of monetary policy.  (For an alternative 
view, see the box “The Staff Forecast Is Too Strong.”)   
 Real GDP ends the medium-term projection at essentially the sam e level as 
the January Tealbook, as the weaker forecast for the first quar ter of 2017 and 
the later onset of the assum ed fiscal expansion are offset by t he positive 
effects of somewhat more favor able financial conditioning facto rs—in 
particular, the higher path for  equity prices and the lower tra jectory for the 
dollar.

   Over the medium term, real GDP gr owth is expected to outpace po tential 
growth, which rises gradually f rom 1½ percent this year to 1¾ p ercent in 
2019.  The output gap is projecte d to widen to 1¾ percent by the end of 2019, 
the same as in the January Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The January employment report, w hich was broadly consistent with our 
expectations in the January Tealbook, suggests that the labor market has continued to 
improve and is currently a li ttle beyond full employment.10  
 Total nonfarm payroll employme nt increased 227,000 in January, which was 
more than accounted for by stronger-than-expected private-secto r hiring.  In 
contrast, government employmen t unexpectedly fell 10,000 in Jan uary, and 
estimates for both November and December were revised down to a lso show 
declines.  The three-month moving average of total payroll gain s was 183,000, 
about the same as in our pr evious Tealbook forecast.11   
 We took some signal from the upwar d surprise in private payrolls in January 
and nudged up our forecast of private hiring over the next coup le of months.  
In contrast, we marked down proj ected government payrolls to re flect the 
federal government hiring freeze.12  All told, total nonfarm payroll 
employment is expected to r ise about 180,000 per month through the second 
quarter, a touch less tha n previously projected.   
 The unemployment rate edged up to 4.8 percent in January, and t he labor 
force participation rate r ose 0.2 percentage point, to 62.9 per cent; we had 
expected both to be unchanged.  Subs tantially fewer unemployed individuals 
                                                 
10 The employment report for Febru ary will be released on March 1 0, the Friday before the FOMC 
meeting. 
11 The January employment report included the benchmark revisions  to the Current Employment 
Statistics (CES).  The revisions  were minor:  Based on the upda ted CES data, total payroll gains averaged 
187,000 per month in 2016, an upward revision of 7,000 per mont h. 
12 The federal government hiring  freeze, which was effective Janu ary 22 and will la st for 90 days, 
was instituted after the referen ce week for the January employm ent report.  We have currently penciled in 
declines in federal employment of  around 10,000 per month from February through April.  Beyond the 
90-day period, we project furth er, though smaller, declines, on  average.  All told, we now expect federal 
employment to fall by 80,000 by the end of the projection perio d, equal to around 2¾ p ercent of the federal 
workforce.

  left the labor force in Januar y than has been the case recently , which we think 
boosted both the unemployment rate  and the participation rate.  As large 
changes in gross labor force flows tend to be reversed, we project the 
unemployment rate to edge bac k down to 4.7 percent in February and the 
participation rate to slip t o 62.7 percent by April—about the s ame as in the 
January Tealbook.  (See the box “Labor Force Participation and Labor Market 
Flows.”)   
 Labor productivity in the busine ss sector rose at an annual rate of around 
3 percent in the second half of  2016 following a decline in the first half.  For 
the year as a whole, labor productivity increased 1¼ percent, w hich exceeded 
the average pace over the preceding five years by ¾ percentage point.   
The labor market is projected to improve further over the mediu m term, though at 
a slower pace, on average, than in recent years.  By the end of  2019, the labor market is 
very tight, with the unemploymen t rate nearly 1 percentage poin t below our estimate of 
its natural rate.  This projecti on is essentially the same as i n the January Tealbook. 
 Average monthly payroll gains are expected to slow from 170,000 in 2017 to 
120,000 in 2019—just a little faster than the pace consistent w ith no change in 
labor market slack.   
 Labor productivity enters 2017 somew hat above our estimate of i ts structural 
level.  We project that labor productivity will increase a litt le less than 
1 percent per year over the pr ojection period, a bit slower tha n in 2016 and 
slightly below our estimat e of its structural pace.13 
 After having decreased by 1 percentage point over the previous two years, 
the unemployment rate declines  another ¾ percentage point over the coming 
three years and reaches 4.1 percent at the end of 2019.   
 Both the labor force participa tion rate and the employment-to-p opulation 
ratio continue to improve relative to their de clining trends.   
                                                 
13 Productivity typically declines r elative to its structural lev el when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly reflecting lesser-qualified workers being drawn  into the workforce.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION   
 Core PCE price inflation in J anuary, at a monthly rate of 0.3 p ercent, was 
higher than we were expecting.  The  upside surprise was concent rated in some 
categories of goods prices that tend to be volatile, so we did not build in faster 
price increases in coming months.14  Consequently, on a quarterly basis, our 
core inflation forecast is noticeably higher in the current qua rter than in the 
January Tealbook; for the year a s a whole, however, core inflat ion is just 
0.1 percentage point  higher.   
 In the 12 months through January, core PCE prices rose 1.7 perc ent and total 
PCE prices rose 1.9 percent.  Both figures are 0.1 percentage p oint above our 
previous projection.  We expect the 12-month change in core inf lation to 
remain close to 1.7 percent over the near term, while the measure for total 
inflation is anticipated to move a little above 2.0 percent in February and 
March (mainly reflecting earlier  declines in gasoline prices dropping out of 
the calculation) before easi ng to 1.8 percent in the second qua rter.  
 Higher commodity prices, combine d with recent dollar weakness, result in 
core import price inflation of  about 2 percent at an annual rate over the next 
two quarters, which would be the l argest import price increase in over 
five years.  Thereafter, we expect  import price inflation to sl ow to a ¾ percent 
pace, consistent with moderate f oreign inflation, a gradually a ppreciating 
dollar, and slowly declining commo dity prices.  Changes in core  import prices 
are estimated to have held down c ore PCE price inflation by 0.2  percentage 
point in 2016, and they are expecte d to reduce core inflation b y 0.1 percentage 
point per year over the remainder of the medium term.   
 The incoming data on longer-run inflation expectations have not  moved much, 
on balance, in recent months.  Median expectations over the nex t 5 to 10 years 
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged down  to 
                                                 
14 January PCE price changes tend to be more volatile than at oth er times of the year.  For 
example, both this January and January 2016 saw upside surprise s in goods prices that were concentrated in 
apparel and durable goods excluding motor vehicles.  Some of th e unusually high readings on goods price 
inflation in January last year w ere repeated in February, but e ventually these prices  decelerated and core 
goods PCE prices declined for 2016  as a whole.  Similar to last  year, we view the January 2017 reading on 
core goods price inflation as tra nsitorily high, and we expect goods prices will d ecelerate—but the 
uncertainty around the timing is significant.

  2.5 percent in February, about unc hanged from a year ago.  Median 10-year 
inflation expectations  for PCE prices from the Survey of Profes sional 
Forecasters ticked up in the fi rst quarter to 2.1 pe rcent after  being essentially 
flat at 2 percent since earl y 2013.  The 3-year-ahead measure o f inflation 
expectations in the Federal Res erve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer 
Expectations ticked up in February to 3.0 percent.  The TIPS-ba sed measure 
of 5-to-10-year-forward inflati on compensation is currently abo ut 2 percent, 
little changed since the January Tealbook.   
Total PCE price inflation is anticipated to m ove up from 1.4 percent in 2016 to 
1.9 percent by 2019, while core infl ation rises from 1.7 percen t to 2.0 percent over the

point acceleration in core in flation between 2016 and 2019 main ly reflects the 
diminishing pass-through from ear lier declines in energy prices  and core import prices 
along with the further tighten ing of resource utilization.  In addition, we continue to 
assume a small pickup (5 ba sis points in both 2018 and 2019) in  the prevailing level of 
inflation expectations relevan t for wage and price setting.   
We have received several readings  on labor compensation since t he January 
Tealbook.  The evidence for a pick up in wage growth remains mixed, but taken together, 
these recent readings appear consistent with a labor market tha t is operating a little above 
its sustainable level against a backdrop of sluggish trend productivity growth.   
 Average hourly earnings increa sed 2.5 percent ove r the 12 month s ending in 
January after rising at a relatively steady pace of 2 percent earlier in the 
recovery.  In January, average  hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent, a smaller 
increase than we had expected.15  Some of the surprise i n January reflected an 
outsized decline in average hourl y earnings of supervisory work ers in the 
financial-activities sector tha t we expect to be partly reverse d.16  Thus, we 
anticipate average hourly earnings to increase at a solid pace in February and 
the 12-month change to pick up to 2. 9 percent over the next cou ple of months.  
                                                 
15 The average state minimum wage is estimated to have risen from  roughly $8.25 to $8.50 per 
hour in January, which we think added about 0.1 percentage poin t to the change in average hourly earnings 
in January. 
16 The staff estimates that, excluding the financial-activities s ector, average hourly earnings rose 
¼ percent in January.

   The employment cost index (ECI) for December rose 2¼ percent re lative to a 
year earlier, as expected, roughly the same pace seen over the past few years.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker moved  down in 
December and January after acce lerating through much of last ye ar.  The 
latest reading of 3.2 percent is s imilar to that of a year ago.   
 With business-sector compensation per hour (CPH) expected to be  revised up 
in the second half of 2016, we now  estimate that CPH rose 3¼ pe rcent over 
2016, ¾ percentage point more tha n in the previous Tealbook.  W e expect 
CPH growth to be 3 percent, on ave rage, in the first half of th is year and then 
to pick up gradually to 3½ percen t by 2019 as the labor market tightens 
further.   
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 In the longer run, we continue t o assume a natural rate of unem ployment of 
5 percent and potential GDP growth of 1.7 percent. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by the beginning of 2022. 
 With output above its potential and inflation at the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal f unds rate is about 1 percentage  point above its 
long-run value of 3 percent in 2021 and then moves back toward its long-run 
value thereafter. 
 Real GDP growth slows to 1½ pe rcent in 2020 and 1¼ percent in 2 021 as the 
federal funds rate is above its  neutral level.  The unemploymen t rate is 
4.2 percent in 2020 and rises gradually toward its assumed natu ral rate in 
subsequent years.  
 PCE price inflation moves up fro m 1.9 percent in 2019 to slightly above the 
Committee’s long-run objective for a few years before moving ba ck to 
2 percent.

 Recent Developments in the Manufacturing Sector  
Manufacturing output contracted sharply during the Great Recession , and its subsequent recovery 
has been historically weak.  Since mid -2014, both industrial production (IP) and productivity growth 
in manufacturing have stagnated.  This prolonged softness is highly atypical and stands in contrast 
to the slow  but steady improvement in the broader economy.  Although  some very recent 
indicators suggest that manufacturing may be on the verge of escaping its recent stagnation, the 
pickup in activity has not been sustained for long enough to be conclusive.   
Industrial Production .  For the 50 years prior to the most recent recession, manufacturing IP and 
real gross domestic product ( GDP ) rose at the same average rate, with manufacturing being 
considerably more cyclically sensitive (figure 1).  Thereafter, the trends seem to have diverged.  Although both real GDP and manufacturing output bottomed out in the second quarter of 2009, 
GDP in the fourth quarter of 2016 was 12 percent above its pre- recession peak, while manufacturing  
production was still nearly 6 percent below  its previous peak, marking its slowest recovery on 
record.
1  In particular, the recovery for manufacturing has been stalled for the past two years, with 
factory output essentially flat over this period.  
The recent sluggish performance of manufacturing can be partly  explained by weakness in exports.  
According to the staff’s flow -of-goods system, negative contributions from exports (the green bars in 
figure 2) reduced manufacturing growth in both 2015 and 2016, reflecting in part the sharp appreciation 
of the dollar since mid -2014.2  This drag from exports is highly unusual; from 1980 to 2016, exports 
contributed, on average, about 1  percentage point to annual manufacturing output growth.  Since mid -
2014, manufacturing IP has also been restrained by lower demand for manufactured goods used in oil 
and gas drilling and, more broadly, by weak domestic demand for capital goods.  
 
                                                 
1 Notably, because the data for IP extend back to 1919, this assertion indicates that the most recent recovery 
has been even slower than the recoveries following the Great Depression and the end of World War II.  
2 With  data on industrial production, imports, exports, and demand indicators, the flow -of-goods system 
produces model -based estimates of domestic purchases and inventory changes.

 Productivity.   The recent weakness in IP is also reflected in the slowdown in manufacturing labor 
productivity  growth .  Figure 3  plots average labor productivity growth for the manufacturing 
sector (the red bars)  and the broader business sector (the black bars) from 19 72 to 2011 and from 
2012 to 2016.  As shown by the first set of bars , between 1972 and 2011, the average annual growth 
rate for manufacturing productivity was nearly  3½ percent, about 1½ percentage point s faster  than 
the growth rate for business -sector productivity.  Although the pace of productivity growth for 
both the manufacturing and business sectors has decreased in recent years, the second set of bars  
indicates that manufacturing productivity growth has slowed to an average of less than ½ percent  
since 2012, a much greater slowdown than in the overall business  sector.3  Furthermore, the fact 
that productivity growth for the manufacturing sector has been slower than that for the business 
sector is  highly atypical for an expansionary period. 
Industry -level measures of labor productivity based on the Federal Reserve’s IP data (not shown ) 
indicate that the slowing in manufacturing productivity growth has been widespread.  Of the 
263 individual industries that comprise manufacturing IP, more than 80 percent exhibited rates of 
labor productivity growth since 2012 that were below their long -run (1972 to 2011 ) averages, and 
nearly 40 percent experienced labor productivity declines  over this period.  Notably, productivity 
growth in  high -technology manufacturing industries —which has long been a driver of 
manufacturing productivity growth —has been  only half its long -run average over the most recent 
four years.   
Looking forward .  Some very recent signs suggest that manufacturing output may be beginning to 
turn up.  Manufacturing IP has recorded gains (albeit modest) in four of the most recent five 
months, the new orders indexes in national and regional manufacturing surveys have risen 
markedly to solid levels (figure 4), oil and gas drilling has begun to pick up, and domestic capital 
expenditures have begun to show gains.  Nonetheless, it is still too soon to determine whether this 
modest pickup in the manufacturing sector will be sustained .  
 
 
                                                 
3 Measured since the most recent business cycle peak in late 2007—business cycles are common timeframes 
for analyzing p roductivity statistics —manufacturing productivity growth exceeds that for the business sector, 
though manufacturing continues to record a sharper slowdown in productivity growth relative to earlier years.

 Alternative  View:  The  Staff Forecast  Is Too Strong 
In the March  staff forecast,  real GDP rises  at a 2 percent average  annual pace in 2017 and 
2018; the  unemployment  rate drops  to 4.2 percent by the end of 2018 and  remains near 
that level through  2020.  At  the same time, interest rates rise steeply, with the federal 
funds rate exceeding  3 percent  by the end of 2019 and the 10‐year Treasury  yield reaching  
nearly 4 percent.   This alternative view  argues that the staff’s outlook for real activity is 
too strong given the steep rise in interest rates.   
One way to think about the strength  of the staff forecast is through the lens of the 
neutral rate of interest, which is the interest rate that  is consistent  with output  growing 
at its potential  pace, provided  that output is initially at its potential  level.  Because  
aggregate spending, according  to staff models, is  more closely related to long‐term 
interest rates than short‐term  ones, it is helpful to focus on the neutral long‐term interest 
rate—in particular,  the 10‐year Treasury  yield. 
In the staff view, the neutral  rate of interest has recently been depressed relative  to its 
longer‐run value.   For example,  as of the second quarter of 2016, the staff’s estimate of  
the outpu t gap was around zero and had been roughly  flat for the  preceding  few 
quarters,  which suggests  that the level  of interest rates at that  time should  provide a 
good estimate of  the neutral rate of interest.  In  the second quarter of 2016, the 10‐year 
Treasury yield was 1¾ perce nt and thus was slightly negative  in real terms, assuming  
10‐year inflation  expectations  of 2 percent.   Thus, the neutral rate for the real 10‐ year 
Treasury yield also was slightly negative  and well below  the staff’s assumed  longer‐run 
real 10‐Treasury  yield of 1.5 percent (3.5 percent in nominal terms less 2 percent inflation).  
While the method of inferring  the neutral rate of interest described earlier can be  used 
when the  economy  is close to potential,  another approach is  needed over the  medium 
term, when the  unemployment  rate moves considerably  below its natural rate.  An 
alternative  approach  to estimating  the neutral rate is through the use of one version of 
the optimal control exercises  shown in  the Monetary  Policy Strategies  section of  the 
Tealbook—specifically,  the variant that  assumes a very small penalty  on interest rate 
changes.  The interest rate  path in this simulation  returns the unemployment  rate to its  
natural rate by early next year and  keeps the unemployment  rate  near this level 
thereafter.   Thus, by early next year, the  interest rate  path in this scenario  satisfies the 
definition  of a neutral  rate of interest.  As can be seen in the table on the following  page, 
these simulations  imply a high level of the neutral real  interest rate in the medium term.  
In particular,  the real 10‐year Treasury  yield in line 2 is around 2¼ percent,  higher than the 
longer‐run level of 1.5 percent assumed  by the staff, shown  in the right ‐hand column.1  
                                                 
Note:   This alternative  view was prepared  by John Roberts. 
1 Over  the first few quarters of the simulation,  the unemployment  rate has not yet reached its 
natural rate,  so the path of interest rates is not a good measure of the neutral rate of interest over this 
period.

 The real federal funds  rate (line 3)  exceeds its long‐run value (of 1 percent) by an  even 
wider margin. 
The tax cuts assumed  in the staff forecast are one identifiable  factor boosting  the neutral 
rate in coming years:   The tax cuts will support spending  and raise the interest rates 
needed to keep  the unem ployment  rate near  its natural rate.  To illustrate  the effect of 
the tax cuts, lines 4, 5, and 6 of the table show the results of a similar calculation  that 
excludes the tax cut.2  Once again,  by the end of this year, unemployment  is very close  to 
its natural rate.  As expected,  the interest rates  in this case—which  are a reasonable  
approximation  to the neutral rate of interest from 2018 onward—are  lower.  Even  so, in 
this simulation,  the real 10‐ year Treasury  yield—again,  a reasonable  estimate of the 
neutral rate—exceeds  the estimate of  its longer‐run value,  which is 1¼ percent in this 
case.  It edges up through 2019 before moving down toward its longer‐run value.    
An interpretation  of this analysis is that in the staff forecast,  the “headwinds” that  have 
restrained  growth in recent years (and require a low interest rate to  maintain  full 
employment) shift  very rapidly  to strong  “tailwinds” (which  require more restrictive  rates 
to maintain  full employment) that  go beyond the readily identifiable factor  of the tax 
cuts.  Without  a compelling  explanation  for these additional  tailwinds, a less aggressive  
staff forecast would seem appropriate.   Separate calculations  suggest that a downward  
adjustment  to the increas e in real GDP  of around ⅓ percentage point per year  over the 
medium term—along  with  the lower interest  rate path  that our mechanical  rule for the 
federal funds  rate would  imply in that case—would  be sufficient to  eliminate the  
overshooting  in the neutral rate of interest implicit in  the staff outlook.   The 10‐year 
Treasury yield in this case would be about 40  basis points lower, and  the federal funds  
rate would  rise less steeply,  reaching  only about 2½ percent by the end of 2019.

 Labor Force Participation and Labor Market Flows 
Since the end of 2013, the labor force participation rate has moved sideways on net 
(figure 1).  Given its declining trend of about 0.3 percentage point per year as currently 
estimated by the staff, the flat participation rate over the past three years represents a 
cyclical improvement of nearly 1 percentage point.   However, the recent behavior of the 
underlying labor market flows —in particular, the decline in labor force entry to a low 
level —raises the question of whether the participation rate recovery is over.1  The 
discussion in t
he box argues that, historically, there is no strong link between labor force 
entry flows and cyclical movements in the participation rate .  
Figure 2 plots gross labor force entry flows (flows of individuals who move from being 
out of the labor force to either employment or unemployment) and gross labor force exit 
flows (flows in the opposite direction), normalized by the size of the population.  
Intuitively, economic forces that induce an increase in labor force participation —for 
example, greater employment opportunities and rising wages —should lead to more 
people bein
g pulled into the labor force.  However, this behavioral response is difficult to 
identify in the data.  Indeed, in contrast to the intuition described above , gross labor 
force entry flows appear to have been countercyclical during the latest cyclical episode:  
They rose during the Great Recession and early in the recovery —a time when the 
participation rate was falling —and declined more recently, a period in which the 
participation rate has stabilized.  Moreover, during the second half of the 1990s, the 
participation rate moved well above its estimated trend, as shown in figure 1, despite 
gross labor force entry that fell to a very low level by 2000, as shown in figure 2.   
                                                 
1 For example, Krueger (2016) argued that the continued decline in the rate of transition of those 
who are out of the labor force back into the labor force suggests that the recovery in participation is 
likely to be a short- lived phenomenon.  See Alan B. Krueger (2016), “Where Have All the Workers Gone?” 
paper presented at the 60th Economic Conference held at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, Boston, 
Mass., October 14, https://www.bostonfed.org/-/media/Documents/economic/conf/great-recovery-
2016/Alan-B-Krueger.pdf .

 Two factors can help account for the fact that gross labor force entry and exit flows 
typically move very closely together over time , rather than in opposite directions as 
intuition would suggest .  First, the unemployed are substantially more likely to transition 
between being in and out of the labor force than are the employed, which can be due to 
either real transitions or reporting errors of their labor force status in the Current 
Population Survey.2 
 Because the level of unemployment increases during a cyclical 
downturn, both gross entry and exit flows rise, reflecting the churn associated with the 
relatively weaker labor force attachment of the unemployed.  Then, as the recovery 
proceeds and many unemployed individuals find jobs, their probability of temporarily 
dropping out of the labor force (and later rejoining) declines.  Second , secular changes in 
the labor market can affect gross entry and exit flows.  For example, older individuals 
(retirees) have an appreciably lower probability of moving in to and out of the labor force 
than the rest of population —thus, population aging leads to a trend decline in both gross 
labor force entry an
d exit flows.  Indeed, population aging can account for about one-
fifth of the decline in gross flows since 2010. 
In an accounting sense, movements in the participation rate are determined by the net 
flow into the labor force (that is, gross entry flows minus gross exit flows).  However, t he 
factors mentioned in the previous paragraph make it difficult to infer from the flows data 
how many people are actually reentering (and staying in) the labor force.  For example, if 
an individual previously on the sidelines of the labor market —sometimes unemployed, 
sometimes out of the labor force —finds a stable job, she will push up the participation 
rate but also reduce su
bsequent gross entry and exit flows.  Without longitudinal data 
that would track the same individuals over long periods, it is challenging to conclude how 
much persistent reentry is actually taking place in the labor market and how much the 
flows data merely reflect changes in excess churn between unemployment and out of 
the labor force.   As a result, observations about gross labor force entry flows alone are 
insufficient to pin dow
n the remaining potential for cyclical improvement in labor force 
participation.

Summers (1986), “ Reporting Errors and Labor Market Dynamics ,” Econometrica , vol. 54 (November),

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
After an unusually strong third quarter driven by bouncebacks in economic 
activity in Canada and Mexico, total foreign growth eased to an annual rate of 2¾ percent 
in the fourth quarter, still about ½ percentage point higher than its average pace over the 
past two years .  Recent data suggest that growth will edge down further in the current 
quarter  to 2½ percent .  The forecast is little changed , as greater -than-expected momentum 
in the euro area and  less-than-anticipated drag from Brexit in the United Kingdom are 
offset by downward revisions to Mexico.   
We see growth abroad remaining at about 2½ percent, which we judge to be near 
its potential pace, over the remainder of the forecast period .  The effects of a cyclical 
recovery in several South American economies are  counterbalanced by moderating 
growth in China.  In addition, near -term foreign activity should be supported by positive 
sentiment, and growth throughout the forecast period is sustained by accommodative 
monetary policies .  
We continue to see global downside risks as having become somewhat less 
prominent since last year.   We also envision more upside risks.  For example, firm ing 
monthly indicators and the improvement in  foreign  financial market  conditions could 
signal more buoyant economic growth abroad than in our baseline.  (See the “Stronger 
Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar ” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section.)  However, the upcoming elections in several European economies are a source 
of concern; should anti- EU forces gain influence and threaten the breakup of the euro 
area, financial conditions would likely deteriorate across Europe and beyond, weighing 
on activity.  ( See the “Heightened Risk of EU Breakup” alternative scenar io in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section.)  In addition, Mexico  and other EMEs could suffer from 
disruptions related to rising U.S. interest rates  and uncertainty regarding U.S. trade 
policy, as we have highlighted in previous Tealbooks.  Finally , the risk of a hard landing 
in China is always  present .   
Inflation in the AFEs rose  from  an annual rate of  0.8 percent in the third quarter to 
1.8 percent in the fourth quarter, and it is expected to rise to almost 2½  percent in the 
current quarter, largely reflect ing pass -through of higher oil prices and currency 
depreciation s to retail energy prices.   We see AFE inflation moderating to 1½  percent in 
the second quarter as the boost from higher energy prices recedes and then edging up to

 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period as core inflation firms.  With inflation 
generally remaining below central banks’ targets, we continue to expect monetary policy 
in the AFEs to stay  accommodative throughout the forecast period.  
We see inflation in the EMEs rising to an estimated annual rate of 4½ percent in 
the current quarter from 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, as the boost from higher gasoline prices and peso depreciation in Mexico  more than offsets lower inflation in 
China.  Thereafter, EME inflation should moderate and settle slightly abov e 3 percent  by 
the end of this year.  A gainst  this backdrop, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate 
50 basis points, and we envision further tightening this  year.  In contrast, in Brazil, where 
inflation surprised on the downside, the central bank cut its policy rate 75 basis points, and we see further loosening.    
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro Area .  Recent indicators —such as  February  PMIs a nd January confidence 
readings —suggest that GDP growth will increase to  slightly above 2 percent in the 
first quarter , up from 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter, and almost ½ percentage point 
more  than projected in the January Tealbook.  However, s overeign bond spreads for 
France and several other  countries have widened as  recent polls suggest that anti- EU 
candidates may fare well in several upcoming national elections.  W e now see 
political uncertainty  leading to further financial stresses , and we marked down 
slightly our growth outlook for the second half of 2017 because of the persistent 
effects of these stresses .  (M ore details are in the box “Political Uncertainty and the 
Economic Outlook for the Euro Area.”)  Accordingly , we project that GDP growth 
will slow to 1¾  percent in the remainder of 2017 and then edge up to almost 2 percent 
by 2019 as the drag from elevated political uncertainty wanes and monetary policy  
remains stimulative .   
Recent data suggest that, after reaching 2  percent in the fourth quarter, headline 
inflation jumped to 3½ percent in the current quarter on the back of surprisingly strong hikes in retail energy prices.  We expect inflation to fall back to 1¼ percent by 
midyear as the boost from energy prices fades and then to edge up to 1½ percent later in the forecast period as diminishing slack leads to some firming of core inflation.  
Thus, we anticipate  that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) will start tapering its 
purchases at the beginning of 2018, ceasing them entirely by mid year.  We assume

 that the ECB will reinvest the proceeds of its program throughout the forecast period 
and keep  policy rates at their current very low levels until late 2019.   
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth rose from 2.3 percent in the third quarter to 
2.9 percent last  quarter , driven by a sharp rebound in exports.  With export growth 
projected to normalize and given a slight weakening in  activity data , we see growth 
slowing to near 2 percent in the first quarter and holding just below that pace for the 
rest of the year .  This projection is a little higher than in the January Tealbook, as 
faster- than-expected growth in the second half of 2016 led us to rethink the drag  from  
Brexit -related uncertainties.   Even so, we continue to project that growth will 
moderate a bit further to 1¾ percent in 2018 and 2019 as the prospect of reduced trade with th e rest of Europe begins to weigh on investment and spending .  
 
We expect inflation to rise to 3½ percent  in the first quarter , mainly as a result of  past 
sterling depreciation, before gradually falling back to the B ank of England ’s (BOE)  
2 percent target b y 2019.  I n its February Inflation Report , the BOE stated  that weak 
wage growth signaled  more slack in the labor market than it previously thought, and 
also repeated that it was  likely to see through the transitory spike in inflation.  
Accordingly , we now anticipate the first rate hike  to occur in the second half of 2018, 
almost a year later than assumed in the January Tealbook.  We also assume that the BOE will continue purchasing corporate bonds through the first quarter of 2018 and will maintain the stoc k of its government bond purchases at £435 billion through the 
end of 2019. 
• Canada.  Real GDP grew 2. 6 percent in the fourth quarter, somewhat above our 
estimate in the previous  Tealbook, driven in part by solid private consumption.  
January’s s trong manufacturing PMI and solid employment gain s suggest ongoing 
momentum, and we expect GDP growth of 2¼ percent in the current quarter.  
Thereafter, with the output gap closed, growth should settle at its trend pace of 
1¾ percent by mid -2018.   
• Japan.  Fourth-qua rter real GDP growth  moderated to 1 percent .  Although private 
investment and exports picked up, private consumption was flat .  Recent data have 
also been mixed.  M erchandise exports declined in January, but the PMIs through 
February improved further.  T aken together, these changes suggest that GDP g rowth 
will remain near 1  percent in the first quarter , a pace above potential .  Going forward , 
we see economic activity continuing to expand at a similar rate through 2018,

 Political Uncertainty and the Economic Outlook for  the Euro Area  
In recent months, market participants have focused  increasingly on  the rise of anti –European  
Union  (EU) sentiment in euro -area member state s.  As a result, sovereign spreads in some euro-
area countries have widened  noticeably , as shown in figure 1 .  This discussion  reviews the key 
political uncertainties  and outlines  potential implications for the euro- area economic outlook.   
 
National elections will be held this year in the Netherlands, France, Germany, and possibly Italy  
(figure 2) .  In all four countries, voter support for anti -EU parties has increased substantially 
compared with recent decades .  Although  pro- EU part ies appear likely to maintain control over 
the German parliament  by a wide  margin , recent polls  suggest that an anti-EU party could win a 
plurality of votes in the Dutch parliamentary election (Geert Wilders’s PVV , or Party of Freedom ; 
dark blue bar in figure 3) and in the first round of the French p residential election (Marine Le 
Pen’s National Front party; dark blue bar in figure 4 ).   
    
The apparent popularity of these anti-EU parties has renewed fears about the integrity of the 
currency union.  In France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the most prominent anti- EU 
politicians  have called for a referendum to withdraw from the EU  and, hence , the currency 
union.   Moreover, in France and the Netherlands , anti-EU politicians have explicitly advocated  
the reintroduction  of national currencies (and in France, the redenominati on of sovereign debt 
in the new national currency ).  In Italy, the populist Five Star Movement has called for a 
referendum on Italy’s membership in the euro area.   
 
Uncertainties in  France intensified during the intermeeting period.  A corruption scandal 
weakened  Fran çois Fillon, the presidential candidate from the pro- EU center- right  party, rais ing 
the perceived likelihood that Marine Le Pen  could win the presidency .  As a result, French 
sovereign spreads (red line in figure 1) rose to their highest levels in more than four  years.  
Because we expect heightened  political uncertainty and the associated market volatility to 
remain a headwind for the euro- area economy , we marked down slightly  our projection of the 
region’s  growth  in 2017 . 
 
Nevertheless, o ur baseline outlook assumes that the influence of anti- EU part ies will ultimately 
be contained, a referendum on EU membership will not be held in a euro-area member state, 
and political issues  will not derail the recovery .  Our thinking is based on two  considerations .  
First, current polls suggest that anti -EU parties are unlikely to win exclusive control of a national  
government  in the euro area ( figures  3 through 5).  I n France, the presidential election will likely 
involve a second -round runoff (based purely on the popular vote) between the two leading 
candidates from the first round , and t his structure tends to favor centrist  candidates .  In the 
Netherlands, Wilders’s party is polling at  less than one -fifth of survey respondents .  Thus, in 
both countries, even if anti- EU parties fare somewhat better than polls suggest, they will likely 
still need support from other parties —many of which remain strongly in favor of the currency 
union —in order to govern .  Second, constitution al laws set strict requirements for holding a 
referendum in France, the Netherlands, and Italy.  Without a supportive governing majority , it 
may  be very difficult to hold a legal referendum on EU or euro- area membership.1   
 
                                                 
1 For example, in France, normally a minimum requirement for a referendum is the consent of the 
president’s cabinet (which can remain in power only if supported by a majority of lawmakers) or the legislature.  
In th e event of gridlock between an anti- EU president and a more moderate cabinet and legislature, there 
would likely be a legal dispute over the president’s authority to call a referendum.

 Polls are subject to considerable uncertainty, however, especially in light of French survey 
evidence that many voters are un sure about their voting intentions.  Anti -EU parties could 
strongly outperform recent polls, which could substantially  pressure other parties to support 
their policies.   
 If a referendum on the EU is held in a euro- area country  and substantial momentum build s 
toward an EU exit , fears of a breakup of the euro area could intensify significantly.  In such a 
scenario, financial stresses would escalate across the region , weighing heavily on euro- area 
economic activit y and perhaps generating significant spillovers to the United States.  Even if the 
referendum was ultimately voted down, consistent with surveys indicating that  a majority of 
euro- area citizens wish to remain in the currency union, there could be significant financial  
and economic disruptions in the meantime.  An adverse scenario along these lines is  
examined in more depth in the “Heightened Risk of EU Breakup” scenario in the Risks and   
Uncertainty section.

 supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, before stalling  in 2019 as a 
result of a planned consumption tax hike.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• Mexico.   Real GDP grew a solid 2.9 percent at an annual rate last  quarter, down from 
an unusually high pace of 4.3 percent in the third.  Growth was supported by solid 
household demand and rapid export growth.  However , tighter financial conditions, a 
surge in inflation, and continued uncertainty over U.S. trade policy have led to a striking drop in consumer and business confidence, which appear t o be weighing on 
household demand and private investment.  Accordingly, w e see GDP growth 
dropping sharply to 1½ percent in the first half of this year .  Growth should recover  to 
2½ percent by 2019, helped  by the peso’s recent depreciation  and boosted, further 
out, by past reforms to the energy sector .  Relative to the January Tealbook, w e 
revised down growth over the forecast period about ¼ percentage point as a result of  
greater uncertainty about the outlook for U.S. trade policy.  
On the back of sharp hi kes in fuel prices  and peso depreciation, Mexican headline 
inflation has surprised on the upside, rising to a 12-month rate of 4.7 percent in 
January from 3.3 percent in December.  In response, the Bank of Mexico increased its policy rate a further 50 basis points, more than the 25 basis points we anticipated, 
bringing the cumulative increase since late 2015 to 3¼ percentage points.  We see 
12-month inflation falling to 3 ¾ percent by early next year and settling a little above 
the 3  percent midpoint of the target range by the second half of 2018.  On February 
21, the Mexican authorities announced that they will offer up to $20 billion in a 
foreign exchange hedging instrument to support the peso if necessary.  
• Brazil.   Monthly indicators through December sugg est that Brazil’s economy 
continued to contract in the fourth quarter, albeit at a slower pace.  A recent strengthening in industrial production and improved confidence indicators suggest 
that Brazil will pull out of recession in the current quarter.  Even  so, we expect the 
recovery to be slow, with GDP rising a tepid 1½ percent in 2017 as rising 
unemployment and household deleveraging continue to weigh on consumer spending.  Further out, w ith fiscal reforms supporting confidence and monetary policy easing, 
we see growth rising to a little over 2 percent.

 Inflation has continued to decline, with the 12-month rate reaching 5.4 percent in 
January, just below the upper bound of the central bank’s target range.  This decline, coupled with weak economic activity  and a strengthening currency , led the Brazilian 
central bank to reduce its policy rate a further 75 basis points to 12¼ percent  at its 
February meeting, as we expected.  
• China.   We estimate that real GDP growth will edge down to just below 6½ percent 
in the current quarter.  Recent measures to cool the housing market will likely weigh 
on growth, although an improvement in PMIs through February suggests that the 
services and exports sectors will pick up.  We see growth slowing to 5¾ percent by 2019 as potential growth declines.  However, downside risks to the outlook remain significant, including the possibility of a sharp adjustment in the property market, a run on the financial system, and a destabilizing currency depreciation.  
After dipping to 1.3 percent in the third quarter, headline consumer price inflation 
bounced back to 2.6 percent in the fourth.  W e see consumer price inflation remaining  
around 2½ percent over the forecast period, but, given sharp increases in producer prices  (following years of declines ) and some increase in consumer services inflation  
in recent months, there is some upside risk to this  outlook. 
• Other Emerging Asia.  Real GDP growth slowed to 3½ percent last  quarter from a 
little under 4 percent in the third quarter.  This slowdown to some extent  reflects a 
step-down in India n growth  from 7.6 percent in the third quarter to 4.6 percent in the 
fourth , in part because of the abrupt removal of 500- and 1000- rupee bank  notes from 
circulation.  Elsewhere in the region, the growth pict ure in the fourth quarter was 
mixed .  External demand, as reflected in a pickup in high -tech exports and 
manufacturing activity, i s supporting activity in much of the region.  However, in 
some economies —most notably Korea and Taiwan —weak domestic demand appears 
to be more than offsetting the momentum from external demand.  Overall, we see 
growth in the region rising back to 3¾ percent in the near term —partly as India’s 
economy rebounds— and settling  at around 3½ percent by next year .

Financial Market Developments 
 Financial markets were genera lly quiet over the intermeeting p eriod, although 
broad equity price indexes conti nued to climb, fu rther stretchi ng valuation pressures in 
that market.  Market-based odds of an increase in the target ra nge for the federal funds 
rate at the March meeting surge d late in the period, prompted by comments by Federal 
Reserve officials.  Market expectations of the l evel of the fed eral funds rate beyond the 
near term—as well as Treasury yi elds, inflation compensation, a nd the exchange value of 
the dollar—all experienced rel atively small net changes.   
 Based on market quotes, the odds of an increase in the target r ange for the 
federal funds rate at the March meeting moved up from about 25 percent to 
roughly 80 percent.  Market-based exp ectations for the level of the federal 
funds rate from mid-2017 through the  medium term rose about 15 basis points 
on average.  
 Yields on nominal Treasury securities for maturities of 5 years  or less were up 
around 15 basis points, while yields  for maturities of 10 years  or longer 
increased only slightly on net.  
 TIPS-based inflation compensati on decreased 10 basis points at the 5-year 
horizon but was little changed at the 5-to-10-year horizon. 
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes rose about 5 percent.  Near-ter m option-
implied stock price volatilit y remained near the lower end of i ts range over the 
past several years.  Corporate  bond spreads were little changed  for 
investment-grade firms but narrowe d some for speculative-grade firms. 
 AFE and EME equity indexes increased 3½ percent and 2 percent, 
respectively, since the February meeting. 
 The broad dollar index was a bout unchanged, as an appreciation against AFE 
currencies was offset by a depreciation against EME currencies.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Domestic Developments 
On net, Federal Reserve communi cations over the period appear t o have raised 
expectations of a rate hike at the March meeting.  Market parti cipants’ expectations for 
the path of the federal funds rat e in the medium term also move d up somewhat but were 
little changed at more distant horizons.  The Committee’s decis ion to keep the target 
range for the federal funds rate  unchanged at the February FOMC  meeting was well 
anticipated.  The C hair’s semiannual Monetary Policy Report  testimony on February 14 
was reportedly interpreted by market participants as suggesting  a slightly higher 
probability of monetary policy ti ghtening in the near term.  Su bsequently, investors 
reportedly took note of the menti on in the February FOMC meeting minutes that many 
FOMC participants thought it ma y be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate fairly 
soon.  However, FOMC participants w ere also described as seeing only a modest risk that 
inflation pressures would incre ase significantly.  Late in the period, communications 
from several Federal Reserve o fficials seemed to prompt market participants to 
substantially revise  up the probability t hey attached to an inc rease in the target range for 
the federal funds rate at  the upcoming meeting. 
Overall, based on federal funds f utures prices, the risk-neutra l probability of an 
increase in the target range for the feder al funds rate at the March meeting moved up 
substantially, from about 25 per cent to around 80 percent.  The  expected level of the 
federal funds rate from the middle of 2017 through the medium t erm, as measured either 
by a straight read from OIS quotes  or by a staff model that adj usts for term premiums, 
rose modestly, but the expected  level in the long run remains l ittle changed.  
Over the intermeeting period, nominal Treasury yields moved up somewhat for 
maturities of five years or less.  Nominal Treasury yields for longer-dated maturities were 
little changed, on net, over the i ntermeeting period, although they rose notably late in the 
period amid comments by various Fed eral Reserve officials.  Treasury yields reacted only 
modestly to domestic economic da ta releases that were reportedly seen as somewhat 
better than expected, on balance, bu t yields were somewhat sensitive to news regarding 
political uncertainties in Eur ope.  TIPS-based inflation compen sation at the 5-to-10-year 
horizon was also little changed, on net, since the February FOM C meeting.  Both 
nominal Treasury yields and inf lation compensation remain notab ly higher than levels 
that prevailed prior to t he November elections.

  Continuing the patterns seen since  the November elections, broa d U.S. equity 
price indexes rose, on net, since t he February FOMC meeting, likely reflecting an 
increase in risk tolerance am ong equity market investors.  The equity risk premium 
decreased a bit further and now stands in the lower quartile of its historical distribution 
since 1985.  Stock prices rose ac ross most industries, and equity prices for financial firms 
outperformed broader indexes.  Meanwhile, spreads on yields of nonfinancial corporate 
bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities wer e little changed for 
investment-grade firms but narro wed some for speculative-grade firms. 
Equity prices of the top six ba nk holding companies (BHCs) show ed a further 
step-up following the President’s  executive order on February 3 regarding core principles 
for regulating the U.S. financial system and have subsequently remained at higher levels.1  
In addition, CDS spreads of the largest BHCs declined slightly following the executive 
order.  Moreover, consensus year ly earnings expectations have i mproved for fiscal year 
2017 for most large BHCs over the past month. 
Foreign Developments 
Foreign market conditions were generally positive over the inte rmeeting period, 
with equities rising, reflecti ng positive earnings and improved  economic indicators.  
Sentiment was particularly buoyant toward emerging market econo mies:  EME exchange 
rates have moved up, EME bond spreads have narrowed, and flows to EME mutual funds 
have picked up.  Financial market conditions were more mixed in  the AFEs.  AFE 
exchange rates and sovereign yiel ds have moved down and French spreads were volatile, 
in part due to heightened politic al uncertainty in Europe.   
On balance, the value of the broad dollar index is about unchan ged since the 
FOMC meeting.  Consistent with positiv e sentiment toward the EM Es, the dollar 
depreciated 1¼ percent against EME currenc ies.  The dollar weak ened 4 percent against 
the Mexican peso, which benefited from the Bank of Mexico’s announcement of a 
$20 billion program offering hedges ag ainst peso depreciation a nd a 50 basis point 
increase in the policy rate .  In contrast, the dollar rose 2½ percent against AFE 
currencies, including a 2¾ percent increase against the euro, d riven by monetary policy 
divergence and heightened political risks in Europe.   
                                                 
1 Increases in bank stock prices may reflect investors’ expectat ions of lighter bank regulations, 
lower taxes, and higher interest  rates that would boost large banks’ profits.

  Concerns that the anti-euro ca ndidate Marine Le Pen could win the French 
presidential election this sp ring and uncertainty about the future of the European financial 
assistance program for Greece were drivers of asset price movem ents in Europe (see the 
box “Political Uncertainty and the  Economic Outlook for the Euro Area” in the 
International Economic Developments and Outlook section).  Fren ch sovereign spreads 
widened as much as 19 basis points but retraced as polls indicated less likelihood of a 
Le Pen victory.  German 10-year y ields have declined 12 basis p oints since the February 
FOMC as investors sought safer assets.  Despite these developme nts, euro-area stocks 
increased 4½ percent, in line wit h other advanced-economy equit y markets, lifted by 
positive earnings and economic data as well as the weaker euro.   
U.K. 10-year yields also dec lined notably.  A dovish assessment of U.K. labor 
market slack by the Bank of England at its February 2 policy meeting and weaker-than-
expected U.K. inflation and reta il sales data contributed to a 21 basis point decline in 
24-month-ahead policy expectati ons.  Meanwhile, Japanese 10-year government bond 
yields rose to 15 basis points e arly in the period, leading the  Bank of Japan (BOJ) to 
purchase more bonds in the 5-to-1 0-year segment than expected.  The Japanese 10-year 
yield ended the period at 7 basis  points, in line with the BOJ’ s target of around 0 percent. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, cond itions in domestic short-term  funding markets 
remained stable.  The effective federal funds rate held steady at 66 basis points except for 
typical softness at month-ends , and overnight Eurodollar rates were generally at about 
that level as well.  Overnight T reasury repo rates generally re mained just a little above 
the ON RRP rate. 
On March 15, the debt limit suspension period ends, and the Tre asury Department 
is expected to have reduced its cash balance at the Federal Res erve to $23 billion.2  The 
staff projects that the Treas ury will reduce net bill supply by  about $85 billion between 
March 3 and March 15.  This action may have spillover effects i nto the repo market, 
including possible increased take-up at the ON RRP facility. 
                                                 
2 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2 015 stipulates that the Secretary of the Treasury shall not increase 
the cash balance “above normal operating balances.”  This wordi ng has been broadly interpreted to be 
$23 billion, which was the opening cash balance on November 2, 2015, when the suspension was signed 
into law.  Assuming the debt ceiling will not be raised, on Mar ch 16, 2017, the Treasury will begin to take 
“extraordinary measures” to remain under the debt limit.  With the availability of thes e measures as well as 
April’s typically large tax rece ipts, the Treasury is not expec ted to hit the debt limit before the fall of 2017.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Financing conditions for nonfinan cial businesses and households  have remained 
generally accommodative in recen t months and continue to be sup portive of economic 
activity. 
 Credit flows to large firms have remained solid, with particula rly strong 
investment-grade corporate bond i ssuance and leveraged loan originations. 
 Loans continued to be largely available for most households and  for small 
businesses, though small business credit demand has remained su bdued. 
 Over a longer horizon, and against  the backdrop of financing co nditions that 
have remained accommodative overall, some borrowers appear to be facing 
modestly higher borrowing costs a s a result of the gradual removal of 
monetary accommodation since late 2015.  
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  
Nonfinancial Corpora te Debt and Equity  
Gross issuance of investment-gra de corporate bonds remained str ong in January 
and February.  Although speculative-grade issuance has been sub dued in recent months 
on average, bond spreads for riskie r firms remained at the lowe r end of their range over

Street analysts continue to proj ect robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over the next 
year, even as fourth-quarter earnings are estimated to have com e in about flat relative to

In the leveraged loan market, increased appetite from instituti onal investors has 
led to more favorable financing conditions in recent months.  L everaged loan mutual 
funds in particular have experien ced persistent and significant inflows since October, in 
part because floating-rate loans have become relatively attract ive to investors compared 
with fixed coupon bonds, given expectations of further increases in short-term interest rates.  In January, spreads on lev eraged loans continued to nar row and gross institutional

  leveraged loan issuance reached about $75 billion—the highest monthly level since 
February 2013—with roughly three-fourths of that being for refinancing purposes.  Nevertheless, total outstanding i nstitutional leveraged loans e dged down, as loan 
paydowns outpaced gross issuance.  
C&I loans on banks’ books were li ttle changed in January and Fe bruary.  The 
recent slowdown in C&I loan growth  is largely a result of loan paydowns at large banks 
and branches and agencies of f oreign banks, which tend to serve  large clients that have 
access to the institutional leveraged loan market. 
Commercial Real Estate  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained accomm odative in 
recent months.  CRE loans on banks’ books continued to grow, an d triple A CMBS 
spreads were little changed.  How ever, the volumes of CMBS issu ance and of deals in the 
pipeline have been lower this  year through February compared wi th the same time period 
in each of the prior two years.  Mar ket commentators attribute some of the CMBS 
slowdown to issuers digesting the risk retention rules that too k effect in late 2016.  
Finally, although the delinquency r ate on loans in CMBS pools continued to rise in the 
past couple of months, lenders a re not expected to tighten unde rwriting standards (see the 
box “What Are the Implications of t he Sharp Rise in the CMBS De linquency Rate for 
Financing Conditions in This Market?”). 
Small Businesses 
Credit supply to well-establishe d small businesses remained gen erally available. 
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) index on  small business 
optimism increased substantiall y at the end of last year and now stands at its highest level 
since 2004, likely reflecting exp ected changes in the regulator y and tax environment 
under the new Administration.  However, results from the Januar y SLOOS suggest that 
increased optimism has not yet tr anslated into stronger loan demand from small 
businesses.  In addition, utilization rates  of existing lines o f credit and NFIB survey 
results on planned capital expenditures remain low.

 What Are the Implications  of the Sharp Rise  in the Delinquency  Rate 
for Commercial  Mortgage ‐Backed Securities  in This Market? 
The delinquency  rate for commercial  mortgages  in corporate mortgage ‐backed securities  
(CMBS) pools has increased  since the spring  of 2016, raising concerns  about whether 
signs of distress in CMBS financing  conditions  are emerging  (the left panel of figure 1).   In 
this discussion,  we show that the increase in delinquencies  is confined  to loans from the 
2006–07 CMBS pools, we  project the evolution  of the delinquency  rate, and we describe 
why the projected  increase is  unlikely to indicate  an adverse  change in CMBS financing  
conditions.  
As shown in  the right panel of figure 1, the key driver of  the increase in the aggregate 
CMBS delinquency  rate is the set of loans from the 2006–07  legacy vintage.1  These loans  
were originated  at a time  when CMBS  underwriting  was very loose;  such standards  have 
since tightened  substantially.   Loans in CMBS pools typically have a 10‐year term  and are 
generally  not fully amortizing—generally,  the large maturing  balloon balances  need to be 
refinanced  to avoid default.  As of 2016:Q4,  of the original $394 billion of  loans from the 
2006–07 vintage, about $227 billion  had been refinanced  and $70 billion had been charged 
off, leaving  roughly $96 billion of loans outstanding,  most of which are expected  to 
mature by the end of 2017.  Out of this outstanding  volume, roughly  $16 billion of  loans 
were delinquent  in the fourth  quarter, and  we estimate that  an additional  $12 billion  will 
likely default in 2017 because of their inability to refinance their  maturing  balances  in the 
CMBS market, given today’s more stringent  underwriting.2  
                                                 
1 The delinquency  rate of the post‐ crisis CMBS loans remains low,  although  some of the loans used 
to finance retail properties  in regional markets have shown some signs of distress in recent months.  
2 The volume  of loans expected  to default would be even higher had we used loan characteristics  at 
origination—the  strong rebound of commercial  real estate property prices  and decrease  in interest 
rates  since the crisis have produced  significant  improvements  in the updated credit profiles  of these 
loans.  In contrast,  the volume of expecte d defaults would be lower  if some of loans manage to 
refinance  outside of the CMBS market.  Staff analysis indicates  that since 2015, roughly half of the loans 
originally  financed in the CMBS market have been refinancing  their loan balances  post‐crisis using non‐
CMBS funding.  This share appears to have picked up somewhat  since 2015.

 We expect these future  defaults to cause  the delinquency  rate on the 2006–07  vintage to 
continue to rise significantly  over the  course of this year (the  red line in the left panel of 
figure 2).3  The defaulting  loans will boost the delinquency  rate of the 2006–07  vintage 
for some  time, as defaults continue  to affect the numerator  of the delinquency  rate until  
they are resolved.  In  addition,  loans on fundamentally  solid properties  that are able to 
refinance at the  end of their original terms drop  out of the 2006‐07 CMBS vintage, 
causing the denominator  of the delinquency  rate to contract quickly  and the rate itself  to 
spike.  By the end of 2017, most remaining  loans in the 2006–07  vintage should be 
resolved one way or another.   Overall, the projected  increase in the delinquency  rate of 
the 2006–07  vintage will drive  up the aggregate delinquency  rate in the first half of 2017, 
as shown in  the right panel of figure 2, even if the delinquency  rate  for the post ‐crisis 
vintages remains near zero.  As the volume of outstanding  2006–07  loans is projected  to 
dwindle over  time, the contribution  of these loans to the aggregate delinquency  rate will 
decline, and the aggregate delinquency  rate should  start to fall again in  the second half of 
this year. 
We believe that the projected  rise in the aggregate CMBS  delinquency  rate is unlikely to 
portend an adverse  change in CMBS financing  conditions  for three  reasons.   First, the 
projected  delinquency  rate  remains well below  the levels seen during  the financial crisis.  
Second, unlike during the financial crisis, the projected  increase in  the delinquency  rate is 
not caused by broader market  distress  or a shock to property values or rents.  Third, the 
increase has  been long  anticipated  by market participants.   According  to market  sources, 
the increased  credit risk associated  with the 2006–07  vintage is already priced in by the 
markets.  Indeed, combining  our projected  default rate for outstanding  2006–07  loans 
with a reasonable  assumption  on loss severity,  our estimate of  cumulative losses  for this 
vintage appears to be fairly well aligned  with reported  estimates  of investors’  current 
expectations  of these losses.  
                                                 
3 Our projection  for the evolution  of the delinquency  rate for the 2006–07 vintage is based on our 
projection  of the volume  of loans defaulting  at maturity  in a given quarter  in 2017.  To project the future 
path of the aggregate  delinquency  rate, we combine the projection  for the 2006–07 vintage with an 
assumption  of a constant , near‐zero delinquency  rate for loans in the post‐crisis vintage as well  as an 
assumption  that the 2006–07 vintage  will continue to decline as a share of total CMBS outstanding  at 
the average rate observed  over  the past year.

  obligation and revenue) over comp arable-maturity Treasury secur ities increased a bit.  
The credit quality of state and l ocal governments generally imp roved further, as the 
number of ratings upgrades notab ly outpaced the number of downg rades in January and 
February, mainly because of rati ng changes for general obligati on bonds. 
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were li ttle changed over 
the intermeeting period, as mortg age credit continued to be ava ilable for borrowers with 
strong credit scores and documen ted incomes.  In January and February, the interest rate 
on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages m oved sideways after having risen with Treasury yields, 
on net, since November.  Closed-end residential mortgage loans on banks’ books were 
about flat in January and February, while banks’ holdings of home equity lines of credit 
continued their long contraction.  
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accomm odative over 
the past few months on balance.  C onsumer credit continued to i ncrease at a 6½ percent 
year-over-year rate in Decembe r 2016, reflecting similar growth  rates in the credit card, 
automobile, and student loan segments.  Financing conditions in the ABS market 
remained favorable, while the g rowth of consumer lending at ban ks continued in January 
and February, albeit at a slower  pace than in the fourth quarte r of 2016.  The notable 
exception to the generally accommodative financing conditions f or consumers is the still-
tight standards on subprime credit card lending.   
Overall, household debt continued to increase at a moderate pace in the fourth 
quarter, and the ratio of household debt to disposable income m oved sideways again.  
Household net worth also increas ed in the fourth quarter, prima rily because of additional 
sizable increases in home and equity market prices.  The ratio of household net worth to 
disposable income, which has hove red at an elevated level for a  few years, edged up a bit 
further to near its historical high. 
DEVELOPMENTS SINCE LATE 2015 
Since late 2015, the FOMC has begun to gradually remove monetary policy 
accommodation, increasing the targe t range for the federal funds rate by a total of 
50 basis points.  In addition, 5- and 10-year Treasury yields h ave risen about 30 basis

  points and 20 basis points, on net, respectively, reflecting th e change in the stance of 
monetary policy as well as other factors.   
Discerning the effects of the  removal of accommodation on finan cing conditions 
is challenging.  The change in monetary policy has been fairly modest, and financing 
conditions are also affected by other factors, such as changes in demand for credit or 
movements in risk premiums resu lting from shifting investor sen timent.   
Nonetheless, monetary policy a ctions since late 2015 appear to have led to 
modestly higher borrowing costs in some credit market segments.   For example, interest 
rates on newly extended bilateral (that is, nonsyndicated) LIBO R-priced loans have risen 
about 60 basis points, as LIBOR in creased while spreads stayed roughly constant.  C&I 
loan expansion has continued over this period on net.  In addition, rates on nonfinancial 
commercial paper have risen rough ly in line with the federal fu nds rate, while the 
outstanding amount is little changed on balance. 
For some other segments of business credit markets, the effects of the gradual 
removal of policy accommodation on  financing rates have likely been tempered or offset 
by other factors.  In the leveraged loan market, the prevalence  of interest rate floors has 
mitigated the effects of increases in LIBOR since late 2015, as  LIBOR has generally 
remained below the floors.  Howev er, further increases in LIBOR will likely pass through 
to interest rates on leveraged l oans, as the three-month LIBOR has recently risen just 
above the typical flo or of 1 percent.   
In addition, yields in the corpor ate bond market have moved dow n considerably 
since December 2015, despite the increase in yields on comparab le-maturity Treasury 
bonds, on the basis of lower expected default rates and improved investor sentiment.  
Corporate bond issuance has b een robust throughout the period.   
In household credit markets, fin ancing conditions for residential mortgages have 
tightened a bit.  Rates on 30-year  fixed-rate conforming residential mortgage loans rose 
about 20 basis points, on net, from December 2015 up until the December 2016 FOMC 
meeting.  Perhaps more indicative of the effects of less accomm odative monetary policy, 
rates moved up 16 basis points shortly after the December 2016 FOMC announcement, in 
line with the increase in the 10-year Treasury yield, reportedly spurred in part by the upward revision to the Committee’s median projection for the fe deral funds rate in the

  Summary of Economic Projections .  Since then, though, some of t his increase has 
retraced.  Home purchase activity has continued apace in this p eriod.  
Finally, recent survey data indicate that consumers may be begi nning to take 
rising interest rates into consideration in their  financial dec isionmaking, especially 
following the December 2016 rate hike.  The percentage of consumers expecting higher 
interest rates in the next 12 months, based on the University o f Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers, has increased since last summer, although it is not clear how much of this 
increase is due to monetary polic y actions that have already ta ken place.  The percentage 
of consumers that cite expecta tions of rising interest rates as  a reason that it is a good 
time to buy a home has increased, and such expectations may be pulling forward some 
demand for mortgage credit.  I n addition, the percentages of co nsumers who cite low 
interest rates as a reason for  purchasing homes, automobiles, and durable goods have 
declined in recent months.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
The evidence regarding the magnitude of uncertainty around our projections for 
real GDP growth and the unemployment rate is mixed.  As in the January Tealbook, we 
see uncertainty as being somewh at higher than it was before the  recent U.S. elections but 
nonetheless reasonably well in lin e with the average over the p ast 20 years (the 
benchmark used by the FOMC).  On the one hand, the Baker, Bloom , and Davis index of 
economic policy uncertainty remains at a higher level than in the months before the 
election.  On the other hand, options -based indexes of expected stock market volatility 
(for example, the VIX) remai n at subdued levels, as do corporate bond spreads.   
We continue to regard the risks  to our medium-term GDP projecti on as tilted to 
the downside, primarily because monetary policy is likely bette r positioned to offset large 
positive shocks than substantial adverse ones.  A rising federa l funds rate implies 
increasing room for conventiona l monetary policy actions, but i n the staff’s baseline 
outlook there is not much room f or accommodation in the event o f a moderately large 
adverse shock over the next year or so.  Although we continue t o view the risks as tilted 
to the downside, we view those ri sks as less pronounced than in  the recent past, reflecting 
both risks to the foreign outlook t hat have subsided somewhat and elevated levels of 
consumer and business confidence in the United States.  We view  the risks around our 
unemployment rate projection as  aligned with those for GDP and, therefore, as skewed to 
the upside.     
With regard to inflation, we do not  view the current level of u ncertainty as 
unusually high.  We see importa nt risks to inflation on both th e downside and the upside, 
and we view those risks as roughly balanced.  To the downside, some survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at low levels.  In addition, the 
projected divergence between dome stic and foreign monetary policies could generate 
greater appreciation of  the dollar than we have anticipated in the baseline forecast.  To 
the upside, with the economy pr ojected to be operating above it s long-run potential, 
inflation may increase more than the staff expects, consistent with the predictions of 
models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation, a possibility that 
is explored in one of the alte rnative scenarios.

 ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario explores the 
consequences of a stronger response of wages to labor market slack and a more 
pronounced reaction of long-run inf lation expectations to reali zed inflation.  The second 
scenario considers the possibi lity of greater impetus to privat e demand.  The third 
scenario illustrates the macroeconomic implications of a disrup tion in financial markets 
due to a reassessment of appropria te asset valuations.  In the fourth scenario, we assume 
the tax cut incorporated in the  staff projection for next year does not materialize.  In the 
fifth scenario, we analyze the e ffects of a heightened risk of a breakup of the European 
Union that has financial ramifi cations for the global economy.  The sixth scenario 
considers the possibility that growth abroad is stronger and that the dollar is weaker than 
in the baseline.  
We simulate these scenarios us ing a variety of staff models ind icated in the 
scenario headings.1  In all but one scenario, the federal funds rate is governed b y the same 
rule as in the baseline.  The exception is the No Fiscal Expans ion scenario, where we 
assume an alternative adjustment  to the intercept in the baseli ne rule.  The size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the bas eline paths in all of the 
scenarios. 
Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and Mo re Sensitive Long-Run Inflati on 
Expectations (FRB/US) 
Despite tight labor and product markets in the Tealbook baselin e, core PCE 
inflation is projected to pic k up only slowly over the medium t erm, reaching 2 percent in 
2019.  This outlook is consistent w ith the relatively muted sen sitivity of inflation to 
economic slack seen in recent years.  However, given the possib ility of nonlin earities in 
the Phillips curve, this scenario postulates that wages become more sensitive to labor 
market slack as the unemployment rate falls further.  At the sa me time, long-run inflation 
expectations are assumed to become more sensitive to realized i nflation.2 
                                                 
1 The models used are FRB/US, which  is a large-scale macroeconom etric model of the U.S. 
economy; EDO, which is an estimat ed medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy; 
and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model. 
2 In the calibration of this scena rio, we assume that both the s lope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four tim es larger than in the

 Under these circumstances, inf lation increases to 2½ percent in 2019 and is close 
to 3 percent at the end of the s imulation.  To counteract the h igher inflation, the federal 
funds rate increases more rapidly than in the baseline, reachin g 3¾ percent in 2019 and 
4¾ percent in 2022, about ¾ percentage  point higher than in the baseline projection.  As a 
consequence of slightly higher longer-term real interest rates,  real GDP growth is a bit 
lower and the unemployment rate t rajectory is slightly higher.  
Stronger Aggregate Demand (EDO) 
Several survey-based indicators  of consumer sentiment and busin ess activity have 
increased significantly in recent months.  Motivated by this su rvey evidence, this scenario 
assumes that more ebullient animal spirits spur faster consumer  and business spending.3 
In this scenario, real GDP rises 2¾ percent in 2017, compared w ith 2 percent in 
the baseline projection.  The une mployment rate falls noticeabl y faster than baseline in 
2017 and 2018; it then edges up over the remainder of the simul ation period and is close 
to the baseline level by the end of 2020.  Inflation is little changed, while the federal 
funds rate rises more steeply and is as much as ½ percentage po int higher than the 
baseline. 
Domestic Financial Turbulence (FRB/US) 
In the latest QS report, the s taff raised its level of concern about asset valuations 
to a “notable” level and continue d to point to the elevated lev els of corporate leverage as 
a potential source of fragility.  The staff modal outlook assum es that financial 
developments proceed smoothly, w ith equity prices edging up fur ther from current levels 
and corporate bond premiums remaining near their recent relativ ely low levels.  
However, risks attend our forecast, and in this scenario, we il lustrate the effects of 
financial turbulence stemming fro m a downward adjustment of fin ancial asset and 
commercial real estate valuat ions starting at the end of 2017.  We assume that the 
financial turmoil leads to highe r risk premiums and causes a cu rtailment of credit to 
                                                 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the incr ease reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that cover s the late 1980s to the late 1990s.  
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this s cenario are well belo w those representing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s. 
3 In this scenario, we apply a shoc k that lowers the aggregate risk premium, which is the model’s 
main driver of aggregate demand, by one standard deviation.

 households and businesses.4  In particular, the triple-B c orporate bond spread rises about  
100 basis points above the baseline in 2018 and the stock market falls about 20 percent 
from peak to trough. 
Real GDP decelerates substanti ally and increases only 1 percent per year, on 
average, in 2018 and 2019, while the unemployment rate rises ab ove 5 percent in late 
2018, ¾ percentage point higher th an in the baseline.  The high er unemployment rate and 
slightly lower projected inflati on imply a shallo wer path for t he federal funds rate, which 
is 1¼ percentage points below the baseline projection at the en d of 2019.  
No Fiscal Expansion (FRB/US) 
In the baseline projection, the  staff is assuming a cut in pers onal income taxes 
equal to 1 percent of GDP starting in the fir st quarter of 2018.  However, enactment of 
fiscal expansion is not assured, a nd in this scenario, we assum e that the tax cut forecast 
by the staff does not materialize .  As a consequence, we also u nwind the adjustments to 
the rule for setting the federal  funds rate and to the long-ter m interest rate term premium 
made in the baseline projection t o account for additional fiscal expansion. 
Without the tax cut, real GDP growth is ¼ percentage point lower than in the 
baseline in 2018 and slightly low er in 2019, while the unemploy ment rate is ¼ percentage 
point higher at the end of 2018.  In addition, inflation follow s a slightly lower trajectory 
in this scenario.  These developm ents, together with the adjust ment to the rule for setting 
the federal funds rate, result in a federal funds rate that is ½ percentage point below the 
baseline at the end of 2020. 
Heightened Risk of E U Breakup (SIGMA) 
As discussed in the Internationa l Economic Developments and Out look box 
“Political Uncertainty and the E conomic Outlook for the Euro Area,” increasing support 
for anti-EU parties poses signi ficant economic and political ri sks.  In our baseline, anti-
EU sentiment—notwithst anding probable flare-ups—remains suffici ently contained, and 
as a result financial conditions  remain stable and EU output ex pands at a moderate 
pace.  This scenario considers th e possibility that the Europea n elections bring anti-EU 
                                                 
4 To calibrate this scenario, we  assume an increase in the Gilch rist-Zakrajšek excess bond 
premium that is about half the increase seen in this indicator around the time of the Lehman Brothers 
collapse.  We then infer the eff ect of an increase in the exces s bond premium on FRB/US spending 
equation residuals—and on the model’s bond and equity risk prem ium residuals—through linear 
regressions.

 parties into power in one or m ore countries, amplifying investo r concerns about a 
breakup of the euro area.  In this scenario, these countries ul timately opt to remain in the 
EU and euro area, but Europe experiences pronounced financial s tresses, declines in 
confidence, and recession until fears of a euro-area breakup ev entually subside.  
Specifically, our scenario assume s that EU GDP falls about 4 pe rcent below the 
baseline by the end of 2018 as EU c orporate borrowing spreads w iden markedly—about 
100 basis points by the end of this year—and household and busi ness confidence 
declines.  The EU crisis has sizab le adverse spillovers to the United States:  Investment-
grade corporate bond spreads ri se about 50 basis points, flight -to-safety flows boost the 
trade-weighted dollar 10 percent above its baseline path, and t he term premium on long-
term U.S. Treasuries declines.  F inancial conditions also tight en markedly in economies 
outside the EU and United States.5 
Weaker foreign activity and the s tronger dollar cause U.S. real  net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline, while  lower confidence and weaker financial conditions in the 
United States depress domestic demand.  All told, U.S. real GDP  expands only 
1¼ percent per year, on aver age, in 2017 and in 2018, about ¾ p ercentage point less than 
in the baseline.  The U.S. unemployment rate is about ¾ percent age point higher than in 
the baseline in late 2018 and rem ains above the baseline throug h 2022.  Lower resource 
utilization and falling import pric es reduce U.S. core PCE infl ation to about 1¼ percent 
by 2018.  The federal funds rate foll ows a shallower path, reaching only 1½ percent at the 
end of 2018. 
Stronger Foreign Growth a nd Weaker Dollar (SIGMA) 
In our baseline forecast, we expect that the foreign economies will expand at a 
moderate pace and that underl ying inflation will edge up gradually to central bank 
targets.  However, some foreign i ndustrial production and trade indicators have come in 
somewhat stronger than expected in recent months, and the expan sion abroad may prove 
faster, especially if highly accommodative monetary policies in the AFEs boost aggregate 
demand more than assumed in the ba seline.  In this scenario, we  assume that foreign 
GDP growth rises to abo ut 3½ percent in 2017 and 2018, about 1 percentage point per 
year higher than under our baseli ne projection.  Increased optimism about the foreign 
                                                 
5 The increase in the European and  U.S. financial stresses featu red in the scenario is about half the 
tightening observed during the 2011–12 European debt crisis, ex cept for the 10 percent  appreciation of the 
dollar, which is somewhat larger.

 outlook, including the perception of  diminished tail risks, cau ses the broad real dollar to 
fall 8 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2018. 
U.S. real GDP expands 2½ percent in 2017 and 2018, nearly ½ percentage point 
more than in the baseline, as the weaker dollar and stronger fo reign growth boost U.S. 
real net exports.  The unemployme nt rate falls to 3¾ percent by  the end of 2019.  Higher 
import prices and heightened resou rce pressures cause core PCE inflation to move to 
2¼ percent in 2018 and 2019.  The federal funds rate rises by more than in the baseline, 
increasing to 4 percen t by the end of 2019.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 1998 through 2014 were used.  Thi s shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the dist ribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range  to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section , we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds 
rate and compare the associated policy paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those in 
the Tealbook baseline.  The prescriptions of simple rules and optimal control exercises 
are little changed from the January  Tealbook, reflecting small and offsetting effects of an 
upward revision to near- term inflation and a delayed start in the assumed fiscal expansion 
from the third quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018.  Most simple rules and optimal 
control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than assumed in the staff forecast.  In a special exhibit, we examine optimal control policy prescriptions when the underlying baseline  projection is consistent with  the median responses to the 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) rather than the staff forecast . 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near- term prescriptions fo r the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first- difference rule.
1  These prescriptions 
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and middle panels also include the staff’s baseline assumption for the path of the federal funds rate. 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor -type policy rules in the second quarter of 2017 
are slightly above their counterparts in the January Tealbook, reflecting an 
upward revision to the staff’s projection of core PCE inflation in 2017.  The ir 
prescriptions in the following quarter are little changed  from the January 
Tealbook, reflecting offsetting effects of the upward revision to near- term 
inflation and of the downward revision in the output gap. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not feature an  interest  
rate smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the near term than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule  and the Tealbook baseline. 
                                                 
1 We provide details on each of these four simple rules  in the appendix to this section.

  • The near -term prescriptions of the first- difference rule are little changed from 
the January Tealbook. 
A MEDIUM -TERM  EQUILIBRIUM  REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATE   
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model, given 
the staff’s baseline projection.  This Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  corresponds to the 
level of the real  federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period, would 
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• The current -quarter estimate of Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  is 
0.1 percentage point lower  than in  the January  Tealbo ok, reflecting a small 
downward revisi on to the output gap. 
• At 1. 42 percent, Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  is more than 1 percentage 
point above the average projected real federal funds rate in the staff forecast for the same 12 -quarter period and 42 basis  points above the staff’s estimate 
of the real federal funds rate in the long run. 
• The average projected  real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is 
below Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  because the policy reaction function 
assumed by the staff encom passes several policy considerations in addition to 
closing the output gap, such as  ensuring that inflation stays near the 
Committee’s 2  percent objective.  
SIMPLE  POLICY RULES  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model under the 
Taylor  (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and the first- difference rule.2  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the 
output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows the paths implied by the 
                                                 
2 Unless otherwise noted, the policy  rules assume that policymakers are committed to following 
the prescriptions of each rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage 
setters believe that policymakers will follow through with this commitment and  understand its 
macroeconomic implications.

  different policy rules.3  The policy paths prescribed by each rule are little changed from  
the January  Tealbook, reflecting offsetting effects of the upward revision to near- term 
inflation and of the downward revision in the output gap. 
• The policy path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the 
intercept.  The federal funds rate increases, on average, about 95 basis points per year through the firs t quarter of 2020, when it reaches 3.5 percent.  The 
pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 
around 4 percent in 2021 before eventually returning to its longer-run level of 3 percent.  
• The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a constant intercept prescribes a slightly 
higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than the version with a judgmental intercept adjustment used to construct the Tealbook baseline.  The difference in policy rates arising from this alternative intercept 
assumption is small and dissipates too rapidly to have marked effects on the 
real longer -term interest rates that influence economic activity in the FRB/US 
model.  Thus, macroeconomic outcomes under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are si milar to those in the Tealbook baseline. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp 
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years .  This 
initially more rapid tightening of policy is followed by a period extending well 
beyond 2022 during which the federal funds rate is lower  than in the Tealbook 
projection.  As a result, the paths for the real 10- year T reasury yield  under 
these two rules are , on net, not far from that under the Tealbook baseline, and , 
therefore, the differences in the paths for unemployment and inflation are relatively small in relation to the initially large differences in the path of the federal funds rate.
4 
                                                 
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.  
4 The Taylor  (1993) rule calls for slightly lower policy rates than the Taylor  (1999) rule over the 
period shown because it does not respond as strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level 
over the next several years.  As a consequence, the Taylor (1993) rule generates a lower trajectory fo r the 
unemployment rate and a slightly higher trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor  (1999) rule.

  • The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate through  2019 than the Tealbook baseline.  Thereafter, the federal funds 
rate eventually drifts down to near its longer-run level of 3 percent.  By 
contrast, the federal fu nds rate in the Tealbook baseline continues to rise for a 
while after 2019.  This divergence occurs because the first- difference rule, 
which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the projected narrowing of the output gap late in the decade and beyond.  The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2019, in 
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflation in the future, 
implies lower longer -term real rates over the entire projection period relative 
to the Tealbook baseline as well as higher levels of resource utilization and of 
inflation.  Thus, the first- difference rule generates outcomes for the 
unemployment rate that are markedly below the unemployment rate paths generated under the baseline policy rule and further below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy choices in a way that improves current  and future economic outcomes.
6  As was the case 
for the simple rules, t he federal funds rate paths prescribed  by optimal control under each 
of the four loss functions are little changed  from  the January Tealbook. 
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on changes in the federal funds rate.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook 
                                                 
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these sp ecifications; the appendix provides technical 
details on the optimal control simulations.  
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic 
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ actions; however, the simulations are not 
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

  baseline policy path.  This higher path arises because, in the current baseline 
projection, the unemployment rate falls well belo w the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that the “equal weights” 
loss function judges to be costly.  A tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate  of the 
natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of 
inflation to lower levels of resource utilization  in the FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is identical to the specification with equal weights  when the unemployment rate 
is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is considerably below both the path for the case of equal weights and the Tealbook baseline path.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymake rs 
choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this outcome.  The tighter labor market causes inflation to reach 2  percent more 
quickly than in the case of equal weights; inflation then edges  above the 
Committee’s longer -run objective for the next decade.
7 
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function 
that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times 
larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise identical.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in the “equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with undershooting the inflation objective in coming years are larger.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff 
                                                 
7 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under  “asymmet ric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to reoptimize the path of the federal funds rate 
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter monetary p olicy.  Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, policy rates and 
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook baseline and optimal control under 
commitment.   For the other three  specifications of the loss functi on, the simulation results under 
commitment and discretion are not much different from each other .

  because inflation responds little to resource utilization.  He nce, policymakers 
would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of 
unemployment, which this specification of the loss function sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount. 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but 
is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the specification 
with equal weights in 2017 in an effort to contain the projected undershooting 
of the natural rate of unemployment, and remains around 5 percent over the remainder of the period shown.  The paths for the real federal  funds rate and 
the real 10 -year Treasury yield are also noticeably higher for a couple of years 
than in the case of equal weights.  While this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation almost unaffected, it keeps the unemployment rate close to the staff’ s 
estimate of the natural rate.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL USING A PROJECTION CONSISTENT WITH  THE SEP 
In the optimal control simulations presented so far, the optimal path of the federal 
funds rate is substantially above the Tealbook baseline policy path except when the 
assumed  loss function does not place any weight on undershooting the natural rate of 
unemployment.  Here, we illustrate how these results depend on the assumed baseline outlook.  To this end, we discuss the policy prescriptions of optimal control under the 
loss function with equal weights when applied to a baseline projection that is consistent 
with the median responses in the December 2016 SEP rather than the current Tealbook 
projection.  As before , the simulations are carried out using the FRB/US model, so that 
the marginal  effects of changes in the federal funds rate are nearly identical under th e 
SEP-consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline.

• The SEP -consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline differ in several ways . 
                                                 
8 To construct an SEP -consistent baseline for the FRB/US model, the staff interpolated annual 
SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyo nd 2019 (the last year reported in the 
December 2016 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth and monotonic way.  
The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP; for example, the 
staff as sumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of the unemployment 
rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer- run value.

Optimal Control Using a Projection Consistent with the SEP
     Note: The SEP−consistent projection is constructed to match the median responses to the December 2016 Summary of
Economic Projections; for details, see footnote 8 in the main text. It is assumed that the natural rate of unemployment is
given by the median longer−run unemployment rate projection of 4.8 percent. In the Tealbook baseline, the natural rate of
unemployment is 5 percent. All simulations are performed in the FRB/US model.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

  o In the SEP -consistent baseline , the projected path for the unemployment 
rate is higher than in the March Tealbook.  Moreover, the natural rate of 
unemployment is assumed  to be 4.8 percent, in line with the median 
longer-run SEP projection.  By contrast, the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate of unemployment is 5 percent.  As a result,  the 
unemployment gap, shown in the upper- right panel,  is considerably less 
negative over the entire projection period in the SEP-consistent baseline 
than in the Tealbook baseline.9 
o At the same time, the path for the federal funds rate is lower in the SEP -
consistent baseline than in the Tealbook baseline.  In the model, this 
lower policy path implies  that the less -negative unemployment gap is 
not a result of tighter policy , but of a lower neutral  rate of interest 
implicit in the SEP median projection  than in the staff projection.10 
o The path for the rate of inflation in the SEP-consistent baseline is higher 
and stays closer to the Committee’s 2 percent goal than in the Tealbook 
baseline.  SEP median i nflation reaches 2 percent in 2018, and the 
inflation gap remains minimal thereafter.   
• The lines labeled “Equal weights ( SEP-consistent )” report optimal control 
simulation results under the loss function with equal weights and  using the 
SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection.  T he prescribed  path for 
the federal funds rate is higher than the SEP -consistent baseline policy path by 
0.4 percentage point, on average, through 2022.11  This higher path arises 
because, in the SEP median projection, the unemployment rate falls below its 
longer-run value over the next several years, an outcome that is judged to be 
costly in the model under the equal weights loss function. 
                                                 
9 Because of the lower assumed natural rate of unemployment in the SEP baseline, the 
unemployment gap is higher than in the Tealbook baseline both going forward and in the recent past.  
10 The neutral rate of interest is the interest rate that is consistent with output growing at its 
potential pace, provided that output is initially at its potential level.  
11 This difference does not imply that the median SEP path is necessarily  suboptimal.  In providing 
their projections, respondents to the SEP may factor in elements that are not captured by the simple loss 
function that we assume.  Moreover, the assumptions about the economic relationships in the model, as well as the projections beyond the variables and periods contained in the SEP release, need not coincide 
with the projection and perceived economic tradeoffs of SEP respondents.  Indeed, the median SEP li kely 
does not correspond to the projection of any particular respondent  or of the Committee.

  • That said , the deviation of the optimal control path of the federal funds rate 
from the  policy path in the SEP -consistent baseline is considerably smaller 
than the corresponding deviation under the Tealbook baseline ; in the latter 
case, the difference averages 1.3 percentage points through 2022.  The fact 
that both the inflation gap and the unemployment gap are small in the SEP -
consistent baseline implies that the baseline policy path is already close to optimal for the equal weights loss function, which is not the case under the Tealbook baseline. 
• The optimal control path for the nominal fed eral funds rate through 2022 is 
1.5 percentage points lower , on average, under the SEP-consistent baseline 
than under the Tealbook baseline.  As the marginal effects of monetary policy 
are similar  across both baselines, t his difference is a direct reflecti on of the 
lower neutral real rate of interest implicit in the SEP . 
• Under the SEP- consistent  baseline, the optimal control path of the 
unemployment gap through 2022 is  0.1 percentage point higher, on average, 
than its  baseline path .  Under the Tealbook baseline, this difference is 
substantially larger , averaging 0.5 percentage point over the projection period, 
because policymakers under optimal control must trade  off the larger 
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment with their desire to return inflation back to 2 percent. 
• The optimal control path for inflation under the SEP- consistent baseline is 
closer to 2 percent than the optimal control path under the Tealbook baseline.  Whereas the optimal control and the baseline inflation paths are similar un der 
the SEP -consistent baseline, the optimal control inflation path under the 
Tealbook baseline is appreciably lower than the baseline projection because policymakers aim to contain the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic implications  of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strateg ies are described as 
commitment  strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  An d 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together, possibly along with ot hers, as a means to assess the various tradeoffs 
policymakers may face when pursuing their mandated objectives.  
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported 
in the Monetary Policy Strategies  section .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t . 
The right-hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate 
for the current period (ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead annual change in the 
output gap ( ∆4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted πLR, 
is 2 percent.

  Simple Rules  
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board 
staff.1  The intercep ts of these rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen so that they are 
consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a longer- run real federal funds rate 
of 1 percent, a value used in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
Near -term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the 
Tealbook projec tions for inflation and the output gap.  When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters .  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quart ers.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand- side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the se cond quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal 
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL  FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The “Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US r* ” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter 
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the out put gap equal to zero in the final quarter 
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large- scale econometric model 
of the U.S. economy.3  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others ( 2012).  
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first imple mented on a fully compounded, 365- day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.

  which take the form of pr ojected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  It is generated after 
the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they match those in 
the extended Tealbook forecast.  A model simulation then determines the value of the rea l federal 
funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the staff’s 
extended baseline forecast.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* .  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US  r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes 
even wh en their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US  r* 
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12- quarter period to close 
the output gap at the end of this time frame , whereas in the Tealb ook baseline, the real federal 
funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB /US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption tha t market participants as well as 
price and wage setters have perfect foresight and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large- scale asset 
purchase programs.  When the Tealbo ok is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations 
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin 
in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation , 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps  (𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, 
measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural 
rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policy makers discount the future using a quarterly discount 
factor 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

  Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specifi cation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rat e.  
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
4  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect foresight and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is as sumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a 
horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon fu rther would not 
affect the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits. 
  
                                                 
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes  in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.  Loss Functions

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
