Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that we have re ceived since the March Tealbook suggests that 
resource utilization has continue d to tighten.  I n particular, the labor market news, which 
includes the two most recent employment reports, was strong.  T he unemployment rate 
moved down to 4.5 percent in March even as the labor force part icipation rate (LFPR) 
moved a little further above its  estimated trend, and the avera ge pace of payroll growth in 
the first quarter remained so lid.  As a result, we now see the labor market as running a 
little tighter than we ha d earlier anticipated.1  Although the incoming spending data for 
the first quarter have been disappointing, on balance, our assessment is that the weakness 
will be temporary.  We now estimate that real GDP growth slowed  to an annual rate of 
only 1 percent in the first quart er, but we expect it to bounce  back to a pace of around 
2½ percent this quarter, leaving t he average over the first hal f unrevised from the March 
projection.   
  Beyond the near term, real GDP growth is marginally stronger in this projection, 
mostly reflecting a somewhat lower path for the dollar.  We exp ect growth to average a 
bit above 2 percent this year  and next, supported in part by the fiscal expansion that we 
expect will begin in 2018.  We proj ect growth to slow a bit in 2019, partly reflecting the 
ongoing gradual normalization of monetary policy assumed in our forecast.  With real 
GDP growth expected to outpace our estimate of potential output  growth, real economic 
activity further overshoots its su stainable level.  As a result , the unemployment rate is 
projected to fall to 4 percent by the end of 2019, nearly 1 per centage point below our 
estimate of the natural rate , which we have edged down to 4.9 p ercent. 
The March reading on the consumer price index (CPI) was conside rably lower 
than we had anticipat ed.  We now estimate that total PCE price inflation (measured on a 
12-month change basis) was 1.9 perc ent in March, and that core inflation was 
1.6 percent; both measures are 0.2 p ercentage point lower than we expected in our 
previous forecast.  However, beca use we see the March CPI as ha ving been somewhat 
anomalous, and in response to re cent higher-than-expected import prices, we nudged up 
our projection for core inflati on over the next few months, off setting a portion of the 
negative March surprise.  Our  inflation projection beyond this year is not materially 
                                                 
1 We judge the labor market to be tighter notwithstanding some s mall adjustments—discussed 
later—that we made to our supply-side assumptions this round.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth  is below the project ions from the Survey 
of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast  in 2017 an d 
lower than the Blue Chip in 2018 .  The staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is a 
bit below the Blue Chip  and SPF surveys  in 2017 and  below the Blue Chip in 2018.  T he 
staff’s CPI inflation projection is  below those of outside forecasters in 2017 and  is the 
same as them  in 2018.  Th e staff’s projections for both overall and core PCE price 
inflation  are below the SPF forecast s in 2017 and 2018 .

  different from what we showe d in the March Tealbook.  We contin ue to project that core 
PCE price inflation will move up to 2.0 percent in 2019, and th at headline inflation will 
be 1.9 percent.  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Fiscal Policy 
 We have retained our placeholder assumption that adjustments to  federal 
fiscal policy will increase the primary budget deficit (that is, the deficit 
excluding interest costs) by 1 per cent of GDP, and t hat this fi scal expansion 
will take the form of a cut in pe rsonal income taxes starting i n the first quarter 
of 2018.  There is considerable un certainty about the potential  size, timing, 
and composition of these fiscal  policy changes.  Indeed, given that progress 
toward coalescing around a speci fic set of policy changes has been slow, we 
view this uncertainty as even grea ter than it was at the time of the March 
Tealbook. 
 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government 
will increase the rate of real GDP growth about ¼ percentage point in 2017, ½ percentage point in 2018, and ¼ pe rcentage point in 2019, abo ut the same 
as in the March Tealbook.   
 In the near term, funding for all  discretionary federal governm ent programs 
runs out on April 28.  We assume that an agreement providing fu nding beyond 
that date will be reached w ith no major disruptions to government operations, 
and that the size and compositi on of spending will be little ch anged by the 
agreement.
2 
Monetary Policy  
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase about 1 percentage  point per year, 
on average, over the projecti on period and to average 3.5 perce nt in the fourth 
quarter of 2019—just a touch higher than in the March Tealbook.    
                                                 
2 We estimate that a one-week feder al government shutdown starti ng at the end of April would 
subtract around ¼ percentage poi nt (annual rate)  from real GDP growth in 2017:Q2 and add a comparable 
amount to growth in 2017:Q3.

   We continue to assume that the SOMA portfolio will remain at it s current 
level until the third quart er of 2017 and then begin to contrac t, as the proceeds 
from principal repayments on secu rities held in the portfolio are no longer 
reinvested. 
Other Interest Rates  
 Over the next few quarters, the 10 -year Treasury yield is a lit tle lower than in 
our March projection, as market r ates have come in below our pr evious 
projection.  The 10-year Treasur y yield is projected to rise to  3.9 percent by 
the end of 2019—modestly above its assumed longer-run value of 3.5 percent.   
 The path of 30-year fixed mortgag e rates is revised mostly in l ine with the 
revisions to the path for the 10- year Treasury yield.  However,  triple-B 
corporate bond spreads are curr ently about 20 basis points narr ower than we 
had projected in the March Tealbook, and our projection carries  forward part 
of this narrower spread into next year.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices  
 Equity prices have declined ar ound 1½ percent since the March T ealbook, 
whereas we had projected them t o remain about flat.  Neverthele ss, notable 
valuation pressures remain i mplicit in our projection, and our view is that 
those pressures will limit the scope for further stock price appreciation over 
the medium term.  As a result, e quity prices are projected to rise at an average 
annual rate of only about 1 percent through 2019, similar to th e projected rate 
of increase in the March Teal book.  (Implications of a decline in equity prices 
are explored in alternative scenarios included in the Risks and  Uncertainty 
section.)   
 Recent data on house prices have been slightly weaker than expe cted, and we 
have nudged down our forecast for house price appreciation this  year to 
around 5½ percent.  We estimate that  house prices are somewhat above their 
normal historical relationship w ith rents and therefore continu e to project that 
growth in home values will slow to around 4 percent in 2018 and  2019.

  Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Incoming data suggest a bit greater near-term momentum in the f oreign 
economies than we anticipated at the time of the March Tealbook .  We now 
estimate total real foreign GDP  growth in the first quarter of nearly 3 percent 
at an annual rate.  We see growth abroad moderating to 2½ perce nt by the 
third quarter, largely reflecti ng a deceleration of economic ac tivity in Canada, 
and we expect foreign growth to remain at this near-potential p ace through the 
medium term. 
 The broad nominal dollar has depr eciated about 1 ½ percent since the time of 
the March Tealbook.  Going forward, we expect the broad real do llar to 
appreciate at an annual rate of  about 1½ percent over the forecast period, as 
market expectations for the fed eral funds rate move up toward the staff 
forecast.  Reflecting recent dollar depreciation, our projectio n for the broad 
real dollar at the end of 2019 is 1 pe rcent lower than in the M arch Tealbook. 
Oil and Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil has fallen about $3 per barre l since the time 
of the March Tealbook to $53 per barrel.  Spot prices have been  volatile, 
falling about $5 between the March Tealbook and the March FOMC meeting 
before mounting a recovery that  persisted through the week endi ng April 14.  
Prices responded to both news about U.S. oil production and inv entories as 
well as changing market convicti on regarding OPEC’s commitment to cut 
production.  As in the March Tealb ook, we project that oil pric es will decline 
gradually over the p rojection period.   
 Prices for industrial metals ha ve fallen more than 5 percent si nce the March 
Tealbook, as short-term supply disr uptions in the production of  copper and 
nickel have been resolved.  Even with these declines, metals prices are still 
notably higher than they were las t October when they started ri sing on 
expectations for a pickup in global activity and slower growth in supply.  
Food and agricultural prices have  fallen 6 percent since the Ma rch Tealbook, 
mainly reflecting upward revisi ons to the supply outlook for several crops.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
The news on spending since the March Tealbook has been negative , on balance, 
with downward surprises for PCE a nd federal defense purchases o nly partially offset by 
upside surprises in residential investment, oil drilling activi ty, and exports.  We currently 
estimate that real GDP increas ed at an annual rate of only abou t 1 percent in the first 
quarter after increasing at a 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter; this deceleration mainly 
reflects a sharp slowdown in real PCE growth.  However, we see the soft PCE reading as 
mostly temporary, and we project that real GDP growth will pick  up to a 2½ percent pace 
in the current quarter.3 
 Real PCE growth appears to have  slowed to an an nual rate of onl y ½ percent 
in the first quarter.  As previously noted, we see much of this  slowing as 
transitory.  Spending on energy services was held down by unseasonably 
warm weather through February, and we expect it to pick up in t he second 
quarter, assuming temperatures return to seasonal norms.  Spending in some 
non-energy services categories, w hich is currently estimated to  have been soft 
in the first quarter after ris ing strongly in the fourth, is al so expected to 
rebound.  Similarly, sales of motor vehicles stepped down in the first quarter 
from a very high level in the f ourth, and we expect vehicle sal es to decline 
only a little further this quart er.  Finally, spending in the b road category 
covered by non-auto retail sales , which was especially weak in February, 
rebounded in March, albeit to a lower level than we had anticip ated.4  With 
ongoing gains in employment and income as well as still-upbeat levels of 
sentiment, PCE growth is expect ed to step back up to a rate of 3 percent in the 
second quarter, about the same pace as we forecast in the previ ous Tealbook.  
 Equipment and intangibles (E&I) investment is estimated to have  increased at 
an annual rate of 2¼ percent in t he first quarter, a little mor e than the 
1½ percent gain in the fourth qua rter of last year but less tha n we expected in 
the March Tealbook.  Several indicators of business spending remain upbeat; for example, new orders of nondefense capital goods have posted  net gains in 
recent months, and indexes of business sentiment and activity are still 
                                                 
3 The BEA’s first estimate of GDP growth for 2017:Q1 will be rel eased on Friday, April 28.  
4 We think some of the decline in  retail sales in February and t he rebound in March reflected the 
temporary hold on federal tax re funds with an earned income tax  credit or a child tax credit that was 
introduced this year.

  elevated.  However, in light of the persistent weakness in E&I spending 
through last year, we have somew hat downgraded our near-term E&I outlook 
in this projection and now have investment increasing at a more  modest 
2½ percent annual rate in the next couple of quarters.   
 Indicators of oil drilling activ ity jumped in the first quarter  and point to a 
much stronger level of investm ent in drilling and mining struct ures than we 
had been expecting.  In contra st, spending on other nonresident ial structures 
has edged down.  All told, spending on nonresidential structures is now 
projected to rise at an annual rate of 14¼ percent over the fir st half of this 
year, well above our previous forecast.  
 The recent data on housing activity have remained positive desp ite the rise in 
mortgage rates since last fall .  Starts for single-family homes edged up in the 
first quarter, and permits stren gthened.  Sales of existing hom es declined in 
February, but pending home sales, w hich tend to lead actual sal es by a month 
or two, increased notably.  Some of the recent strength in hous ing activity 
may reflect a pull-forward in res ponse to the warmer-than-usual  February 
weather, the anticipation of a f urther rise in interest rates, or both.  As a result, 
we continue to expect that a jum p in residential investment gro wth in the first 
quarter will give way to modest declines in the second and thir d quarters as 
higher mortgage rates start  to weigh more heavily on housing demand. 
 Export growth has been surprisingly strong in recent months; as  a result, net 
exports are estimated to have been a smaller drag on first-quar ter real GDP 
growth than we had been expecti ng.  Export growth is expected to slow in the 
current quarter but to remain at a pace above that in the March  Tealbook.  On 
average, net exports are project ed to subtract about ¼ percenta ge point from 
GDP growth in the first half  of 2017, about half of the drag in  the previous 
forecast.   
 Manufacturing production recorded a  moderate increase in the fi rst quarter as 
a whole despite declining in Marc h.  The first-quarter increase , together with 
continued strength in the new orders indexes from the national and regional manufacturing surveys, suggest s that factory output will increa se modestly in 
coming months.  We project that manufacturing production will i ncrease at an

  annual rate of 2 percent in the f irst half of this year—roughly  the same as in 
the March Tealbook—after treadi ng water, on net, during the pas t two years.  
Real GDP growth is projected  to be 2 percent in 2017, to pick u p to 2¼ percent in 
2018 as fiscal expansion kicks i n, and then to slo w to about 1¾  percent in 2019, in part 
reflecting the ongoing normaliza tion of monetary policy.  
 The medium-term GDP forecast is just a touch stronger than the March 
Tealbook.  The level of real GDP at the end of the second quarter is little 
revised and the key conditioning fac tors are slightly more positive, mostly 
reflecting the somewhat lower  projected path for the dollar. 
 Over the medium term, real GDP gr owth is expected to outpace po tential 
growth.  (We assume that potentia l GDP growth will rise gradual ly from 
1½ percent this year to 1¾ percent in 2019.)  We forecast real GDP to be 
about 1¾ percent above potential  at the end of 2019, a tenth mo re than in the 
March Tealbook.   
 The box “Tealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2016” reviews recent 
errors in the staff’s forecast for GDP, unemployment, and inflation. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
Taken together, the two employment reports since the March Teal book suggest 
that labor market conditions c ontinued to tighten through the first quarter and by 
somewhat more than we had previously expected.5  
 Key indicators from the househol d survey were stronger than we projected in 
the March Tealbook.  After edging d own (as expected) to 4.7 percent in 
February, the unemployment rate  fell to 4.5 percent in March, 0.2 percentage 
point lower than we anticipate d.  The LFPR unexpectedly increas ed to 
63.0 percent in February and remai ned at that level in March, 0.2 percentage 
point above our March Tealbook forecast. 
 We responded to the incoming data  by lowering our projection fo r the 
unemployment rate in the current quarter 0.2 percentage point, to 4.5 percent.

 Tealbook  Forecast  Errors:  An Update through 2016 
The staff’s  forecast errors for 2016 were relatively  small.  Real gross domestic 
product (GDP)  growth in 2016, although  still subject to sizable revisions,  is currently  
estimated  to be close to staff forecasts  from one and two years  ago.  As was the 
case in recent years, the unemployment  rate finished  2016 lower than the  staff’s 
prior‐ year forecast,  though it was in line with the staff forecast from April 2016.   
Tealbook  forecasts  of core personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE) price  inflation 
in 2016 were slightly too low.  Here  we discuss these recent forecast errors.  
In the left panel of figure 1, the gray bars show the currently  published  Q4/Q4 pe rcent 
changes in real GDP from  2013 to 2016, the blue squares show the forecasts  for GDP 
growth made in the April Tealbook  one year prior, and  the green triangles  show the 
forecast from the April Tealbook  in the contemporaneous  year.  The  whisker bands  
demarcate  70 percent forecast error bands, so  that unusually large forecast errors are  
represented  by cases where the top edge of a gray bar falls outside of  the whisker 
band.1  The red dots show the GDP growth estimates  for each year  from mid‐ April of 
the subsequent  year, along  with 70 percent bands computed  from past revisions  to 
those estimates.  Staff  forecast errors for real GDP growth in 2016 are small, well 
within the  70 percent whisker bands, although  the staff’s prior‐ year GDP projection  
was too high for the third  consecutive  year.  
The right panel shows the same information  for the  unemployment  rate.  The April  
2016 forecast was on the mark, a notable  improvement over projections  from earlier 
years.2  However,  the April  2015 Tealbook  forecast of the unemployment  rate in 
2016:Q4 was too high, continuing  a pattern of  one‐sided errors  in forecasts.  Unlike  
forecasts  from earlier in  the expansion,  when the  labor force participation  rate  was  
  
                                                 
1 The whisker bands for real activity  variables are calculated  using forecast errors since 1980; 
whisker bands around the inflation projections  are calculated  using forecast errors since 1998. 
2 The staff subsequently  raised its unemployment  rate forecast for 2016 in the next few 
Tealbooks,  making them  too high again.  However,  the resulting forecast errors (0.1 to 0.2 
percentage  point) are small by historical  standards.   Figure 1: Real Activity Forecast Errors

 persistently  lower than  the staff expected  (not shown), the labor force participation  
rate finished  2016 slightly higher than the staff anticipated  in 2015.  Accordingly,  staff 
prior‐ year forecasts  of the employment ‐to‐population  ratio (also  not shown) were 
somewhat  more accurate  in the few preceding  years than in 2016, as forecast errors in 
the unemployment  and labor force participation  rates were offsetting  in 2013 through 
2015 but not in 2016. 
The combination  of lower‐ than‐expected  GDP growth and a lower‐than ‐expected  
unemployment  rate over  the past few years  has prompted  the staff to make a series of 
adjustments  to its supply‐side assumptions.   Most notably, the staff has lowered its 
estimate of structural  productivity  growth on several  occasions  over this  period.   
Figure 2 shows the same information  for the Q4/Q4 percent  changes in total and core 
PCE prices.  The staff’s  prior‐year forecast  of 2016 total PCE price inflation was close to 
the currently  published  reading, whereas  the forecast made in April 2016  was too low.  
The difference  between the forecasts  made in April 2015  and April 2016  importantly  
reflects the staff’s oil price projections.   Oil prices  unexpectedly  fell early in 2016 and 
then rebounded  later that year.  The staff  projection  in April 2015  anticipated  neither 
the early‐2016 decline nor the later rebound  and proved more accurate  for oil price 
inflation than the staff projection  in April 2016, which had taken onboard  the early 2016 
decline but had forecast a smaller rebound.   
Staff forecasts for core  PCE price inflation in 2016 were a couple of  tenths of a 
percentage point too  low.  The misses were concentrated  in services prices and, in 
particular,  nonmarket  prices, which wound up higher than expected.  From  2013 to 
2015, the staff’s year‐ ahead core inflation forecasts  were slightly too high.  As it turns 
out, those  forecast errors can be explained  by core goods import prices that came in 
lower than  expected.   Conditioning  on the actual  path of import prices and other 
observable  factors, core  inflation from 2013 to 2015 was, as in 2016, slightly higher than 
the staff can  explain.  These positive  residuals  might reflect,  among other things, a 
higher inflation trend than the staff assumes  or a larger contribution  to core inflation 
from resource  utilization,  or they may simply be the result of idiosyncratic  shocks.

  In addition, we revised up our cur rent-quarter pr ojection of th e LFPR 
0.1 percentage point, to 62.8 percent. 
 Overall payroll employment gain s during the first quarter—an av erage of 
178,000 per month—were somewhat softer than we had anticipated,  though 
still well above the 90,000 to 120,000 r ange that we estimate t o be consistent 
with unchanged labor market sl ack.  In the second quarter, we e xpect payroll 
employment to rise at about the same pace as in the first quart er.  
o In the first quarter, private  payrolls increased 171,000 per mo nth, 
on average—about 30,000 less per m onth than expected in the 
March Tealbook.  The March gain was only 89,000, but we think 
that much of the swing from Fe bruary’s 221,000 increase was 
accounted for by weather-related influences.6  
o In contrast to private payrolls, total government employment ca me 
in somewhat above our expectati on.  This upside surprise, which  
was concentrated in federal emp loyment, suggests that the feder al 
hiring freeze was less bindi ng than we had expected.  We now 
assume that federal payrolls wil l be flat starting in May, rath er than 
falling 5,000 per month as we had previously projected. 
As we have discussed in previous  Tealbooks, we have been surpri sed during the 
past few years by the extent of t he improvement in labor market conditions given the 
pace of real GDP growth.  In respons e to those earlier surprises, on several occasions we 
reduced our estimate of potential GDP growth and made less-significant changes to the 
natural rate of unemployment.  This round, with productivity cl ose to our estimate of its 
trend, a further reduction in potential output growth did not s eem to be called for.  
Accordingly, we trimmed our estim ate of the natural rate and ra ised our estimate of the 
trend LFPR.7  Specifically, we have slightly s lowed the decline in the tren d LFPR from 
                                                 
6 Private payroll gains in Februa ry and March wer e affected by t he unusually warm weather in 
February, which boosted the increase in payrolls in that month and held it down in March.  Separately, we 
estimate that the major winter storm that hit the Northeast dur ing the March survey’s reference period held 
down private payroll gains in that month by about 20,000.   
7 Our decision to revise up the trend LFPR also reflected a reev aluation of the trend for young 
persons and some evidence that some workers previously reportin g themselves as disabl ed have returned to 
the workforce.

  2016 through 2019, which raised our es timate of its level 0.1 percentage point in the 
current quarter and 0.2 percenta ge point by the end of 2019.  I n addition, we now assume 
that the natural rate continued to edge down last year, reachin g 4.9 percent by the end of 
2016, rather than remaining flat at 5.0 percent as in our recen t projections.8   
Even with these adjustments, we see the labor market as running  a little tighter 
through the first half of the year than we anticipated in the M arch Tealbook. 
 Our current-quarter projection of  the unemploymen t rate (at 4.5  percent) is 
0.4 percentage point below its natu ral rate, a 0.1 percentage p oint wider gap 
than in the March projection, while our forecast for the LFPR (62.8 percent) 
exceeds its trend by 0.1 percentage point, about the same as in  the previous 
Tealbook.   
 We continue to view some of the ot her indicators of labor marke t slack as 
slightly elevated.  The share of  individuals working part time for economic 
reasons and the long-term unempl oyment rate, while having decli ned further 
during the first three months of  the year, remain above their a verage levels 
before the 2007–09 recession.   
As in the March Tealbook, the lab or market is projected to impr ove further over 
the medium term and is expected to be quite tight by the end of  2019. 
 Average monthly total payroll ga ins are expected to slow from 1 80,000 in 
2017 to 120,000 in 2019.   
 After decreasing about 1 percen tage point since early 2015, the 
unemployment rate is projected t o decline anothe r ½ percentage point over 
the medium term and to reach 4.0 percent at the end of 2019, 0. 1 percentage 
point below the previous projec tion.  The small revision at the  end of the 
forecast period reflects the lo wer assumed natural rate of unem ployment. 
 Both the LFPR and the employmen t-to-population ratio continue t o improve 
relative to their declining trends.   
                                                 
8 We prevented these adjustments from showing through to potenti al GDP by making a technical 
change pertaining to the ratio o f the trends in business-sector  hours and total-economy hours.

   We project that productivity will increase a little less than 1  percent per year 
over the forecast period, a b it slower than in 2016 (though sti ll up from its 
average over the preceding several years) and slightly below ou r estimate of 
its structural pace.9 
 The box “Immigration and Economic G rowth” discusses the contrib ution of 
immigration to population grow th and potential GDP. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION   
 Taken as a whole, the news b earing on consumer price inflation  was softer than 
we expected in the March Tealbook and resulted in a lower near- term inflation outlook.  
 The CPI declined 0.3 percent in March, and, strikingly, the cor e index 
declined 0.1 percent; the current vi ntage of the core CPI data shows only five 
other monthly declines since  1980.  Our translation of these data, along with 
the March PPI, suggests that core PCE prices also declined 0.1 percent in 
March following a surprisingly la rge increase in core prices in  January and a 
more modest increase in February.   
 We think much of the softness in t he March consumer price data reflects 
transitory or one-off factors.10  Based on that assessment and in light of the 
upward surprise in import prices (discussed later), we have marginally raised 
our projection for core inflati on over the next few months, the reby offsetting a 
portion of the negative March surprise.11  (In January, when the incoming 
inflation data were surprisingl y strong, we similarly tempered the implications 
of the news for our forecast.) 
                                                 
9 Productivity typically declines r elative to its structural lev el when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly reflecting workers with lower-than-average prod uctivity being drawn int o the workforce.   
10 For example, we view the relativ ely large declines in the CPI for lodging away from home 
(which fell 2.8 percent) and apparel (which fell 0.7 percent) a s transitory movements, and we expect some 
of these declines to be reversed in the coming months.  Separat ely, the CPI for wirel ess telephone services 
declined 7.0 percent in March (monthly rate), reducing the mont hly change in the core CPI by about 
0.15 percentage point; we view th at decline as un likely to repe at. 
11 Had we maintained our monthly assumptions for the remaining mo nths of the year (and thus 
ignored the stronger import pri ce information and not built in any bounceback from the downward surprise 
in the CPI in March), the news in  the March CPI report would ha ve lowered our 2017 core PCE inflation 
projection 0.2 percentage point instead of 0.1 percentage point .

   We now estimate that the 12-mont h change in core PCE prices mov ed down 
to 1.6 percent in March—0.2 percentage point lower than we had expected.  
Given the partial offset to the March surprise that we built in to our near-term 
projection, we expect this m easure to edge back up to 1.7 percent by June, 
0.1 percentage point below the pr evious Tealbook.  We expect th e 12-month 
change in total PCE prices to be a bit below 2 percent over thi s period.   
 The recent data on import prices have been stronger than we exp ected.  Core 
import prices are now estimate d to have risen at an annual rate of 1 percent in 
the first quarter, whereas in the March Tealbook we projected a  slight decline.  
Recent dollar weakness is expect ed to push core import price in flation up to 
an annual rate of 1¾ percent over the next two quarters, higher than the 
average over the previous five y ears.  Thereafter, import price  inflation is 
expected to slow to a ¾ percent  pace, consistent with moderate foreign 
inflation, a gradually appreciating dollar, and slowly declinin g commodity 
prices.   
 The incoming data on longer-run inflation expectations have mov ed lower 
since the March Tealbook.  Median e xpectations over the next 5 to 10 years 
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers edged down  to 
2.4 percent in March and remained at that level in the prelimin ary April 
reading.  The Federal Reserve Ba nk of New York’s Survey of Cons umer 
Expectations reported that the median inflation expectation 3 y ears ahead 
declined to 2.7 percent in Marc h after having increased since N ovember.  The 
TIPS-based measures for both 5-y ear and 5-to-10-year-forward in flation 
compensation, currently at 1.8 and 1.9 percent, respectively, h ave edged down 
from the 2 percent level seen at the time of the March Tealbook.  
Our core inflation projection f or 2017 is 0.1 percentage point lower than in the 
March Tealbook but is unrevised the reafter.  Over the three-yea r period from 2016 to 
2019, core inflation rises from  1.7 percent to 2.0 percent whil e total PCE price inflation is 
anticipated to move up from 1.4 percent to 1.9 percent.  The ¼ percentage point 
acceleration in core inflat ion between 2016 and 2019 mainly reflects the diminishing 
pass-through from ear lier declines in energy prices and core im port prices, along with the 
further tightening of resource  utilization.  In addition, we co ntinue to assume a small 
pickup (5 basis points in bot h 2018 and 2019) in the prevailing  level of inflation 
expectations relevant fo r wage and price setting.

 Immigration and Economic Growth  
Immigration has historically been an important source of population growth in 
the United States.  According to estimates by the Census Bureau, net 
imm igration flows (both legal and unauthorized) accounted for about one- third  
of the roughly 1 percent average annual population growth rate over the past 
50 years.  In the latest year for which data are available, 2015, n et immigration is 
estimated  to have b een about 1.15 million  persons .  Altogether, an estimated 
43 million foreign -born individuals resided in the U nited States  that year, of which 
about 11 million were unauthorized .1 
In the staff  project ion, potential output rises 1.7 percent per year over the next 
10 to 15 years .  As can be seen in the second bar from the right  in figure 1  (labeled 
2020s) , about  0.9 percentage point of this growth  is attributable to population 
growth  (the sum of the blue and cross -hatched  portions of the bar) , of which 
about half (the blue portion) is due to net immigration .2  Other sources of 
potential gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth ( shown by the red portion of the 
bar) include the combined contribution of the trends in the labor force participation rate, the average workweek, and labor productivity.  
In a standard “growth accounting” framework, such as the one used by the staff, a reduction in population growth reduces the growth rate of potential GDP by 
the same amount  (holding productivity growth  and other factors  constant) .  In 
this framework, a change in immigration policy that reduced  net immigration by  
500,000 persons per year would, all else being equal, reduce the growth rate of 
potential GDP between 0.1  and 0.2 percentage point .  If all unauthorized 
immigran ts—who constitute roughly 5 percent of the U.S. labor force—were 
removed or emigrated, this change would have a substantial effect on the level 
of potential GDP. 
Changes to immigration policy will have spillovers beyond the direct effect on the 
population , so the total effect may  be larger or smaller than this simple 
calculation would suggest.  For example, the immigrant population has , on 
average, a higher labor force participation rate than the native- born population; 
as a result, lower net immigration could reduce the trend participation rate a bit, 
all else being equal, implying a larger downward effect on potential GDP.  
Alternatively, a reduction in the number of immigrants  would effectively raise the 
                                                 
1 Estimates of the number  of unauthorized immigrants  are from the Pew Research Center 
and are obtained by subtracting an estimate of the number of legal immigrants (derived from 
administrative records) from an estimate of the overall foreign -born population (derived from 
national surveys such as the American Community Survey).  
2 The staff u ses the Census Bureau’s projections of population growth in its forecast of 
potential output.  The numbers in figure 1 refer to the working -age population —the relevant 
population for thinking about potential output.  Using the full population instead would  yield a 
similar decomposition.

 amount of capital available per worker, all else being equal, and might therefore 
boost  average productivity , offsetting to some extent the negative effect  on 
potential GDP from the lower population.  Taking into account general 
equilibrium effects would further complicate the analysis.  Of particular int erest 
might be  how changes in immigration policy affect capital investment , new firm 
creation, and the employment of non -immigrant workers . 
Finally, it is worth noting that a change in immigration policy would  likely have, at 
most , a small effect on the aggregate statistics used to measure slack in the 
economy.  While labor force participation rates and unemployment rates among  
the foreign -born  population differ somewhat from those of the native- born 
population, these differences are sufficiently small that a modest change in 
immigration would  not generate large differences in these aggregate statistics.

  Average hourly earnings and busin ess-sector compensation per hour (CPH) from 
the Productivity and Costs report have accelerated modestly ove r the past couple of years, 
while ECI growth has remained relatively flat.12  Broadly speaking, we are not puzzled 
by recent compensation trends; we think the anemic trend in pro ductivity growth plays an 
important role in exp laining these trends.   
 Average hourly earnings increa sed 2.7 percent ove r the 12 month s ending in 
March, ¼ percentage point faster than over the preceding 12 mon ths and 
¾ percentage point above the ra tes observed through 2014.  We a nticipate this 
12-month change will pick up to 2.9 percent over the next coupl e of months.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3 .4 percent 
in March, below its recent highs  but noticeably above the pace seen a few 
years ago.  
 Business-sector CPH is currentl y estimated to have increased 3¼  percent in 
2016—again, up from the rates that  were typical of a few years ago.  We 
expect CPH growth to edge up to 3½ percent by 2019 as the labor  market 
tightens further. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 In the longer run, we continue t o assume a growth rate of poten tial GDP of 
1.7 percent.  The natural rate of  unemployment has been revised  down from 
5.0 percent to 4.9 percent. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by the end of 2021. 
 With output above its potential a nd inflation slightly higher t han the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, t he nominal federal funds rate  is about 
1 percentage point above its long -run value of 3 percent in 202 1 and then 
moves back toward its lo ng-run value thereafter. 
                                                 
12 The ECI for March will be  published on April 28.

   Real GDP growth slows to 1½ pe rcent in 2020 and 1¼ percent in 2 021 as the 
federal funds rate is above its  neutral level.  The unemploymen t rate is 
4.1 percent in 2020 and rises gradually toward its assumed natu ral rate in 
subsequent years.  
 PCE price inflation moves up f rom 1.9 percent in 2019 and hover s slightly 
above the Committee’s long-run objective for a few years before  moving back 
to 2 percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
We estimate that total foreign growth edged up to nearly 3  percent in the first 
quarter instead of the step -down that we had envisaged in the March Tealbook.  Although 
this pickup is mostly driven by stronger- than-expected activity in Brazil, Canada, and 
China, PMIs and trade data from many other advanced and emerging market economies 
have also been  more  upbeat  than we had expected .  Moreover, surprisingly robust 
demand in China led its  first-quarter real GDP growth to exceed 7 percent .  That said, w e 
continue to expect foreign growth to moderate to 2½ percent by the third  quarter, largely 
reflecting a deceleration of activity in Canada to a more sustainable pace.   We expect 
foreign growth to remain at about 2½ percent —close to potential—through 2019 as a 
pickup in Latin America roughly offsets a slight moderation in growth elsewhere.  
Altogether, we have revised up our estimate for growth abroad in the first half 
about ¼ percentage point.  Our forecast is little changed after that.  A fter having 
consistently marked down our forecast for foreign growth in 2017 during the past two 
years, we are encouraged that our forecast is now up relative t o late last year . 
Headline inflation  in the advanced foreign economies ( AFEs ) jumped to an 
annual rate of 2½  percent in the first quarter from 1¾ percent in the fourth.  This jump 
largely reflected  pass -through from higher energy prices and currency depreciation to 
retail energy prices.  AFE inflation falls back to 1½ percent by midyear  as these effects 
wane before beginning to edge up toward authorities’ 2 percent inflation target.  In our 
baseline forecast, economic recovery and an improved inflation outlook should lead AFE  
central banks to begin the slow process of dial ing back their monetary stimulus later in 
the forecast period, with Canada moving first in early 2018.  But overall, monetary policy remains generally accommodative.  
Inflation in the emerging market economies ( EMEs ) stepped up to 3½ percent in 
the first quarter , as a steep increase in Mexican inflation more than offset a sharp drop in 
food prices in China.  The acceleration of prices in Mexico large ly reflect ed the effects of 
past currency depreciation and large  hikes in fuel prices.  As these pressures fade, an d 
given considerable policy tightening by the Bank of Mexico, we see Mexican inflation 
beginning to ease toward the 3 percent inf lation target later this year.

 The encouraging tone of the recent data—particularly sentiment and survey 
indicators—highlights upside risks to foreign economic activity .  A stronger pickup in 
activity abroad could lead to an aggressive removal of monetary stimulus .  We explore 
the consequences of such an outcome in the alternative scenario “ Stronger Foreign 
Growth and Tighter Po licy” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
That said, downside risks to the outlook remain.  Among the geopolitical risks we 
are monitoring —including North Korea, Syria, and Turkey—the upcoming elections in 
France, where two anti -EU candidates have been polling strongly, figure prominently.  
We continue to be concerned about the persistent  buildup of debt in China and the 
possibility of a financial crisis .  U.S. policy normalization could also generate financial 
strains in some EMEs if rising U.S. rates and an appreciating dollar increase  dollar debt 
burdens.  We consider an alternative scenario  along these lines , “EME Turbulence and 
Stronger Dollar ,” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Canada.  Following rapid  growth of 3¼ percent in the second half of 2016, recent 
indicators, such as the monthly GDP for January and the manufacturing PMI through 
March, suggest that real GDP gr ew a solid 3 percent last  quarter, ¾ percentage point  
more  than what we had in the March Tealbook.  Household demand was unusually 
strong as a result of  a temporary boost from the Canada Child Benefit program, and 
investment in the oil and gas sector resumed after a long period of steep declines .  We 
expect growth to average around 2 percent over the rest  of this year and edge down 
further to  its 1¾  percent rate of potential growth by mid -2018.  Growth will continue 
to be supported by accommodative monet ary and fiscal policies.  
• Euro Area .  Recent data suggest that first -quarter GDP growth was just below 
2 percent, the same pace as in the fourth quarter.  W e project that GDP growth will 
edge down to 1¾ percent this  quarter and remain there over the forecast period, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy.  The forecast for the remainder of 
2017 is a touch higher than in the March Tealbook, as strong s urvey  indicators 
suggest slightly greater momentum than previously anticipated.  With support for 
anti-EU candidates elevated in several  countries, including in France, where the two 
rounds of the presidentia l election will be held on April 23 and May 7, an escalation 
of fears about the future of the currency union remains a significant downside risk to the outlook.

 Inflation jumped to 3 percent in the first quarter  from 1.9 percent in the fourth, 
pushed up by higher energy and food prices.  With core inflation running around 
1 percent  and projected to creep up to only 1½ percent by 2018, we still expect  the 
European Central Bank ( ECB ) to remove accommodation very  gradually .  We see the 
ECB  beginning to taper its asset purchases  over the first half of 2018 and ceasing 
these purchases  by the middle of the year.  But w e now have the ECB raising  its 
deposit rate at the beginning rather than at the end of 2019.  As a result, we see the 
deposit rate, currently  negati ve 0.40 percent , touching zero  by the end of 2019.  This 
slightly less accommodative stance of monetary policy importantly reflects our response to more hawkish communications by some ECB policymakers that suggest less patience in removing stimulus  as infl ation rises .  
 
• United Kingdom.  We have real GDP growth  slowing to 2 percent in the first quarter 
from 2.7 percent in the fourth, in line with some recent weakening in industrial production, services output, and exports.  W ith softer  real income growth  squeezing 
consumer demand and with the prospect of reduced trade after Brexit  restraining  
investment, we see growth declin ing further to 1¾ percent by the end of 2017 and to 
1½ percent thereafter . 
 
Inflation jumped to 4 percent in the first quarter from 2 percent the quarter before, mainly as a result  of past sterling depreciation.  As the exchange rate stabilizes, this 
effect should dissipate, and inflation should move back t o the Bank of England’s 
(BOE ) 2 percent target by the end of 2019.  W e still think th at the projected  
slowdown in economic growth and sluggish real wage gains  will dissuade the BOE 
from raising its policy rate b efore the second half of 2018. 
 
• Japan.  Industrial production, manufacturing PMI, and consumer confidence readings 
show increased momentum in the Japanese economy , and we have revised up GDP 
growth slightly to 1¼ percent in the first half of this year, well above the estimated 
½ percent growth rate of potential GDP.  We continue to see GDP growth edging down to 1 percent in 2018 as the output gap closes before growth stalls in 2019 as a 
result of a planned consumption tax hike.  Economic growth should be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy.  We expect the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to continue aggressive asset purchases and to keep its deposit rate slightly negative 
throughout the forecast period.  I nflation is projected to rise from zero in the first 
quarter to 1¼ percent  by 2019 (excluding the effects of the consumption tax hike), but 
to remain well short of the BOJ’s 2 percent target .

 EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China.   Real G DP growth climbed to 7.1 percent in the first  quarter, ½ percentage 
point above our March Tealbook estimate.  Growth was boosted by a pickup in 
manufacturing , partly due to  strength in export-oriented industries, consistent with 
upbeat export orders and strong imports of high-tech components.  R esidential re al 
estate and infrastructure investment also continued to support growth, even as 
property prices and sales have begun to cool in the wake of last year’s tighter 
macroprudential measures.  We took some signal from  China’s near -term strength 
and revised up growth in the second quarter ½ percentage point to 6½ percent.  We nonetheless still expect growth to slow as the authorities tighten the reins on credit and as potential growth falls, and to settle to  a more sustainable pace of  5¾ percent by 
late 2018.  H owever, w e remain concerned about t he possibility of a much sharper  
adjustment as financial vulnerabilities , especially corporate debt,  continue to mount.   
Headline consumer price inflation fell to negative 0.6 percent in the first quarter from 
2.6 percent in the fourth quarter, pulled down by a sharp fall in food prices, 
particularly vegetables .  After the influence of these temporary factors fades,  
consumer price inflation should sett le at about 2½ percent  by late 2017.   
• Other Emerging Asia.  Inco ming data suggest that real GDP growth in the region 
stepped up to 4 percent in the first quarter from 3½ percent in the fourth, 
¼ percentage point higher than projected in the previous Tealbook.  This step -up is 
largely the result of signs that the Indian economy is recovering  from  the disruptions 
suffered during the demoneti zatio n drive in late 2017.  But growth in several other 
countries in the region also picked up, supported by surprisingly robust export 
demand.  Strength in the region’s exports appears to be coming both from a pickup in 
demand for high-tech goods and stronger Chinese demand for commodities.  As Chinese growth slows, we see exports of the region losing some steam with growth in 
emerging Asia ex. China declining a bit to 3½ percent by th e end of 2017.   
• Mexico.   Data since the March Tealbook suggest that Mexican growth decelerated to 
just under 2 percent in the first quarter from 3 percent in the fourth.  We have revised 
up our first- quarter estimate ¾ percentage point , as the incoming data have not been 
as dire as we had feared at th e time of the March Tealbook.  Importantly, indicators 
for household demand held up, and export growth was solid in the first quarter.  We see Mexican growth gradually moving up to 2½ percen t by 2018, supported by the

 improved near-term outlook for U.S. manufacturing activity, reduced drag from fiscal 
consolidation, and a weaker peso, as well as by past reforms in the energy sector.  
Inflation surged to nearly 10 percent in the first quarter, fueled by peso depreciation and a hike in fuel prices.  We see the effects of these developments waning and inflation declining to  near the 3 percent inflation target by 2018.  To keep inflationary 
pressures at bay, the Bank of Mexico continued to tighten in late March, raising the policy rate 25 basis points to 6.5 percent, 350 basis points above its level at the start of its tightening phase in late 2015. 
• Brazil.   Brazil’s economy likely exited the deepest recession in its history in the first 
quarter , and we have penciled in first -quarter growth of 2½ percent.  Record soybean 
and corn harvests led exports to skyrocket, driving a surge in the monthly GDP proxy through February.  We expect the export strength to taper off later this year, with 
Brazil’s reco very then being increasingly underpinned by domestic demand.  
Consistent with this  view, consumer and business confidence readings continued to 
improve.  We nonetheless envision Brazil’s economic recovery to be slow and 
protracted, with activity restrained  by tight monetary policy, household deleveraging, 
and lingering investor doubts about whether the government can tackle the country’s fiscal and structural  problems.   
Amid double-digit unemployment and tight monetary policy, i nflation fell to 
4.6 percent  in March  on a 12-month basis, just above the government’s target.  This 
decline, coupled with still- weak economic activity, led the Brazilian central bank to 
slash its  policy rate 100 basis points in mid -April to 11.25 percent.

 Financial Market Developments 
Treasury yields declined and the dollar depreciated over the intermeeting period, 
apparently driven by investor exp ectations for a slower pace of  policy rate increases 
following FOMC communications aft er the March meeting, waning i nvestor optimism 
about the prospect of more expa nsive fiscal po licies, and adver se geopolitical 
developments.  Risky asset prices were little changed on net. 
 Based on a straight read of mark et quotes, investors continued to attach near-
zero probability to an increase in the target range for the fed eral funds rate at 
the May meeting, while the probabi lity of an increase at the Ju ne meeting was 
little changed at 54 percent.  Mar ket-based expectations of the  level of the 
federal funds rate for ear ly 2018 through the end of 2020 declined about 15 to 
45 basis points. 
 Results from private surveys s uggested that market participants  pulled 
forward their modal expectations for when the FOMC will start normalizing 
the size of its balance sheet.  T he effect of this change on asset prices 
appeared to be f airly limited.  
 Yields on nominal Treasury securi ties with maturities of 5 year s and 10 years 
declined 36 basis points.  For the  most part, these declines reflected lower real 
yields, but 5-year and 5-to-10-yea r-ahead inflation compensatio n also 
decreased—16 basis points and 10 basis points, respectively. 
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes were little changed, on net, wh ile bank equity 
indexes declined a fair bit.  N ear-term option-implied stock pr ice volatility 
increased to its highest level si nce the U.S. elections in Nove mber but 
remained near the middle of its  range over the past few years.  Corporate bond 
spreads were little changed on net. 
 In the AFEs, sovereign benchmark yields declined, while major e quity 
indexes were mixed.  EME equity prices gener ally rose. 
 The broad dollar index d eclined about 1¾ percent.

  U.S. overnight market interest r ates fully incorporated the FOM C’s March 
rate increase, and conditions in s hort-term funding markets remained stable.  
Quarter-end dynamics were, for the most part, typical of recent non-year-end 
quarter-ends.   
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Domestic Developments 
On net, FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were r eportedly 
interpreted as indicating a some what slower pace of policy rate  increases but an earlier 
date of potential changes to the  Committee’s reinvestment polic y than investors had 
expected.  Although the Committee’s decision to raise the targe t range for the federal 
funds rate at the March meeting w as widely anticipated, some of  the accompanying 
communications were interpreted as more accommodative than expe cted.  In particular, 
market participants highlighted the fact that the Committee’s m edian SEP projections for 
the federal funds rate for 2017 and 2018 were unchanged from De cember, while some 
investors had reportedly antic ipated an upward revision followi ng strong economic data 
releases and Federal Reserve communications in early March sign aling additional near-
term rate increases.   
Subsequently, investors reportedly took note of the mention in the March FOMC 
minutes that “most participan ts . . . judged that a change to t he Committee’s reinvestment 
policy would likely be appropriate l ater this year,” and some m arket participants 
appeared to have pulled forward their modal expectation for whe n the FOMC will either 
announce or start to implement a change to its reinvestment pol icy.  For example, in 
response to one recent survey conducted by the Wall Street Journal,  nearly 70 percent of 
the participants reported expecting the FOMC to begin normalizing its balance sheet in 2017, up from around 20 percent from the same survey last month .  Market participants 
also highlighted the statement i n the minutes that FOMC partici pants generally preferred 
to phase out or cease reinvestme nts of “both Treasury securitie s and agency MBS.”  
Overall, market reaction over the intermeeting period to news r elated to potential 
reinvestment policy changes a ppeared to be fairly limited. 
Based on a straight read of quotes  on federal funds futures con tracts, the 
probability of the next rate increase occurring at the June mee ting was little changed at 
54 percent.  The expected path of the federal funds rate further out through the end of 
2020, implied by a straight read from OIS quotes, rotated down by up to 47 basis points

 on net.  However, a staff model suggested that more negative te rm premiums accounted 
for about half of this decline.   
Yields on intermediate- and longer-maturity nominal Treasury se curities were 
about 36 basis points lower over the intermeeting period, with a more-accommodative-
than-expected interpretation of t he FOMC communications, the re duced outlook for 
domestic fiscal and re gulatory policy cha nges, and geopolitical  developments all placing 
downward pressure on yields.  In part icular, Treasury yields fe ll noticeably following the 
March FOMC meeting and on the news  of the canceled vote on the American Health 
Care Act (AHCA), with the latte r reportedly raising investor un certainty about the 
Administration’s ability to imp lement its broader economic poli cy agenda.  Geopolitical 
developments, including increas ed uncertainty about the outcome  of the French elections 
and tensions surrounding North Korea, reportedly also weighed o n yields later in the 
period.1  Meanwhile, Treasury yields e xhibited only limited reaction to  domestic 
economic data releases, which cam e in slightly weaker than inve stors expected on net.  
The staff’s term structure model attributed about one-third of the decline in the 10-year 
yield to a decrease in the avera ge expected future short rate a nd the remaining two-thirds 
to a lower term premium.  Both components remained above their levels prior to the 
November elections.  One-year-a head option-implied volatility o n 10-year swap rates—
an indicator of uncertainty about future Treasury yields—was li ttle changed over the 
intermeeting period.  In contrast , one-month-ahead option-impli ed volatility rose sharply, 
once the expiration of these  option contracts extended beyond t he date of the upcoming 
French elections.   
On net, 5-year TIPS-based infla tion compensation has declined 1 6 basis points 
since the March FOMC meeting, par tly reflecting t he lower-than- expected March CPI 
release, and is now lit tle changed relative to its level prior to the November elections.  
The 5-to-10-year forward measures of inflation compensation als o edged lower over the 
same period.  MBS yields fell in line with comparable-maturity Treasury yields.  
Broad U.S. equity price indexes have been little changed, on ne t, since the March 
FOMC meeting despite the drop in in terest rates, as investors r eportedly became less 
optimistic about the prospects of  tax and regulatory reforms.  Share prices of firms in the 
financial sector decreased a fai r bit, while those of firms in the utilities and real estate 
                                                 
1Treasury yields fell immediatel y following the U.S. missile strike on Syria but quickly 
rebounded.

 sectors, which tend to benefit more than some other sectors fro m lower interest rates, 
increased somewhat.  One-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 
index—the VIX—increased to its h ighest level since the U.S. ele ctions in November, 
likely reflecting concerns about i ncreased geopolitical risks, although it remained near the 
middle of its range over the past few years.  Over the intermee ting period, spreads of 
yields on investment- and specula tive-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed on net.  Private-sector 
analysts continued to project robust profit growth for S&P 500 firms over 2017 even as 
first-quarter earnings were es timated to be a bit lower relativ e to the fourth quarter on a 
seasonally adjusted basis. 
Equity prices of the six largest  bank holding companies (BHCs) declined around 
9 percent over the intermeeti ng period, partly r eversing their large post-election gains, 
amid mixed earnings reports and reduced investor expectations f or the Administration’s 
tax and regulatory reforms.  CDS sp reads for the top six BHCs t icked up a bit but still 
remained below their pre-election levels.  
Foreign Developments 
Since the March FOMC meeting, mo vements in foreign financial ma rkets have 
been driven by changes in invest ors’ perceptions about future U .S. fiscal policy, central 
bank communications in the Un ited States and abroad, and geopolitical risks.  
During the intermeeting period, 10-year sovereign yields declin ed across all of the 
advanced economies.  Dovish comm unication from ECB officials, a long with slightly 
lower-than-expected euro-area  inflation, pushed German 10-year yields down 20 basis 
points.  Concerns about the outcome of the French presidential elections contributed to a 
slight widening of French sovere ign spreads and led to a notable increase in the cost of 
insuring against a euro depreci ation relative to a euro appreciation.  In the United 
Kingdom, weaker-than-expected act ivity data contributed to a 16  basis point decline in 
10-year gilt yields .  On March 29, the U.K. government formally  invoked Article 50, 
beginning the process of negotiating the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.  This event was widely anticipated, a nd it resulted in little price action.  Later in the period, 
U.K. Prime Minister May called for  early parliamentary elections on June 8, seeking to 
gain a larger majority for the  Conservative Party ahead of the Brexit negotiations.  
Increased tensions in Syria and in the Korean peninsula reportedly also contributed to the 
decline in AFE yields later in the period.

 The broad dollar index declined 1¾ percent, with most of the decline occurring in 
the week following the March F OMC meeting.  The dollar also depreciated after the 
cancellation of the vote on the AHCA, which reportedly damped expectations for 
expansionary U.S. fiscal policy.  Among AFE currencies over the period, the dollar 
depreciated about 5 percent against the yen amid concerns about geopolitical 
developments and consistent wit h U.S. yields declining substant ially more than Japanese 
yields.  The dollar also depreciated 5¼ percent against sterlin g, with much of the decline 
occurring after the call for ear ly elections in the United King dom.  
Major equity indexes in the AFEs were mixed, and measures of im plied volatility 
rose sharply.  Share prices rose slightly in the euro area, sup ported by strong 
manufacturing PMI data.  In Jap an, the stronger yen weighed on equity prices.    
Investor sentiment toward the emerging market economies (EMEs) continued to 
be positive amid strong data on ac tivity and low rates in advan ced economies.  EME 
equity prices generally rose, f lows to EME mutual funds remaine d strong, and EME 
currencies appreciated against t he dollar.  Notab ly, the Mexican peso appreciated about 
4½ percent against the dollar and is now near its level prior t o the U.S. presidential 
election.  EME sovereign bond spread s were little changed over the period. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Overnight rates reflected a sm ooth transmission of the March in crease in the 
federal funds target range and remained stable over the interme eting period.  The 
effective federal funds rate  printed at 91 basi s points except for typical softness at 
quarter-end.  Overnight Eurodollar rates closely tracked the ef fective federal funds rate.   
The reduction in Treasury bill supply prior to the end of the debt limit suspension 
period on March 15 pushed overnight secured money market rates to the lower end of the 
target range and led to an i ncrease in ON RRP take-up.2  As net bill issuance picked up 
again beginning on March 16, overnight  secured spreads to the O N RRP rate widened 
slightly and ON RRP take-up declined.  
                                                 
2 Legislation passed in 2015 suspended the debt limit through Ma rch 15, 2017, at which point the 
debt limit of the United States was reset at the amount of debt  outstanding on that dat e.  On March 16, the 
Treasury Department began using extraordinary measures that wou ld likely keep the d ebt from breaching 
the limit through the fall.

 Quarter-end dynamics in overnight  money markets largely followed the pattern of 
recent non-year-end quarter-ends.  One exception was Eurodollar volumes, which 
displayed a more gradual and l ess pronounced decline ahead of q uarter-end instead of the 
usual sharp one-day drop.  At th e March quarter-end, ON RRP tak e-up increased 
$123 billion from the prior da y to $347 billion, in line with r ecent non-year-end quarter-
ends.  
Abroad, quarter-end dynamics in most foreign money markets were  generally 
orderly.  Very short-term FX swap  bases widened, but not as muc h as during recent 
quarter ends, and the bases quickly returned to levels closer t o recent norms.  There were 
modest take-ups of dollar aucti ons at the Bank of Japan and the  ECB.  
Conditions in other short-term f unding markets were also stable over the 
intermeeting period.  Reflecting the  March rate increase, net y ields on money market 
funds (MMFs) rose.  Total outstand ing levels of commercial pape r, certificates of 
deposit, and assets under management of MMFs remained about unc hanged.  
Following the large deposit outfl ows induced by the mid-October MMF reform, 
large time deposits and core depos its at foreign banks increased in the first quarter. 
Domestic banks experienced some large time deposit outflows in early 2017, while core 
deposit inflows remained stable.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Financing conditions for nonfinan cial businesses and households  have been 
roughly unchanged, on net, in recent months and have continued to be supportive of 
economic activity.  Nevertheless, the overall pace of financing  of large businesses picked 
up in the first quarter but remained modest compared with the v ery strong pace seen early 
last year.  Overall household debt  growth also continued to be modest. 
 Market-based lending to large nonf inancial firms remained solid , with 
particularly strong investmen t-grade bond issuance and a pickup  in bond 
issuance by lower-rated firms.  By contrast, bank loan growth s lowed 
noticeably, apparently driven by a  weakening in the demand for commercial 
and industrial (C&I) and commercia l real estate (CRE) loans.   
 Credit continued to be largely ava ilable for small businesses, although the 
demand for credit by these fir ms reportedly remained weak. 
 Financing conditions for households continued to be accommodati ve on 
balance.  Growth of consumer loans moderated but remained relat ively strong, 
while demand for residential real e state loans was little chang ed amid still-
tight lending conditions for house holds with lower credit score s or harder-to-
document incomes. 
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corpora te Debt and Equity  
Over the intermeeting period, fin ancing conditions for large no nfinancial firms 
stayed accommodative.  Gross issu ance of corporate bonds remain ed strong in March, 
reflecting robust issuance by investment-grade firms.  In addition, issuance by lower-
rated firms picked up, with a large share of the proceeds repor tedly earmarked for 
refinancing existing debt.  Gross equity issuance by large nonf inancial firms was also 
solid in March, reflecting a robust pace of seasoned offerings as well as a pickup in initial 
public offerings.  Share repurchas e and mergers and acquisition s (M&A) activity 
remained relatively solid ove rall, although announcements of ne w share repurchase 
programs and M&A activity in the first quarter were lower than a year ago.

  Net debt financing to nonfinancial  businesses increased in the first quarter but 
remained noticeably below the pace of early 2016.  Net debt financing was particularly 
weak during the second half of  2016, led by softer C&I loan gro wth and bond issuance 
net of retirements.  While bond issuance rebounded in the first quarter to its pace of early 
2016, C&I lending continued to be soft last quarter. 
According to the April Senior Lo an Officer Opinion Survey on Ba nk Lending 
Practices (SLOOS), both foreign an d domestic banks reported wea ker demand for C&I 
loans, on net, in the first quarter.1  Regarding their credit po licies on such loans, banks 
reportedly left standards for a pproving C&I loans unchanged; however, they have eased 
several loan terms, including loa n rate spreads and covenants f or large and middle-market 
firms, citing more aggressive competition from other banks or n onbank lenders as an 
important reason for doing so.  (N onbank lenders appear to have increased lending to 
medium-sized firms with limited access to corporate bond market s; see the box “Direct-
Lending Investment Funds:  The ‘Ne w Kid’ in Middle-Market Lendi ng.”)  Of note, the 
recent slowdown in C&I loan growth was attributed in part to lo an paydowns at large 
domestic and foreign banks, two t ypes of institutions that tend  to serve large firms with 
access to the institutional le veraged loan and corporate bond m arkets.  
Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans was quite stron g last quarter; 
however, with the majority of t hose loans reportedly being used  for refinancing purposes, 
net issuance continued to be f airly light.  Refinancing activit y was boosted by favorable 
financing conditions, as evidenced by continued strong inflows to leveraged loan mutual 
funds and tight spreads on newly iss ued loans.  These developme nts partly reflected 
institutional investors’ strong de mand for floating-rate loans given expectations of further 
increases in short-term interest rates. 
Commercial Real Estate  
Financing conditions for CRE w ere broadly unchanged on net.  Co mmercial 
mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)  spreads widened slightly since the March FOMC 
but remained near the lower end of  the range seen since the fin ancial crisis.  CMBS 
issuance picked up in March, repor tedly reflecting a return to a more-normal level after

 Direct -Lending  Investment Funds:   
The “New Kid”  in Middle -Market Lending  
A new class of nonbank lenders  to middle- market firms  has emerged since the financial crisis —the 
so-called direct -lending investment funds, or direct -lending funds .  Middle -market firms —medium -
sized firms with revenue roughly between $10 million and $ 1 billion —reportedly account for nearly 
one- third of U.S. private- sector GDP and employment .1  Ma ny middle -market firms do not have 
access to corporate bond markets and struggle to borrow from institutional leveraged loan 
investors such as loan mutual funds or issuers of collateralized loan obligations.  As a result, middle-
market businesses have historically relied mainly on commercial banks for credit.  Since the 
financial crisis, however, new direct -lending investment funds  have carved out a sizable and 
growing niche to meet the demand for credit from medium -sized firms.2   
Direct -lending funds are sponsored by private equity firms and alternative asset managers.3  The se 
funds  raise capital from institutional investors including foundations, endowments, pensions, high -
net-worth individuals, and sovereign wealth funds .  Investors commit capital for the life of each 
fund, which usually lasts close to 10 years.  Investors are compensated for the long lockup  periods 
with relatively high yields, a business model that is  particularly attract ive to institutional investors , 
which  tend  to reach for yield in a low interest rate environment.  These  nonbank  loans are 
attractive to many medium -sized firms  despite higher cost s because they would not otherwise 
receive enough  financing from traditional banks , particularly at longer maturities.   
Figure 1 shows an estimate of the total amount of capital deployed by direct -lending funds annually 
since 2008.  These  funds deployed $ 32 billion to medium -sized firms over the past four years —with 
individual deal sizes typically not exceeding $1 billion —of a total of at least $ 35 billion raised from 
investors over that time.4  As of the end of 2016, these funds are estimated to have had nearly 
$10 billion of uncalled capital ( or “dry powder”) available to be deployed  in future deals (f igure 2).           
The increasing presence of these nonbank lenders has coincided with publicly traded middle-
market firms’ growing appetite for credit.5  Of these firms, those without a long -term bond rating 
increased their long -term debt $ 78 billion over the past four years, as shown in f igure 3, a period 
during which direct -lending funds deployed over $30 billion , suggesting that this new class of 
nonbank lenders  has become  a nontrivial supplier of credit to the middle- market segment of the 
corporate sector.6  In a ddition, a growing fraction of these firms newly entered long -term debt 
                                                 
1 These statistics have been compiled by the National Center for the Middle Market , 
www.middlemarketcenter.org .  
2 Goldman Sachs noted in a March 29, 2013 SEC filing that it “believes [middle-market companies] have been 
underserved in recent years by banks and have difficulty accessing the public debt markets.”     
3 Examples of alternative asset managers include hedge funds, various debt strategy funds,  and real asset 
funds.   
4 KKR provided loans of close to $1 billion to Mills Fleet Farm Group for an acquisition when it otherwise could 
not acquire financing.   
5 In this analysis, m iddle -market firms are defined as nonfinancial firms with three-year rol ling average annual 
revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.  
6 Because loan holdings are not separated from bond holdings in the data, the analysis excludes firms with 
long -term bond ratings, which account for about 5  percent of these 2,000 firms,  to g et a more accurate 
measurement of loan holdings.

 markets in recent years.  According to figure 4 , close to 6 percent of these firms started to carry 
long -term debt  on their books  between 2011 and 2015; in sharp contrast, less than 1 percent of their 
non -middle -market counterparts started to carry long -term  debt during this period.7   
While the analysis is limited to public firms because of data availability , it has a broad application , as 
publicly traded firms  constitute  about half of nonfinancial domestic firms in terms of total assets.8  
In addition, the trend in credit demand is likely to hold for private  firms  as well:  D irect -lending 
funds are likely more important for private firms because such firms generally are sm aller, are more 
financially constrained, and have a narrower spectrum of credit sources . 
Taken together, recent developments indicate that direct -lending funds are becoming an 
important source of funding for middle- market firms, which appear to have increasing demand for 
credit.  These nonbank lenders, which typically extend longer- term loans than commercial banks, 
add to the pool of long -term liquidity for middle- market firms, helping them diversify their sources 
of credit and possibly become less dependen t on bank -intermediated credit.  
 
 
 
 
                                                 
7 Among unrated firms, middle -mar ket firms constitute about 7 0 percent of publicly traded firms.  
8 For instance, in 201 3, publicly traded firms held about $25 trillion in  assets, while the Financial Accounts  of the 
United States report nonfinancial domestic firms in aggregate held about $ 50 trillion .

  the adoption of the risk-retenti on rule in late December caused  some issuance to be 
shifted from January and Febru ary into the fourth quarter.  CRE  loan growth on banks’ 
books slowed in the first quarter  but continued to be robust ov erall.  Domestic 
respondents to the April SLOOS ge nerally reported tightening th eir lending standards and 
seeing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories during the first quarter.   
Small Businesses 
Overall, since the March Teal book, indicators point to credit m arket conditions 
for small businesses having impr oved somewhat.  Data from the m ost recent Wells 
Fargo/Gallup Small Business Inde x survey indicated that credit supply eased somewhat 
from already accommodative leve ls, although results from the Ap ril SLOOS suggested 
that demand for credit among small  businesses weakened over the  first quarter. 
The National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) index of  small business 
optimism, which rose sharply fo llowing the November elections, remained elevated at 
levels last observed in 2004, likel y reflecting expected change s in the regulatory and tax 
environment under the new Administration.  This optimism has no t translated into 
stronger loan demand from small bus inesses thus far; anecdotal evidence points to small 
business bank deposits that are n ear record-high levels, which might be suppressing 
demand for credit.  Indicators of recent small business loan pe rformance have remained 
strong, and credit quality concer ns are not expected to constra in the growth of small 
business credit going forward.   
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on 
balance, and gross issuance  of bonds by state and local governm ents was solid in March.  
Since the March FOMC meeting, yields on 20-year municipal bonds  moved down 
roughly in line with the decline i n comparable-maturity Treasur y securities, leaving their 
ratios over Treasury yields lit tle changed on net.  On balance,  the credit quality of state 
and local governments appeared t o improve further, as the number of ratings upgrades 
continued to outpace the number of downgrades in March.

  HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were li ttle changed over 
the intermeeting period, as cred it availabilit y continued to be  relatively tight for 
households with low credit scores  or harder-to-document incomes .  Mortgage rates 
declined in line with yields on longer-term Treasury securities  and mortgage-backed 
securities, but they remained e levated relative to the third qu arter of 2016.  Consistent 
with these developments, refinance originations have slowed con siderably since the third 
quarter.  In the April SLOOS, ba nks reported roughly unchanged standards on residential 
real estate loans on average; th at said, they reported a tightening of standards on non-QM 
(non-qualified mortgage) loans  and an easing of standards on GS E-eligible (government-
sponsored enterprise-eligible) and government loans.  Banks als o reported that demand 
for GSE-eligible and government loans weakened during the first  quarter.  In line with 
lower reported demand, residentia l real estate lending at banks  declined.   
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accomm odative over 
the past few months on balance .  Growth in consumer loan balanc es moderated a bit 
further from the relatively strong pace seen during the past fe w years, although year-over-
year growth in credit card balanc es, student loans, and auto lo ans stayed in the 6 to 7 
percent range through February.  C onsumer credit appeared to be broadly available, even 
as interest rates charged on cre dit card balances and new auto loans drifted up i n line with 
their benchmark shorter-term int erest rates.  In the April SLOOS, banks reported that 
they had tightened standards on c redit card and auto loans, on net, while noting that they 
had experienced little change in t he demand for consumer loans on the whole. 
New issuance of consumer asset-ba cked securities (ABS) picked u p over the first 
quarter and was quite strong in M arch.  Some lenders appeared t o have stepped up their 
issuance of credit card ABS, lik ely reflecting the tight intere st rate spreads on such 
securities.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
As in the March Tealbook, we see the uncertainty around our forecast of 
economic activity as being somewha t greater than it was before the recent U.S. elections 
but still in line with the avera ge over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the 
FOMC).  We based this judgment largely on a view that greater u ncertainty prevails 
about the future direction of  government policy.  Empirical indexes of uncertainty are 
mixed:  The Baker, Bloom, and D avis index of economic policy un certainty remains at a 
higher level than in the months before the elections, but optio ns-based indexes of 
expected stock market volatilit y (such as the VIX) and corporat e bond spreads remain at 
subdued levels.   
We continue to judge the risks t o our medium-term GDP projectio n as tilted to the 
downside, primarily because mone tary policy is likely better po sitioned to offset large 
positive shocks than substantial adverse ones.  (For more discu ssion of this downside 
risk, see the box “A Guidepost for Dropping Effective Lower Bou nd Risk from the 
Assessment of Risks.”)  Neverth eless, we see the downward skew as less pronounced 
than it was late last year, re flecting both that risks to the f oreign outlook have subsided 
somewhat and that consumer and business confidence in the Unite d States has moved up.  
We see the risks around our unemplo yment rate pro jection as aligned with those for GDP 
and, therefore, as skewed to the upside.  
With regard to inflation, we do not  think that the current leve l of uncertainty is 
unusually high.  We see importa nt risks to inflation on both th e downside and the upside, 
and we consider those risks t o be roughly balanced.  To the dow nside, some survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain at relati vely low levels.  In 
addition, U.S. monetary policy normalization co uld generate a g reater appreciation of the 
dollar than we have anticipated in the baseline forecast, as is  illustrated in one of the 
alternative scenarios.  To the upside, with the economy project ed to be operating above 
its long-run potential, inflation m ay increase more than the staff expects, consistent with 
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of e conomic slack on inflation, 
another possibility that is expl ored in one of the alternative scenarios.

 A Guidepost  for Dropping  Effective  Lower Bound Risk  
from the Assessment  of Risks 
The staff has, for some  time, judged that the risks to the  projection  for real activity are 
skewed to the downside  due to the effective  lower bound  (ELB) constraint  on the federal 
funds rate.  All else being equal, a higher expected  path for the federal  funds rate lowers  
the probability  that policymakers  will be constrained  by the ELB in the near future, which 
reduces downside  macroeconomic  risks.  With the federal funds rate having  risen to the 
range of ¾ to 1 percent and expected  to rise further going forward,  we will face a 
decision about when to drop  the ELB reference  from the Tealbook’s  assessment  of risks.  
In this discussion,  we describe  how one specific measure  of ELB risk has evolved since 
liftoff and is expected  to evolve  in the future.  We  then lay out one possible way to use 
this measure  to inform  our decision on when to drop  our reference  to the downside  
economic  risk stemming  from the ELB.  
 
Figure 1 shows a measure  of ELB risk—the probability  that the federal funds  rate will be  
at the ELB  for at least one quarter during the next three years—computed  from 20,000 
stochastic  simulations  of FRB/US around the Tealbook  baseline projection  using the non‐
inertial version of the Taylor rule.1  According  to figure 1, the  ELB risk measure  was above 
30 percent throughout  2016 but then  moved below 30 percent early this year.  The ELB  
risk measure  based on the April 2017  Tealbook  projection  is 26 percent.2 
 
  
                                                 
1 We use the non‐inertial Taylor rule to capture  the fact that policymakers  typically cut interest rates 
aggressively  in the face of a looming recession,  even though they often increase interest  rates gradually 
in the aftermath  of a recession.   In sticky‐ price models that account for the ELB,  this asymmetric  
behavior is consistent  with the prescription  of optimal commitment  policy and other well‐ performing  
rules, such as the price‐ level targeting  rule and the rule proposed  in David Reifschneider  and John C. 
Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary  Policy in a Low‐Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and 
Banking, vol. 32 (November),  pp. 936–66. 
2 In the stochastic  simulation,  many of the ELB episodes are short lived, with the federal funds  rate 
touching  the ELB in only one or two quarters.   According  to the April 2017 Tealbook  projection,  the 
probability  that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least four quarters (not necessarily 
consecutive)  during the next three years is about 10 percent.

 Note that  ELB risk fluctuated  during 2016 even though the actual federal funds  rate 
remained  constant  in the range of ¼ to ½ percent.   These movements  reflect the fact 
that the ELB risk measure  depends  not only on the current federal funds  rate, but also on 
the projected  path of the federal funds rate.  When the projected  path of the federal 
funds rate becomes  flatter (steeper),  ELB risk increases  (decreases).   For example,  when 
the staff reduced its estimate of  the long‐run equilibrium  value of the federal funds  
rate—the intercept  in the Taylor rule—in the June 2016 Tealbook  projection,  the 
projected  path of the federal funds rate flattened  appreciably.  As  a result, the  ELB risk 
increased,  from about 31 percent in Apri l 2016 to more than 34 percent in June 2016. 
 
Figure 2 shows the projected  path of the ELB risk according  to the current Tealbook  
forecast.  In this figure, the  ELB risk at an y given date shows  the model‐implied 
probability  that the federal funds rate will be  at the ELB  for at least  one quarter during 
the subsequent  three years if  the economy  has evolved according  to the current 
Tealbook  projection  up to that time.  Because  the federal funds rate  is expected  to rise, 
ELB risk is expected  to decline  further from its current level.  It declines even below its  
steady‐ state value  of 18 percent—show n by the dashed line—reflecting  the projected  
overshooting  of the federal funds rate above its  long‐run value  of 3 percent.3  Indeed, as  
a result of the forward ‐looking nature of the ELB risk measure,  the ELB risk is expected  to 
decline below its steady‐ state value in early 2018, when the  federal funds rate is still 
expected  to be substantially  below its long‐run value  of 3 percent.  
 We plan to consult this  ELB risk measure  to inform  our decision about when to drop  the 
ELB referenc e in our assessment  of risks in the Tealbook.   Our provisional  plan is to stop 
highlighting  the ELB risk sometime  after our measure  of ELB risk is below 25 percent.   The 
choice of 25 percent is somewhat  arbitra ry, and others may see a different  threshold  level 
as more appropriate.   As can be seen in figure 2, according  to the April Tealbook  
projection,  the ELB risk measure  is likely to dip below  25 percent for the first time in 
2017:Q3, when the  federal  funds rate is projected  to be a little above  1 percent.   The date 
when this  measure  moves below 25 percent will depend  on the actual evolution  of the 
economy  as well as the evolution  of the staff  projection.   If the federal funds  rate rises  
more slowly or the staff projection  of the funds  rate path becomes  flatter than 
anticipated  by the current Tealbook  projection—possibly  because the  staff further 
lowers its estimate of  the long‐run equilibrium  natural rate—the threshold  will be 
breached  later than 2017:Q3.  
                                                 
3 The steady‐state value of the ELB risk is the model‐implied probability  that the federal funds  rate 
will be at the ELB for at least one quarter  during the next three years, conditional  on the economy  being 
at its steady state today.  This concept is distinct from the unconditional  probability  that the federal 
funds  rate is at the ELB.  To compute  the steady‐state ELB risk shown in figure 2, we begin stochastic  
simulations  from a steady state consistent  with  that shown in the Long‐ Term Outlook exhibit of the April 
Tealbook  projection.

 Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveilla nce assessment, whic h judges the vulnerabilities in the U.S. 
financial system as moderate.  T he rise in asset prices in equity and commercial real 
estate markets since the previous QS assessment, coupled with a  further narrowing of 
corporate bond spreads, points to  notable and increasing valuat ion pressures.  But the 
stability implications of these va luation pressures are counter balanced by a number of 
factors.  First, the evidently hi gh appetite for risk suggested by stretched valuations has 
not as of yet led to increased bo rrowing in the nonfinancial se ctor, leaving vulnerabilities 
associated with leverage at a m oderate level.  Moreover, vulnerabilities from leverage in 
the financial system continue  to be low, owing, in part, to bank capital ratios that are high 
by historical standards.  Finall y, vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity 
transformation remain low.  Liquidi ty coverage ratios for all l arge domestic bank holding 
companies are above regulatory requirements.  Last year’s refor ms have, to date, reduced 
run risk in money market funds.  A djustments in short-term fund ing markets in response 
to these reforms are, however, still ongoing, and run risks have the potential to reemerge. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario explores the 
consequences of a stronger response of wages to labor market slack and a more 
pronounced reaction of long-run inf lation expectations to reali zed inflation.  The second 
scenario presents an economy in w hich the path of the interest rate and equity prices are 
both lower, leaving the equity pr emium wider and relieving valuation pressures 
somewhat.  The third scenario il lustrates the possible economic  consequences of a broad 
policy disappointment in which consumer, business, and investor expectations deteriorate markedly as the anticipated fiscal expansion and reduction in r egulatory burdens do not 
materialize.  In the fourth and f ifth scenarios, we assume a lower natural rate of 
unemployment, both without and wit h policymakers’ misperceptions about the level of 
the natural rate.  In the sixt h scenario, we consider the possi bility that U.S. monetary 
policy normalization leads to eme rging market turbulence and a much stronger 
appreciation of the dollar.  The l ast scenario analyzes the eff ects of stronger foreign 
economic growth in combination wit h a faster normalization of monetary policy in 
the AFEs.

 We simulate these scenarios using two staff models.1  In all but one scenario, the 
federal funds rate is governed by the same rule as in the basel ine.  The exception is the 
Broad Policy Disappointment scenario, in which we assume an alt ernative adjustment to 
the intercept in the baseline rule.  The size and composition o f the SOMA portfolio are 
assumed to follow the baseline pa ths in all of the scenarios. 
Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and Mo re Sensitive Long-Run Inflati on 
Expectations (simulated with FRB/US) 
Despite tight labor and product markets in the Tealbook baselin e, core PCE price 
inflation is projected to pic k up only slowly over the medium t erm, reaching 2 percent in 
2019.  This outlook is consistent w ith the relatively muted sen sitivity of inflation to 
economic slack that has characterized recent experience and wit h tightly anchored long-
run inflation expectations—features that are also present in th e FRB/US model.  A 
natural way to generate larger responses in inflation from the state of economic 
conditions in the FRB/US model is  to loosen these assumptions.  In this scenario, we 
postulate that wages (and therefo re, in FRB/US, prices) become more sensitive to labor 
market slack and long-run inflati on expectations become more se nsitive to realized 
inflation.2 
Under these circumstances, inf lation increases to 2½ percent by  2019 and is close 
to 3 percent by 2022.  To counteract higher inflation, the fede ral funds rate increases 
more rapidly than in the baseline, reaching 3¾ percent by the e nd of 2019 and 4¾ percent 
at the end of 2022, about ¾ percentage point higher than in the baseline projection.  As a 
consequence of slightly higher longer-term real interest rates,  real GDP growth is a bit 
slower and the trajectory for th e unemployment rate is ¼ percen tage point higher by the 
end of 2022. 
Lower Valuation P ressures (FRB/US) 
In the baseline forecast, equity prices edge up a little furthe r and the 10-year 
Treasury yield rises relativel y steeply, refl ecting both the on going increase in short rates

economy, and SIGMA, whi ch is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model. 
2 In the calibration of this scena rio, we assume that both the s lope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four tim es larger than in the 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the incr ease reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that cover s the late 1980s to the late 1990s.  
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this s cenario are well belo w those representing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

 and our assu mption that the term premium will trend up toward l evels more typical of the 
pre-crisis experience.  This pr ojection implies an equity premium that gradually declines 
to 2.35 percentage points, betwee n the 15th and 20th percentiles of its unconditional 
distribution over the past three decades—an indication of notable overvaluation in the 
equity market. 
In this scenario, we explore th e possible consequences of those  valuation 
pressures being relieved somewhat.  In particular, we assume th at the 10-year Treasury 
term premium increases 30 basis  points less than in the baselin e (and, hence, the 10-year 
Treasury yield does likewise).  Thi s lower trajectory for longer-term interest rates is more 
consistent with current market expectations.  Importantly, we a ssume that the lower term 
premium reflects weaker demand conditions; thus, the lower traj ectory for the Treasury 
yield does not provide any increme ntal support for economic activity.  We also assume a 
gradual decline of 5 percent in e quity prices rather than the s mall increase built into the 
staff forecast.  Under these alternative conditions, the equity  premium is 75 basis points 
higher than in the baseline  by the end of 2019, bringing market  valuations more in 
balance with the strength of t he economy projected in the basel ine.3  However, in the 
model simulation, the implicati ons of these financial changes f or real economic activity 
and inflation are slight, partly because the decline in equity prices is smooth and gradual 
(reaching 5 percent relative to the baseline only at the end of  2019) and partly because it 
has no repercussions for busine ss or household confidence or for the lending capacity of 
the financial system.      
Broad Policy Disap pointment (FRB/US) 
In this scenario, we assume tha t the federal government not onl y fails to 
implement the fiscal expansion assumed in the baseline, but als o is unable for the most 
part to enact other policies that  financial markets may have priced in, such as an easing of 
regulatory burdens.4  Moreover, this scenario assumes  that the staff has not fully 
appreciated the positive eff ects of more buoyant consumer and b usiness sentiment on 
spending in the baseline projec tion.  As a result, in addition to the restraint on aggregate 
                                                 
3 This upward adjustment in the e quity premium brings it near th e 25th percentile of its historical 
distribution.   
4 To be clear, we have not built into the baseline any increment  to growth stemming from regulatory 
relief.  In this scenario, we unwind the adjustments to the rule for setting the federal funds rate and to the 
long-term interest rate term premium that were made in the base line projection to account for the assumed 
fiscal expansion.

 demand because the fiscal expans ion does not materialize, econo mic activity is also 
curtailed by an erosion in consum er sentiment and an increase i n perceived risk by 
businesses and financial marke ts.  In particular, the triple-B corporate bond spread rises 
about 40 basis points above the baseline in 2018 and the stock market falls almost 
10 percent from peak to trough. 
As a result, real GDP decelerat es substantially, growing less than 1½ percent per 
year, on average, during 2018 and 2019, about ½ percentage poin t less than in the 
baseline.  The unemployment rate rises slightly from its curren t level rather than 
declining as in the baseline and hovers at around 4¾ percent fr om 2018 to 2022—close to 
its longer-term sustainable leve l.  With the labor market less tight and inflation lower, the 
federal funds rate rises more  gradually and is  about 1 percenta ge point below the baseline 
rate of 3½ percent at the end of 2019.5  
Lower Natural Rate of U nemployment (FRB/US) 
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate wi ll fall to 4 percent 
by the end of 2019, almost 1 percenta ge point below the staff’s baseline estimate of the 
natural rate of unemployment.  However, the natural rate is est imated with considerable 
uncertainty and could be lower than the staff’s estimate of 4.9  percent.  In this scenario, 
we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 4 perc ent for the past few 
years and remains at that level in the future. 
For purposes of illustration, thi s scenario unrealistically ass umes that 
policymakers and the staff are al ready fully aware of the lower  natural rate and have 
adjusted their estimate of the unemployment gap downward about 0.9 percentage point at 
the beginning of the simulation.  Under these conditions, the i nertial Taylor rule calls for 
a slightly more gradual rise in the federal funds rate, leaving  it a bit less than 
½ percentage point below the  baseline by the end of 2018.  (The deviation from the 
baseline would be larger wit h a non-inertial version of the pol icy rule.)  The 
unemployment rate falls faster than in the baselin e as a result  of both the lower natural 
                                                 
5 Without the change in sentiment, the failure to implement the fiscal expansion implies that real 
GDP growth is ¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline in 2018 and slightly lower in 2019, while the 
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher at the end of 20 19.  In addition, inflati on is a touch lower 
than in the baseline.  These developments, together with the ad justment to the rule for setting the federal 
funds rate, result in a federal f unds rate that is ½ percentage  point below the baseline at the end of 2020.

 rate and a more accommodative stance of policy, which generates  modestly stronger job 
creation and GDP growth.  Inflation remains close to the baseline.  
Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment with Mi sperception (FRB/US) 
This scenario is the same as the previous one but makes the mor e realistic 
assumption that policymakers and the staff learn gradually abou t the true state of the 
economy.  More specifically, policym akers and the staff initially perceive that the natural 
rate of unemployment is 4.9 percent and learn only slowly that the true natural rate is 
4 percent; the gap between the act ual and perceived natural rat e is assumed to be almost 
completely eliminated by the end of 2022. 
Because unemployment in the next f ew quarters is mistakenly jud ged to be below 
its natural rate (rather than stil l above it, as in the previou s scenario without 
misperception), and because outpu t is perceived to be correspon dingly above its 
potential, the path for the feder al funds rate is  higher than i n the previous scenario—by 
about ½ percentage point, on average, in 2019.  The tighter sta nce of policy reduces GDP 
growth ¼ percentage point by the end of 2018 compared with the scenario without 
misperception.  The trajectory of GDP growth is close to the ba seline.  The 
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point a bove the scenario with out misperception by 
the end of 2022.  The relatively mod est effect on real economic  activity in this scenario 
reflects in large part the rela tively low interest rate sensiti vity embedded in FRB/US; 
hence, simulations with other models could yield results that are less benign.  Inflation 
runs slightly below the baseline.  
EME Turbulence and Stro nger Dollar (SIGMA) 
The reaction of financial marke ts to the FOMC’s decisions to hike policy rates in 
December and March has thus far been quite benign and likely re flects that foreign 
growth prospects appear to be on a more solid footing.  However , many emerging market 
economies, including but not lim ited to China, have high levels  of corporate debt, 
sovereign debt, or both, and they remain vulnerable to higher i nterest rates and currency 
depreciation.  Accordingly, there  is a risk that ongoing U.S. m onetary policy 
normalization could lead to height ened financial pressures abro ad, triggering market 
volatility, reduced economic ac tivity, and flight-to-safety flo ws that further boost the 
dollar.  In this scenario, we assu me that EME corporate borrowi ng spreads rise 
substantially in the face of pers istent capital outflows from these economies and that the 
broad real dollar appreciates an additional 10 percent by the m iddle of 2018.  Despite

 weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central banks are assumed to tighten 
monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on inflation arisin g from the depreciation of 
their currencies.  All told, foreign GDP growth runs, on averag e, about ¾ percentage 
point below the baseline in 2017 and 2018. 
The stronger dollar and weaker  foreign growth depress U.S. real  net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP grow th moderates to 1½ percent in 2 018, nearly 
¾ percentage point less than in the baseline.  Lower import prices and weaker economic 
activity cause core PCE infla tion to be below 1½ percent throug h 2018.  The federal 
funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, risin g to 2½ percent by the end 
of 2019. 
Stronger Foreign Growth a nd Tighter Policy (SIGMA) 
In our baseline forecast, we expect policy normalization abroad —especially in the 
major AFEs—to occur very slowly as headwinds diminish only gradually and central banks remain attentive to downsid e risks to activity and inflat ion.  However, a stronger 
output expansion than in the base line could induce foreign central banks to downweight 
these risk-management considerations and embark on markedly fas ter policy tightening.  
In this scenario, we assume that foreign GDP growth runs at ove r 3 percent per year over 
2017 and 2018, about 1 percentage point  above the baseline, and  that the improved 
outlook prompts AFE central banks to tighten their policy rates  more aggressively than 
what is prescribed by the baseline policy rule.  The stronger f oreign growth, higher 
interest rates—including from s ome rise in term premiums—and re versal of earlier flight-
to-safety flows into U.S. assets  contribute to a 10 percent dep reciation of the broad real 
dollar.     
Despite the sharp tightening of  monetary policy abroad and some spillovers of 
that tightening into U.S. interes t rates, U.S. activity benefits as stronger foreign growth 
and the weaker dollar boost net exports.  U.S. real GDP expands, on average, 2½ percent 
in 2017 and 2018, about ¼ percentage poi nt more than in the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate falls to around 3½ percent by the end of 2019 .  Higher import prices 
and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to move persistently above 
2¼ percent in 2018 and 2019.  The federal funds rate rises more  quickly than in the 
baseline, increasing t o 4 percent by the end of 2019.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 1998 through 2014 were used.  Thi s shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the dist ribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range  to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section , we consider a selection  of strategies for setting  the federal funds 
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with 
those in the Tealbook baseline.  The prescriptions of simple rules are generally little 
different  from those in the March Tealbook because the baseline paths for  the output gap 
and inflation are little changed .  The optimal control policy rate paths  are somewhat 
higher than those in the March Tealbook.  This change reflects  the staff’s projection of a 
slightly larger undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment in coming years  with 
essentially no change in the staff’s  projection for inflation.1  Most simple rules and 
optimal control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than assumed in the staff forecast.  In a special exhibit, we examine policy prescriptions and macroeconomic outcomes under a number of policy rules in a setting in which wages , 
and thus prices, are more responsive to labor market tightness than in the FRB/US model. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also known as the “balanced  approach” rule) , an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and 
a first -difference rule.
2  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections 
for the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and middle panels also provide the path for the federal funds rate used in the staff  baseline.  
• The prescriptions of the Taylor-type policy rules in the second and third 
quarter s of 2017 are little changed since  the March Tealbook. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not feature an interest  
rate smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the 
near term than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline. 
                                                 
1 The staff revised down its estimate of the natural rate of unemployment 0.1  percentage point and 
its projection for the unemployment rate about 0.2  percentage point through the second quarter of 2018 and 
about 0.1 percentage point for several years thereafter.  As a result, in the Tealbook baseline, the 
unemployment rate undershoots its natural rate by a little more than in March.  
2 We provide details on each of these four simple rules  in the appendix to this section.

  • The near -term prescriptions of the first- difference rule are a little higher than 
in March, reflecting the staff’s projection of a somewhat faster rise in output 
relative to its potential level  later this year compared with  the projection in the 
previous Tealbook. 
A MEDIUM -TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE  
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model, given 
the staff’s baseline projection.  This Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r * corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period, would 
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• The current -quarter estimate of Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r * is 14 basis 
points higher than projected in the March Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revisions to the output gap, while the real federal funds rate path is little revised . 
• At 1. 76 percent, Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r * is more than 1 percentage 
point above the average projected real federal funds rate in the staff forecast for the same 12 -quarter period and 76 basis points above the staff’s estimate 
of the real federal funds rate in the longer  run. 
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is 
below the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r * because the policy reaction 
function assumed by the staff includes an interest  rate smoothing term, reacts 
to both the output gap and inflation deviations from 2 percent, and does not insist on closing the output gap over a particular time horizon.

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule

  output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows the paths implied by the 
different policy rules.4  The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are only slightly 
higher than in the March Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revision to the staff’s 
projection of the output gap.  
• The policy rate path in the staff forecast is constructed using a version of the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the 
intercept.  The federal funds rate increases, on average, about 1 percentage 
point per ye ar in 2017 and 2018 and reaches 3  percent  in 2019.  The pace of 
tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 4.1 percent in 2021 before moving toward its longer-run level of 3 percent.  
• The prescriptions of the inertial Taylor  (1999) r ule with a constant intercept 
imply a slightly higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years 
than the path associated with the Tealbook baseline, which incorporates a judgmental intercept adjustment.  The difference in policy rates arising from 
this alternative treatment of the intercept is small and dissipates too rapidly to 
have marked effects on the real longer -term interest rates that influence 
economic activity in the FRB/US model.  Thus, macroeconomic outcomes under the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule are similar to those in the Tealbook 
baseline.  
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp 
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie 
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years .  This 
initially more rapid tightening of policy is followed by a period extending well 
beyond 2022 during which the federal funds rate is lower  than in the Tealbook 
projection.  Under the maintained assumption that market participants have 
perfect foresight , the paths for the real 10- year T reasury yield  under these two 
rules are, on net, not far from that under the Tealbook baseline.  Economic activity in the FRB/US model is tightly linked to the real 10- year Treasury 
yield , and thus the differences in the paths for unemployment and inflation 
                                                 
market participants, price setters, and wage setters believe that policymakers will follow  through on this 
commitment and  understand its macroeconomic implications.  
4 Because of these endogenous responses, the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

  between the two rules are relatively small in relation to the initially large 
differences in the path s of the federal funds rate.5 
• The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower path for 
some years thereafter.  This divergence occurs because the first -diffe rence 
rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the projected narrowing of the output gap late in the decade and beyond.  The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2019, in 
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflation in the future, 
implies lower longer -term real rates over the entire projection period relative 
to the Tealbook baseline as well as higher levels of resource utilization and of 
inflation.  Thus, the first- differenc e rule generates outcomes for the 
unemployment rate that are markedly below the unemployment rate paths generated under the baseline policy rule, leading to inflation outcomes that are somewhat above the Tealbook baseline projection. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULA TIONS UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.6  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices in a way that improves current  and future economic outcomes.
7  
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
                                                 
5 The Taylor  (1993) rule calls for slightly lower policy rates than the Taylor  (1999) rule over the 
period shown because it does not respond as strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level 
over the next several years.  As a consequence, the Taylor (1993) rule generates a lower trajectory for the 
unemployment rate and a slightly higher trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor  (1999) rule. 
6 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 201 6 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix provides technical 
details on the optimal control simulations.  
7 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic 
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ actions; however, the simulations are not 
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

  unemployment, and on avoiding changes in the federal funds rate.  Under this 
strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the 
Tealbook baseline policy rate path.  This higher path arises because, in the current baseline project ion, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that policymakers with an “Equal weights” loss function judge to be costly.  A tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that is substantially 
closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is 
somewhat lower than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of inflation to lower levels of resour ce 
utilization  in the FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate 
is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate 
is considerably below both the path for the case of equal weights and the Tealbook bas eline path.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers 
choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this 
outcome.  Because private agents believe that policymakers will follow this 
policy rate path  if the economy evolves as projected, the tighter labor market 
brings inflation to 2  percent more quickly than in the case of equal weights; 
inflation then edges  above the Committee’s longer -run objective for the next 
decade.
8 
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five 
                                                 
8 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unem ployment over the medium term under  “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to reoptimize the path of the federal funds rate 
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future  would choose to pursue a tighter 
monetary policy.  Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, policy rates and 
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook baseline and optimal control under 
commitment.   For the o ther three  specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under 
commitment and discretion are not much different from each other .

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

  times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative 
than in the “E qual weights” case, even though the losses associated with 
undershooting the inflation objecti ve in coming years are larger.  The reason 
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds little to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the nat ural rate of 
unemployment, which this specification of the loss function sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount. 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but 
is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster than under the 
specification with equal weights in 2017 in an effort to contain the projected undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment and remains around 
5½ percent over the remain der of the period shown.  The paths for the real 
federal funds rate and the real 10 -year Treasury yield are also noticeably 
higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights.  While this 
policy leaves the trajectory for inflation almost unaffected, it keeps the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  
• Compared with the March Tealbook, the federal funds rate paths prescribed 
by optimal control under each of the four loss functions are one- to three-tenths of a percentage point higher in the final years of the period 
shown, r eflecting continued improvements in the labor mar ket and the 
mode stly higher inflation generated by the tighter labor market later in the 
decade.  In addition, the simulation “Minimal weight on rate adjustments” 
also features a rise in the federal funds rate that is about 70 basis points higher 
at the end of 2017 than in the previous Tealbook because policymakers in the model move aggressively in response to further declines in the unemployment 
rate relative to its natural rate.  
POLICY RULES PERFORMANCE UNDER A STEEPER  WAGE PHILLIPS CURVE  
In the FRB/US model, wages and prices are not very responsive to labor market 
conditions—a pattern  consistent with the behavior of wages and prices during the period

  of changing labor market slack over most of the past decade.  However, as the labor 
market  continues to tighten  and t he unemployment rate moves further below its natural 
rate, there is a risk that wages could rise by more  than the staff currently assumes, leading 
to higher consumer price inflation .  In the fourth exhibit, we illustrate how several  simple 
rules perform  under a scenario in which the slope of the wage Phillips curve is four times 
the assumed value in the FRB/US model.9  We consider both the inertial and non- inertial 
versions of the Taylor (1999) rule, along with a rule for the change in the federal funds rate (rather than its level).
10  The simulations are carried out using the FRB/US model 
and represent versions of an  alternative scenario that appears  in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section of this Tealbook.11 
• Under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, inflation outcomes are appreciably higher with the steeper wage Phillips curve than in the Tealbook baseline, 
which is constructed using a similar policy rule.  Inflation outcomes are higher 
because the  undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment produces , all 
else being  equal,  a larger inflation response than in the Tealbook baseline.  
This higher rate of inflation leads to a higher path for the federal funds rate 
                                                 
9 Four times the size of the slope of the wage Phillips curve in the FRB/US model falls within the 
range of estimates for a period that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s  but is below estimates derived 
using data from the 1970s.  
10 This “change rule” is  specified so that 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡−𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1= 1.2 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−2)+ 2(4.9−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡), where 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 is the 
federal funds rate,  𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 is four -quarter core PCE price inflation, and 𝑈𝑈 𝑡𝑡 is the unemployment rate.  For an 
analysis of a similar rule, see John B. Taylor (1999), “The Robustness and E fficiency of Monetary Policy 
Rules as Guidelines for Interest Rate Setting by the European Central Bank,” Journal of Monetary 
Economics , vol. 43 (June), pp. 655– 79.  For a recent application, see Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The 
Economic Outlook and the Conduc t of Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Stanford Institute for 
Economic Policy Research, Stanford University, Stanford, California, January 19 , 
https://www.federalr eserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170119a.htm .  The change rule has different 
coefficient values than the first -difference rule shown in the second exhibit and, importantly, it uses the 
current deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate a nd of inflation from 2  percent rather than 
expectations about future changes in the output gap and expected deviations of inflation from 2 percent.  
All else being equal, the change rule’s focus on absolute deviations, rather than on expected changes, tends 
to accentuate tightening and easing cycles relative to the first- difference rule.  
11 Unlike the similar alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A, we 
do not adjust the way that inflation expectations are formed, but instead isolate the effects of a change in 
the policy rule under a steeper wage Phillips curve.  Moreover, as in the other simulations in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook A, the simulations are conducted under the assumption that market 
participan ts, as well as price and wage setters, have perfect foresight.  By contrast, the alternative scenario 
in the Risks and Uncertainty section that considers a steeper wage Phillips curve embeds the assumption that all expectations are formed using projections  based solely on past outcomes.

  and, in turn, a somewhat higher unemployment rate than in the Tealbook 
baseline. 
• Under the Taylor (1999) rule, the federal funds rate rises much more quickly 
in response to the higher inflation than under the inertial version of that rule .  
As a result, unemployment is initially higher  than under the inertial version of 
the rule, where as inflation outcomes are similar.  
• The change rule has different properties than Taylor- type rules.   For example, 
when the unemployment rate is below its natural rate and inflation is  above 
2 percent , it prescribes continual increases  in the federal funds rate at least 
until inflation returns to 2 percent or the unemployment rate returns to its 
natural rate.12  By contrast, Taylor -type rules would prescribe decreases in  the 
federal funds rate as inflation declines to  2 percent and the unemployment rate 
rises to ward  its natural rate.13 
• In the Tealbook baseline, core PCE price inflation is somewhat below 2 percent in the current and subsequent quarters; however, the unemployment 
rate is currently 0.4 percentage point below its natural rate and projected to fall further.  On net, the change rule calls for increases to the federal funds 
rate until the unemployment rate has almost risen to its natural rate .  The 
prescribed policy rate path remains above the prescriptions of the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule from the second half of 2018 through 2022, leading to a more rapid return of the unemployment rate to its natural level  and keeping 
inflation at or below 2 percent through 2022 despite the steeper wage Phillips curve. 
• In sum, the model simulations indicate that both the Taylor (1999) rule and 
the inertial version of that rule  would lead to a persistent overshooting of the 
Committee’s 2 percent  inflation objective if wages turn out to be more 
                                                 
12 Similarly, if the unemployment rate is above its natural rate and inflation is below 2  percent, the 
change rule will prescribe decreases in the federal funds rate until inflation returns to 2  percent or the 
unemployment ra te returns to its natural rate.  
13 The change rule, like the first -difference rule, does not specify the long -run value of the real 
federal funds rate; it nonetheless achieves this value in the long run through its response to inflation 
deviations from 2  percent and to unemployment rate deviations from its natural rate.  By contrast, Taylor-
type rules include an intercept term that is assumed to correspond to the long- run value of the real federal 
funds rate.

  responsive to labor market tightne ss over the next few years than assumed in 
the staff projection.  This overshooting occurs because the tightening in the 
stance of policy presc ribed by these rules arrives too late to fully contain  the 
inflation pressures brought about by  substantial unemp loyment rate 
undershooting in combination with a steeper wage Phillips curve.  By 
contrast, the relatively aggressive response of monetary policy embedded in the change rule is  able to forestall the rise in inflation —provided this future 
stance is fully an ticipated by price and wage setters, as we assume in the 
simulation.  
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic 
implications  of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strateg ies are described as 
commitment  strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  An d, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess t he various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported 
in the Monetary Policy Strategies  section .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t .  
The right-hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE price 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate 
for the current period (ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead annual change in the 
output gap ( ∆4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted πLR, 
is 2 percent.

  Simple Rules  
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board 
staff.1  The intercepts of these rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen so that they are 
consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a longer- run real federal funds rate 
of 1 percent, a value used in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
Near -term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the 
Tealbook projec tions for inflation and the output gap.  When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters .  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quart ers.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand- side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the se cond quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL  FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The “Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US r* ” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter 
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the out put gap equal to zero in the final quarter 
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large- scale econometric model 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others ( 2012).  
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first impleme nted on a fully compounded, 365- day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.  Taylor (1993)  rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+0.5𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 𝑡𝑡

  of the U.S. economy.3  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of pr ojected values of the model’s exogenous variables. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* .  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US  r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes 
even when their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US  r* 
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12- quarter period to close 
the output gap at the end of this time frame , whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal 
funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMU LATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the w hole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as price and wage setters have perfect foresight and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealbook 
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large- scale asset 
purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarte r; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin 
in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the

  Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
4  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.  
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect 
foresight and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is as sumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy 
decisions made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a 
horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon fu rther would not 
affect the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits.

ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.  Loss Functions

    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. 
HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitiv e receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy
changes in transfers and taxes.

From:  David Wilcox 
Subject:  Corrected Probabilities of Returning to the E ffective Lower Bound  
 
 In the Risk and Uncertainty section of the April Tealbook A, the box “ A 
Guidepost for Dropping Effective Lower Bound Risk from the Assessment of Risks ” (on 
pages 68- 69) presented calculations of the probabilit y that  the federal funds rate would 
return to the effective lower bound (ELB).  The calculations were constructed using 
stochastic simulations of the FRB/US  model around the staff baseline projection and 
were shown in figures 1 and 2 of the box.    During the process of preparing to show updated versions of these 
probabilities in subsequent Tealbooks, a small error was found in the code that 
constructed  these calculations.  This note provides corrected calculations  of the 
probabilitie s that had been shown in the box.  The red lines in figures 1 and 2 show the 
correct probabilities, and the black lines show what was in the April Tealbook.  In a few 
places in the text, the correct calculations are shown in red and the incorrect ones are 
shown in black strikeout.  Even with these corrections, the main point of the box is 
unchanged:  G iven the baseline April forecast, the probability of returning to the ELB 
will probably be low enough around the third quarter of this year that we will consi der 
dropping it as a factor  that contributes importantly to  our assessment of a downside skew 
in the risks for our projection of economic activity.

Page 1 of 2 A Guidepost  for Dropping Effective Lower Bound  Risk  
from the Assessment of Risks  
The staff has  for some time judged  that the risks to the projection for real activity are 
skewed to the downside due to the effective lower bound (ELB) constraint  on the federal 
funds rate.  All else being equal, a higher expected path for the federal funds rate lowers 
the probability  that policymakers will be constrained by the ELB in the near future, which  
reduces downside macroeconomic risk s.  With the federal funds rate having  risen to the 
range of ¾ to 1 percent and expected to rise further going forward, we will face a 
decision about  when to drop the ELB reference from the Tealbook’s  assessment of risk s.  
In this discussion, we describe how one specific measure of ELB risk has evolved since 
liftoff and is expected  to evolve in the future.  We then lay out one possible way to use 
this measure to inform our decision on when to drop our  reference to the downside 
economic risk stemming from the ELB.  
 
Figure 1 shows a measure of ELB risk —the probability that the federal funds rate will be 
at the ELB for at least  one quarter during  the next three years —computed from  20,000 
stochastic  simulations of  FRB/US around the Tealbook baseline projection using  the non -
inertial version of the Taylor rule.1  According to figure 1, the ELB risk  measure was above 
40 30 percent throughout  most of  2016 but then moved below 40  30 percent  early this 
year.  The ELB risk measure based on the April 2017 Tealbook projection  is 28 26 percent.2 
 
                                                 
1 We use the non -inertial Taylor rule to capture the fact that policymakers typically cut interest rates 
aggressively in the face of a looming recession, even though they often increase interest rates gradually 
in the aftermath of  a recession.  In sticky -price models that account for the ELB, this asymmetric 
behavior is consistent with the prescriptio n of optimal commitment policy and other well -performing 
rules,  such as the price -level targeting rule and the rule proposed in David Reifschneider and John C. 
Williams (2 000) , “Three Lessons for Monetary Policy in a Low- Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and 
Banking , vol. 32 (November), pp. 936– 66. 
2 In the stochastic simulation, many of the ELB episodes are short lived, with the federal funds rate 
touching the ELB in only one or two quarters.  According to the April 2017 Tealbook projection, the probability that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least four quarters  (not necessarily 
consecutive) during the next thre e years is about 10  percent.

Page 2 of 2 Note that ELB risk fluctuated during  2016 even though the actual federal funds rate 
remained constant in  the range of ¼ to ½ percent .  These movements  reflect the fact 
that  the ELB risk  measure depends not only on the current federal funds rate, but also on 
the projected  path of the federal funds rate.  When the projected path of the federal 
funds rate becom es flatter (steeper) , ELB risk increases  (decreases).  For example, when 
the staff reduced its estimate of the long -run equilibrium value of the federal funds 
rate— the intercept in the Taylor rule—in the June  2016 Tealbook projection, the 
projected path of  the federal funds rate flattened appreciably .  As a result, the ELB risk 
increased , from about 37 31 percent in April 2016 to more than  52 34 percent in June 2016.  
 
Figure 2 shows the projected  path of the ELB risk according to the current Tealbook  
forecast.  In this figure, t he ELB risk at any given date shows  the model- implied  
probability that the federal funds rate will be at the ELB for at least  one quarter during  
the subsequent  three years if the economy has evolved according to the current 
Tealbook  projection  up to that time.  Because the federal funds rate is expected to rise, 
ELB risk is expected to decline further from its  current level.  It declines even below its 
steady -state  value of 18  percent —shown  by the dashed line—reflecting the projected 
overshooting of the federal funds rate above its long -run value of 3 percent .3  Indeed, as 
a result of  the forward -looking nature of the ELB risk measure, t he ELB risk is expected to 
decline below its steady -state  value in  late 2017  early 2018 , when the federal funds rate is 
still expected to be substantially below its long -run value of 3 percent . 
 We plan to consult this ELB risk measure to inform our decision about  when to drop the 
ELB reference in our assessment of risks  in the Tealbook .  Our provisional plan is to stop  
highlighting the ELB risk sometime after our measure of ELB risk is below 25 percent.  T he 
choice  of 25 percent is somewhat arbitrary, and others may see a different threshold  level 
as more appropriate.  As can be seen in figure 2, according to the April Tealbook 
projection, the ELB risk  measure is likely to dip  below 25 percent for the first time in 
2017 :Q3, when the federal funds rate is projected to be a little above 1  percent.  The date 
when this measure moves below 25 percent  will depend on the actual evolution of the 
economy as well as the evolution of the staff projection.  I f the federal funds rate rises 
more slowly or the staff projection of the funds rate path becomes flatter than 
anticipated by the current Tealbook projection —possibly because the staff further 
lowers its  estimate of the long -run equilibrium natural rate— the threshold  will be 
breached  later than 2017: Q3.  
                                                 
3 The steady -state value of the ELB risk is the model -implied probability that the federal funds rate 
will be at the ELB for at least one quarter during the next three years, conditional on the economy being 
at its steady state today.  This concept is disti nct from the unconditional probability that the federal 
funds rate is at the ELB.  To compute  the steady -state ELB risk shown in figure 2, we begin stochastic 
simulations from  a steady state consistent with that shown in the Long -Term Outlook exhibit of the April 
Tealbook projection .
