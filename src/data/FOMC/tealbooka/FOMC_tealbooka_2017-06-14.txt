Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The spending and labor market i ndicators that we have received since the April 
Tealbook show resource utilizati on as having continued to tight en thus far this year.  The 
unemployment rate fell to 4.3 pe rcent in May, down 0.4 percentage point from the end of 
last year.  In addition, the payroll employment gain through Ma y exceeded the pace that 
we think is consistent with no c hange in labor utilization.  Meanwhile, the incoming data 
on spending and production suggest that real GDP growth will rebound from an annual 
rate of 1¼ percent in the first  quarter to 2½ percent this quar ter.  On average, the pace of 
growth over the first half of the year is about ½ percentage point faster than our estimate 
of potential GDP growth. 
Although the case seems strong tha t utilization h as been tighte ning, it is a closer 
call as to whether that tightening has proceeded more quickly t han we expected in the 
April Tealbook.  On the one hand, the unemployment rate in May was 0.2 percentage 
point lower than in our previous f orecast, while the projected level of real GDP in the 
second quarter is a touch higher .  On the other hand, the recen t pace of payroll 
employment growth has been weaker  than we had anticipated.  Mor eover, recent monthly 
readings on PCE price inflation have been soft. 
In particular, the April reading on PCE price inflation surprised us slightly to the 
downside, as we had expected a l arger bounceback following the very low March value.  
Total PCE prices rose 1.7 per cent in the 12 months through Apri l, while core prices rose 
1.5 percent, 0.1 percentage point softer than expected in the p revious Tealbook.  We 
continue to view the recent soft  readings as importantly reflec ting idiosyncratic and 
transitory factors a nd, therefore, as tell ing us relatively lit tle about the degree of tightness 
in the real economy.  On balance,  in light of the lower unemplo yment rate and slightly 
higher level of real GDP, we judge  that resource utilization in  the second quarter is a little 
tighter than we ha d thought in April.  
We now project that real GDP growth over 2017 as a whole will a verage almost 
2½ percent, ¼ percentage point above the April Tealbook forecas t.  GDP growth is 
forecast to slow to 2¼ percent in 2018 and to 1¾ percent in 201 9, as the stimulus from 
the fiscal expansion that we continue to assume will occur is o ffset by the ongoing

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is above the project ions from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017 
and below the Blue Chip consensus in 2018 . The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is 
lower than both outside forecast s.  The s taff’s projection for CPI inflation is below 
those of outside forecasters in 2017 and is the same as them in 2018.  Th e staff’s 
projections for both overall and core PCE price inflation are noticeably below the SPF 
forecast s in 2017 but are in line with the SPF forecasts in 2018 . 
Note: SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures. Blue Chip does not provide results for 
PCE price inflation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from about 50 
panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookRevisions  to  the  Staff  Projection  since  the  Previous  SEP  
The  FOMC  most  recently  published  its  Summary  of  Economic  Projections,  or  SEP,  following  
the  March  FOMC  meeting.  The  table  below  compares  the  staff’s  current  economic  
projection  with  the  one  we  presented  in  the  March  Tealbook.  
Since  March,  we  have  revised  up  our  projection  for  the  increase  in  real  GDP  in  2017  by  about  
½  percentage  point.  Our  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2018  and  2019  is  unrevised.  With  
faster  GDP  growth,  on  net,  over  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  falls  by  more  
than  in  the  March  forecast  and  reaches  3.8  percent  at  the  end  of  2019,  which  is  
1.1  percentage  points  below  the  staff’s  downwardly  revised  estimate  of  the  longer‐ run 
natural  rate.  
The  available  data  on  consumer  price  inflation  for  March  and  April  were  weak,  but  we  view  
these  readings  as  importantly  reflecting  idiosyncratic  and  transitory  factors.  As  a  result,  the  
forecast  for  core  PCE  price  inflation  is  marked  down  this  year  but  is  unrevised  thereafter.  
Total  PCE  inflation  is  expected  to  move  up  modestly  over  the  next  couple  of  years  and  to  
reach  2  percent  in  2019,  0.1  percentage  point  higher  than  in  the  March  forecast.  
With  the  outlook  for  the  GDP  gap  somewhat  tighter,  the  federal  funds  rate  path  from  the  
intercept ‐adjusted  inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule  that  we  use  in  our  baseline  forecast  is  above 
that  in  the  March  Tealbook  through  most  of  the  projection  period.

gradual normalization of monetary policy.1  With real GDP growt h expected to outpace 
our estimate of potential output growth throughout the medium t erm, real economic 
activity further overshoots its su stainable level.  As a result , the unemployment rate is 
projected to be 3.8 percent at  the end of 2019, 1.1 percentage points below our estimate 
of its natural rate, and 0.2 per centage point lower than in the April Tealbook.  We now 
project that the 12-month change in both total and core PCE pri ce inflation will run a 
little lower through the end of this  year than in our previous projection.  Beyond this year, 
though, our inflation forecast is not materially different from  the April Tealbook and 
reaches 2 percent in 2019. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 We have retained our placeholder assumption that adjustments to  federal 
fiscal policy will increase the primary budget deficit (that is, the deficit 
excluding interest costs) by 1 per cent of GDP, and t hat this fi scal expansion 
will take the form of a cut in pe rsonal income taxes starting i n the first quarter 
of 2018.  But there continues to be c onsiderable uncertainty ab out the 
potential size, timing, and composition of any fiscal policy ch anges—indeed, 
probably more so than earlier this year. 
o In preparing the current forecast we contemplated delaying the onset or 
reducing the magnitude of the assumed fiscal expansion.  Althou gh we see 
lower odds of something equiva lent to our assumed policy change  being 
enacted, we still view it to be the modal outcome. 
 We continue to project t hat discretionary policy actions across  all levels of 
government will increase the rat e of real GDP growth about ¼ percentage 
point in 2017, ½ percentage point in 2018, and ¼ percentage point in 2019. 
Monetary Policy  
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase a little more than 1 percentage point 
per year, on average, over the projection period and to average 3.7 percent in 
1 The assumed placeholde r for fiscal expansi on adds about ¼ perc entage point to the growth rate 
of real GDP in both 2018 and 2019.

the fourth quarter of 2019.  This pa th is a bit steeper than in  the April 
Tealbook, reflecting the slightl y tighter economy we are projecting. 
 The SOMA portfolio remains at its current level until the third  quarter of 2017 
and then begins a gradual and predic table decline as reinvestments from 
principal repayments on securiti es held in the portfolio are ph ased out. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise significantly o ver the medium 
term from an average of 2.3 percen t in the current quarter to 4 .0 percent by the 
end of 2019.  In line with the slight ly steeper trajectory for the federal funds 
rate, the yield at the end of 2019 is a bit higher than in our April forecast and 
modestly above its assumed longer-run value of 3.5 percent. 
 The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was revised mostly in line with the 
path for the 10-year Treasury yield.  However, we lowered our p rojection for 
the triple-B corporate bond spread by 5 to 10 basis points in b oth 2017 and 
2018 in response to the persisten tly lower-than-projected spread over the past 
few quarters. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have risen about 3¾ percent since the April Tealb ook, whereas 
we had projected stock prices to be  about flat.  Nevertheless, in our view, 
notable valuation pressures will l imit the scope for further st ock price 
appreciation over the medium term.  Accordingly, equity prices are projected 
to rise at an average annual rate of only ½ percent from here f orward, a tad 
less than in the April Tealbook.  ( For a discussion of the rationale behind the 
staff’s forecast of equity prices, see the box “Stock Market Tr ajectory in the 
Baseline Forecast.”) 
 Incoming data on house prices have been slightly stronger than expected, and 
we have nudged up our forecast for house price appreciation this year to 
around 6 percent.  We judge that th e ratio of house prices to r ents is 
marginally above its long-run tre nd.  To reflect this considera tion, we project 
the growth in home values to s low to around 4 percent in 2018 a nd 2019, a 
pace that would stabilize house  prices relative to rents.

Stock Market Trajectory in the Baseline Forecast 
The most recent QS report highlighted valuation pressures across a range of 
assets, including U.S. equities, where price- to-earnings ratios have reached 
extraordinarily high levels not seen since the bursting of the tech stock bubble in 
the early 2000s . Valuation of equities relative to government bonds, as gauged 
by the staff’s estimate of the e xpected equity premium, is also higher than 
average ( that is , the equity premium is low), although not near historical 
extremes .  Moreover, in recent Tealbooks we have been project ing that th e 
equity premium (the shaded area in figure 1) will further narrow toward 
historically low levels on the expectation that equity prices will remain resilient 
even as interest rates increase.  In light of these valuation concerns, we 
contemplated adopting a new baseline stock market path in which stock prices 
would decli ne 5 to 10 percent by the end of 2018 relative to their current level.  
Notwithstanding the valuation pressures noted previously , we decided against 
such a change for the following reasons.   
Importantly, the recent forecast s already had stock prices rising at a historically 
very slow pace, about 1 percent per year in nominal terms .  Including dividends , 
this pace would imply annual returns on stocks of about 3 percent.  This return is 
well below average historical equity returns and refle cts the staff’s view that 
currently elevated valuation pressures are likely to weigh heavily on equity 
returns in the medium term. 
Standard asset pricing models imply that investors must be expecting to earn 
some, even if small, premium on stocks over a two-year period relative to the 
risk-free (nominal) return on a two- year Treasury bond.  T o rationalize a decline in 
stock prices over the next two years, we would have to adopt one of two 
arguments, neither of which we currently find very compelling. 
The first possible argument would be that th e Tealbook forecast and narrative 
embed a substantial negative surprise to markets and investors , such as 
disappointing (after- tax) corporate earnings, increased downside risk to 
economic conditions, or higher- than -expected interest rates.  But the baseline 
forecast anticipates steady , gradual strengthening of the economy over the next 
two years without a serious inflation threat . Moreover, the rise in long -term 
Treasury yields embedded in the baseline is not far out of line with market 
expectations .  All of this suggests the staff forecast is broadly consistent with key 
dimensions of the market ’s outlook ; accordingly, if the staff forecast were to be 
realized, we do not think that equity investors would be disappointed.  
The second possible argument for a stock market decline is an assumption that 
investors will reassess their exposure to equities in light of continued prevailing 
high valuations —in effect, an increase in risk aversion triggered by something 
outside of the staff forecast.  With regard to this rationalization, the vast

 literature on forecasting stock returns does offer evidence that there is so me 
predictive content of stock valuation measures for subsequent returns, though 
such tests have less predictive power out of sample.1  Most predictive 
regressions , however, would suggest low  positive, rather than negative , 
expected returns.  An alternative approach involves estimating  the probability of 
a stock market crash or substandard returns.  Here, again, recent research and  
preliminary staff  analysis  tend to suggest that current stock market valuations 
would , at bes t, predicate a fairly modest increase in the odds  of substandard 
future returns , with wide confidence bands .2    
Finally, although valuation ratios and equity premium measures do not enable us to predict the timing and extent of stock market correction s with much 
confidence, these variables are useful in assessing the financial system’s 
vulnerability to negative shocks.  Thus,  for now at least, we think it is preferable 
to signal our concerns regarding  valuation pressures through the use of 
alternative scen arios  rather than adjustments to the baseline forecast .

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Foreign real GDP growth picked up to 3¼ percent in the first qu arter, a bit 
more than we anticipated in the April Tealbook.  We expect grow th abroad to 
moderate to a 2½ percent pace by e arly next year, in part as Ca nada’s growth 
settles to a more sustainable rate and policy stimulus in China  diminishes.  As 
in the April Tealbook, we expect foreign growth to remain at th is near-
potential pace through the medium term. 
 The broad nominal dollar has depr eciated about 1 ¼ percent since the time of 
the April Tealbook.  We expect the  broad real dollar to appreci ate at about a 
2 percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market ex pectations for 
the federal funds rate move up t oward the staff forecast, leaving the level of 
the dollar at the end of 2019 about ¾  percent lower than in the  April 
Tealbook.  The slightly greater pa ce of dollar appreciation in this projection 
reflects the marginally more rest rictive stance of U.S. monetar y policy in 
response to the sligh tly tighter economy. 
Oil and Commodity Prices 
 Against a backdrop of continued increases in U.S. oil productio n, oil prices 
fluctuated over the intermeeting period on changing market conv ictions about 
OPEC’s agreement to cut production.  Ultimately, OPEC renewed t he 
agreement for an additional nine months, but the agreement did not include 
additional production cuts that s ome market participants had ex pected.  The 
spot price of Brent crude oil closed most recently at $51 per b arrel, $2 per 
barrel lower than at the time of the April Tealbook.  As in the  April Tealbook, 
we project that oil prices will decline gradually over the projection period. 
 Agricultural prices have risen 2 pe rcent since the April Tealbo ok, mainly on 
increased wheat and corn prices.  C ool weather and heavy rains in the 
Midwest have delayed planting sch edules and pose some risk for the winter 
harvest. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
On balance, the incoming spending d ata have surprised us to the  upside relative to 
our expectations in the April Te albook.  We currently estimate that real GDP increased at 
an annual rate of 1¼ percent in t he first quarter, and we proje ct GDP growth to step up to

about a 2½ percent pace in the s econd and third quarters, large ly reflecting a pickup in 
consumption spending from its trans itorily low first-quarter pace.  On net, our projection 
for GDP growth in the first half  is revised up a couple tenths of a percentage point from 
the previous Tealbook, mainly due  to upward revisions in E&I spending and net exports. 
 We estimate that real PCE posted a meager increase of ½ percent  at an annual 
rate during the first quarter.  We continue to attribute the we akness to a 
variety of special factors, inc luding depressed outlays for ene rgy services due 
to unseasonably warm weather, a s tep-down in motor vehicle sale s from an 
above-trend pace last year, and some payback from strong gains in non-energy 
services in the fourth quarter .  The incoming spending data have corroborated 
our view that PCE growth will  pick up during the second quarter , although we 
tempered our near-term forecast in light of the sharp downward revision to 
real disposable personal income in the fourth quarter of last y ear.2  Even so, 
with ongoing gains in employment and still-upbeat levels of sen timent, we 
expect real PCE growth to avera ge about 3 percent this quarter and next. 
 Investment in E&I is estimated t o have increased at an annual r ate of 7 percent 
in the first quarter, well a bove our April Tealbook forecast of 2½ percent 
growth.  In addition, indicators of business spending in the se cond quarter 
remain upbeat.  Investment in E&I i s now projected to rise at n early a 
5 percent pace during the first half of this year, twice as fas t as in the April 
Tealbook, and we expect a similar in crease in the third quarter . 
 We estimate that residential i nvestment rose at a robust 14 percent annual rate 
in the first quarter, noticeably s tronger than in the April Tealbook.  Some of 
that strength was likely pulle d forward in response to unseason ably warm 
weather, the anticipation of  higher interest rates, or both.  We expect that the 
2 Incorporating information from unemployment insurance tax reco rds led the BEA to revise down 
their estimate of labor compensation in the fourth quarter of 2016 by $114 billion.  Anecdotal reports 
suggest that the weak fourth-quarter reading could partly reflect a shifting of income from late last year into 
early this year in anticipation of a potential cut in personal tax rates; such a shift would imply a sharp 
increase in compensation in the first quarter.  Indeed, the opp osite pattern occurred in late 2012 and early 
2013, when compensation was pu lled forward noti ceably in advanc e of the 2013 expiration of the Bush tax 
cuts.  For now, we have tentatively taken on board the lower level of income:  The BEA has not assumed a 
first-quarter rebound in compensation, and we have not overridd en their assumption in  our projection. 
(This question could be resolved in the summer when the unemplo yment insurance tax records for the first 
quarter are incorporated in the national accounts.)

strong growth of residential investment in the first quarter wi ll give way to a 
fairly flat trajectory in the second and third quarters, as hig her mortgage rates 
start to weigh more  heavily on housing demand. 
 Investment in drilling and mining s tructures shot up more than 450 percent at 
an annual rate in the first quarter, substantially more than we  had projected.  
Looking ahead, indicators of oil  drilling activity have risen f urther, pointing to 
solid gains in drilling and mini ng structures investment in the  second and third 
quarters.  However, the incom ing data on investment in other no nresidential 
structures have been weaker th an we expected.  All told, our fo recast for 
nonresidential structures invest ment in the first half of this year is unrevised 
from the April Tealbook, while the  third quarter is somewhat st ronger. 
 The contribution of net exports t o real GDP growth is ½ percentage point 
stronger in the first quarter, reflecting both lower-than-expec ted imports and 
higher-than-expected exports.  W e have also revised up the net export 
contribution in the second and third quarters by about 0.1 perc entage point in 
response to the recent dollar depreciation.  Net exports are no w projected to be 
neutral for first-half GDP grow th and a modest drag in the thir d quarter. 
 On balance, the incoming data on industrial production have bee n somewhat 
stronger than we had anticipated in the April Tealbook.  We exp ect increases 
in industrial production to modera te in the coming months, as utilities 
production is held down by a retur n to seasonally normal temperatures and 
manufacturing production is rest rained by a slowdown in motor v ehicle 
assemblies.  Mining output has ri sen at a rapid clip in recent months, largely 
as a result of gains in oil a nd gas drilling and crude oil prod uction.  (For a 
discussion of U.S. crude oil production, see the box “Why Is U. S. Oil Output 
So Strong?”) 
All told, real GDP is projected  to rise nearly 2½ percent this year, ¼ percentage 
point faster than in the April Tealbook.  Beyond 2017, our GDP growth forecast is 
unrevised at 2¼ percent i n 2018 and 1¾ percent in 2019; toward the end of the medium 
term, growth slows because of  the ongoing gradual normalization  of monetary policy. 
 The key conditioning factors underpinning our forecast are more 
accommodative, on balance, than in the April Tealbook—in partic ular, the

Why Is U.S. Oil Output So Strong? 
 
Total U.S. crude oil production  nearly doubled from around 5 million barrels per day  (b/d) in the 
mid‐2000s  to just under 9½ million b/d in 2015 (figure 1, black line).  This increase was almost 
exclusively  due to production  from unconventional  “tight oil” geographies,  where methods  such 
as horizontal  drilling and hydraulic  fracturing  have been  exploited  to extract  oil and gas trapped 
in low‐permeability  rock formations.   However,  between  2014  and 2016, oil prices fell about 
70 percent, and the count of drilling rigs in operation—a  widely used predictor of  near‐term  crude 
oil production—plummeted  by a similar magnitude.   To the surprise of many industry analysts, 
total U.S. production  fell only 6 percent  and has turned up in recent quarters.   
Why did oil production  not fall by more?  The answer lies in the large and widespread  productivity  
gains in drilling and extraction  technologies  not reflected in  some existing indicators  of 
production.   These gains in productivity  imply that (1) a simple count of drilling rigs is,  by itself, no 
longer a good predictor of  near‐term production,  and (2) U.S. producers  are able to remain  
profitable  at far lower  prices than in previous years.  Thus, even  with the expected  path of oil 
prices below $60 per barrel  and the number of active drilling rigs far lower  than a few years ago, 
the Energy Information Administration (EIA)  projects U.S. oil production  to average  9.3 million 
b/d in 2017 and to reach an all‐time annual record of 10.0  million b/d in 2018  (figure  1, black dotted 
line).  Understanding  the factors behind the EIA’s projected  growth in oil production  is important,  
as these  estimates  are incorporated  into the Board staff’s forecasts  for real GDP and industrial  
production.1 
Mapping  Rig Counts to Output.  Traditionally,  the rig count has been seen  as a good indicator of 
near‐term production  because a large fraction of a well’s output occurs in its first few months.  
However,  the linkage between  drilling rigs and oil extraction  relies on the assumption  that the 
productivity  of successive  cohorts of new wells is relatively stable.   Since the onset of the tight‐oil 
boom in 2010, the  first‐month output of new wells advanced  rapidly, with  a new well  in the tight‐
oil areas producing  roughly 700 b/d in early 2017, more than four times the 2010 level  (figure 2).  
                                                            
1 Oil output is not a direct  input into the spending ‐side calculation  of GDP, but as domestic  oil production  
rises,  oil imports—which  are subtracted  from  aggregate  expenditures  to measure GDP—decline.   Thus, a shift 
toward domestically  sourced oil boosts the level  of real GDP.

 Drawing on new EIA data  for the  main tight‐oil regions, the  staff have constructed  a new 
measure—the  number of rigs needed  for flat production  (RNFP)—that  helps gauge  the direction  
and magnitude  of expected  changes in domestic  oil production.   The RNFP  uses estimates  of the 
productivity  of new wells to calculate  the number of rigs required  to keep total production  
constant in the tight‐oil regions—that  is, to exactly  offset the natural decline in output from 
existing wells.2  With conventional  oil production  roughly flat over the past decade—see  figure 1, 
orange line—the  RNFP and the tight‐oil rig count can be used to predict  changes in aggregate 
production.   Figure 3 shows the RNFP  (black line) and the tight‐oil rig count (red line).  With the 
number of rigs now trending above the RNFP, total oil production  should continue to expand  in 
the coming months, consistent  with  the EIA projection  embedded in  the staff forecast. 
Breakeven  Prices .  The oil price required for a new drilling project  to be economically  viable has 
declined notably.  The downward  trend in those prices, known as  breakeven  prices, also supp orts 
the strong production  forecast.  Breakeven  prices in the tight‐oil areas have been falling over the 
past two  years while also converging  across  regions toward more similar levels (figure  4). 3  While 
part of the decline likely reflects input costs for drilling  that fell during the industry downturn  (for 
example,  rig rental rates, sand, and labor), structural  changes—such  as innovations  in drilling and 
new well  completion  techniques—account  for a substantial  portion of the reduction.   In April 
2017, average breakevens  were a little below spot oil prices, as shown  by the black line in figure 4; 
however,  average numbers hide a large degree of heterogeneity, even  within regions.4 
Looking Forward.   Large productivity  gains in recent years have altered historical  relationships,  
making new indicators  helpful in understanding  current and future trends.  Further production  
gains may face some headwinds  in future months, as input costs are likely to increase  with  more 
drilling rigs returning  to use, but new technologies  also have considerable  scope  to spread  across 
existing producers.   Hence, current projections  for near‐record production  levels of U.S. crude oil 
in 2017 and 2018 appear consistent  with  a path of moderate  oil prices and modest levels of rigs in 
operation.   
                                                            
2 Rising production  puts upward pressure on future values of the RNFP, but productivity  gains counteract  
this effect,  reducing the number of rigs needed to maintain a given level of output.  
3 Definitions  of breakeven  prices vary widely.  We report wellhead  half‐cycle breakevens,  a measure of well 
profitability  that excludes transportation  expenses,  the cost of exploration,  and other field developments.  
4 Within‐region breakevens  range  from  about $30 per barrel in some areas  of the Permian Basin to $70 per 
barrel in some counties within the Bakken region.

dollar is modestly weaker, equit y and home prices are slightly higher, and oil 
prices are a bit lower. 
 However, the projected level of  household income is lower throu ghout the 
forecast, which restrains the growth rate of PCE over the mediu m term, all 
else being equal. 
 We assume that potential GDP gr owth will move up from 1½ percen t this year 
to 1¾ percent in 2019; the level  of potential at the end of 201 9 is 0.1 percent 
higher than in our April forecast  because of stronger projected  capital 
spending.  With real GDP growth projected to outpace potential growth over 
the medium term, resource utiliz ation tightens further:  Real GDP is expected 
to exceed its potential level by 2 percent at the end of 2019, ¼ percentage 
point more than in the April Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
Taken together, the April and May e mployment reports indicate that the labor 
market has tightened further. 
 The unemployment rate declined from 4.5 percent in March to 4.3  percent in 
May, 0.2 percentage point lower than  we projected in the April Tealbook, 
while the labor force participation rate (LFPR) declined from 6 3.0 percent in 
March to 62.7 percent in May, 0.1 percentage point below our ex pectation.  
We now project the unemployment rate to remain at 4.3 percent t hrough 
September, 0.2 percentage point low er than in our previous fore cast. 
 Payroll employment rose 174,000 in April and 138,000 in May, so mewhat 
slower than we expected in the  April Tealbook.  Em ployers have added an 
average of 160,000 payroll jobs p er month so far this year, abo ut 20,000 per 
month slower than in the April Tealbook but still faster than t he pace we 
estimate to be consistent wit h unchanged labor market slack 
(90,000 to 120,000 per month).  Balanci ng the weaker-than-expec ted 
employment readings against the  upward revisio ns to our near-te rm forecast 
for GDP growth, we project payroll gains to average about 170,0 00 per month 
through September, little changed from our April forecast.

 Other labor market indicators  continue to point to strong labor  demand.  
Notably, initial claims for unemployment insurance remain near historic lows, 
the quits rate is essentially b ack to its pre-recession level, and consumers’ 
expectations of job availabilit y have surpassed the high-water mark reached in 
the previous expansion. 
In our judgment, the labor market is tight:  Our projection of the unemployment 
rate in the current quarter is  0.6 percentage point below our e stimate of its natural rate, 
and the LFPR is 0.1 percentage poin t above its estimated trend.3 
Looking ahead, the labor market is  projected to tighten further  over the medium 
term and to be very tight by the end of 2019. 
 After decreasing about 1 percen tage point since early 2015, the 
unemployment rate is projecte d to decline another 0.5 percentag e point over 
the medium term and to end 2019 a t 3.8 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower 
than in the April Tealbook. 
 Average monthly total payroll ga ins are expected to slow from 1 66,000 in 
2017 to 122,000 in 2019.  Both the LFPR and the employment-to-p opulation 
ratio are projected to continue t o improve relative to their de clining trends. 
 We project that productivity will increase slightly less than 1  percent per year, 
on average, over the forecast  period, a bit slower than in 2016  (though still up 
from its average over the preceding several years) and slightly below our 
estimate of its structural pace.4 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Core PCE price inflation picke d up in April from the exceptiona lly low March 
reading, but the pickup was smalle r than we had projected.  Our  best judgment is that the 
3 We considered revising down our  estimate of the natural rate o f unemployment in this projection 
in light of the further decline in unemployment and the weak re cent readings on inflation.  For the moment, 
however, we have chosen not to make any adjustment, in large pa rt because we view those weak inflation 
readings to be transitory. 
4 Productivity typically falls bel ow its structural level when t he labor market becomes tight, 
possibly because a larger share of workers hired in a tight lab or market have below-average productivity 
than is the case during a slack labor market.

recent inflation data do not point to a significantly slower pace of monthly pric e increases 
going forward; indeed, the fundame ntals underlying the core inf lation forecast are a little 
stronger in this projection. 
 At the time of the April Teal book, we had the very weak March C PI report in 
hand; we subsequently received the March and April readings on PCE prices.5 
Core PCE prices declined 0.1 per cent in March and rose 0.2 perc ent in April.  
Both readings were slightly low er than we projected in the prev ious Tealbook.  
o Much of the softness in core PCE prices in March and April can be 
explained by sharp declines in pr ices for wireless telephone se rvices and 
prescription drugs; we think tha t these declines have limited signal value 
for monthly inflation readings going forward. 
o That said, a number of categorie s of consumer prices registered  weak 
readings in March; indeed, the t rimmed mean PCE price index als o slowed 
that month, though not by as much as the core index. 
o In addition, first-quarter core import prices were weaker than expected, a 
factor that we think is modestly  restraining core PCE inflation  in the 
current quarter.  We have revis ed up our projected path for cor e import 
price inflation over the rest of  the year in response to the do llar’s recent 
depreciation. 
 For the second quarter, these various factors led us to mark do wn our forecast 
for core PCE inflation to 1.1 percent, 0.5 percentage point bel ow our April 
Tealbook projection.  Core infla tion is projected to step up to 1.8 percent in 
the third quarter, 0.1 percentage po int faster than in the April Tealbook, 
reflecting the higher projected pa th for core goods import pric e inflation. 
 Measured on a 12-month change basi s, core PCE prices moved down  to 
1.5 percent in April, rounding 0.1 pe rcentage point lower than in our previous 
forecast.  We expect the 12-month change in both total and core  PCE inflation 
to remain at around 1½ percent until t his year’s low March reading drops out 
of the calculation. 
5 The May CPI report will be releas ed on the second day of the J une FOMC meeting.

 Core import price inflation is expected to step up from a ½ percent pace in the 
first quarter to 2¼ percent in the second and third quarters, a s the drag from 
earlier dollar appreciation is replaced by a boost from recent dollar 
depreciation.  Thereafter, impor t price inflation is expected t o slow to a 
½ percent pace, consistent with moderate foreign inflation, a g radually 
appreciating dollar, and slowl y declining commodity prices. 
 The incoming data on longer-run inflation expectations are litt le changed, on 
balance, since the April Tealbook.  Median expectations over th e next 5 to 
10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers h eld at 
2.4 percent in May, and the Surve y of Professional Forecasters’  median 
10-year inflation expectations for  PCE prices remained stable a t 2.1 percent in 
the second quarter.  Longer-term TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation edged lower in May.  The median of inflation expec tations 
3 years ahead reported in the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York’ s Survey of 
Consumer Expectations increas ing from 2.7 percent in March to 2 .9 percent 
in April. 
We continue to see PCE price inflation converging to 2 percent by the end of the 
medium term. 
 We now project core PCE pri ces to rise 1.6 percent in 2017, 0.1  percentage 
point lower than in the April Tealbook, and then to move up to 2.0 percent by 
2019.  Total PCE price inflation i s also expected to move up fr om 1.6 percent 
this year to 2.0 percent in 2019.  Our forecasts for core infla tion in 2018 and 
2019 are unrevised to rounding rela tive to April, while our for ecast for total 
inflation is up 0.1 percenta ge point in both years.   
 The ¼ percentage point increase in core inflation between 2016 and 2019 is 
driven by the diminishing pass-th rough from earli er declines in  energy prices 
and core import prices, along with  the further tightening of resource 
utilization.  We also continue  to assume a small pickup (5 basis points in both 
2018 and 2019) in the prevailing level of inflation expectation s relevant for 
price and wage setting.

Incoming data on labor compensation have been mixed.  We contin ue to expect 
compensation growth to pick up over the medium term as the labo r market tightens 
further. 
 After increasing at a pace of  about 2 percent in the second half of last year, the 
ECI for private workers rose a t an annual ra te of 3.2 percent i n the three 
months ending in March, somewhat more than we expected.  The pickup was 
particularly pronounced in occ upation groups and i ndustries tha t tend to be 
more affected by minimum wages, which had increased in several states in 
January; we expect ECI growt h to step down to about a 2¼ percen t pace over 
the rest of the year.  Over the  12 months ending in March, the ECI increased 
2.3 percent, up from 1.8 percent  over the preceding 12 months. 
 Average hourly earnings (AHE ) increased 2.5 percent over the 12  months 
ending in May, unchanged from the preceding 12 months.  With AH E now 
having come in below our expecta tions in four of the first five  months of this 
year, we marked down our near-term forecast modestly.  We now a nticipate 
this 12-month change will move roughly sideways at around 2½ pe rcent 
through September, nearly ½ percen tage point lower than our pre vious 
forecast. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3 .5 percent 
in April, below its recent hi ghs but noticeably above the pace seen a few 
years ago. 
 Incorporating the BEA’s large dow nward revision to compensation  in the 
fourth quarter of last year, we now  estimate that compensation per hour in the 
business sector fell 2.1 percent at an annual rate in that quar ter and rose only 
1.6 percent in 2016.  Although the BEA’s  estimates for the firs t quarter, which 
are still based on incomplete source data, imply that hourly co mpensation rose 
at a 1.7 percent annual rate, we s ee upside risk to this estima te.  The very 
weak fourth-quarter growth in c ompensation per hour may be partly due to the 
shifting of compensation that w e discussed in footnote 2; if so , when the more 
complete source data are availab le, this series could eventuall y show a sharper 
rebound in the first quarter than currently estimated.  In any event, we 
continue to project that this m easure of compensation growth wi ll pick up

over the medium term to about  3½ percent by 2019 a s the labor m arket 
tightens further. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be 
4.9 percent in the longer run, and t hat the growth rate of pote ntial GDP will be 
1.7 percent. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by the first half of 2022. 
 Real GDP growth slows to about 1½ percent in 2020 and 1¼ percen t in 2021 
as the federal funds rate is above  its neutral level.  The unem ployment rate is 
4.0 percent in 2020 and continues to r ise gradually toward its assumed natural 
rate in subsequent years. 
 PCE price inflation moves up f rom 2.0 percent in 2019 and hover s slightly 
above the Committee’s long-run objective for several years befo re moving 
back to 2 percent. 
 With output above its potential le vel and inflation a bit over the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, the nominal  federal funds rate is about 1¼  percentage 
points above its long-run valu e of 3 percent in 2021 and then m oves back 
toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
We estimate that total fo reign growth picked up to 3¼ percent at an annual rate in 
the first quar ter from 2¾ percent in the fourth.  Foreign economies have now registered 
their third consecutive quarter of above-trend growth following lackluster performance in 
the first half of last year. Incoming data have continued to surpris e us on the upside, and 
our estimate of first -quarter growth abroad is ¼ percentage point higher than in the April 
Tealbook.  The revisions have been widespread , with sizable markups in Canada, Japan, 
and Mexico, al though the United Kingdom—where growth tumbled to  below 1 percent — 
is a major exception. 
We see foreign growth moderating to its potential rate of 2½ percent by early next 
year and staying at about that pace for the remainder of the forecast period .  The 
projected deceleration in foreign activity reflects the waning  of forces that led to the 
earlier strong growth, with the expansion in Canada and Japan moving down to a more 
sustainable pace, credit stimulus in China diminishing, commodity prices leveling off 
from their increases over the past year, and the recent sharp rebound in global trade 
showing some signs of slowing.  That said, in response to strong a ctivity data in the 
foreign economies, we have revised up foreign growth slightly for the remainder of 2017, 
with the forecast unchanged thereafter . 
Risks surrounding our foreign outlook appear to be more balanced than last year.  
On the upside, the strength of recent activity  indicators from abroad —and the pattern of 
upward revisions to our foreign outlook over the past few Tealbooks—could foreshadow 
stronger momentum in the foreign economies tha n what we currently expect.  We explore 
the consequences of such an outcome in the “ Stronger Foreign Growth ” alternative 
scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
On the downside, we remain concerned  about economic and financial prospects 
for the euro area, especially in Italy, despite a decline in near-term risks following the 
French election.  Moreover, in China, stepped-up efforts to rein in credit growth, while 
positive for longer- term financial stability, raise the risk of a sharp escalation of financial 
stress in the near term. In addition, we remain mindful of the possibilit y that monetary 
policy normalization in the United State s could disrupt emerging market economies 
(EMEs). Such a risk would be heightened were developments in the U.S. economy, such 
as unexpectedly high inflation, to require faster tightening of monetary policy, a situation

we explore in the “ EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar ” alternative scenario in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section. 
Recent data suggest that inflation in the advanced foreign economies ( AFEs ) will 
moderat e to just above 1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from 2.3 percent 
in the f irst as the effects of higher energy prices fade.  AFE inflation should gradually 
pick up to 1½ percent over the forecast period , although this pickup masks divergent 
trends.  I n the euro area and Japan , inflation moves up in response to tighter resource 
pressures  but remains considerably below central banks’ target s; as such, we assume that 
monetary policy in these regions will remain highly accommodative.  In Canada, inflation 
stays close to the 2 percent target, while in the United Kingdom it falls toward 2 percent 
as the pass -through from earlier currency depreciation fades ; in both economies, we 
project that monetary authorities will start removing stimulus next year . 
We estimate that inflation in the EMEs will come in at about 3½ percent this 
quarter, unchanged from the first quarter.  Thereafter, we see inflation declining to a little 
over 3 percent by the end of this year and stabilizing at that pace .  The decline in inflation 
largely reflects a deceleration of prices in Mexico as the effects of earlier currency 
depreciation and gasoline price hikes wane.  We have seen diverse movemen ts in 
monetary policy among the EMEs, concentrated in Latin America: The central banks of 
Mexico and Argentina recently hiked their policy rates, while the central banks of Brazil, 
Chile , and Colombia eased. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Canada. Real GDP growth climbed to 3.7 percent in the first quarter from 
2.7 percent in the fourth, ¾ percentage point higher than our April Tealbook estimate. 
This step-up in growth was driven by unusually strong c onsumption, reflecting the 
recent introduction of the Canada Child Benefit program, and by the resumption of 
investment in the energy sector.   Recent indicators, such as the April manufacturing 
PMI, suggest that growth will moderate to about 2½ percent in the current quarter.  
We expect that growth , supported by accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, 
will average around 2 percent through mid-2018 and settle at its potent ial pace of 
1¾ percent thereafter. 
• Japan .  Real GDP growth picked up from 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter to 
2.2 percent in the first, almost 1 percentage point faster than estimated in the April

Tealbook.  This acceleration was driven by a pickup in household spending and a 
large swing in inventory investment.  Recent indicators, including April industrial 
production and the May manufacturing PMI , suggest that economic activity has 
continued to expand at a solid pace.  Accordingly, we now project GDP growth to 
average almost 1½ percent over the remainder of this year, up a bit from our April 
forecast and well above our estimate of potential growth of ½ percent.  Thereafter, 
growth should move down further to ¾ percent in 2018 before stalling in 2019 as a result of a legislated consumption tax hike. Given  continued monetary stimulus 
throughout the forecast period and the projected opening of a significant positive output gap, we forecast that inflation will rise from about zero in early 201 7 to 
1¼ percent in 2019 (excluding the effects of the tax hike) , still well below the 
2 percent target . 
• Euro Area .  Real GDP growth held steady at 2 percent in the first quarter.  Recent 
indicators—such as PMI s and confidence readings through May—have been 
relatively stro ng, consistent with growth rising to 2¼ percent in the current  quarter.  
We project that  growth will edge down to 1¾ percent in 2018 and 2019.  Compared 
with the April Tealbook, this forecast is ¼ percentage point stronger for 2017, 
reflecting the strength of recent data, but is unchanged thereafter . 
Data through May suggest that inflation will step down from 2.9 percent in the first 
quarter to ½ percent in the current quarter entirely as a result of a decline in food and 
energy prices .  Headline i nflation should rise to 1¼ percent in late 2017 as food and 
energy prices recover, and  edge up further to 1½ percent by 2019 as resource slack is 
slowly absorbed.  We continue to assume that the European Central Bank will purchase assets at its current monthly pace of €60 billion through the end of 2017 
before tapering in the first half of 2018.  In addition, we anticipate that the deposit rate will remain at negative 0.4 percent until early 2019 before rising to 0 percent by 
the end of the forecast period. 
• United Kingdom.  In contrast to most foreign economies , U.K. GDP growth plunged 
from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter to 0.7 percent in the first quarter , 1¼ percentage 
points below our April Tealbook projection.  This slowdown is due to a decline in 
exports after a fourth -quarter surge and to weak private consumption reflecting the 
moderation in real incomes caused by higher inflation .  Recent indicators, such as 
April retail sales and PMIs through May, suggest GDP will rise 1½ percent in the

current quarter.  Thereafter, growth should stay at about that pace through 2019, as 
uncertainty surrounding B rexit weighs on household and business spending. 
Inflation rose to 3.9 percent in the first quarter, and we expect it to moderate to 
slightly above 3 percent this quar ter as past sterling depreciation  continues to pass 
through to consumer prices.  As this boost wanes, inflation should decline to near the 
2 percent target by early 2018.  With wage growth  more subdued than previously 
expected , we now anticipate that the Bank of England will raise its policy rate in the 
fourth quarter of 2018, one quarter later than assumed  in the April Tealbook. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• Mexico. Worries that uncertaint y about U.S. trade policy will weigh on the Mexican 
economy are abating somewhat. GDP growth edged down to 2.7 percent in the first 
quarter from 2.9 percent in the fourth but was still ¾ percentage point above what we 
had in the April Tealbook.  Growth was supported by strong er-than-expected  exports 
and household demand agai nst the backdrop of the lowest unemployment rate since 
2007.  Recent indicators —including weak  manufacturing exports as well as the sales, 
production, and exports of vehicles —suggest that growth will drop further to about 
2 percent  in the current quarter.  But this projection is  nonetheless ¼ percentage point 
higher than in the April forecast , as U.S. manufacturing production looks stronger.  
We expect Mexican growth to gradually move up to 2½ percent by the end of 2018.  
Reduced  drag from fiscal consolidation, a weaker peso, and past reforms in the 
energy sector  should support growth, but be offset by tightened monetary policy. 
We see in flation  declining to 6 percent in the current quarter from nearly double- digit 
inflation in the first as the effects of past peso depreciation and a January hike in fuel 
prices start to wane .  Inflation should declin e further to near the 3 percent inflation 
target by 2018.  Responding to inflationary pressures, the Bank of Mexico rais ed the 
policy rate 25 basis points in mid -May to 6.75 percent, 375 basis points above its 
level at the start of its tightening phase in late 2015 .  We expect more rate hikes later 
this year . 
• Brazil .  GDP growth experienced a stunning turnaround from negative 2.2 percent in 
the fourth quarter to 4.3 percent in the first.  W e had anticipated a substantial pickup, 
but a surge in agricultural exports  boosted growth 1¾ percentage points above our 
April Tealbook estimate .  As exports normalize , we see Brazilian growth moderating

to ¾ percent in the curr ent quarter before gradually picking  up to about 2¼ percent by 
2019.  Lately, financial conditions in Brazil have tightened in the wake of a political 
crisis that erupted in mid -May and threatens to topple the interim government of 
President Michel Temer. These developments and the weaker incoming indicators 
for the second quarter prompted us to mark down our near- term Brazilian outlook .  
Over the longer term, our baseline forecast is unchanged and continues to assume that 
the government will impleme nt critical fiscal and structural reform s, but the recent 
political turmoil has increased uncertainty about future progress toward these reforms 
and about the economic outlook more generally. 
Amid double- digit unemployment and tight monetary policy, inflation  declined to 
4.1 percent in April on a 12-month basis, below the 4½ percent target.  This decline, 
coupled with still- weak domestic demand, led the Brazilian central bank to slash its 
policy rate 100 basis points in mid- April and another 100 basis points in late May, to 
10.25 percent.   We expect further cuts in the next few months. 
• China. After a strong first quarter, we estimate that real GDP growth will slow to 
6½ percent this quarter, slightly below our April Tealbook projection.  Infrastructure 
and property- sector investment have held up, but PMIs, exports, commodity imports, 
industrial production, and manufacturing investment all weakened  in April.  Some of 
the moderation in domestic demand likely reflects diminishing credit  stimulus, and 
we expect growth to fall further over the coming quarters amid ongoing efforts by 
Chinese authorities to tighten domestic financial conditions.  All told, we see growth 
stepping down to about 6¼ percent in the second half of this year and then slowing 
further, in line with potential growth , to 5¾ percent by 2019.  Downside risks to the 
outlook remain, including the possibility of a sharp adjustment in the property market, 
a run on the financial system, or renewed capital outflows leading to sharp moves in 
the exchange rate.  
Headline consumer price inflation fell to negative 0.6 percent in the first quarter on 
falling food prices.  We see inflation increasing to 2½ percent in the current quarter as 
food price inflation stabilizes  and staying about there over the for ecast period .   
• Other Emerging Asia. Strong export growth throughout much of the region, together 
with a rebound in India as the negative effects of its demonetization policy abate d, 
boosted growth in other emerging Asia to 4.4 percent in the first quarter, from 
3.5 percent in the fourth.  We see the robust export growth that  has supported the

region’s strong performance moderating some of late .  Two important drivers of 
Asian exports have been Chinese demand for the region’s products and strong 
performanc e in the high- tech sector. Most recent indicators for regional exports, 
Chinese imports, and high tech appear to have cooled somewhat.  As such, we see 
growth in other emerging Asia edging down over the next few quarters and settling at 
around 3½ percent by early next year.

Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, pric es of risky assets were littl e changed, on net, 
while Treasury yields declined a nd the dollar depreciated modes tly.  Investors perceived 
FOMC communications as broadly in line with expectations and in coming economic data 
as slightly weaker than expecte d on balance.  Confidence in the  Administration’s ability 
to advance its economic agenda appeared to wane somewhat furthe r, while market 
participants’ perceptions of an improved global economic outloo k reportedly provided 
some support to investor risk sentiment. 
 FOMC communications were characterized as about in line with ex pectations, 
with investors noting that the Committee did not seem to have m aterially 
changed its view of the economic outlook.  However, the May FOM C minutes 
were generally seen as having provided a bit more clarity on the Committee’s 
plan to reduce reinvestments this year. 
 Based on a straight read of mark et quotes, the probability of a  rate hike at the 
June meeting increased, on net , from 65 percent to 90 percent, while the 
implied risk-neutral probabilit y of at least one more rate hike  this year, 
conditional on a rate hike in June, declined from 58 percent to 44 percent.  
Market-based expectations of the level of the federal funds rat e from early 
2018 through the end of 2020 edged down a bit. 
 Yields on intermediate- and longe r-dated nominal Treasury secur ities 
declined, on net, posting modest r eactions to domestic economic  data releases 
and U.S. political headlines.  TIPS- based inflation compensatio n declined 
somewhat in the context of w eak inflation data, while implied v olatility on 
Treasury yields remained subdued.   
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged up, on balance, as percep tions of an 
improved global outlook and posit ive news on corporate earnings appeared to 
roughly offset reduced confidence in the Administration’s abili ty to push 
forward its economic and regulatory reforms.  Near-term option- implied stock 
price volatility remained near multidecade low levels.  Corpora te bond 
spreads were little changed on net.

 Foreign market developments were generally positive, boosted by  mildly 
improved sentiment following the  French election and foreign da ta that mostly 
surprised on the upside.  Globall y, equity prices generally rose, most euro-area 
sovereign bond spreads declined m odestly, and capital flows to emerging 
market economies (EMEs) conti nued.  The notable exception was B razil, 
where local political developm ents weighed on domestic financia l markets.  
The broad dollar index decline d about 1¼ percent, mainly driven  by its 
depreciation against AFE currencies. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Domestic Developments 
FOMC communications over the in termeeting period were viewed as  broadly in 
line with investors’ expectati ons that the Committee would cont inue to remove policy 
accommodation at a gradual pace.  Market participants interpret ed both the Committee’s 
assessment in the May FOMC statement that the slowdown of growt h in the first quarter 
was “likely to be transitory” and the phrase in the May FOMC mi nutes that “most 
participants viewed the recent softer inflation data as primari ly reflecting transitory 
factors” as indicating that the Committee had not materially changed its economic 
outlook.  In addition, market participants generally viewed the  discussion in the minutes 
on reducing reinvestments as mitigating the risk that the proce ss of reducing the size of 
the balance sheet would lead to ou tsized movements in interest rates or adverse effects on 
market functioning.  Market report s also highlighted the minute s discussion noting that 
nearly all meeting participant s were in favor of a proposed ope rational plan to gradually 
increase the caps on the dollar amounts of Treasury and agency securities that would run 
off each month, with such a plan commencing sometime this year as long as the economy 
and the path of the federal funds  rate evolved as currently exp ected.  Partly in reaction to 
the minutes, a number of market  participants r eportedly pulled forward their expectations 
for the most likely timing of a change to the Committee’s reinv estment policy. 
The probability of a rate hike occurring at the June meeting—as  implied by a 
straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts and without adjusting for term 
premiums—rose to 90 percent from 65 percent prior to the May me eting, while the 
implied probability of at least one  more rate hike later this year, conditional on a rate hike 
in June, declined from 58 percent to 44 percent.  The expected path of the federal funds 
rate from 2018 to the end of 2020, as implied by both a straigh t read from OIS quotes and

a staff model that adjusts for term premiums, declined a bit ov er the intermeeting period, 
in part because of the release of  the May employment situation report. 
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened somewhat, on net, ov er the 
intermeeting period, with the 2-ye ar Treasury yield being little changed and the 10-year 
yield declining 14 basis points.  Following the May FOMC meetin g, intermediate- and 
longer-dated nominal Treasury yiel ds moved up as market partici pants highlighted the 
passage in the statement that t he slowdown in growth during the  first quarter was likely 
to be transitory.  Subsequently, t hose increases more than reve rsed in the remainder of the 
intermeeting period, as yields decl ined in reaction to the weak er-than-expected April CPI, 
U.S. political headlines in mid-May that were interpreted as li kely impeding the 
Administration’s ability to advance its economic policy agenda,  and the somewhat 
weaker-than-expected May employm ent situation report.  Option-implied volatility on 
10-year swap rates briefly jum ped up following the political he adlines in mid-May but 
subsequently fell back to near t he low end of its multiyear range. 
The 5-year measure of TIPS-base d inflation compensation edged d own 5 basis 
points, with the decline mostly attributable to the lower-than- expected April CPI print, 
while the 5-to-10-year forward measure decreased 11 basis point s.  Spreads of agency 
MBS over comparable-maturity Tre asury securities tightened a to uch in reaction to the 
reinvestments discussion i n the May FOMC minutes. 
Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged up, on net, since the May  FOMC meeting, 
reflecting two offsetting for ces.  On the one hand, the improve d global outlook may have 
increased optimism that corporate earnings would continue to st rengthen.  Indeed, stock 
prices of firms with high interna tional sales exposure outperfo rmed those of firms with 
low exposure.  On the other hand, investor confidence in the Ad ministration’s ability to 
advance its economic and regulatory reforms appeared to decline  further, as stock prices 
of firms with high effective tax rates—which would benefit the most from corporate tax 
cuts—underperformed broader equity indexes.   
One-month option-implied volatil ity on the S&P 500 index—the VI X—was about 
unchanged, on net, and stands near t he bottom of its historical distribution.  Political 
headlines on May 17 led to a dec line of 1¾ percent in the S&P 5 00 index on that day and 
a brief spike in the VIX that quickly retraced.  The box “Drivers of Recent Movements of 
Implied Volatility” investigates the role of policy uncertainty  and other factors in the low 
level of option-implied equity m arket volatility in recent mont hs.

Drivers of Recent Movements of Implied Volatility 
Recent market commentary has been attentive to the historically low levels of option -implied equity 
market volatility as measured by the VIX.  To some, the low VIX has been puzzling in light of the 
heightened uncertainty about U.S. economic policy; indeed, it has been conjectured that the low 
levels of the VIX may be driven in part by a recent proliferation of investment strategies involving 
the selling of options.  We show that low implied volatility largely reflects low actual market price 
volatility, which historically is more closely connected to perceived downside risks to near -term 
economic growth than to popular measures of economic policy uncertainty. Nonetheless, we 
cannot entirely account for the recent extraordinarily low readings on actual market volatility . 
Volatility over the next 30 days implied by S&P 500 index options is close to the 5th percentile of its 
historical distribution (red line, figure 1) .1 However, the same can be said for actual volatility , the 
blue line, measured as an exponentially weighted average of past intraday returns. To understand 
the recent low level of the VIX, it is helpful to dissect it into the sum of expected near- term volatility , 
the black line, and an insurance premium against market moves in either direction, known as the 
variance risk premium, show n in figure 2.2 Although the variance risk premium is in the bottom 
quartile of its historical distribution, it has been fairly stable since 2012 and does not appear to be a 
major driver of recent very low VIX levels. This observation suggests that the c urrent low level of 
the VIX is significantly driven by expected volatility, while potential drivers such as changes in 
investment strategies among certain participants in the equity options market —which would work 
through the variance risk premium —are likely less important. 
As shown in figure 1, expected volatility and actual volatility are tightly linked, so to better 
understand movements in the VIX, the remainder of the analysis focuses on two potential drivers of 
recent actual volatility : a measure that reflects economic policy uncertainty (the Baker- Bloom -Davis 
index) and a measure that reflects perceived downside risks to economic fundamentals (the one-
quarter- ahead recession probability derived from the Survey of Professional Forecasters). Figure 3 
shows both measures. While the policy uncertainty index is well above its long -run median, the 
recession probability is closer to the lower end of its range. Policy uncertainty and recession risks 
tend to be highly correlated around recessions but are less correlated when the economy 
is expanding. 
To evaluate the relative importance of these measures for explaining volatility, we estimate 
quarterly regressions of actual volatility on the two measures , both jointly and individually. Jointly, 
both measures explain 33 percent of the variation in actual volatility. Individually, recession 
probability explains 29 percent of the variation , whereas economic policy uncertainty by itself 
explains only 16 percent. This finding suggests that, over the full sample, economic policy 
uncertainty adds little explanatory power once we account for recession risk. 
Thus, while economic policy uncertainty has increased of late, we should not be too surprised that it 
has not led to a marked increase in actual volatility or the VIX .  However, the question of why actual 
volatility is at its lowest level since the early 1990s cannot be fully explained by the level of 
recession risk.  
1 Although this analysis focuses on the VIX, conclusions hold for longer -dated i mplied v olatility estimates, which 
are also hovering at or near post -crisis lows. 
2 The decomposition of the VIX i nto the expectations and premium components was provided by FRB NY staff.

In the corporate bond market, spr eads of yields on investment- and speculative-
grade nonfinancial corporate bonds o ver those on comparable-mat urity Treasury 
securities were little changed, on net, and remained below the medians of their respective 
historical distributions. 
Foreign Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, forei gn financial markets were su pported by 
generally positive economic data releases abroad, the reduction  of political risk in 
Europe, and robust first-quarter  earnings reports in a number of countries.  By contrast, 
political developments in the Un ited States appeared at times t o weigh on global market 
sentiment.  
The broad U.S. dollar depreciate d about 1¼ percent, mostly refl ecting weakness 
against AFE currencies.  In particular, the euro was buoyed by the outcome of the second 
round of the French presidential  election on May 7 and stronger-than-expected euro-area 
macroeconomic data releases.  U.S. developments, including political uncertainty and 
mixed data reports, also weighed on the dollar.  The Brazilian real fell about 3 percent 
against the dollar amid adverse local political developments.  
Most AFE 10-year sovereign yields were slightly down over the i ntermeeting 
period.  Spreads of most euro-ar ea sovereign bonds over those o f comparable-maturity 
German bunds narrowed slightl y, largely on diminished perceptio ns of downside political 
and economic risks.  Late in the  period, Italian spreads edged up on the possibility of an 
early general election, leaving them little changed since the t ime of the May FOMC 
meeting.  
Equity prices rose in most advanced economies.  EME equity inde xes increased 
slightly, on balance, although Brazilian stocks took a sizable hit after the emergence of 
new corruption allegations against President Temer.  EME sovereign bond spreads were 
little changed, while flows into E ME mutual funds remained robu st.   
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
Conditions in domestic short-term  funding markets remained stab le over the 
intermeeting period.  The effective federal funds rate held ste ady at 91 basis points, 
closely tracked by the overnight Eurodollar rate.  Term unsecured funding rates, such as 
yields on three-month commercial  paper and Eurodollar deposits,  also remained roughly

 The Recent Decline in the LIBOR −OIS Spread  
Since February , the spread between the three- month LIBOR (London interbank 
offered rate) and the OIS (the overnight index swap) has narrowed notably and now 
stands at 11  basis points, near its average from 2013 to 2015, as shown in figure 1.  
Short -term f unding pressures, which intensified in the summer of 2016 as money 
market fund (MMF) reforms were causing  prime MMFs to shrink, appear to have 
abated  as banks acquired new funding sources for their commercial paper (CP)  and 
negotiable certificates of d eposit ( CDs) as well as additional funding via other types of 
instruments .1 
In the year leading up to the October 2016 implementation deadline for these reforms , 
prime MMFs greatly reduced their unsecured lending to banks  through CP , CDs, and 
Eurodollar deposits .  This reduction in the supply of funds  was widely cited as driving 
up bank unsecured term funding costs.  T he spread between three- month LIBOR —
which closely tracks CD and CP rates —and OIS increased from about 15 basis points 
to a bit above 40 basis points over this period , as banks offered higher rates to 
attract  funding .2 
Temporarily higher yields attracted additional demand from money market investors and allowed banks to replace part of the funding lost from MMFs.  To be sure, total CP 
and CDs outstanding have declined about $300 billion since early 2015, but the decline 
has not been as steep as the $700 billion drop in MMF holdings, as shown in f igure 2.   
 
                                                 
1 The refor m imposed floating net asset values, or NAVs, for institutional prime funds and 
municipal funds and permits liquidity fees and redemption gates for all nongovernment funds.  
2 The significant movements in the LIBOR −OIS spread over the past year do  not appear to have 
been driven by perceptions of changing bank credit quality.  Moreover, despite concerns over 
LIBOR’s calculation methodology, its co- movement with CP and CD rates suggests that LIBOR 
remains a useful measure of banks’ unsecured borrowin g costs.  LIBOR also serves as a reference 
rate for trillions of dollars in adjustable -rate loans and interest rate derivatives.

Available data on investors in CP and CDs outside of MMFs are very limited.  M arket 
participants suggest  that  the sources of new demand for money market  instruments 
have included bond funds  and nonfinancial corporations.  MMF substitutes, such as  
private liquidity funds and offshore money market funds , do not appear to have 
substantially  increased their holdings of CP and CD s.   
Short -term funding pressures have also been alleviated as banks that had previously 
relied on prime MMFs for funding  replaced  some CP and CD issuance  with other 
instruments.  I n particular, banks have raised funds through repos, advances from 
Federal Home Loan Banks, issuanc e of dollar- denominated bonds  and shorter- term  
debt, and growth in deposits  other than CDs , as shown in figure 3 .

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
On the whole, financing conditi ons for nonfinancial businesses and households 
continued to be supportive of ec onomic activity over the interm eeting period.  However, 
the growth of core loans at ba nks has stepped down this year, r eflecting both weaker 
demand for business loans and tig hter credit standards for cons umer loans.  In addition, 
the expansion of total consumer credit has continued to moderat e, and the growth of 
residential mortgage lending slo wed a bit in the first quarter,  though it remained near the 
high end of its recent range.  C orporate bond issuance has generally been strong.    
 Financing conditions for large nonfinancial firms remained soli d.  Banks’ 
commercial and industrial (C&I) loans bounced back in April and  May after 
declining in the first quarter, though the pace seen in May rem ained below 
that of a year ago.  Gross bond issu ance strengthened significantly in May 
after a typical season al slowdown in April. 
 Credit continued to be generally a vailable for small businesses, though 
demand has remained subdued.  Lenders to small businesses noted that 
delinquency rates have continue d to edge up from historically l ow levels, but 
credit standards for small business loans have reportedly remai ned unchanged.   
 The expansion of banks’ consumer loans continued to ebb in Apri l and May, 
and growth of overall consumer credit has continued to moderate  in recent 
months.  Delinquency rates on subpr ime credit card and auto loa ns have 
drifted up from low levels, and we have seen some signs of tightening credit 
standards in these markets.    
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Financing conditions for large nonf inancial firms remained acco mmodative over 
the intermeeting period.  Corpor ate bond issuance rebounded considerably in May after a 
slowdown in April that was typica l for a month in the middle of  a corporate earnings-
reporting season.  Gross issuance of  institutional leveraged lo ans remained strong in 
April and May, although it receded from the near-record levels seen over the prior two 
months.

C&I loans picked up in April and May after a weak first quarter , though their 
growth rate has remained well below the strong pace seen a year  ago.  As we described in 
the April Tealbook, in the Senior  Loan Officer Opinion Survey banks reported a broad-
based decline in demand for C&I  loans in the f irst quarter. 
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained solid on a verage.  Share 
repurchases in the fourth qua rter of 2016 and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the first 
quarter of this year remained r obust overall, albeit somewhat b elow the very strong 
average pace seen in recent ye ars.  Announcements of new share repurchase programs 
and M&A activity continue d their downward trend, possibly signaling low er future debt 
issuance. 
The credit performance of nonfinan cial corporations remained st able.  Balance 
sheet leverage indicators tic ked down a bit in the fourth quart er but remained close to the 
historically high levels seen over the past 20 years.  While de fault rates were little 
changed in April, bond rating downgrades outpaced upgrades in b oth number and volume 
in May, indicating a slight deterioration i n credit quality.  
With reports in hand for almost all S&P 500 firms, aggregate corporate earnings 
in the first quarter are estimated to have remained near the le vel seen in the fourth quarter 
on a seasonally adjusted basis, s ignificantly above their year- ago level.  Wall Street 
analysts again revised up their  projections for year-ahead earn ings for S&P 500 firms 
through mid-May. 
Small Businesses 
Overall, the demand for credit from small businesses remained t epid, while the 
supply of credit generally conti nued to appear accommodative.  Small business loan 
originations held steady in March and were close to the volume of a year ago.  Survey 
data suggest that credit supply remained stable, with nearly 40  percent of respondents 
from the April release of the qua rterly Wells Fargo/Gallup Smal l Business Index survey 
reporting that it was “somewhat  or very easy” to obtain credit over the past 12 months, 
one of the highest such readi ngs since 2008.  While lenders noted that loan delinquency 
rates have continued to edge up fro m historically low levels, c redit standards for small 
business loans have reportedl y remained unchanged.  The April s urvey also indicated that 
optimism among small business owners edged down but remained in  an elevated range.

Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions in commercial real estate (CRE) markets re mained 
accommodative.  CRE loans on banks’ books continued to grow rob ustly in April, with 
nonfarm nonresidential loans l eading the expansion this year.  However, the average 
growth rate over April and May is a bit lower tha n that during the first quarter, reflecting 
in part a slowdown in both constr uction and multifamily lending .  Commercial mortgage-
backed securities (CMBS) issuan ce through the first five months of the year has been 
similar to the issuance over the first five months of 2016.  While delinquency rates on 
CRE loans at banks continued to t ick down in the first quarter,  the delinquency rate on 
loans in CMBS pools continued to increase.  The rise in the CMBS delinquency rate is 
mostly confined to loans that were originated during the period  of weak underwriting 
prior to the crisis.  These deli nquencies have generally been e xpected by market 
participants and are no t anticipated to have a  material effect on credit availability or 
market conditions.  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on 
balance, and were mostly unaff ected by the initiation of Puerto  Rico’s bankruptcy 
process.1  Gross issuance of municipal  bonds remained solid in May.  On net, the number 
and dollar volume of credit rating downgrades outpaced the numb er of upgrades, possibly 
signaling a slight deterioration i n the credit quality of state and local governments. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remaine d generally 
accommodative over the intermeeting period.  Mortgage rates dec lined slightly, in line 
with longer-term Treasury and mortg age-backed securities (MBS) yields, but remained 
elevated relative to the thi rd quarter of 2016.  Despite the higher level of mortgage rates, 
first-quarter growth in total residential mortgage lending rema ined near the high end of 
its recent range.  Delinquency rates on mortgage loans continue d to edge down, amid 
1 On May 3, Puerto Rico entered a court-supervised bankruptcy pr ocess after it failed to reach an 
agreement to restructure its deb t by the May 1 deadline.  This event had a limited effect on Puerto Rico’s 
bond prices and no no ticeable effect on broa der municipal marke ts.

robust house price growth and still -tight lending standards for households with lower 
credit scores and harder-to-document incomes.   
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained genera lly 
accommodative; however, some indicators point to reductions in credit availability in 
recent months.  The tighter conditions are especially apparent within the subprime 
segment, where there has been s ome further deterioration of cre dit performance.  
Credit card balances continued to grow in March at a robust year-over-year rate, 
though the pace moderated a bit from 2016.  Outstanding credit card balances among 
prime borrowers continued to grow apace with prior years, despite an upward drift in 
interest rates, and delinquencies  remained low by historical st andards.  However, the 
growth of credit card balances among subprime borrowers slowed somewhat, and 
delinquency rates for this group ha ve continued to increase.   
Year-over-year growth in auto l oans remained solid through the first quarter.  
Overall delinquency rates on auto loans continued to be relativ ely low, but the 
delinquency rate among subprime  borrowers remained elevated, reflecting easier lending 
standards in 2015 and 2016.  Recent evidence suggests that thes e standards have 
tightened; for example, the cre dit rating of the average car bo rrower has trended up, and 
new extensions of subprime auto loans have declined.  We expect  that tighter auto 
lending conditions will lead to improved loan performance among subprime borrowers.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of econ omic activity as 
being about in line, on balance, with the average over the past  20 years (the benchmark 
used by the FOMC).  Several facto rs point to less -than-average uncertainty.  Many 
empirical indicators of uncer tainty are subdued, including opti ons-based indexes of 
expected stock market volatilit y (such as the VIX) and corporat e bond spreads.  In 
addition, we see the uncertainty associated wit h the foreign outlook as having subsided 
further since late last year, pa rticularly with the outcome of the French elections.  
However, other considerations po int to greater-th an-average uncertainty.  For example, 
we think that somewhat greater uncertainty continues to prevail  about the future direction 
of federal government policies tha n before the recent U.S. elections.  That uncertainty is 
reflected in the Baker, Bloom, and Davis index of economic poli cy uncertainty, which 
remains at a higher level, on ave rage, than in the two years before the elections. 
We now judge the risks to our med ium-term GDP projection as balanced.  In 
previous Tealbooks, we consider ed the risk of monetary policy h aving to return to the 
effective lower bound (ELB) as tilting the risks to our economi c outlook somewhat to the 
downside.  However, based on stochastic simulations in the FRB/ US model around the 
current baseline forecast, we es timate that the probability of returning to the ELB 
sometime over the next three years has declined to 23 percent, which is below the 
threshold level of 25 percent that  we proposed in the April Tea lbook for removing the 
downside skew associated with ELB risk.1  We see the risks around our projection for the 
unemployment rate as aligned with  those for GDP and, therefore, as also balanced. 
With regard to inflation, we con tinue to see the current level of uncertainty as in 
line with the average over the pa st 20 years and the risks to the downside and upside as 
roughly balanced.  To the downside, the Michigan survey measure  of longer-run inflation 
expectations remains very low , although other survey-based indi cators of longer-run 
inflation expectations ha ve not moved down.  In addition, U.S. monetary policy 
normalization could generate a gr eater appreciation of the doll ar than we have anticipated 
1 The methodology for calculating this probability was described  in the box “A Guidepost for 
Dropping Effective Lower Bound Risk from the Assessment of Risk s” in the April Tealbook.  See the 
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate” for our current a nd projected estimates of this probability.

in the baseline forecast.  To the upside, with the economy proj ected to be operating above 
its long-run potential, inflation m ay increase more than in the  staff forecast, consistent 
with the predictions of models t hat emphasize nonlinear effects  of economic slack on 
inflation. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario illustrates the 
possible economic consequen ces of a broad policy disappointment in which consumer, 
business, and investor expectati ons deteriorate markedly as the  anticipated fiscal 
expansion and reduction in regulatory burdens do not materializ e.  The second scenario 
assumes that economic activity i s stronger than in the baseline ; in addition, inflation is 
assumed to be more sensitive to tighter resource utilization.  In the third scenario, we 
explore the implications of a lo wer natural rate of unemploymen t than in the baseline, 
with only gradual recognition by policymakers and the staff abo ut the true level of the 
natural rate.  The fourth scenario presents outcomes associated  with a situation in which 
long-term interest rates do not r espond to the increases in the  federal funds rate that are 
assumed in the baseline—a phenomenon reminiscent of the “Greens pan conundrum” 
seen in the mid-2000s.  In the fif th scenario, we consider the possibility that faster U.S. 
policy normalization, prompte d by a pickup in inflation, leads to financial turbulence in 
vulnerable emerging market econom ies and a stronger appreciatio n of the dollar.  The 
sixth and last scenario analyzes the effect on U.S. macroeconom ic performance of 
stronger foreign growth.   
We simulate these scenarios using three staff models.2  In all but two scenarios, 
the federal funds rate is govern ed by the same rule as in the b aseline.  One exception is 
the Broad Policy Disappointment sc enario, in which we assume an  alternative adjustment 
to the intercept in the baselin e rule.  The other exception is the EME Turbulence and 
Stronger Dollar scenario, where w e assume that the unexpected i ncrease in U.S. inflation 
in the second half of this year t riggers a temporarily larger response of the federal funds 
rate than implied by the baseli ne rule, although such a respons e is later unwound as 
2 The models used are FRB/US, which  is a large-scale macroeconom etric model of the U.S.

financial conditions in EMEs tighten.  The size and composition  of the SOMA portfolio 
are assumed to follow the baseli ne paths in all of the scenarios. 
Broad Policy Disap pointment (FRB/US) 
In this scenario, we assume tha t the federal government fails t o implement the 
fiscal expansion that is i ncorporated in the baseline.3  In addition, other policy changes 
that financial market particip ants may have priced into current  asset values, such as an 
easing of regulatory burdens, fail to materialize.4  Moreover, this scenario assumes that 
the staff has not fully appreci ated the positive effects of more buoyant consumer and 
business sentiment on spending i n the baseline projection.  Con sequently, in addition to 
the direct, conventi onal restraint  on aggregate demand stemming  from the fact that the 
fiscal expansion does not material ize, economic activity is als o curtailed by an erosion in 
consumer sentiment and an incr ease in perceived risk by busines ses and financial 
markets.  In particular, the triple-B corporate bond spread ris es about 40 basis points 
above the baseline in 2018, and e quity prices fall almost 10 percent from peak to trough.5 
As a result, real GDP growth slows to about 1 percent in 2018, roughly 
1 percentage point less than in the baseline.  By the end of 20 22, the unemployment rate 
has risen about ½ percentage point  from its level at the end of 2017 to 4.7 percent—just 
below the staff’s assumption for the natural rate and ¼ percentage point higher than in the 
baseline.  With labor market re sources less tight and inflation  modestly lower than in the 
baseline, the federal funds rate rises more gradually and is ju st over 3 percent at the end 
of 2022, about 1 percentage point b elow the baseline rate.6 
3 In this scenario, we unwind the adjustments to the rule for se tting the federal funds rate and to 
the long-term interest rate term premium that were made in the baseline projection to account for the 
assumed fiscal expansion.
4 To be clear, in both the baselin e and the alternative simulati on, regulatory relief is assumed to 
not affect the economy directly but rather indirectly through i ts effects on sentiment and asset values.
5 In this scenario, equity values decline gradually  over the cou rse of several quarters next year.  
The results shown here are little c hanged if, instead, the decl ine in stock prices occur s immediately in the 
first quarter of 2018. 
6 Without the change in sentiment and equity prices, the failure  to implement the fiscal expansion 
alone would imply that real GDP growth is 0.3 percentage point lower than in the baseline in 2018 and is 
almost the same as in the base line in 2019, while the unemploym ent rate is about 0.2  percentage point 
higher at the end of 2019.  In addition, inflation would be a t ouch lower than in the baseline.  These 
developments, together with the adjustment to the rule for sett ing the federal funds rate, would result in a 
federal funds rate that is ½ percentage point below the baselin e at the end of 2020.

Stronger Aggregate Demand and Higher Inflation (EDO) 
Incoming readings on labor market conditions show continued improvement, and 
several surveys of consumer sentiment and business activity hav e remained upbeat in 
recent months.  Furthermore, while business investment was weak  over the previous two 
years, data for this year so f ar show investment to have picked  up considerably. 
Motivated by these positive develo pments, this scenario assumes  faster consumer and 
business spending than in the ba seline, with growth in resident ial investment also well 
above the moderate pace shown in the staff forecast.7  Moreover, consistent with the view 
that the Phillips curve could be steeper at higher rates of res ource utilization than when 
economic activity is relatively w eak, we postulate that inflati on and wages become more 
sensitive to tighter resource utilization than in the standard version of the EDO model.8 
Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second hal f of 2017, 
compared with a 3 percent pace in the baseline.  The unemployment rate falls more 
rapidly, bottoming out at 3½ pe rcent in 2018 and 2019 and remai ning lower than in the 
baseline for some time thereaf ter.  With resour ce utilization running tighter and the 
Phillips curve assumed to be steep er than in the standard versi on of the model, inflation 
moves above 2 percent in the s econd half of 2017 and rises to about 2½ percent by 2020.9 
The federal funds rate reach es 4½ percent at the end of 2019 an d peaks slightly above 
5 percent in 2021.  Given enough time , this path for the federa l funds rate would 
eventually drive the unemployment rate up to its assumed natura l rate and bring inflation 
back down to 2 percent.  The unemployment rate does not need to exceed the natural rate in order to bring inf lation back down—simply returning to the n atural rate is enough— 
because longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored throughout this scenario. 
7 In the staff forecast, residenti al investment ave rages 4 perce nt per year between 2017 and 2019. 
In this scenario, we calibrate t he composition of aggregate dem and so that residential investment instead 
grows around 6½ percent per year. 
8 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth a nd slack, see, for example, 
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet?   Assessing Progress toward Full 
Employment and Price Stability,”  Economic Letter, vol. 9 (13) ( Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, 
October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documen ts/research/eclett/2014/el1413. pdf.  The greater sensitivity of 
price inflation assumed here is consistent with the estimates o f some other DSGE models, such as Frank 
Smets and Rafael Wouters (2007), “Shocks and Frictions in U.S. Business Cycles:  A Bayesian DSGE 
Approach,” American Economic Review,  vol. 97 (June), pp. 586 606. 
9 The larger rise in inflation depends importantly on the substantially smaller adjustment costs for 
wages and prices in this scenario; the smaller costs lead to a steeper Phillips curve .  Had we used our 
standard coefficients in the wage and price equations, inflatio n would have been only about 2 percent in 
2022, as in the baseline.

Lower Natural Rate o f Unemployment with Mi sperception (FRB/US) 
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate wi ll fall to about 
3¾ percent by the end of 2019, around 1 percentage point below the staff’s baseline 
estimate of the natural rate of  unemployment.  However, the nat ural rate is estimated with 
considerable uncertainty and coul d be lower than the staff’s es timate of 4.9 percent.  In 
this scenario, we assume that th e natural rate of unemployment has been 4 percent for the 
past few years and remains at th at level in the future.  Given the difficulties associated 
with ascertaining the level of t he natural rate, we also assume that policymakers’ and the 
staff’s perceptions of the natura l rate converge to the true na tural rate only gradually over 
time.  Hence, the gap between the  actual and perceived natural rate is not fully eliminated 
until the end of 2022. 
Because policymakers do not fully recognize the lower natural r ate—and the 
correspondingly higher level of pot ential—until several years i nto the simulation, they 
perceive a lower path of the unemployment rate as implying a mo re positive output gap 
than in the baseline, providing a n incentive to raise the feder al funds rate, all else being 
equal.  As events unfold in this scenario, the initially slight ly tighter stance of policy 
holds real GDP growth close to th e baseline for some time.  As policymakers’ and the 
staff’s estimates of the natural  rate of unemployment converge to the truth, GDP growth 
rises a touch above the sta ff forecast by the end of 2022, while the unemployment rate is 
¾ percentage point below.  Inflatio n falls a shade below the Te albook projection by the 
end of 2022.  As the higher level of  potential becomes apparent to policymakers and the 
staff, they recognize that resour ce utilization is less tight t han they had previously 
perceived; as a result, and wit h the lower path for inflation, the federal funds rate drops 
below the baseline by the end of 2021. 
A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum (FRB/US) 
The Committee has raised the fed eral funds rate three times fol lowing the period 
of near-zero rates.  However, according to several measures of term premiums on longer-
term Treasury yields, the rate in creases occurred in conjunctio n with ongoing declines in 
those premiums; indeed, followi ng the initial rise from the ELB , 10-year Treasury yields 
dropped for three quarters.  The a bsence of a clear imprint from monetary tightening on

long-term yields is reminiscent  of what is ofte n referred to as the “Greenspan 
conundrum” seen in the early 2000s.10 
This scenario simulates the macroeconomic consequences of such a disconnect 
between the policy rate and longe r-term interest rates.  Consis tent with the original 
Greenspan conundrum period, we ke ep long-term rates fixed over the next six quarters at 
their levels as of the third quarter of thi s year, reflecting a  movement in term premiums 
that is not attributable to hei ghtened pessimism about the econ omic outlook on the part of 
market participants.  The short-te rm federal funds  rate continu es to evolve according to 
the prescriptions of the basel ine policy rule.  Starting in the first quarter of 2019, the 
conundrum slowly unwinds, and the  link between short- and long-term rates is fully 
restored by the end of the simulation period. 
In this scenario, lower long-te rm rates boost asset prices and spur consumption 
and investment spending.  As a re sult, real GDP growth reaches 2¾ percent in 2018, 
about ½ percentage point above t he baseline.  With a more buoya nt economy, the 
trajectory for the unemployment ra te is substantially below the staff forecast, reaching a 
low of 3 percent in 2020; given th e flatness of the model’s wag e and price Phillips 
curves, inflation moves only marginally above the baseline.  By  the end of 2019, 
consistent with output being well above potential, the federal funds rate increases to 
almost 4¼ percent, more than ½ perc entage point higher than in the Tealbook projection.  
As the conundrum unwinds and long r ates start to rise along wit h the short rate, GDP 
growth slows and the unemployment  rate moves back toward the baseline, though it 
remains about ½ percentage point lower in 2022.  
EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar (SIGMA) 
In our baseline, we see the e ffects of U.S. policy normalizatio n as likely to be 
manageable for most foreign economies, even while assuming that the federal funds rate 
rises somewhat faster than markets appear to envision.  However, a significant risk 
remains that U.S. policy normali zation could generate substanti al adverse spillovers 
abroad, especially if it proceeds much more quickly than in the  baseline and is driven 
mainly by concerns about U.S. inf lation rather than by faster U .S. economic growth.    
10 This risk was previou sly discussed in a box  and an alternative  scenario in the September 2016 
Tealbook, both titled “A Return to the Greenspan Conundrum.”

This scenario considers the possi bility that modestly higher-th an-expected U.S. 
inflation in the second half of t his year induces the FOMC to remove policy 
accommodation noticeably faster th an in the baseline, with the federal funds rate rising to 
2 percent by the end of this year .  These developments lead to rising interest rates in the 
EMEs.  Tighter financial condi tions weigh on activity in the EM Es and progressively turn 
investor attention to underlying E ME vulnerabilities, including  high corporate leverage.  
By early next year, EMEs experien ce large capital outflows and sizable depreciations of 
their currencies amidst an ongoi ng flight from EME assets.  The  turbulence in the EMEs 
has adverse financial spillove rs to both the United States and the rest of the global 
economy.  All told, foreign GDP growth runs, on average, 1 perc entage point below the 
baseline in 2018 and 2019, while flight-to-safety flows cause t he broad real dollar to 
appreciate 10 percent. 
The stronger dollar and weaker  foreign growth depress U.S. real  net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP grow th moderates to about 1½ percen t in 2018 and 
1¼ percent in 2019, ½ percentage poin t less than in the baseline.  Lower import prices 
and weaker economic activity cau se core PCE inflation to run, o n average, at 1½ percent 
in 2018 and 2019.  After EME financial conditions begin deterio rating sharply in early 
2018, the federal funds rate follows  a considerably shallower path than in the baseline, 
reaching only 3 percent by the end of 2019. 
Stronger Foreign G rowth (SIGMA) 
In our baseline forecast, we expect foreign output to expand at  a moderate pace 
and inflation to slowly edge closer to central bank targets, as  headwinds facing the 
foreign economies gradually diminish.  However, survey and acti vity indicators have 
come in somewhat stronger than expected in recent months, and t he expansion abroad 
may prove faster, especially if accommodative policies become m ore effective in the 
context of ongoing balance sheet repair and improvements in con sumer and business 
confidence. In this scenario w e assume that foreign GDP growth  rises to about 
3¼ percent in 2017 and 2018, ½ percentage point higher per year than in our baseline 
projection.  Increased optimism about the foreign outlook, including the perception of 
diminished tail risks, causes the broad real dollar to deprecia te 8 percent by the end 
of 2019.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or 1980 through 2014, yielding 
percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors for 1998 through 2014 were used.  Thi s shorter range reflects both more limited data on staff 
forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment that the dist ribution of inflation since the mid-
1990s is more appropriate for the projection period than distributions of inflation reaching further back.  In all cases, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile bands of the 
errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompass 70 percent prediction-interval ranges; adding 
the green bands expands this range  to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the 
prediction intervals.  There is not enough historical forecast data to calculate meaningful 
90 percent ranges for the two inflation series.  A median line above the staff forecast means that 
forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies 
In this section , we consider a selection of strategies for setting  the federal funds 
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with 
those in the Tealbook baseline.  The prescriptions of simple rules are generally a little 
higher than those in the April  Tealbook because the staff raised the baseline path for the 
output gap.  The optimal control policy rate paths are al so somewhat higher than those in 
the April  Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s projection of a s omewhat larger undershooting 
of the natural rate of unemployment in coming years alongside no material change in the 
staff’s  projection for inflation.  All of the simple rules and all but one optimal control 
exercise p rescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate over the next few years 
than assumed in the staff forecast.  In a special exhibit, we  conduct optimal control 
experiments with a version of the FRB /US model that incorporates an alternative to the 
assumption of model- consistent expectations typically used in our simulations . 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also 
known as the “balanced approach” rule) , an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and 
a first -difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections 
for the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and 
middle panel s also provide the path for the federal funds rate used in the staff baseline. 
• All but one of the prescriptions of the Taylor -type policy rules in the third and 
fourth  quarters of 2017 are a little higher  than in the April  Tealbook, with the 
influence of a more positive output gap more than offsetting that o f lower 
inflation . 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not feature an interest 
rate smoothing term, prescribe substantially higher federal funds rates in the 
near term than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline. 
1 We provide details on each of these four simple rules in the appendix to this section.

• The near -term prescriptions of the first- difference rule are a little higher than 
in April , reflecting the staff’s projection of a somewhat faster rise later this 
year in output. 
A MEDIUM -TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model given 
the staff’s baseline projection.  This Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would 
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• The current -quarter estimate of Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* is 29 basis 
points higher than projected in the April  Tealbook, reflecting the upward 
revisi on to the output gap. 
• At 2.05 percent, Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* is more than 1¼ percentage 
points above the average projected real federal funds rate in the staff forecast 
for the same 12 -quarter period , up from a n average difference of a little less 
than 1 percentage point over the past year.  Also, Tealbook-consistent 
FRB/US r* is about 1 percentage point above the staff’s estimate of the real 
federal funds rate in the longer run. 
• The average projected real feder al funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is 
below the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction 
function us ed by the staff in constructing the baseline forecast includes an 
interest rate smoothing term, reacts to both the output gap and inflation 
deviations from 2 percent, and is therefore not designed to close the output 
gap over only three years.

Taylor  (1999) rule, and the first- difference rule.2 These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation in response to the different federal 
funds rate paths implied by each of the specified policy rules.3 The policy rate paths 
prescribed by each rule are modestly higher than in the April  Tealbook, reflecting the 
upward revision to the staff’s projection of the output gap. 
• The policy rate p ath in the staff forecast is construct ed using a  version of the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the 
intercept. The federal funds rate increases, on average, a bit more than 
1 percentage point per year in 2017 and 2018 and reaches 3¾ percent  in late 
2019.  The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate 
peaks at 4¼ percent in 2021 before moving toward its long -run level of 
3 percent. 
• The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which has a constant intercept , prescribes a 
slightly higher path for the federal funds rate over the next few years than the 
path associated with the Tealbook baseline, which incorporates a judgmental 
intercept adjustment.  The difference in policy rates arising from this 
alternative treatment of the intercept is small and dissipates too rapidly to ha ve 
marked implications for the real longer -term interest rates that influence 
economic activity in the FRB/US model.  Thus, macroeconomic outcomes 
under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are similar to those in the Tealbook 
baseline. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp 
tightening in policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that lie 
significantly above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years .  This 
initially more rapid tightening of policy is followed by a period , beginning 
early in the next decade and lasting several years , during which the federal 
funds rate is lower  than in the Tealbook projection.  Because market 
participants understand that higher short- term real interest rates during the 
2 Unless otherwise noted, the simulated path for each policy rule is obtained under the assumptions 
that policymakers are committed to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial 
market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through 
on this commitment but also understand the macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so. 
3 Because of these end ogenous responses, the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

next several years will be offset by lower real interest rates later on , the paths 
for the real 10 -year Treasury yield under these two rules are, on net, not far 
from that under the Tealbook baseline.  Economic activity in the FRB/US 
model tends to be closely linked to the real 10-year Treasury yield , and thus 
the paths for unemployment and inflation under the two rules are similar to 
the paths in the Tealbook baseline despite the initially la rge differences in the 
paths of the federal funds rate.4 
• The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower path for 
some years thereafter .  This latter divergence occurs because the first -
difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap 
rather than to its level, reacts to the projected narrowing of the output gap late 
in the decade and beyond.  The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2018, 
in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer -term real rates over the entire projection period than in the 
Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of resource utilization and 
inflation.  Thus, the first- difference rule generates outcomes for the 
unemployment rate that are markedly below those associated with the baseline 
policy rule.  Consequently, the first-difference rule produces inflation outcomes that are somewhat above those in the Tealbook baseline projection. 
• Compared with the corresponding simulations in the April Tealbook, t he 
federal funds rate paths prescribed by the simple rules are 0.1 to 
0.3 percentage point higher, on average, over the next three years, reflecting 
higher proje cted resource utilization . 
4 The Taylor (1993) rule calls for slightly lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over the 
period shown because it does not respond as strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level 
over the next several years.  As a consequence, the Taylor ( 1993) rule generates a lower trajectory for the 
unemployment rate and a slightly hi gher trajectory for inflation than does the Taylor (1999) rule.

OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT 
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5 
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices in a way 
that improves economic outcomes.6 
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, on keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.   Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly 
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path.  This higher path arises 
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome 
that these policymakers judge to be costly.  The tighter policy results in a path 
for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the 
Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited 
response of inflation to changes in levels of resource utilization  in the 
FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rat e is running below the natural rate, but that is 
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate 
is considerably below both the path for the optimal control simulation with equal weights and the Tealbook baseline path.  With the asymmetric loss 
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appendix in this Tealbook section 
provides technical details on the optimal control simulations. 
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic 
outcomes by m aking promises that bind future policymakers’ actions and that are taken as credible by wage

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the 
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered 
by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that 
helps achieve this outcome.  Because the public believes that policymakers 
will follow through on this policy rate p ath even as the economy evolves as 
projected with the substantial undershooting of the natural rate of 
unemployment, the tighter  labor market brings inflation to 2 percent more 
quickly than in the case of equal weights .  Starting around 2025 (not shown), 
the unemployment rate runs a little above its natural level for several years as 
policymakers seek to contain the inflation ary pressures stemming from a 
prolonged period with limited resource slack .7 
• The third simulation exercise, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a 
loss function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise identical.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative 
than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses a ssociated with 
undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years.  The reason 
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff 
because inflation responds only weakly to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment, which this specification of the loss function 
sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount. 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but 
is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting 
optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than under 
the specification with equal weights in an effort to undo the projected 
7 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective an d undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to re -optimize the path of the federal funds rate 
without regard to past po licy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter 
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out 
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the 
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function . For the other three 
specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under commitment and discretion are not much 
different from one another .

undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment ; the federal funds rate 
remains near 6 percent over the remainder of the period shown.  The paths for 
the real federal funds rate and the real 10 -year Treasury yield are also notably 
higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights.  While this 
policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to those of all except one of the 
other loss functions over the period shown, it keeps the unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.8 
• With the exception of the simulation with a minimal weight on rate 
adjustments, the federal funds rate paths prescribed  by optimal control under 
each of the above loss functions are about ¼ percentage point higher, on 
average, over the next three years than in the April Tealbook, reflecting 
greater projected tightness in the labor market. For the simulation with a 
minimal weight on rate adjustments, the upward revision is larger for that 
period, at 1¼ percentage points, because policymakers in the model move 
aggressively to contain a larger projected undershooting of the natural rate of 
unemployment. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL : ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXPECTATIONS 
FORMATION 
In the optimal control simulations  described above, in addition to closing the 
unemployment gap, policymakers eventually return inflation to 2 percent on a sustained 
basis despite running a polic y over the next several years that , in most simulations, is 
markedly tighter than under the Tealbook baseline.  In those simulations, we assume that 
agents form “model- consistent expectations ”—that is, we assume that  the public knows 
the structure of the economy, understands policymakers’ strateg y concerning current and 
future settings of the federal funds rate, and uses that knowledge when forming expectations of future movements in asset prices, wages, and inflation.  These 
assumptions facilitate achievement of  policymakers’ stated objectives , particularly for 
inflation. In particular , in simulations with model- consistent expectations , long- term 
inflation expectations move to 2 percent almost immediately from their current value of 
1.8 percent assumed in the sta ff’s baseline , as the public expects that the policymakers 
will act vigorously to bring inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.  An alternative 
8 After 2022, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes above and 
sometimes below the case of equal weights.

assumption is that inflation expectations are “sticky,” in the sense that they respond 
slowly to changes in actual inflation  and other influences.  The staff view underlying the 
Tealbook baseline forecast is consi stent with the latter perspective:  Long- term inflation 
expectations are expected to rise only gradually toward 2 percent even as tight resource 
utilization lifts actual inflation slightly above 2 percent for an extended period.9 
In this special exhibit, we explore the implications for optimal control policy and 
macroeconomic outcomes of depart ing from the assumption of model-consistent 
expectations .  To do so, we assum e instead that the public forms expectations based 
solely on historical relationships as represented by small- scale statistical models—that is, 
we assume “ VAR -based expectations .”10 To illustrate the policy implications of this 
alternative assumption, we show simulations under model-consistent expectations  and 
under VAR -based expectations for two loss functions: “Equal weights” and 
“Asymmetric weight on ugap.” 
• The first simulation , “Equal weights : MCE ,” reproduces the optimal control 
policy and outcomes from the “Equal w eights” simulation of the previous 
exhibit.  The second simulation, “Equal weights: VAR -based ,” is obtained 
under optimal control using the VAR -based expectations version of the 
FRB/US mo del.  In the early part of the period shown , policymakers choose a 
fairly similar path for the federal funds rate, but model-consistent and VAR -
based expectations produce some differences in economic outcomes.  In the 
model- consistent expectations case, the public foresees the inflationary 
implications of high future levels of resource utilization , but the public also 
expect s that a tighter stance of policy will follow . These anticipations initially 
induce a lower path for inflation than under VAR- based expectations and a 
higher path for the 10- year real Treasury yield , which is a key influence on

Implications,” memorandum to the Federal Open Market Committee, Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, Division of Monetary Affairs, D ivision of

aggregate demand in the FRB/US model.  By contrast, under VAR- based 
expectations, given the low initial level of inflation expectations and the fact 
that the public does not accurately foresee the unusual ly low levels of 
unemployment that are forthcoming, policymaker s need only to raise the 
federal funds rate for a relatively brief period to contain inflation expectations 
and achieve the Committee’s 2 percent inf lation objective.  Moreover, later in 
the simulation, the paths for the federal funds in the two models diverge, 
despite the real 10 -year Treasury y ields converging.  This divergence arises 
because, in the VAR -based expectations version of the model, the 10- year 
Treasury yield i s not tied directly to the future path for the federal funds rate 
as it is in the model- consistent expectations version of the model.  This feature 
explains wh y the differences in inflation and unemployment are small relative 
to the differences in the paths for the nominal rate late in the simulation. 
• The third simulation , “Asymmetric weight on ugap: MCE ,” reproduces the 
optimal control policy and outcomes from the previous exhibit when there is 
no penalty in the loss function on unemployment undershooting its natural 
rate.  Also shown are results from  a fourth simulation , “Asymmetric weight on 
ugap: VAR -based ,” for which the asymmetric loss function is again used , this 
time with the FRB/US  model under VAR -based expectations .  Unconcerned 
by persistently low unemployment, policymakers with th ese preferences 
choose polic ies that are, for some time,  notably easier than in the 
corresponding e qual- weights cases. Moreover, policymakers facing model -
consistent expectations choose a lower  path for the nominal funds rate than 
they do under VAR -based expectations .  Intuitively, the belief  under model-
consistent expectations that policymakers are committed to achieving 
2 percent inflation induces the public to look beyond the lengthy period of 
very low unemployment when forming inflation expectations.  The assumed 
credibility of this  promise helps line up actual inflation with the longer- term 
objective over the period shown and beyond.  Under VAR -based expectations, 
policymakers do not benefit in the same way from the foresight and 
conviction of the public .  Initially, long- term inflation expectations stand 
somewhat below the Committee’s inflation objec tive but, absent a sufficiently 
strong policy response, would eventually be lifted persistently above 2 percent 
by the lengthy period of low unemployment.  To preemptively limit the 
associated losses , policymakers in the VAR- based expectations case must

tighten policy more in the short run than in th e model -consistent 
expectations case. 
• This special exhibit highlights the important role that expectations formation 
can play in determining optimal policy  by presenting results for two stark 
alternative s.  When expectations are model consistent, promises to achieve 
policy objectives in the future can generate powerful effect s on current 
economic outcomes through expectations.  But, these channels assume the 
public possess es detailed knowledge of the structure of the economy and the 
policy strategy.  By contrast, under VAR- based expectations , the public only 
uses limited information and expectations are formed only on the basis of past 
outcomes.  These two features of VAR -based expectations imply that the 
public will be systematically  surprised e ven in the face of large 
policy changes. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix 
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic 
implications  of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment 
strategies. 
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader se t 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  An d, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess t he various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table “Simple Rules” gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported 
in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t. 
The right-hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE price 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate 
for the current period (ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead annual change in the 
output gap ( ∆4ygap t+3|t). The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted πLR , 
is 2 percent.

Simple Rules 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board 
staff.1 The intercepts of these rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen so that they are 
consistent with a 2 percent longer -run inflation objective and a longer- run real federal funds rate 
of 1 percent, a value used in the FRB/US model.2 The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
Near -term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the 
Tealbook projec tions for inflation and the output gap.  When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters . When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quart ers.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand- side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the se cond quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal 
funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy R ules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The “Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter 
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the out put gap equal to zero in the final quarter 
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large- scale econometric model 
of the U.S. economy.3 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others ( 2012). 
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.

which take the form of pr ojected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  The measure is 
derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based expectations— that is, 
agents u se small -scale statistical models so that their expectations o f future variables are 
determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and 
the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes 
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US  r* 
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close 
the output gap at the end of this time frame , whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal 
funds rate can vary over time. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole per iod covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectati ons and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that qu arter; when the Tealbook i s published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following e quation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discoun t the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽 0.9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕 � 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉 𝑇𝑇

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weigh ts on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.

The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty t o the unemployment rate falling be low the natural rate. 
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weig ht to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4  The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights. 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not af fect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits. 
4 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution. Loss Functions

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff’s measure of potential output and the 
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policy changes in transfers and taxes.
