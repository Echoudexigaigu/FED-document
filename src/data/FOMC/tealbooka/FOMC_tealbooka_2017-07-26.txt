Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The economic outlook is broadly sim ilar to the one we presented in the June 
Tealbook.1  Even with the disappointing June retail sales data, we contin ue to see the 
incoming information as supporting the view that the lackluster  output growth in the first 
quarter would give way to a more sizable increase in the second  quarter.2  For the second 
half of the year, we currently anticipate that real GDP will ri se at an annual rate of about 
2½ percent—not quite as fast as we anticipated in June and down  slightly from the 
2¾ percent pace reflected in the tables and figures that accompany this text, but still 
sufficient to further widen t he gap between actual and potential output.3  Labor market 
conditions have continued to tight en, with payroll employment r unning well above the 
pace required to absorb new entrants into the workforce.  The u nemployment rate has 
moved down ¼ percentage point so fa r this year, and we expect i t to edge down further in 
the second half.   
Beyond this year, we still expect  GDP growth to slow in 2018 an d 2019 as 
monetary policy tighten s.  Even so, GDP rises faster than its p otential rate throughout the 
medium term, and the output gap w idens to nearly 2 percent by t he end of 2019.  The 
unemployment rate is projecte d to fall to 3.8 percent by that t ime, about 1 percentage 
point below our estimate of its  natural rate.  Revisions to the  key conditioning factors 
underpinning our forecast are offsetting in this projection.  A lthough we maintained our 
assumption that expansionary fis cal policy will be implemented early next year, we 
reduced the size of the placeholder tax cut by half and shorten ed its duration.  In the other 
direction, the lower projecte d paths for the dollar and longer- term interest rates boost 
GDP growth slightly in 2018 and 2019.    
As for inflation, we have been surprised with the weakness in m onthly readings 
for March through May; in response, we have nudged down our pro jection over the near 
1 Throughout this document, the t ext has been updated to take on  board material information from 
the CPI, retail sales, and Monthl y Treasury Statement, which we re published after the Tealbook projection 
was finalized on July 13.  Since the figures and tables present  the July Tealbook projection, they do not 
reflect the news from these releases. 
2 The Monthly Treasury Statement pointed to considerably stronger defense spending in the 
second quarter than we had anticipated; on net, after folding i n the retail sales data, our GDP estimate for 
the second quarter is little changed from the value shown in th e figures and tables. 
3 The BEA is scheduled to publish its initial estimate of second -quarter GDP along with its annual 
revision to the NIPA on July 28, the Friday after the FOMC meet ing.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is above the project ions from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017 
and below the Blue Chip consensus in 2018 . The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is 
lower than the SPF forecast in 2017.  The s taff’s projection for CPI inflation is below 
those of outside forecasters in 2017 and is above them in 2018.  The staff’s projections 
for both overall and core PCE price inflation are noticeably below the SPF forecast s in 
2017 but only slightly below the SPF forecasts in 2018. 
Note: SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures. Blue Chip does not provide results for 
PCE price inflation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from about 
50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

term.  With the June CPI and PPI  reports in hand, our estimate for PCE prices in June is 
in line with our modestly downgraded expectation and would warrant no change to the 
projection shown in the tables and figures of this Tealbook.  W e continue to view the 
bulk of the recent weakness as tra nsitory and foresee the pace of core PCE price inflation 
moving up from 1.5 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2018 and  then to 2 percent in 2019 
as the transitory weakness wanes  and resource utilization tight ens further.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 Considerable uncertainty remains  about the potential size, timi ng, and 
composition of federal fiscal policy changes that may be enacte d during the 
forecast period.  However, given th at the Congress and the Admi nistration 
have not yet coalesced around a specific set of policy changes and that there 
now appears to be more resistance to increasing the federal def icit than we 
had previously expected, we have r educed the si ze of the fiscal  expansion we 
anticipate will take effect next year.  As a placeholder, we co ntinue to assume 
that the expansion will take the form of a cut to personal taxe s, but we now 
assume that it will increase the annual primary budget deficit (that is, the 
deficit excluding interest cost s) by ½ percent of GDP rather th an the 1 percent 
assumption we adopted in the December 2016 Tealbook.  Further, we now 
assume that it will begin t o be gradually phased out after 5 ye ars, resulting in a 
substantially smaller increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio after 1 0 years than we 
had assumed in the June projection. 
 The revised fiscal expansion is expected to boost the level of real GDP about 
¼ percent by the end of 2019, half as much as in our previous p rojection; this 
estimate is exclusive of multiplier effects and offsets from lo wer interest rates 
and the dollar. 
Monetary Policy  
 The assumed path of the federal f unds rate is lower than in the  June Tealbook, 
primarily reflecting a downward a djustment that we made to the long-run 
value of r* and hence to the inter cept in the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we 
use to mechanically set this rate in our projection.

o We lowered the assumed long -run value of r* by 50 basis points from our 
previous assumption of 1 percent.  Half of this adjustment refl ected our 
revised fiscal assumption:  Because we now have the placeholder  fiscal 
expansion being phased out rather than persisting into the long er run, we 
reversed the fiscal-policy-rela ted increment of 25 basis points  to the long-
run value of r* that we introduced in the December 2016 Tealboo k.  The 
other half reflects a decision t o reduce the staff assumption regarding r* 
after a reappraisal of model-bas ed estimates of this parameter. A year ago, 
when we last lowered r*, we assu med that the model-based estima tes 
would gradually rise as the economy continued to strengthen, bu t instead 
the model-based estimates have b een flat over the past year (se e the box 
“The Equilibrium Real Rate in t he Longer Run” in the Monetary P olicy 
Strategies section).4 
o With the changes to r*, the inter cept-adjusted inertial Taylor rule 
generates an average federal  funds rate of 1.4 percent in the f ourth quarter 
of this year and 3.3 percent at the end of 2019, about 10 basis  points and 
40 basis points, respectively, belo w their levels in the June T ealbook 
projection.   
o We allowed only a portion of the dow nward revision to interest rates 
related to the reductions in r* to show through to stronger aggregate 
demand.  In particular, the portion associated with the change in the stance of fiscal policy is assumed to support demand and so partially offset the 
lower impetus from fiscal pol icy.  However, we did not allow th e 
reduction in interest rates associ ated with the remainder of th e reduction in 
r* to boost our medium-term projection, because that portion of  the r* 
adjustment reflected a judgment that an easier stance of moneta ry policy 
than we previously believed will be required to achieve full em ployment 
and price stability in the longer run.

 The SOMA portfolio is assumed to begin a gradual and predictabl e decline in 
the fourth quarter as reinvestme nts from principal repayments o n securities 
held in the portfolio are phased out. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is re vised markedly down in this pro jection, 
reflecting the downward revision t o the projected path of futur e short-term 
interest rates over the valuation window and, to a lesser exten t, lower term 
premiums.5  Overall, the 10-year Treasury yi eld is projected to rise over  the 
medium term, from an average of  2.5 percent in the current quar ter to 
3.4 percent by the end of 2019; the latter figure is about 60 basis points lower 
than in the June projection. 
 The path of 30-year fixed mortgage rates was revised in line wi th changes to 
the path for the 10-year Treas ury yield.  However, we lowered o ur projection 
for the triple-B corporate bond s pread a bit in the near term i n response to the 
persistently lower-than-expect ed spread over the past few quart ers. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are broadly in lin e with our projection in the Ju ne Tealbook.  
We continue to hold the view that  valuation pressures will limi t the scope for 
further stock price appreciati on over the medium term.  Accordi ngly, equity 
prices are projected to rise  only about ½ percent per year in t he medium term, 
about the same as in the June Tealbook.  
 Incoming data on house prices have been in line with our expectations, and we 
have kept our forecast for house  price appreciation this year a t around 
6 percent.  Currently, we judge t hat the ratio of house prices to rents is 
marginally above its long-run tre nd.  To reflect this considera tion, we project 
the growth in home values to s low to around 4 percent in 2018 a nd 2019, a 
pace that would stabilize the ra tio of house prices to rents. 
5 The downward revisions to term premiums reflect the staff’s as sumption that the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet will be l arger—both before and after th e normalization of its size is achieved— 
than we had assumed in the June  Tealbook A forecast.  In additi on, the revision to the assumed fiscal 
expansion pushed down term premiums by reducing projected gover nment debt over the longer run.

Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 We estimate that foreign econom ic activity grew  at a solid pace  of around 
3 percent in the first half of t he year.  In aggregate, the for ecast for the second 
quarter is about the same as in the June Tealbook, as upward re visions in 
Canada, the euro area, Japa n, and China have been offset by dow nward 
revisions in Mexico and Brazil.  W e continue to foresee growth abroad 
moderating a little to its potential pa ce of around 2½ percent by early 2018 
and remaining there over the r est of the forecast period.   
 The broad nominal dollar has depr eciated about 1 ½ percent since the time of 
the June Tealbook, largely reflect ing movements against the adv anced foreign 
economy currencies.  However, we e xpect the broad real dollar to appreciate 
at about a 1¾ percent annual rate through the forecast period, as market 
expectations for the federal f unds rate move up toward the staf f forecast. This 
rate of increase is a bit lower than in the June Tealbook, mostly because of the 
decrease in the staff expectat ion for U.S. interest rates.  Rel ative to the June 
Tealbook, our projection for the br oad real dollar at the end o f 2019 is down 
2½ percent. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil closed on Wednesday, July 12, at about 
$48 per barrel, $3 per barrel lower than at the time of the Jun e Tealbook.  Oil 
prices fell about $6 per barrel on news of rec overies in Libyan  and Nigerian 
production as well as the conti nued strength of U.S. oil produc tion.  Prices 
subsequently bounced back on early indications that the recover y in U.S. oil 
production may be slowing.  Futur es prices are roughly unchange d, as the 
increases in Libyan and Nigeria n production remain tenuous.  In  line with the 
now slightly upward-sloping futures curve, we project that the price of 
imported oil will edge up over the projection period. 
 Prices for industrial metals ha ve risen about 3 percent since t he time of the 
June Tealbook as a result of stronger demand from China and a renewed threat of short-term supply disrup tions in the production of co pper in both 
Chile and Indonesia.  Agricultural prices have also risen 3 per cent since the 
June Tealbook, mainly reflecti ng a weaker supply outlook for several crops in 
the United States.

THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
After posting a modest reading in the first quarter, real GDP g rowth looks to have 
picked up in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2½ percent , similar to our June 
Tealbook forecast.6  The data received after we closed the July Tealbook projectio n 
implied offsetting revisions to s econd-quarter GDP growth:  The June retail sales data fell 
well short of our expectations, but  the Monthly Treasury Statem ent for June implied 
stronger defense purchases.  However, taking into account the l atest data, we now project 
GDP will increase at a 2½ percent rate over the remainder of th e year, somewhat less 
than in the June Tealbook forecast.  
 Incoming data indicate that real PCE growth in the first quarte r was not as 
weak as we had previously estimated, and a rebound in the pace of spending 
in the second quarter still appe ars to have occurred—though to a somewhat 
lesser extent than we expecte d.  All told, we continue to put t he rate of PCE 
growth over the first half of t he year at around 2 percent.  De spite the 
disappointing June reading on reta il sales, we still expect PCE to rise at a solid 
pace in the second half of the year, supported by ongoing gains  in income and 
wealth as well as upbeat readings on consumer sentiment.  A lar ge part of the 
second-half pickup in PCE growth reflects our expectation that motor vehicle 
sales will level off after stepping down noticeably in the firs t half of the year. 
 In the residential sector, single-family and multifamily housin g starts moved 
down, on net, over April and May, and permit issuance in both c ategories 
softened some as well.  In addi tion, revised data suggest a lar ger decline in the 
average value of homes started this past winter, which will lik ely be a drag on 
real residential investment ove r the second and third quarters of this year as 
the construction of those homes is  completed.  In all, the inco ming data 
suggest a weaker near-term trajec tory for residential investmen t than we had 
written down in the June Tealbook.  Even so, the recent pattern  remains 
consistent with the softening in residential investment that ou r models 
expected in response to the rise in mortgage rate s since autumn .   
6 As displayed in the table “Fede ral Reserve System Nowcasts of 2017:Q2 Real GDP Growth,” the 
median of the projecti ons generated by the near-term forecastin g approaches used within the System, at 
2.5 percent, is in line with the staff’s judgmental projection.

 Investment in equipment and intan gibles appears to have risen a t an annual 
rate of around 5 percent in the second quarter, and with readin gs on business 
sentiment having remained favorab le, we project broadly similar  gains in the 
second half of the year.  Such a pace is lackluster in comparison with the 
average increase in previous e xpansions, but it is still a noti ceable 
improvement from the outright decline in 2016.  Elsewhere, inve stment in 
nonresidential structures has been on a sharp upward trajectory  since the 
beginning of the year, with a re bound in investment in drilling  and mining 
structures accounting for the str ength.  Given the relatively f lat projected path 
for crude oil prices, however, w e expect the boost to nonreside ntial 
construction from the energy sec tor to taper off.  In all, the outlook for 
business investment in 2017 is litt le revised from the June Tea lbook.     
 Government purchases were weak, on balance, in the first half o f this year, 
particularly for state and lo cal construction.  We continue to forecast a 
rebound in government purchases in the second half.   
 We estimate that real export and import growth stepped down to rates of 
1 percent and 1½ percent, respe ctively, in the second quarter, and we project 
that growth in both will move back up to around 3 percent this quarter.  We 
estimate that net exports will subtract around 0.1 percentage p oint from U.S. 
GDP growth in both the second and t hird quarters.  In each quar ter, these 
contributions are ¼ percentage po int less negative than in the June Tealbook, 
because import data have come in lower than expected and the do llar has 
depreciated.  
 We now estimate that manufacturin g output increased at a modera te annual 
rate of about 2 percent in the fir st half of this year, a little below our June 
Tealbook projection.  The modest gain s projected for factory output in the 
coming months reflect both the pos itive signal from recent read ings on new 
orders in the regional and nationa l manufacturing surveys and the negative 
signal from the automakers’ latest production s chedules.  Those schedules call 
for a sizable decline in motor ve hicle assemblies this quarter,  likely reflecting 
the elevated days’ supply of new vehicles.

For the medium term, we projec t real GDP will increase 2¼ perce nt in 2018 and a 
bit under 2 percent in 2019.  This forecast for gradually slower growth is little revised 
from the June Tealbook and refle cts the ongoing normalization o f monetary policy. 
 This round, revisions to the key conditioning factors underpinning our 
forecast are offsetting in the medium term.  While the scaled-b ack fiscal 
expansion provides less of a boost to demand over the medium te rm, the lower 
paths for the dollar and for longe r-term interest rates work in the other 
direction.   
 In 2018 and 2019, we project real PCE growth will average a mod erate pace 
of 2½ percent, and we expect the s aving rate to be fairly flat, a pattern in 
rough accordance with our baseline consumption models.  The box 
“Population Aging and the Saving Rate” considers the extent to which aging 
may place upward pressure on consumption relative to income in 
coming years.   
 We continue to assume that potential GDP growth will edge up to 1¾ percent 
by the end of the medium term.  Real GDP growth outpaces potent ial growth 
throughout the projection, and resou rce utilization tightens fu rther.  At the end 
of 2019, real GDP is projected to exceed its potential level by  2 percent, 
unchanged from the June Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
The June employment report indicated that labor market conditio ns have 
continued to improve in recent months.  Payroll gains were a li ttle stronger than 
anticipated, while data from th e household survey were close to  our expectation. 
 Private payroll gains were larger than expected in June, and th e estimates for 
April and May were revised up.7  Government employment also rose by more 
than expected in June, but we t ook little signal, as government payrolls have 
been volatile in recent months.  Over the first half of the year, the average 
7 The relatively early survey week in May and the late survey we ek in June may have contributed 
to some shifting in reported payr oll gains between those two mo nths, as some summer hiring (particularly 
of young workers) not fully reflected in the May report would h ave been included in June.

monthly increase in privat e payrolls was 170,000, about 10,000 higher than in 
the June Tealbook and similar to the average gain in 2016.8 
 In the household survey, the unemplo yment rate was just a touch  higher than 
expected in June, rounding up to 4.4 pe rcent and bringing the second-quarter 
average to 4.4 percent,  ½ percentage point be low the level a year earlier.  The 
labor force participation ra te ticked up to 62.8 percent in June, and the 
employment-to-population rati o edged up to 60.1 percent; both m oves were in 
line with our expectations. 
 We have made only minor adjustments to our near-term labor market forecast.  
In the second half of the year, w e expect the gains in total pa yroll employment 
to average about 175,000 per month.  We continue to project tha t the 
unemployment rate will edge down to 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter, and 
that the participation rate will tick down to 62.7 percent. 
We made no changes to our supply-side assumptions.   
 Although the downside surprises in the recent inflation reading s have led us to 
consider revising down our estim ate of the natural rate of unem ployment, for 
now we have decided to maintai n our assumption that the natural rate is 
4.9 percent. 
 We will reassess our estimates  of potential GDP and the natural  rate of 
unemployment after we receive th e annual revision to the NIPA ( which will 
also include new estimates of c ompensation per hour) as well as  additional 
readings on the ECI and inflation.   
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed,  the outlook for the 
labor market is similar to our June Tealbook projection.  
 After having decreased about 1¼ percentage points since early 2 015, the 
unemployment rate is projected t o decline anothe r ½ percentage point over the 
8 Government employment has incr eased a little more slowly thus far in 2017 than it did in 2016.  
All told, the projected average  monthly increase in total nonfa rm payrolls in the first half of 2017 of 
180,000 is lower than the averag e increase in 2016 of 187,000.

 Population Aging and the Saving Rate  
The aggregate personal saving rate, shown by the black line in the left panel of f igure 1, 
declined substantially in the decades leading up to the Great Recession, falling to 2½ percent 
in 2005, and then moved  up sharply during the recession and  has stabilized  around 
5½ percent .  This discussion  explores whether shifts in the age distribution of the population 
can account for some  of these movements in the saving rate and  the extent to which 
population aging may affect the saving rate going forward.  The main result is that changes in 
the age dist ribution  cannot explain the broad  movements in the saving rate over the past few 
decades .  However, now that retirees are a large and growing share of the population, their 
dissaving may begin to put more material downward pressure on the saving rate in 
coming  years .   
 
Using household -level data from the Bureau of  Labor Statistic s Consumer Expenditure 
Survey, we derive a life-cycle saving rate as a function of age.1  Each point on the curve in the 
right panel of f igure 1  shows the saving rate at a particular age relative to that of a 25- year-
old.  I n a given year, a typical household headed by a 40 -year- old has a saving rate that is 
roughly 10 percentage point s higher than the saving rate of the typical household  of a 
25-year- old.  It is not surprising that young earners, who can often  anticipat e higher future 
income, have a lower saving rate than workers later in their career, who are frequently saving 
for house purchases, children’s college tuition, and  retirement.  Afte r age 55, the saving rate 
begins to drop rapidly  and turns negative as the heads of households move into retirement 
and begin to tap into their wealth to support their consumption .  This hump -shaped life- cycle 
path of the saving rate is consistent with prior theoretical and empirical work.2 
 
 
                                                 
1 Each year, roughly 6,000 households participating in the C onsumer Expenditure Survey  provide 
detailed information about their consumption and income, which we use to construct mean saving rates by 
the age of the head of household.  We then fit these saving rates to a third -degree polynomial in age.  The 
estimation uses data from 1986 to 2 014 and includes year fixed effects—that is, the level of the saving rate is 
allowed to vary by year even though the relative life- cycle profile is fixed.  
2 For example, see Karen E. Dynan, Wendy Edelberg, and Michael G. Palumbo (2009), “The Effects of 
Pop ulation Aging on the Relationship among Aggregate Consumption, Saving, and Income,” American 
Economic Review , vol. 99 (May), pp. 380 –86; and Pierre -Oliver Gourinchas and Jonathan A.  Parker (2002), 
“Consumption over the Life Cycle,” Econometrica , vol. 70  (January), pp. 47– 89.

 The left panel of figure 2  summarizes  information on the changing age distribution of the 
population.  Household  heads between the ages of 35 and 55 are categorized as  “savers” and 
everyone else (which includes those under 35 and over 55) as “spenders .”  The percent age of 
savers —the blue area —peak ed around 2000 when the baby boomers hit their highest  saving 
years.  Since  2000, the percent age of spenders has gradually  increased as baby boomers 
move d into their retirement years, as can be seen  by the notable expansion of the 
percent age of the population over the age of 55— the green area. 
 
The effect of population aging on the aggregate saving rate can be  derived by combining the 
estimated life- cycle  path  of the saving rate with population data.   As shown  in the right panel 
of figure 2 , changes in the age distribution put increasing downward pressure on the saving 
rate through the 1970s as young baby boomers had low savings rates.  After 1980, that 
downward pressure diminished as  the baby boomers moved into their saving years, and  
aging’s  upward  effect on the saving rate peaked  in 2000.  Since then, the age distribution has  
increasingly weigh ed on the aggregate saving rate as more baby boomers have move d into 
the dis saving phase  of retirement.  
 
In figure 1, the red line in the left panel puts the magnitude of this population -aging effect 
into perspective by showing how it would affect  the published and forecast saving rate.  Th is 
“age  adjusted” saving rate subtracts the effect shown in figure 2  from the official rate— that 
is, it shows what the saving rate would have been if  the population age distribution had not 
changed  since 1965.  C hanges in the age distribution appear to account for very little of the 
movement in the saving rate over the p ast half -century . 3  However, as the population 
distribution continues to shift toward retirees, the downward pressure on the saving rate 
(and boost to consumer spending) will become more pronounced.  Aging’s effect on  the 
saving rate, all else being  equal, may  also partially mitigate  the downward pressure on the 
natural rate of interest  from other age-related channels such as slower labor force growth 
along with the associated  higher capital- to-labor ratio.4 
 
 
                                                 
3 The explanation for these movements must lie in other factors.  For example, rising wealth and 
transfer income and expanding  access to credit could explain the secular decline in the saving rate, while 
increased pessimism could explain the step -up in the saving rate since the Great Recession.  
4 For a full accounting of the effects of aging on the natural rate of interest, see Etienne Gagnon, 
Benjamin K. Johannsen, and David Lopez -Salido  (2016), “Understanding the New Normal :  The Rol e of 
Demographics,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series  2016 -080  (Washington:  Board of Governors of the

next two years, ending the medi um term at 3.8 percent, the same  as in the 
previous Tealbook.  
 Total payroll gains are expect ed to slow gradually, from an average monthly 
increase of about 175,000 this year to about 120,000 in 2019.  
 The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend next year 
and in 2019, as sustained job gain s and rising wages continue t o draw 
individuals into the labor for ce while also slowing outflows.  On net, the 
participation rate is projecte d to be ¼ percentage point above our estimate of 
its trend level at the end of 2019, unchanged from the June Tea lbook. 
 We project that productivity will increase slightly less than 1  percent per year, 
on average, over the forecast  period, a bit slower than in 2016 —though still 
up from its average over the pre ceding several years—and slightly below our 
estimate of its structural pace.9 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
Twelve-month changes in core PC E prices have slowed from 1¾ per cent earlier 
this year to about 1½ percent at pr esent, and we expect they wi ll remain in that 
neighborhood through late this year. 
 The May readings of both headline a nd core PCE price inflation were lower 
than we had anticipated in t he June Tealbook—a third month of downside 
surprises—and estimates for previous months were revised down a  touch.  We 
continue to view these surpris es as partly driven by idiosyncra tic movements 
in a few specific categories .  Nevertheless, we nudged down our  near-term 
projection to take on board the w eakness in some categories—suc h as housing 
services and other market-based s ervices—that has been more persistent than 
anticipated.  The June CPI and PPI  releases were in line with t hese slightly 
downgraded expectations.  We exp ect that the upcoming monthly r eadings on 
core inflation will remain modest through the remainder of this  year, partly 
9 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pac e when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly because  a larger share of workers hired in a ti ght labor market have below-average 
productivity than is the case du ring a slack labor market.

reflecting residual seasonalit y that pushes down measured price s in the latter 
half of the calendar year. 
 We estimate that PCE energy pri ces dropped in the second quarte r following 
sizable increases in the previ ous two quarters.  With oil prices having declined 
some since the June Tealbook, we now expect PCE energy prices to move 
down, on net, over the second half of the year. 
 After declining in 2016, PCE f ood prices barely edged up in the  first quarter 
but look to have increased at a n annual rate of around 2 percen t in the second 
quarter.  With food commodity pri ces having recovered somewhat since the 
beginning of the year, we expect  food price inflation to run sl ightly ahead of 
core inflation over the se cond half of the year.  
 Based on data through May, core import price inflation is estimated to have 
stepped up from a meager annual ra te of ¼ percent in the first quarter to a 
2 percent pace in the second quarter .  We expect it to rise to 3½ percent in the 
third quarter, boosted by recent dollar depreciation.  Import price inflation is expected to slow to a ¾ per cent pace by 2018, consistent with m oderate 
foreign inflation and a gra dually appreciating dollar.  
The latest readings on longer-term inflation expectations accor d with our view 
that these expectations r emain reasonably stable. 
 In the preliminary July report fr om the University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers, median inflation expe ctations over the next 5 to 10 years ticked 
up to 2.6 percent, still relatively l ow by the standards of this series.   
 The June reading on the median thr ee-year-ahead expected inflat ion from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s Survey of Consumer Expectati ons 
moved back up to 2¾ percent, in line with the range of values o bserved earlier 
this year. 
 The median projection for 10-year  average PCE price inflation f rom the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (a reading taken in May) held steady at 
2.1 percent in the second quarter.

 The TIPS-based measure of five-year-forward inflation compensat ion 
currently stands at 1¾ percent, l ittle changed from its value a t the time of the 
June Tealbook.   
Beyond the near term, our outlook f or inflation is little revis ed.  We continue to 
project that both headline and core PCE price inflation will mo ve up to 1.9 percent next 
year and 2 percent in 2019, as the transitory factors pushing down inflation this year 
abate and resource utilization continues to tighten.     
We have received only a little i nformation on hourly compensati on since the June 
Tealbook.  In the medium term, we continue to forecast that the  healthy labor market will 
bring about a further step-up in the growth of hourly compensat ion, to a pace of 
3½ percent.  
 Average hourly earnings (AHE)  of all employees were again a lit tle below our 
expectations in June.  AHE incr eased 2½ percent over the 12 mon ths ending 
in June, about even with the gain  a year earlier but below the 2¾ percent rate 
of increase seen in late 2016.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3 .4 percent 
in May, below its recent highs but  still well above the pace ob served a few 
years ago. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be 
4.9 percent in the longer run, and t hat the growth rate of pote ntial GDP will be 
1¾ percent. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by late 2021. 
 Real GDP growth slows to about 1½ percent in 2020 and 1¼ percen t in 2021 
as the federal funds rate is above  its neutral level.  The unem ployment rate is 
4.1 percent in 2021 and continues to r ise gradually toward its assumed natural 
rate in subsequent years.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming data continue to point to widespread strong performance abroad, 
especially in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs).  We estimate that foreign 
economic output rose at a solid 2¾ percent annual rate in the second quarter after a robust 
3¼ percent gain the quarter before.  In aggregate, the forecast for the second quarter is 
unchanged from the June Tealbook, as stronger- than-anticipated indicators have led to 
upward revisions in most AFEs and China, which have been offset by downward revisions in Mex ico and Brazil. 
We continue to see foreign GDP growth stabilizing at its potential pace of around 
2½ percent by early 2018.  While economic activity decelerates in Canada to a more 
sustainable pace and Chinese growth slows in line with potential, growth picks up in 
Latin America as Brazil pulls out of its recession and Mexico shakes off its recent weakness.  With the expansion abroad now more firmly established, downside risks to the global economy have diminished since last year.  That said, important conc erns 
remain, notably that a hard landing in China could trigger a sharp slowdown in other emerging market economies (EMEs), an outcome that we explore in the “China-Driven EME Turbulence” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.   
Against the backdrop of stronger economic activity in most AFEs, the Bank of 
Canada (BOC) hiked its policy rate on July 12 and the Bank of England (BOE) and 
European Central Bank (ECB) alluded to the possibility of reducing the pace of monetary 
stimulus (see the box “Recent Actions and Communications by Foreign Central Banks”).  
Markets have taken considerable signal from these discussions, with sovereign yields of these economies jumping and their currencies appreciating, developments that are discussed in more detail in the Financial Market Developments section.  The BOC rate hike occurred two quarters earlier than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook.  We also 
pulled forward the tightening of policy rates by the BOE by two quarters and the ECB by 
one quarter, and we have end-2019 rates in both cases a bit higher than we anticipated in 
June.  However, given remaining slack and expectations of continued low underlying inflation, we still see monetary policy in all three economies staying quite 
accommodative for some time.  That said, there is some chance of even faster growth and 
greater tightening of monetary policies abroad than we expect, an upside risk that we

Recent A ctions and Communications by Foreign Central Banks 
Over the past six weeks or so, actions and communications by officials from several advanced 
foreign economy central banks have jolted global financial markets, boosting bond yields 
abroad and in the United States (see figure).  In this discussion , we summarize monetary policy 
develop ments in the European Central Bank (ECB), Bank of Canada (BOC), and Bank of England 
(BOE) and examine the implications for our economic and monetary policy outlook.  
European Central Bank 
Since the publication of the June Tealbook, the ECB took two incremental steps toward 
eventually beginning to normalize its monetary policy stance. First, at its June 8 meeting, the 
Governing Council changed its forward guidance.  The ECB now expects to maintain its policy 
rate at its current level for an extended period, whereas it had previously expected to maintain 
its policy rate at current or lower levels.  Second, in a speech on June 27, ECB President Draghi 
noted that the forces weighing on euro- area inflation should prove “temporary” and that, as 
the economy continues to recover, monetary policy should adjust —albeit gradually and only as 
underlying inflation dynamics improve.1 As can be seen in the figure, President Dragh i’s speech 
appeared to elicit a significant response in long -term yields , both in the euro area and 
elsewhere. Although President Draghi’s speech caught markets by surprise, the recent ECB 
communications do not change our view that the withdrawal of stimulus will be both long in 
coming and quite gradual after it does arrive.  We view those communications as both a 
necessary acknowledgment that economic prospects have improved and a way of preparing 
markets for the eventual normalization.  With slack remaining and inflation still subdued, we 
continue to expect the ECB to normalize its policy stance only slowly, waiting until early 2018 to 
begin tapering asset purchases and until mid -2018 to cease them.  But in light of the recent 
communication s and positive i ncoming data, we have the ECB beginning to raise its policy rate 
in late 2018, one quarter earlier than in the June Tealbook, and reaching ¼ percent by late 2019, 
¼ percentage point higher than in June. 
Bank of Canada 
The BOC raised its policy rate ¼ percentage point to ¾ percent on July 12, two quarters earlier 
than assumed in the June Tealbook.  The policy change followed statements by BOC officials, 
including Governor Poloz, displaying a more hawkish tone and suggesting a substantial change 
in the BOC’s assessment of the economic outlook.  The BOC cited the broadening of the 
economic recovery, attributed recent weak inflation readings to past economic slack, and expressed more confidence that diminishing resource slack would push up inflation.  In 
contras t, as recently as April, the BOC was expressing concern about the concentration of 
growth in a narrow set of industries and pointing to subdued price and wage inflation as 
evidence of material excess capacity.

Central Banking , Sintra, June 27, https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2017/html/ecb.sp170627.en.html .

We view the BOC’s shift to a less accommodative stance, in part, as reflecting greater 
confidence in the recovery.  The BOC also emphasized that the recent  soft inflation readings 
partly reflect idiosyncratic factors and should be temporary .  Accordingly, we expect monetary 
policy to be slightly less accommodative over the nearer term and anticipate that the BOC will 
raise its policy rate again in the first quarter of 2018.  Nevertheless, our new assumptions for Canadian monetary policy entail only an adjustment  in the timing of policy rate actions over the 
forecast horizon, and , with our longer- term outlook for the Canadian economy little changed , 
our forecast for the policy rate at the end of 2019 remains at 2  percent.  
Bank of England  
On June 14 , the BOE’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) surprised markets with an 
unexpectedly close vote to keep the policy rate at ¼ percent.  T hree d issenting MPC members  
preferred  a rate hike , expressing concern  that, amid limited resource slack, the recent 
overshoot of inflation above target could be more persistent  than previously thought.  
Subsequently, Governor Carney stated that “some removal of monetary stimulus is likely to 
become necessary” if spare capacity  erodes further.
2 
Overall, these developments are responses to persistently elevated inflation (reflecting the 
post -Brexit depreciation of the sterling) and a record -low unemployment rate.   Given the 
uncertain growth outlook, we still see the BOE as maintaining its current policy stance through 
this year and tightening  that stance only very gradually thereafter.  But, consistent with our 
higher inflation projection and the more hawkish BOE tone, we now expect the BOE to hike its 
policy rate in the second quarter of 2018, two quarters earlier than previously assumed, and to 
raise it to ¾ percent by the end of 2019, ¼ percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook.

explore in the alternative scenario “Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy” in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section. 
The heightened focus on policy normalization abroad seems to indicate that those 
central banks are looking through recent declines in headline inflation as reflecting 
transitory factors.  Indeed, even though AFE headline inflation fell to ½ percent in the 
second quarter at an annual rate, ½ percentage point lower than in the June Tealbook, this 
decline largely reflected lower retail energy prices.  Core inflation has held up better but 
remains below central bank targets, except in the United Kingdom.  As the transitory 
effects wane and output gaps narrow, we see AFE inflation stepping up to 1¾ percent 
by 2019, just below authorities’ 2 percent inflation targets.  
We estimate that EME inflation remained at 3¼ percent in the second quarter, a 
touch lower than the June Tealbook projection, as surprisingly strong food price inflation in Mexico was offset by benign inflation in China and elsewhere.  The Bank of Mexico 
(BOM) raised rates in June, as expected, continuing its sequence of successive rate hikes 
since late 2015, but it has also signaled an end to its tightening. Brazil’s inflation fell in 
June to its lowest level in a decade, and the Brazilian government lowered its inflation 
target to 4 percent in 2020 from 4½ percent.  We see a ggregate EME inflation easing 
to roughly 3 percent in this quarter and staying there for the remainder of the forecast 
period.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Euro Area.  Recent indicators —including e levated PMIs, solid retail sales, and brisk 
industrial production—suggest that real GDP growth rose to almost 2¾ percent in the 
second quarter from an upwardly revised 2.3 percent the quarter before, the fastest 
pace seen in two years.  Growth is projected to moderate to 1¾ percent by mid-2018 
and edge down a touch more in 2019 as economic slack erodes.  Compared with the June Tealbook, this projection is about ¼ percentage point higher over the next year, 
reflecting stronger -than-expected momentum in the economy. 
Headline inflation tumbled from a rate of 2.9 percent in the first quarter to negative 0.1 percent in the second as a result of falling e nergy and food prices.  Smoothing 
through Easter- related volatility, core inflation appears to have risen from just under 
1 percent in the second half of 2016 to roughly 1¼ percent in the first half of 2017, 
slightly higher than we anticipated in June.  Going forward, headline inflation is

projected to bounce back from its second-quarter dip and then rise slowly thereafter, 
reaching 1¾ percent only in late 2019, as the output gap narrows and wage growth 
gradually picks up.  Compared with the June Tealbook, this projection is a touch 
higher in 2018 and 2019, reflecting slightly faster growth.   
In light of the positive data and recent ECB communications, we now see the path of 
monetary policy as slightly less accommodative.  While we continue to expect the ECB to begin tapering its asset purchases in early 2018 and to cease them by mid-
2018, we brought forward the liftoff of the deposit rate one quarter to the fourth 
quarter  of 2018 and see the policy rate being ¼ percent by end-2019 rather than zero.  
• Canada.  Following unusually strong GDP growth of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, 
recent data, such as monthly GDP for April and the manufacturing PMI through June, 
suggest that growth moderated to 2¾ percent in the second quarter.  We expect 
growth to average around 2 percent through the remainder of this year and to settle at 
its potential pace of 1¾ percent thereafter.  Relative to the June Tealbook, this projection is stronger for the second quarter of 2017 on better- than-expected data but 
a touch weaker in 2018 and 2019 because of an appreciated Canadian dollar and higher interest rates. 
We estimate that inflation slowed more sharply than expected, from 2.6 percent in the 
first quarter to 1 percent in the second, reflecting surprisingly large declines in ret ail 
energy prices.  Downplaying these soft inflation readings as largely reflecting 
temporary factors, and citing the broadening of economic growth, the BOC increased its policy rate ¼  percentage point to ¾ percent on July 12, two quarters earlier than 
we had anticipated in June.  We assume that the BOC will next increase its policy rate 
in the first quarter of 2018 but still see the policy rate at 2 percent by the end of 2019, 
as in the June Tealbook, consistent with a nearly unchanged longer-term outlook. 
• United Kingdom.  Incoming data on industrial production, services output, and PMIs 
were weaker than expected, suggesting that GDP growth only edged up to 1¼ percent 
in the second quarter, ½ percentage point lower than in the June Tealbook.  Going 
forward, growth should settle at 1¾ percent, as we expect the drag on spending 
exerted by uncertainty surrounding the Brexit negotiations to be offset by continued 
accommodative monetary policy and the weak sterling.

We estimate that headline inflation declined fr om 3.8 percent in the first quarter to 
3¼ percent in the second, reflecting lower energy prices that partly offset the boost 
from past currency depreciation.  As the effects of past depreciation wane, inflation is 
expected to gradually edge down toward the BOE’s 2 percent target.  This projection 
is a bit higher than in the June Tealbook, in part reflecting higher- than-anticipated 
readings on core inflation.   
We continue to anticipate that the BOE will keep its policy rate on hold this year and 
remain quite accommodative thereafter, given the slowdown in economic activity, 
sluggish wage growth, and uncertainties surrounding the Brexit negotiations.  But, 
in line with recent communications by the BOE and our higher inflation forecast, we 
moved up the timing of the first policy rate hike to the second quarter of 2018, two 
quarters earlier than assumed in the June Tealbook, followed by a second hike 
in 2019.  We now have the policy rate at the end of 2019 at ¾ percent, ¼ percentage 
point higher than we assumed in June.    
• Japan .  Recent indicators, such as the manufacturing PMI through June and the July 
reading of the Tankan survey, continue to show solid momentum in the economy and suggest that real GDP growth picked up to 2 percent in the second quarter.  We 
expect GDP growth to decline to a more sustainable pace, gradually edging dow n to 
¾ percent by the end of 2018, before stalling in 2019 as a result of a planned 
consumption tax hike.  Relative to the June Tealbook, this projection is a touch higher through mid -2018 owing to a weaker yen. 
Inflation in Japan has remained moribund despite a very tight labor market, and, in contrast to the other AFEs, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has refrained from discussing any monetary policy normalization plan.  In addition, although the BOJ has been 
purchasing assets at a slower pace than in previous years, it has continued to pursue 
its “yield curve control” policy of keeping its deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent and 
targeting a  rate around 0 percent for the yield on the 10- year Japanese government 
bond.  Accordingly, we still assume that the BOJ’s policy stance will remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period.  Against this background, inflation is projected to rise from an estimated rate of 0 percent in the second quarter to almost 
1¼ percent in 2019 (excluding the effect of the consumption tax hike), still well 
below the BOJ’s 2 percent target.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• Mexico.  We estimate that Mexican real GDP growth dropped from 2.7 percent in the 
first quarter to a disappointing 1½ percent pace in the second, ½ percentage point 
below our June Tealbook forecast.  Mexico has undertaken a program of budget 
cutting in order to stabilize public debt and boost investor confidence, and this fiscal consolidation has proven to be more of a drag on activity this year than we had 
previously thought.  Exports and household demand, which had both contributed to surprisingly strong g rowth in recent quarters, have also softened of late, and both 
residential and public investment have continued to decline amid tightening fiscal and monetary policies.  We expect economic growth to gradually move up to 2¾ percent by the end of the forecast period as this fiscal drag diminishes and as the effects of 
past exchange rate depre ciation and energy-sector reforms kick in. 
Headline inflation eased in the second quarter to a still-high 7 percent from nearly 10 percent in the first. Inflation is still being affected by last January’s fuel price 
hikes as well as by jumps in food prices.  Core inflation has remained well above the 3 percent inflation target, partly reflecting pass -through of past peso depreciation.  
To keep inflationary pressures at bay, the BOM continued to tighten policy in late 
June, raising its policy rate ¼ percentage point to 7 percent, 4 percentage points 
above its level at the start of its tightening phase in late 2015.  BOM policy 
communications have led us to remove our assumption of further rate hikes, and we actually now see some monetary policy easing i n early 2018.  We continue to see 
inflation moving back down to near the 3 percent inflation target by mid -2018. 
• Brazil. We now estimate that Brazil’s economy —after surging at a pace of 
4¼ percent in the first quarter —contracted slightly in the second, a step-down that 
was somewhat greater than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook.  The 
deceleration primarily reflects much weaker agricultural exports, which were boosted 
in the first quarter by a record harvest.  However, the most recent readings on 
economic activity have been upbeat, and we see growth returning to positive territory.  
But domestic demand remains very weak, restrained by tight monetary and fiscal 
policies as well as by an ongoing political crisis that has damaged prospects for 
much -needed reforms and has shaken business confidence.  We therefore expect the 
recovery to be tepid, with growth rising to only 2¼ percent by 2019.

Inflation fell to 3 percent in June on a 12-month basis, its lowest level in 10 years, 
reflecting both the steep recession and falling f ood prices; core inflation fell to 
4 percent.  With inflation well below the central bank’s target of 4½ percent and domestic demand still weak, we see the Brazilian central bank cutting the policy rate 
from its current level of 10.25 percent to 8.5 percent by the end of this year.  
Signaling its determination to keep inflation low, the Brazilian government recently lowered the inflation target to 4¼ percent for 2019 and 4 percent for 2020 and 
suggested that the target would eventually be reduced to 3 percent. 
• China.   Available indicators suggest that China’s real GDP growth slowed to a still-
solid 6¾ percent pace in the second quarter from 7.3 percent in the first.  The gradual 
reining in of credit growth by Chinese monetary authorities since the beginning of the 
year has restrained economic activity; in particular, infrastructure and property-
related investment growth have dipped.  Even so, industrial production and exports 
have held up better than we expected, leading us to revise up growth ¼ percentage point in the second quarter.  We see growth slowing further to 6¼ percent in the 
second half of the year as the authorities continue to gradually tighten credit growth.  
Growth moderates further to 5¾ percent by 2019, in line with declines in potential growth.  We see some risk that credit tightening could trigger an escalation of 
financial stress as vulnerabilities that have been building in the financial system are exposed, leading to a sharp decline in output and spillovers to other E MEs. 
Headline consumer price inflation bounced back to around 2¼ percent in the second quarter after a food -price -induced dip in the first quarter.  We expect inflation to 
remain stable at about the current pace, although rising core inflation in recent months suggests some upside risk to our forecast. 
• Other Emerging Asia.  While economic activity in the region remains relatively 
buoyant, GDP growth likely moderated to 4 percent in the second quarter from 
4.4 percent in the first.  Export growth slowed across the region following its 
supercharged pace in the previous few quarters, as the surge in demand for high- tech 
goods and imports from China moderated.  Industrial production has decelerated 
along with exports in several economies, but manufacturing P MIs remain fairly 
strong.  We expect GDP growth to moderate further to a trend -like 3½ percent pace 
by early next year, with slower growth in the region’s more export-oriented 
economies offsetting somewhat stronger growth in India.

Financial Market Developments 
Longer-dated nominal Treasury yields rose moderately over the i ntermeeting 
period, apparently driven in lar ge part by market perceptions o f a shift toward a 
somewhat less accommodative stance of monetary policy by some A FE central banks.1 
Consistent with this view, the do llar depreciated against most AFE currencies.  In 
contrast, FOMC communications were reportedly viewed by market participants as 
largely in line with previous c ommunications.  Market-implied p robabilities of an 
additional increase in the target range for the federal funds r ate by the end of the year 
were unchanged, on balance, even as the May CPI release came in  weaker than market 
participants had expected.  On ne t, domestic risky asset prices  were also little changed 
amid continued low volatility. 
 The market-implied probability of a n increase in the target ran ge for the 
federal funds rate by the end of the year was unchanged, on net , at just under 
50 percent. 
 Ten-year nominal Treasury yields  increased about 15 basis point s, on balance, 
over the intermeeting period, w ith large gains occurring on, an d in the few 
days after, remarks by ECB Presid ent Draghi and policymakers of  other AFE 
central banks that were interpreted as less accommodative than expected. 
 Yields on 10-year sovereign bonds i ncreased 27 basis points in the United 
Kingdom and more than 30 basis poi nts in Canada and Germany fol lowing 
less accommodative foreign c entral bank communications. 
1 On the morning after the Tealb ook closed, data for the June CP I and June retail sales were 
published.  Both of these releases were viewed as weaker than e xpected, and, as of 10 a.m., they prompted 
a decline in the market-implied probability of an additional in crease in the target rang e for the federal funds 
rate this year from just under 50 percent to just over 40 perce nt.  Additionally, 5- and 10-year nominal 
Treasury yields each declined ab out 4 basis points.  The broad dollar index also fell about ⅓ percent, and 
AFE sovereign yields fell slightly.  These changes are not refl ected in the remainder of this section.  
However, they would not materia lly affect the broad characteriz ation of financial market developments 
over the intermeeting period.

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Domestic Developments  
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were reportedl y viewed, on 
balance, as not materially altering market participants’ expect ations for the path of the 
federal funds rate.  Some market  participants wer e reportedly surprised by the degree to 
which the Chair’s remarks during t he press conference attribute d the recent soft inflation 
data to transitory fac tors.  However, market participants also took note of the discussion 
in the June FOMC minutes that while “most FOMC participants” pe rceived the recent 
softness in price data as “largely reflecting idiosyncratic fac tors,” “several” expressed 
concern that “progress toward the Committee’s 2 pe rcent longer- run inflation objective 
might have slowed.”  A straight  read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts suggests 
that the probability that market  participants attach to the nex t increase of the target range 
for the federal funds rate o ccurring by the end of the year rem ains just under 50 percent, 
despite having fallen for a tim e following the publication of t he May CPI release.2  While 
the market-implied probability of  the next rate hike occurring at the July meeting 
remained near zero, some probabili ty mass shifted from the Sept ember meeting to the 
December meeting.  Meanwhile, the expected path of the federal funds rate from the end 
of 2017 through the medium term was little changed. 
Market participants also inter preted the information provided i n the June FOMC 
statement on reinvestment policy and the Addendum to the Policy Normalization 
Principles and Plans as signaling that a change to the Committee’s SOMA reinvestment 
policy was likely to occur this year.  Market participants repo rtedly see the September 
meeting as the most likely timing for such an announcement, wit h several additional 
primary dealers having moved forward their modal call for the t iming of the 
announcement from the December meeting to the September meeting .  
While short-dated nominal Treasury yields were little changed o ver the 
intermeeting period, 5- and 10-year  yields incr eased about 10 basis points and 15 basis 
2 To the extent that a negative term premium is embedded in short-term rates, the market-implied 
probability of an increase in the  federal funds rate at upcomin g meetings suggested by a straight read of 
federal funds futures quotes ma y understate the true probabilit y.

points, respectively.  Nominal T reasury yields across maturitie s fell following the May 
inflation release, and those d eclines were only partially retraced after the communications 
from the June FOMC meeting th at occurred later that day.  Subse quently, however, 
intermediate- and longer-dated nomin al Treasury yields increase d substantially, likely 
reflecting in part a boost to term  premiums from the less-accom modative-than-expected 
remarks from ECB President Draghi on June 27 and later comments  by other AFE central 
bank officials that also signaled a less accommodative stance.  (For more details, see the 
box “Recent Actions and Communications by Foreign Central Banks ” in the International 
Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  Treasury yields ch anged little, on net, 
over the two days of the Chai r’s testimony to the Congress. 
  The net increase in longer-term  nominal yields over the inter meeting period 
came mostly through higher real yi elds rather th an inflation co mpensation, which also 
moved up some for the period.   
Despite their intermeeting peri od gains, longer-term real and n ominal Treasury 
yields remain very low by historic al standards.  The FOMC memo “Recent Movements 
in Longer-Term Treasury Yields:  Causes and Potential Policy Im plications,” by Board 
staff from the Divisions of M onetary Affairs, Research and Stat istics, and International 
Finance and by staff from the Fed eral Reserve Bank of New York,  dated July 14, 
provides an analysis of factor s weighing on Treasury yields sin ce December 2015. 
Broad U.S. equity price indexes were little changed, on net, since the June FOMC 
meeting amid sparse news about corporate earnings.  In addition , one-month-ahead 
option-implied and (trailing) rea lized volatility of the S&P 50 0 index remained 
historically low.  Most sect ors in the S&P 500 index posted neg ative returns, with the 
health-care and financial sec tors being notable exceptions.  Bi otechnology companies 
saw particularly strong returns, c onsistent with market participants reportedly anticipating 
health-care policies that are m ore lenient on drug pricing than  had been previously 
expected.  
Bank equity prices increased about  4 percent over the intermeet ing period, buoyed 
by recent increases in interest rat es; favorable results from the DFAST and CCAR stress 
tests, which all banks passed;  and related announcements that m any would significantly 
increase their planned capital distributions.  (For more analys is of financial firm equity

Since the U.S. election  last November, equity prices of domestic financial firms  
have significantly outperformed the broader market.  For example, over this 
period, indexes of stock  price s of large U.S. dealer banks and of  alternative asset 
managers  increased  33 percent , while the S&P 500 index rose less than half that 
amount  (figure 1).  To explain this differential performance, market participants 
have pointed to higher growth expectations from a shifted fiscal policy regime, the effect  of higher interest rates and a steeper yield curve in the post -election period , 
and expectations for lighter financial- sector  regulation .  In this discussion  we 
examine how well these factors explain the performance of financial equities since 
the U.S. election.  
As a first step, we calculate risk -adjusted returns ( that is , alphas ) from the  capital 
asset pricing model (CAPM).  As shown in f igure 2, many  domestic financial 
institutions earned significant  abnormal returns  in the post -election period.  In 
particular, large U.S. dealers and asset managers had the highest alphas.
1  To 
understand the factors that explain financial stocks’ abnormal performance, we regress firms’ estimated alphas on  three sets of explanatory variables : 
1. Inte rest rates :  Daily changes in the short -term interest rate (2 -year 
Treasury yield) and slope of the term structure ( 10-year minus 2 -year yield) ,  
2. Volatilit y:  Daily changes in equity (VIX) and fixed -income (MOVE) volatility  
indexes , and 
3. Regulatory sentiment :  Google search  indexes for “Dodd -Frank Act ” and 
“deregulation.”  
 
 
   
  
                                                 
1 The alphas are estimated using the CAPM betas from the two -year period before the U.S. 
election.  For more information on the methodology, see Lubomir Petrasek, Sean Savage, and 
Michael Ng  (2017), “Explaining the Post-Election Surge in Financial Stocks ,”  staff memo, Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Monetary Affairs, May 26.

 Our analysis reveals that much of the post -election rally in financial stock prices can 
be attributed to  macroeconomic factors.  Sp ecifically, we find that investors in 
financial stock s reacted positively to the higher level of  short -term interest rates 
and to the  steepening term structure of interest rates over this period.  These 
interest rate factors alone explain more than  40 percent  of the alphas of large U.S. 
dealers and banks in the post -election period ( figure 3 ).  Presumably, t hese factors 
tend to benefit banks and other lenders  by increasing such firms’ expected net 
interest margins  on balance . 
Although  market volatility has declined , on net , since the election , volatility spiked 
in the immediate aftermath of the election.  We find that the temporary increases 
in equity and fixed -income volatility  after the election are also related to the post -
election alphas of U.S. dealers and asset managers.  In theory, volatility should  
benefit broker- dealers’ trading business es through increased client  activity , while 
asset managers  would potentially benefit from increased trading opportunities 
and fund flows .  Our regression results  show that changes in v olatility  explain 
about 20  percent  of the time -series variation  of U.S. dealers ’ and asset managers ’ 
abnormal performance since the election.  
Finally, we find that our proxies of investor sentiment regarding  the potential for 
financial deregulation  also played a statistically  significant —albeit comparatively  
small—role in explaining U.S. dealers’ and banks’ post -election alphas.  In 
particular, the indexes of Google searches for the topics “Dodd -Frank Act” and 
“deregulation” explain  about  5 percent  of the abnormal performance of U.S. 
dealers  and banks  in the post -election period.  In contrast , we find that the  post -
election performance of foreign dealers is not significantly related to our 
sentiment  indexes, likely because foreign dealers are perceived to be less exposed 
to U.S. regulatory developments.  We note that our proxies are imperfect  and thus  
are likely to understate the im portance of regulatory sentiment on the stock price 
performance of domestic financial institutions.

but declined, on balance, for t he six largest banks. 
Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields of investment- and speculative-
grade nonfinancial corporate bonds  over comparable-maturity Tre asury securities edged 
down on net.  Spreads for investment-grade corporate bonds rema ined somewhat below 
the middle of their historical d istribution, while those for speculative-grade bonds 
remained near the bottom of the ir historical distribution.  
Foreign Developments 
Since the June FOMC meeting, the primary force behind foreign a sset price 
movements has been central bank c ommunications in the AFEs.  Co mmunications from 
the Bank of Canada (BOC), the ECB, and the Bank of England vari ously highlighted the 
improved economic outlook; the t emporary nature of the recent w eakness in inflation; 
and, in the case of the United K ingdom, the persistence of abov e-target inflation.  The 
BOC raised its policy rate in the July meeting.  On net, 10-yea r yields increased 27 basis 
points in the United Kingdom and more than 30 basis points in C anada and Germany, and 
2-year yields also i ncreased notably.  
The heightened focus on the potential for reduction in policy accommodation 
abroad weighed on the value of the dollar against AFE currencie s.  The dollar depreciated 
4 percent against the Canadia n dollar, 1¾ percent against the euro, and 1½ percent 
against the British pound.  The exception was a 3 percent appre ciation of the dollar 
against the Japanese yen, as th e Bank of Japan (BOJ) was viewed  as least likely among 
AFE central banks to change its policy any time soon.  The BOJ reaffirmed its 
commitment to keeping Japane se 10-year bond yields near zero by  conducting a fixed-
rate purchase operation.  The do llar edged down against EME currencies.  Taken 
together, the broad dollar depr eciated ¾ percent, on net, over the period. 
The performance of global equit y prices and other risky assets was somewhat 
mixed over the period.  AFE equit y prices were little changed, on net, while EME equity 
prices edged up.  European peripher al spreads narrowed over the  period following 
outcomes of the French parliame ntary election, Greek debt negot iation, and the Italian 
bank resolutions.  (For more di scussion, see the box “Implicati ons of Recent Euro-Area 
Bank Resolutions.”)  EME sovereign spreads widened slightly, on  net, while fund flows 
into EMEs decreased somewhat but remained positive overall.

Implications of Recent Euro- Area Bank Resolutions 
In June, EU authorities resolved three banks in the euro-area periphery —Banco Popular, a 
medium -sized Spanish lender, and Banca V eneto and Banca Popolare di Vicenza, two small 
Italian banks .  In early July, they also authorized the rescue of a medium -sized Italian bank, 
Monte dei Paschi (MPS) , under a state- funded recapitalization plan. Because these bank 
interventions are the first under the finalized rules of the EU banking union , they provide the 
first signals about how EU authorities will apply the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive 
(BRRD) and how the union’s Single Resolution Board (SRB ) will function . EU authorities used 
different approaches in each case .  This flexibility proved effective in containing negative 
spillovers but also highlights shortcomings in the banking union’s rules and institutions. 
All four banks had been under pressure to address capital and asset quality deficienc ies for at 
least one year before these interventions. MPS and Banco Popular were among the weakest 
performers in the most recent EU-wide stress test , the results of which were released in mid-
2016 .  Subsequently, MPS failed to raise needed capital in private markets and was forced to 
request state aid , while Banco Popular op enly sought a merger or sale after an internal audit 
revealed additional losses.  T he smaller Italian banks had struggled to raise capital since 
shortfalls were initially identified in the 2014 EU-wide stress test. In the process, they 
exhausted private aid provided through a support fund financed by other Italian banks. 
In most instances, the resolution and recovery of banks in the euro area are governed by the 
BRRD, a set of rules designed, in large part, to break the “doom loop” between bank rescues 
and national budgets by placing restrictions on the provision of public funds.  Under these 
rules, at least 8 percent of a bank’s liabilities —including senior liabili ties, if ne eded —have to 
absorb losses (that is, be “ bailed in ”) before state aid can be considered.  However, the 
framework allows for exceptions to the bail- in clause and gives EU authorities some discretion 
over how and to which banks they apply the rules. In tackling these cases, EU authorities relied 
extensively on this flexibility .  As a result, no senior creditors were bailed in, an event that many 
feared would lead to large negative spillovers. 
Banco Popular was resolved under BRRD rules , with no exceptions, and sold for one euro.  The 
resolution was smoothed by the presence of a ready buyer, Santander, which agreed to raise 
the private capital needed to absorb Popular’s assets in their entirety.  As a result, no public 
funds were us ed and bail- in of senior debt was not required . 
The two small Italian banks were ruled as not systemically important by the SRB . This 
distinction allowed EU authorities to take advantage of discretion within the framework to 
avoid resolution under BRRD rules and to instead pursue resolution under national bankruptcy 
procedures . Because Italian bankruptcy procedures do not require the 8 percent liability bail- in 
minimum, senior liabilities of the two banks, along with their good assets, were sold to 
dome stic leader Intesa.  To encourage Intesa to accept the deal, the Italian government 
provided it with state funds and guarantees of up to €17 billion (1 percent of Italian GDP) 
without the government taking an ownership stake.

 A plan to rescue (not resolv e) MPS was  approved under  a BRRD exception called 
“precautionary recapitalization .”  This  exception  permits state aid for solvent banks that have 
capital shortfalls under a stress test  while protecting senior liabilities from bail- in.  Unlike the 
Intesa  case, the injection of roughly €5 billion of state funds to MPS will give the Italian 
government an ownership stake, estimated at 70 percent  of the bank ’s equity . 
Market reaction  to these interventions  ranged from  muted to positive.  Bank share prices in 
Spain , Italy , and the broader euro area rose, on average, after the resolution actions ( figure 1).  
Spreads of Italian and Spanish 10 -year government bonds to German equivalents were also 
stable or slightly narrower ( figure 2).  This  market reaction contrasts markedly with previous 
bouts of localized bank  distress , which resulted in sizable negative spillovers to broader euro-
area bank equities and government bonds.  
However, because these resolutions of medium - and small- sized banks were facilitated by the 
presence of healthy buyers, it remains unclear whether EU authorities would be able to resolve 
larger and more systemically important  banks  as smoothly .  Moreover, EU authorities ’ 
approaches  to these first resolutions highlighted  shortcomings  in the banking union .    
First, the supervisory framework is not yet as effective as envisioned.  Although asset quality 
and capital deficiencies  at all four banks  were identified , deficiencies were not adequately 
remediated .  In addition, supervisors  were slow to declare the three resolved banks likely  to 
fail, a condition that  triggers the resolution process .  Second, significant amounts of state aid 
were used in the Italian case, casting doubt on the willingness of EU authorities to use the BRRD to break the doom loop between bank recapitalizations and national budgets.  Finally, 
the Italian resolutions  highlight the  lack of a  European  deposit  guarantee program , which had 
been proposed as an element of the banking union.  In Italy, deposit insurance is largely funded 
after the fact with  contributions from  domestic banks.  Absent public funds, the remaining 
banks would have had to cover the losses of the failed banks’ insured depositors —which many 
Italian lenders, weakened by bad loans and thin capital buffers, reportedly could ill afford.

SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
The effective federal funds rate rose in line with the 25 basis  point increase in the 
target range and held steady near t he middle of the target rang e except on the quarter-end 
date.  Overnight Eurodollar rates  closely tracked the effective  federal funds rate, while 
overnight Treasury repo rates continue to be just a little abov e the offering rate on the 
Federal Reserve overnight rever se repurchase agreement operatio ns.  Meanwhile, 
continuing the trend seen throughou t this FOMC tightening cycle , retail MMF yields 
increased only a fraction of t he policy rate increase.  And, un like the rates on other 
money market instruments, shorter-dated Treasury bills did not rise in response to the 
target range hike, which repor tedly is partially attributable t o a reduction in Treasury bill 
supply associated with sizable c orporate tax payments in June. 
Over the intermeeting period, ON RRP take-up averaged $196 bill ion except on 
the June quarter-end date, whe n take-up increased to $399 billi on, reflecting a temporary 
surge in participation by both prime and government MMFs.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Financing conditions for nonfinan cial businesses and households  in the second 
quarter have generally continued to be supportive of growth in spending and investment.  
However, respondents to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices (SLOOS) in July conti nued to report weaker demand for  business loans from 
banks and tighter lending standards for commercial real estate (CRE) and consumer loans 
on balance.  
 Net fundraising by nonfinancial fir ms slowed somewhat in June, bringing 
overall second-quarter net borrowing in line with the moderate first-quarter 
pace.  A reduction in corporate  bond issuance and continued slu ggish 
commercial and industrial (C&I) lending were offset by a reboun d in net 
originations of institutional leveraged loan. 
 Financing conditions for CRE transactions and projects remained 
accommodative, with loan growth at banks only gradually moderat ing amid 
reports of tightening credit sta ndards, particularly for constr uction and land 
development loans.   
 In municipal bond markets, there w as little broad-market imprint from Puerto 
Rico’s filing for court-supervis ed debt restructuring or from I llinois’s 
tumultuous budget negotiations.   
 Overall, consumer credit conti nued to grow at a moderate pace i n recent 
months despite ongoing tightening of  lending standards—especial ly for 
nonprime borrowers—reported by banks.    
 Residential mortgage credit re mained broadly available, and flo ws of new 
credit have continued at a moderate pace.

rate spreads narrowing somewha t further for both bonds and bank loans.  Gross issuance 
of corporate bonds stepped down i n June from a torrid pace in May.  In contrast, 
institutional leveraged loan i ssuance continued to be robust th rough June.  
C&I lending by banks remained qu ite weak in the second quarter,  with lending by 
domestic banks continuing to grow slowly and lending by foreign  banks continuing to 
contract somewhat.  Responses fro m the SLOOS indicated that dep ressed demand was 
largely responsible, and that banks’ standards were little chan ged.  The most cited reason 
for the lackluster loan demand was decreased investment by nonf inancial businesses, but 
banks also reported that some bo rrowers were shifting to other sources of financing or to 
using internally generated funds.  B anks also reported in the S LOOS that standards for 
most C&I loan categories were on t he easier end of the range th at has prevailed 
since 2005.  
Credit quality of nonfinancial corporations generally remained favorable over the 
intermeeting period, with relativ ely few upgrades or downgrades logged in June.  The 
trailing six-month bond default rate  remained near its lowest l evel since 2014, and 
aggregate expected year-ahea d defaults implied by Moody’s KMV w ere little changed, 
on net, in recent months, although expected defaults for oil fi rms increased a bit. 
Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations was solid in  the second 
quarter, mostly reflecting robust seasoned equity offerings.  T he volumes of announced 
share repurchases and of announced and completed mergers and acquisitions deals in the 
second quarter all decreased rel ative to year-ago levels. 
With few actual earnings repor ts on hand, second-quarter earnin gs for S&P 500 
firms are expected to increase m odestly relative to the first q uarter (on a seasonally 
adjusted basis), which implies robust earnings growth over year -ago levels.  The outlook 
for corporate earnings remains  favorable, and projections by Wa ll Street analysts for 
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 companies were essentially unrevised last month.   
Small Businesses 
The supply of credit continued to generally appear stable and a ccommodative, and 
although optimism among small bus iness owners remained high, th is positive outlook has 
not bolstered still-subdued dema nd for credit.  Delinquency rates on existing debt 
continued to edge up but remaine d quite low by historical stand ards.

Financing conditions for CRE remained accommodative, though loa n growth at 
banks has moderated somewhat amid reports of tightening credit standards, particularly 
in construction and land developmen t—the riskiest  loan category .  Banks also reported 
that the levels of standards on CRE loans were on the tight end  of their historical range, 
and that, on net, demand for CRE l oans has been weakening in re cent months.  Issuance 
of commercial mortgage-backed s ecurities (CMBS) through the fir st half of the year has 
been similar to the pace seen l ast year.  Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools 
originated before the crisis have  continued to inc rease as thes e loans mature and fail to 
refinance.  These delinquencies have largely been expected by m arket participants and 
have had no material effect to date  on credit availability or o ther market conditions (see 
the box “What Are the Implications  of the Sharp Rise in the Del inquency Rate for 
Commercial Mortgage-Backed Secur ities in This Ma rket?” in the M arch Tealbook).     
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on 
balance, and neither Puerto Rico’ s filing for court-supervised debt restructuring nor 
Illinois’s tumultuous budget negot iations left a noticeable imp rint on the broader 
municipal bond market.1  Gross bond issuance by state and local governments remained 
solid in June but was lower than a year ago.  Yields on 20-year  municipal bonds and their 
ratios over comparable-maturity T reasury yields were little cha nged relative to the time 
of the June FOMC meeting.  On net,  the credit quality of state and local governments 
deteriorated somewhat in June as credit rating downgrades outpaced upgrades, mostly 
reflecting reduced ratings on Illinois-related municipal bonds. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remaine d accommodative 
for most potential borrowers over the intermeeting period, and flows of new credit have 
continued at a moderate pace.  However, growth of loans on bank s’ books has slowed 
somewhat in the first half of this year.  This slowdown appears  to have been partly driven 
by a continuing shift of credit toward government-sponsored ent erprise (GSE) and 
1 Illinois’s budget issues have led to a substantial increase in  CDS spreads on Illinois’s bonds over 
the past two years.  Although a b udget proposal was passed in e arly July over the governor’s veto, Illinois’s 
credit rating remained under rev iew for possible downgrade by s ome rating agencies.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, as aggregate origin ations of home-
purchase mortgages have continue d to rise.  SLOOS respondents, on net, reported that 
standards on most loan categor ies were little changed.  Residential mortgage rates 
increased toward the end of the intermeeting period, in line with yields on longer-term 
Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), but remain low b y historical standards.  
Consumer Credit 
Consumer credit continued to grow  at a moderate rate on a year- over-year basis, 
notwithstanding the upward drift in interest ra tes.  Credit car d and auto lending appear to 
have moved out of the more rapid expansion phase of the credit cycle that was evident 
through the end of last year.  The less exuberant financing con ditions in consumer credit 
markets appear to be, in part, a response to rising delinquency  rates for some categories 
of loans, particularly for subprime borrowers.  In the July SLOOS, banks, on net, reported having tightened standard s and widened spreads for aut o and credit card loans, 
and the level of standards was re ported as being particularly tight for the subprime 
segments of these loan types.  Reflecting in part  continued tightening of lending 
standards, consumer loan growt h at banks moderated further in the second quarter; 
however, that weakness was part ially offset by more robust lend ing by credit unions. 
Finally, the issuance of consum er ABS remained robust in recent months amid tight 
spreads on such securities.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of econ omic activity as 
being in line, on balance, with t he average over the past 20 ye ars, the benchmark used by 
the FOMC.  On the one hand, many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted  
as reflective of macroeconomic  uncertainty—including options-ba sed indexes of 
expected stock market volatilit y (such as the VIX) and corporat e bond spreads—remain 
subdued, and we still see less unc ertainty associated with the foreign economic outlook 
than late last year.  On the othe r hand, we judge that notable uncertainty remains about 
the future direction of some fe deral government policies. 
The box “New Measures of Upside and Downside Risks to the Econo mic 
Outlook” and the exhibit that a ccompanies it present quantitati ve estimates of the 
distribution of risks around the staff outlook, conditional on available indicators of 
economic activity, inflation, financial stress, and macroeconomic volatility.  The current estimates of the conditional di stribution of risks around the s taff forecasts for GDP 
growth and for the unemployment ra te are not esp ecially wide compared with what they 
have been over the past two decades, nor are they particularly skewed. 
Consistent with those estimates, w e continue to judge the risks  around our 
medium-term projections for bot h GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced.  
As in the previous Tealbook, we c onsider the risks to our outlo ok associated with 
monetary policy possibly having to return to the effective lower bound (ELB) as having 
receded substantially from earlier in the recovery.  Based on s tochastic simulations in the 
FRB/US model around the current baseline forecast, we estimate that the probability of 
returning to the ELB sometime over the next three years is close to the steady-state value 
shown in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate.”
1 
1 As noted in the Domestic Economi c Developments and Outlook sec tion, we lowered our 
assumption for the long-run equ ilibrium rate of interest (r*) i n this forecast.  Because r* is the intercept 
term in the baseline monetary policy rule, the assumed path for  the federal funds rate is lower and, in turn, 
both the projected trajectory of  the ELB risk probability and i ts steady-state value are now higher.  (The 
methodology for calculating this  probability was described in the box “A Guidepost for Dropping Effective 
Lower Bound Risk from the Assessment of Risks” in the April 2017 Tealbook.)

 New  Measures  of Upside and Downside  Risks to the Economic  Outlook 
In this discussion,  we describe  a recently  developed  framework  that provides  estimates  of the 
magnitudes  of upside and downside  risks to key variables  in the staff’s baseline forecasts.1  By 
examining  the historical  record of staff forecast errors through the lens of a statistical  model, we  
find that several contemporaneously  available macroeconomic  and financial market indexes are 
significant  indicators  of risks to the forecasts.   This evidence  provides  a foundation  for our new 
measures  that gauge the risks  to current  economic  forecasts.  
                 
To accommodate  potentially  asymmetric risks to the  forecasts, our  framework  assumes  that 
forecast errors for the unemployment  rate, real GDP  growth, and headline  CPI inflation follow 
“double normal” distributions  with particular  shapes that vary over time.   An example  of this 
distribution  is shown in  figure 1.  In contrast  to a standard  (symme tric) normal distribution,  the 
double normal distribution  allows downside  risk to be  governed  by a parameter  σdown that can be 
different from  the parameter  that governs upside risk, σup.  In the figure, downside  risk is plotted 
to be greater than upside risk, although  this skew could be reversed.2  We use standard  statistical  
techniques  to estimate (1)  how both σdown and σup for staff forecast errors at a four ‐quarter 
horizon have varied over time  using historical  staff forecast errors from 1986 to 2016 and (2) the 
extent to which  that variation was  correlated  with a set  of indexes summarizing  macroeconomic  
and financial market conditions  that were available  contemporaneously.    
   
The indexes  that we find to be most useful for estimating  risks to  the staff forecasts  are shown in  
figure 2.  In panel A, an ind ex of several real activity  indicators  is plotted.  Our estimates  suggest 
that forecasts  constructed  when this  index is low (for example,  during recessions) tend  to have 
more pronounced  downside  risk for GDP  growth and greater upside risk for the  unemployment  
rate.  Panel B shows an index  of inflation.   We found that when this index  is relatively  high, the  
                                                 
1 For a more detailed description  of the statistical  methodology  and data  construction  used for this analysis, 
see Eric Engstrom  and Manuel Gonzalez ‐Astudillo (2017), “Time  Variation  in Upside  and Downside  Risks to the 
Staff Baseline Forecast,”  memorandum,  Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve System,  Division of Research  
and Statistics,  July 12.  
2 That the distribution  of staff forecast errors may be asymmetric  does not imply that the forecasts  are 
biased or inefficient.   Indeed, our analysis maintains  the assumption  that the staff’s assessment  of the modal 
outcomes  for macroeconomic  variables is correct, implying that  the mode of forecast errors is always zero.

 upside risk to  the forecast for headline  CPI inflation tends to be elevated.  Panel  C shows an index  
of financial market indicators.   When this indicator  is low (in periods  of elevated  financial stress), 
downside  risks to the GDP growth forecast and upside risks to the  unemployment  rate forecast  
tend to be exacerbated.   Panel D shows an indicator  of macroeconomic  uncertainty.   This index 
gauges the average month‐to‐month volatility  of more than 100 macroeconomic  series.  We  
found that when this index is elevated, the  confidence  intervals  for all three macroeconomic  
forecasts  are wider, with upside  risks to the staff’s inflation and unemployment  rate forecasts  
and downside  risks to the  staff’s foreca st for GDP growth being especially  affected.3 
 
The exhibit “Time ‐Varying Macroeconomic  Risk” presents time‐series estimates  of risks to the  
staff baseline economic  forecasts  that were generated  using our new framework.   As shown in  
the top panel, upside risk to the forecast for the unemployment  rate is estimated  to vary 
substantially  over time,  from about ½ percentage point during  quiescent periods  to more than 
2 percentage  points during periods of turbulence.   In contrast,  downside  risk to the  
unemployment  rate forecast  appears to be relatively  stable over time.   As shown in  the middle 
panel, upside risk for the  staff’s GDP growth forecast is estimated  to fluctuate  moderately  around 
2 percentage  points.  However,  downsid e risk tends to occasionally  surge, with the lower edge  of 
the interval plunging  from typical levels of around negative  2 percentage  points to around  
negative 4 percentage points  or lower at certain times.   The bottom  panel shows the distribution  
of staff forecast errors for inflation.   Upside risk for inflation  is estimated  to vary more strongly 
over time  than downside  risk, with upside  risk increasing  primarily  during periods of heightened  
macroeconomic  volatility.   
                                                 
3 Other instruments  that we tested but found to have less explanatory  power included measures  of 
economic  policy uncertainty  and survey‐based measures  of expected  future economic  activity.

With regard to inflation, we stil l see the current level of unc ertainty around our 
projection as in line with the  average over the past 20 years a nd the risks to the downside 
and upside as balanced; this asse ssment is consistent with the new quantitative estimates 
of the conditional distribution of  inflation forecast risks sho wn in the exhibit “Time-
Varying Macroeconomic Risk.”  To the downside, the recent run o f soft inflation 
readings could prove more persis tent than we have assumed.  Als o, the Michigan survey 
measure of longer-run inflation expectations has drifted down i n recent years and remains 
relatively low, although other surv ey-based indic ators of longer-run inflation expectations 
have not moved down.  In addition, U.S. monetary policy normali zation could generate a 
more substantial appreciation of t he dollar than we have anticipated in the baseline 
forecast.  To the upside, with the economy projected to be oper ating above its long-run 
potential, inflation may increas e more than in the staff foreca st, consistent with the 
predictions of models that empha size nonlinear effects of econo mic slack on inflation. 
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveilla nce assessment, whic h judges the vulnerabilities in the U.S. 
financial system as moderate.  V ulnerabilities stemming from as set valuation pressures 
have increased from a “notable” to an “elevated” level.  That a ssessment is driven 
primarily by high price-to-earnings  ratios and low implied vola tility in equity markets, a 
further narrowing of corporate  bond spreads, and historically l ow commercial real estate 
capitalization rates.  However, t hese valuation pressures have not been accompanied by 
an increase in other financia l vulnerabilities.  Borrowing in the nonfinancial sector 
continues to increase at only about the same pace as nominal GD P growth.  While 
leverage among corporations remains elevated, borrowing by the riskiest firms has 
slowed in recent years.  Vulnerab ilities from leverage in the financial system continue to 
be low, as capital positions at banks and at insurance companie s are high by historical 
standards.  Vulnerabilities fr om liquidity and maturity transformation also remain low, 
partly because large bank holding companies continue to maintai n historically high levels 
of liquid assets and the use of  short-term wholesale funding still has not picked up.  
Moreover, money market fund refor ms still appear to have reduce d run risk, as assets 
under management at potentially r iskier alternatives to prime money market funds have 
not grown rapidly.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st scenario explores the 
effects of combining two factors:   a stronger positive response  of wages to tightening 
labor market conditions and less- well-anchored long-run inflati on expectations.  In the 
second scenario, we consider the  implications of lower long-run  inflation expectations. 
The third scenario presents outcomes associated with a lower natural rate of 
unemployment, where policymakers and the staff only gradually recognize the deviation from the baseline.  The fourth s cenario illustrates the possibl e economic consequences of 
a substantial correction of a sset values in both the equity and  bond markets.  In the fifth 
scenario, we analyze the effect s of stronger foreign economic g rowth in combination with 
a faster normalization of moneta ry policy in AFEs.  The last sc enario contemplates the 
possibility that a slowdown in Chi na’s economy triggers financial turbulence in other 
EMEs, with significant spillovers to the global economy. 
We simulate these scenarios using two staff models.
2  Except where noted, the 
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in th e baseline.  The size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the bas eline paths in all of the 
scenarios. 
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US] 
Despite the tight labor and produc t markets in the baseline for ecast, core PCE 
price inflation is projecte d to reach 2 percent only in 2019.  This outlook is consistent 
with the combination of a flat Phillips curve and well-anchored  long-run inflation 
expectations—features incorporated in both the judgmental analy tical apparatus and the 
FRB/US model.  However, some recent research suggests that the relationship between 
labor utilization and wage grow th (and, in turn, price inflation in the FRB/US model) 
may be stronger when the labor market is tight.3  This scenario captures that risk by

economy, and SIGMA, whi ch is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

boosting the response of wages to t ightening labo r utilization,  and by assuming that long-
run inflation expectations become more sensitive to the higher realized price inflation that 
stems from faster wage growth.4 
Under these circumstances, inf lation increases to 2½ percent by  2019 and to 
3 percent by 2021.  In response to tha t higher path for inflati on, the federal funds rate 
increases more rapidly than in t he baseline; real longer-term i nterest rates are also slightly 
higher.  As a result, real GDP gr owth is a bit slower and the t rajectory for the 
unemployment rate is ¼ percentage point higher by the end of 2022. 
Lower Inflation Expe ctations [FRB/US] 
The Michigan survey measure of  median longer-run inflation expectations has 
trended down and is at a low level by the historical standards of this series.  In this 
scenario, we assume that the dow ntrend in the Michigan survey m easure is an indication 
that the longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage an d price setting are 
½ percentage point lower than i n the baseline in the second qua rter of 2017.  Thereafter, 
those expectations are affecte d by the economy’s experience of inflation to a greater 
extent than in the baseline.  Eventually, the conduct of moneta ry policy drives actual 
inflation and, hence, inflation e xpectations into line with the  FOMC’s 2 percent 
objective. 
Under these assumptions, headline inflation is 1¼  percent at an  annual rate in the 
second half of 2017 and rises t o only 1¾ percent by the end of 2019, ¼ percentage point 
below the baseline.  Inflation rem ains persistently below the 2  percent target in part 
because the baseline policy rule is quite inertial.  The federa l funds rate runs about 
¼ percentage point lower than the baseline for several years.  
Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment with Mi sperception [FRB/US] 
The baseline forecast anticipates that the unemployment rate wi ll fall slightly 
below 4 percent in 2019, around 1 per centage point below the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate of unemployment.  However, the natural rate is est imated with considerable 
4 In the calibration of this scena rio, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four tim es larger than in the 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the incr ease reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that cover s the late 1980s to the late 1990s. 
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this s cenario are well belo w those representing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

uncertainty and could be lower.  In this scenario, we assum e that the natural rate of 
unemployment has been 4 percent for the past few years and will remain at that level in 
the future.  We also assume that policymakers’ and the staff’s perceptions of the natural 
rate converge to its true leve l gradually over time and come in to full alignment with 
reality only at the end of 2022.  
Because the lower natural rate—a long with the correspondingly h igher level of 
potential—are not fully recognized until near the end of the si mulation period, the lower 
path of the unemployment rate i s (incorrectly) perceived as imp lying a more positive 
output gap than in the baseline , prompting a higher federal fun ds rate, all else being 
equal.  As events unfold in this scenario, the sl ightly tighter  stance of policy over the next 
few years holds real GDP growth be low the baseline for some tim e.  However, as 
policymakers and the staff come to recognize that resource util ization is less tight than 
they had initially perceived, the  federal funds rate eventually  moves below the baseline.  
GDP growth rises a touch above the baseline forecast in 2021, w hile the unemployment 
rate is ½ percentage point belo w it.  Inflation falls a shade b elow the Tealbook projection 
by the end of 2018.   
Market Correction [FRB/US] 
Broad equity market indexes have increased significantly since last year, even as 
common measures of future corpor ate profitability have not impr oved much.  Standard 
equity valuation measures, such as the price-to-earnings ratio,  suggest elevated valuation 
pressures.  Similarly, both invest ment-grade and high-yield bon d spreads currently are 
near their lowest levels since the financial crisis.  While som e of the decline in bond 
spreads reflects improvements in the credit quality of bond iss uers, estimates of bond risk 
premiums suggest that bondholders  are now more willing to take on risk. 
In this scenario, we assume t hat equity and bond risk premiums return more 
quickly to historically normal l evels.  By mid-2018, equity pri ces fall about 16 percent, 
while the term premium on Treasury securities r ises halfway to its assumed long-run 
value.  At the same time, the t riple-B corporate bond spread rises about 30 basis points 
above the baseline, enough to move it back close to its median historical value.  
Economic activity is further curtailed by an erosion in consume r and business sentiment. 
Primarily reflecting the deteri oration in sentiment assumed in this scenario, real 
GDP growth slows to about 1½ pe rcent in 2018, roughly ¾ percent age point less than in

the baseline.  The unem ployment rate remains roughly flat somewhat below 4½ percent 
through 2022.  With labor market resources less tight and infla tion modestly lower than 
in the baseline, the federal funds  rate rises more gradually an d is just under 3½ percent at 
the end of 2022, about ¼ percentage  point below the baseline ra te. 
Stronger Foreign Growth a nd Tighter Policy [SIGMA] 
Our baseline forecast envisions monetary policy normalization abroad— 
especially in the major AFEs—t o occur slowly as central banks r emain attentive to 
downside risks, particularly t o inflation.  However, the ongoin g strength in economic 
indicators could signal more buoyant foreign economic growth and lead to higher 
inflation than is currently in the baseline, inducing foreign c entral banks to embark on 
markedly faster policy tighteni ng.  In this scenario, we assume  that foreign GDP growth 
runs at over 3 percent per y ear in the second half of 2017 and in 2018, about 
¾ percentage point above the ba seline.  In addition, we assume that the improved outlook 
prompts AFE central banks to tig hten their policy rates more aggressively than what is 
prescribed by the baseline policy rule.  Higher interest rates abroad—including from a 
rise in term premiums—along with s ome reversal of earlier fligh t-to-safety flows into 
U.S. assets contribute to a 10 pe rcent depreciation of the broa d real dollar.    
Despite the sharp tightening of  monetary policy abroad and some spillovers of 
that tightening into U.S. interes t rates, U.S. activity benefits as stronger foreign growth 
and the weaker dollar boost net exports.  U.S. real GDP expands, on average, 2¼ percent 
in 2018 and 2019, about ¼ percentage poi nt more than in the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate falls to around 3½ percent by the end of 2019 .  Higher import prices 
and greater resource pressures cau se core PCE price inflation t o rise noticeably above 
2 percent in 2018 and 2019.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the 
baseline, increasing t o 3¾ percent by the end of 2019. 
China-Driven EME Turbulence [SIGMA] 
In our baseline forecast, we exp ect Chinese real GDP growth to gradually 
moderate from about 7 percent in t he first half of this year to  a still-solid 5¾ percent pace 
by the end of 2019.  However, given C hina’s underlying vulnerab ilities—including high 
corporate debt and a large and opa que shadow banking system—adverse shocks could 
trigger a quicker and more pronounced slowdown of Chinese GDP g rowth and renewed 
pressures on the renminbi, with negative spillovers to other EM Es.  This scenario 
assumes that such a risk materi alizes.  GDP growth in China and  other EMEs falls to only

2¾ percent and 1 percent, respe ctively, in 2018, as corporate b orrowing spreads increase 
sharply and confidence declines.5 
The financial and economic stresse s in EMEs also trigger a sizable rise in 
borrowing spreads in the United S tates and in the AFEs, while f light-to-safety flows 
cause the dollar to appreciate 10 percent and depress term prem iums on U.S. government 
bonds.  Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central  banks are assumed 
to tighten monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on inflation arising from the 
depreciation of their currencies.   
The appreciation of the dollar , weaker foreign economic activity, and adverse 
financial spillovers cause U.S. GDP growth to slow to about 1 percent in 2018 and the unemployment rate to rise to 4½ percent in 2019.  Weaker econom ic activity and lower 
import prices reduce core PCE  price inflation to about 1¼ perce nt in 2018.  The federal 
funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, risin g to 2½ percent by the end 
of 2019. 
5 In our baseline forecast, GDP g rowth in other EMEs (that is, ex China) is projected to be about 
2¾ percent in 2018.

This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies 
In this section , we consider a selection of strategies for setting  the federal funds 
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with 
those in the Tealbook baseline.  The simple rules and optimal control exercises reviewed 
here prescribe lower trajectories for the federal funds rate now than they did at the time of 
the June Tealbook.  These changes mainly reflect two adjustments to the staff projection.  
First, the outlook for inflation is a bit weaker in the near term .  Second , and more 
important, the staff lowered, by 50 basis points, its assessment of the real federal funds 
rate expected to prevai l in the long er run.  The box “The Equilibrium Real Rate in the 
Longer  Run” discusses some of the estimates of the real federal funds rate in the long run 
that informed the staff’s decision to lower its assessment. Even with these changes, m ost 
simple rules and optimal control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal 
funds rate over the next few years than is assumed in the staff forecast. 
In this Tealbook, w e have reintroduced a nominal income (NI) targeting rule  to 
the set of  simple policy rules routinely considered.  Under the NI target ing rule, monetary 
policy reacts to the gap between the level of actual nominal GDP and some 
predetermined level. In addition to minimizing the output and contemporaneous or 
projected inflatio n gaps (in common with other rules), this rule seeks to make up for past 
misses in inflation.   Accordingly, t he amount of stimulus that NI targeting delivers 
depends importantly on the target path for nominal GDP  and, in particular, on the initial 
deviatio n in nominal GDP  that policymakers seek to offset.  The version of the NI 
targeting rule considered here  seeks to make up for the cumulative shortfall in nominal 
GDP  growth since 2011:Q4, just before the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation 
objectiv e.  The target for NI rises at a rate consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective and the staff’s estimate of the path of real potential output; as a result, 
the NI targeting rule with a 2011:Q4 anchor inherits an NI  shortfall of about 2 percent  in 
the current quarter.1 This shortfall arises principally from the fact that , since 2011:Q4, 
inflation has run below the 2 percent objective.2 
1 The Monetary Policy Strategies section of the March 2016 Tealbook B illustrated the importance 
of the anchor date in NI targeting rules. 
2 The NI shortfall reflects an inflation gap of about 3 percentage points, which is only partially 
offset by a positive real GDP gap of 1 percent.

The Equilibrium Real Rate in the Longer Run 
The equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate in the longer run is the rate consistent with 
the economy operating at its potential once the cyclical effects of economic shocks have abated.  
This “longer- run equilibrium real rate,” along with the Committee’s inflation objective, 
determines the longer- run level of the nominal federal funds rate and other interest rates in the 
staff’s economic models.  T he longer- run equilibrium real rate is also a parameter in simple policy 
rules , including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in the Monetary Policy Strategies 
section.1 
Since June 2014, the staff has, in several steps, lowered its assumption for the longer- run 
equilibrium real rate from 2 percent to ½ percent , including a 50 basis point reduct ion in this 
Tealbook .  The median and range of the longer- run level of the real federal funds rate implied by 
FOMC participants’ projections reported in the Summary of Economic Projections have also 
declined. As discussed in the following, t hese revisions are consistent with a decline in the 
longer- run equilibrium real rate identified in econometric studies by Johannsen and Mertens 
(2015), Laubach and Williams (201 6), and others that model the co- movements of 
macroeconomic variables like inflation, interest rates, output, and unemployment.2 
The figure shows the estimated path of the longer-run equilibrium real rate from Johannsen and 
Mertens (2015) , with corresponding uncertainty bands, and the point estimates from Laubach 
and Williams (2016) . The figure also shows a measure of the actual real federal funds rate and 
highlights that the estimates from the t wo models have remain ed low in recent years . In 
particular, the most recent estimate from Laubach and Williams is near zero, and the Johannsen -
Mertens model places substantial probability on a longer- run equilibrium real rate that is less 
than 1 percent . 
Although the Laubach -Williams and Johannsen -Mertens modeling approaches are not identical, 
they have the common feature that they use time- series methods to model the co- movements of 
major variables like inflation, interest rates, output, and unemployment to infer the longer-run 
equilibrium interest rate.  Both approaches suggest very low estimates of the longer- run 
equilibrium interest rate.  This finding has been corroborated by a variety of studies that use 
either data or methodologies that are substantially different.  For instance, Gagnon, Johannsen, 
and Lopez- Salido (2016) , in a study emphasizing the role of demographics , have estimate d the 
longer- run equilibrium rate at about ½ percent and have suggested that demographic trends will

continue to be a source of downward pressure on rates for some time.  Christensen and 
Rudeb usch (2017) provide an alternative perspective by inferring the longer- run equilibrium 
interest rate mainly from financial market data.  Their point estimate is also near zero, and they 
too predict that the rate is “more likely than not” to remain low in the near term (p. 4) .3 
Furthermore, “model free” measures, such as the Treasury Inflation -Protected Securities five-
year, five-year- forward rate , remain low, though its movements could reflect changes in term 
premium s.  
In addition to the es timates discussed previously, we summarize, with the yellow bar in the 
figure, a range of point estimates of the longer- run equilibrium rate from a collection of empirical 
studies.  The range of point estimates spans from almost 0 to 1¾ percent .  Taken together, these 
studies indicate that the staff’s current assumption for the longer- run equilibrium rate is well 
within the range of empirical estimates, especially given that each of these estimates is subject 
to considerable uncertainty.  As the figure illustrates, the uncertainty bands around the longer-
run equilibrium real rate in the Johannsen -Mertens model are large.  Therefore, each study taken 
individually is only modestly informative about plausible values of the longer- run equilibrium rate, 
but the concordance of estimates using different data and modeling assumptions is somewhat 
reassuring. 
Note: Shaded regions are the 50 percent and 90 percent uncertainty bands from the Johannsen- Mertens 
model. The yellow bar displays a range of recent point estimates from the studies cited h erein in addition to 
estimat es from Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016) and Lewis and Vazquez -Grande (2017). The realized real 
federal funds rate is measured as the nominal federal funds rate less the four -quarter change in core PCE prices. 
Shaded vertical bars are NBER r ecession dates.

NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also 
known as the “balanced approach” rule) , a first -difference rule, and  the NI targeting rule .3 
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output gap and 
inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels, and, except for the first- difference 
rule, use the staff’s revised assumption for the longer-run real federal funds rate of 
50 basis points in the i ntercept term.  The top and middle panel s also provide the path for 
the federal funds rate used in the staff baseline, which is derived using a n inertial  version 
of the Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary adjustment to the intercept .  Because t his 
adjustment is small, the baseline rule provides essentially the same path for the federal 
funds rate as the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule without such adjustment, which 
we omit from the reported simulations. 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) policy rules in the 
third  and fourth quarter s of 2017 are about 75 basis points lower  than those 
made in the June Tealbook because of  both lower projected  inflation and the 
downward revision to the real federal funds rate in the long term.  The 
prescriptions from these rules, which do not feature interest rate smoothing 
terms, remain well above the Tealbook baseline policy path . 
• The near -term prescriptions of the first- difference rule are a little lower than in 
June, reflecting minor changes to the staff’s projection of the output gap over 
the next few quarters. 
• The NI targeting rule calls for values of the federal funds rate below the 
baseline Tealbook projection, primarily reflecting the cumulative shortfall in 
inflation since the end of 2011.  These prescriptions are also lower than  those 
that would have been made using the NI targeting rule under the June 
Tealbook projection because w eak inflation readings since then have widened 
the NI gap in the near term. 
3 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section.

A MEDIUM -TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US model given 
the staff’s baseline projection.  This Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period, would 
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• The current -quarter estimate of Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* is about 
5 basis p oints lower  than the one based on information from the time of the 
June Tealbook, reflecting a small downward revisi on to the trajectory of the 
output gap over the next few years .4 
• At 2. 16 percent, Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* is a little more than 
1½ percentage points above the staff’s estimate of the real federal funds rate 
in the longer run.  In addition, Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* is nearly 
1½ percentage points above the average projected real federal funds rate in the 
staff forecast for the same 12 -quarter period.   
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is 
below the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* because the policy reaction 
function us ed by the staff in constructing the baseline forecast includes an 
interest rate smoothing term and  reacts to both the output gap and inflation 
deviations from 2 percent and is therefore not designed to close the output gap 
over exactly three years . 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS 
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the NI targeting rule.5  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output 
4 The revision to the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r*, a medium -term concept, is smaller than the 
revision to the staff’s estimate of the real f ederal funds rate in the longer run. A key reason is that the 
revision only has a moderate effect on the staff’s assessment of medium -term economic dynamics. 
5 The simulated paths for each policy rule are obtained under the assumptions that policymakers 
are committed to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial market participants, 
price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through on this commitment 
but also understand the macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.

gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified 
policy rules.6 
• The policy rate p ath in the staff forecast is constructed using a  version of the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule with a minor downward adjustment to the intercept.  
The federal funds rate increases, on average, about 1 percentage point per year 
in 2017 and 2018 and reaches 3 percent  in the middle of 2019.  The pace of 
tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at almost 
4 percent in 2021 before moving toward its long -run level of 2½ percent. 
• The Taylor  (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate tightening in 
policy.  However, this tightening is less pronounced than in recent Tealbooks 
because of the revision to the real longer -term federal funds rate, which 
affects the intercept of these rules .  For the Taylor (1999) rule, the real federal 
funds rate lies above the Tealbook baseline through 2021, leading to a higher 
real 10 -year Treasury y ield through the early part of the simulation.  
Consistent with tighter financial c onditions, the unemployment rate is higher 
than under the Tealbook baseline through the middle of 2021.  The 
Taylor  (1993) rule calls for lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over 
the period shown because the first of these two rules responds less strongly to 
the projected rise in output above its potential level over the next several years. Later in the simulation  period, the real federal funds rate falls below 
the Tealbook baseline for a sustained period.  Market participants anticipat e 
these lower rates and, as a result, the real 10 -year Treasury yield is lower than 
the Tealbook baseline path over most of the simulation period.  The more accommodative financial conditions are associated with a higher trajectory for 
inflation and, eventually, a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate than 
under the Tealbook baseline. 
• The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate through 2019 than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower path for 
some years thereafter .  This latter divergence occurs because the first -

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to 
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core 
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation. Nominal Federal Funds Rate

in the decade and beyond.  The lower path of the federal funds rate after 2018, 
in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies 
lower longer -term real rates over the entire projection period than in the 
Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of resource utilization and 
inflation.  Thus, the first- difference rule generates outcomes for the 
unemployment rate that are below those associated with the baseline policy 
rule and inflation outcomes that are above those in the Tealbook ba seline 
projection. 
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate than the other rules because the NI targeting rule seeks to 
compensate for the cumulative shortfall of growth in the GDP deflator since 
the end  of 2011.  Because we assume that the commitment to closing this gap 
is credible, economic agents correctly anticipate this long period of low rates, 
leading to higher  inflation and low er real 10 -year Treasury rates  than under 
the other policy rules and th e Tealbook baseline.  The path for the 
unemployment rate is substantially lower than for all the other simulations shown, reaching a  minimum of 3¼ percent in the middle of 2020. 
• The policy rate p aths prescribed by each rule are lower than those conditional 
on the June Tealbook projection, reflecting the downward revisions to the real federal funds rate in the long run and to the near -term inflation forecast. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT 
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7 
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a 
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent 
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared 
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box 
"Optimal Control and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation. Nominal Federal Funds Rate

which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices, which 
may improve economic outcomes.8 
• The first simulation, “Equal weights,” presents the case in which policymakers are assumed to place the same weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s  2 percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.   Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is signif icantly 
higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path.  This higher path arises 
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome 
that these pol icymakers judge to be costly.  The tighter policy results in a path 
for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the 
Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited 
response of inflation to changes in levels of resource utilization  in the 
FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate 
is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate 
is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal 
weights; it is also below the Tealbook baseline path.  With the asymmetric 
loss function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the 
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered 
by an aversion to the undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this outcome.  Because the public believes that policymakers 
will follow through on this policy rate p ath even as the unemployment rate 
8 Under the optimal control policies sho wn in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic 
outcomes by m aking promises that bind future policymakers’ to take actions that will not be optimal from 
the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). Moreover, these 
promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  However , 
under the alternative assumption of optimal policy under discretion, which does not rely on the credibility 
of policymakers’ promises, the resul ts only differ significantly in the simulation in which there is an 
asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.

substantially undershoots its natural rate, the tighter labor market bring s 
inflation to 2 percent somewhat more quickly than in the case of equal 
weights .  Starting around 2025 (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a 
little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers seek to contain 
the inflation ary pressures stemming from a prolonged period with limited 
resource slack .9 
• The third simulation exercise, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a 
loss function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is 
five times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative 
than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with 
undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years.  The reason 
is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff 
because inflation responds only weakly to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment, which this specification of the loss function 
sees as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount. 
• The four th simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but 
that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting optimal strategy, the f ederal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than 
under the specification with equal weights in an effort to undo the projected 
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment ; the federal funds rate 
remains near 6 percent over much of the remain der of th e period  shown.  The 
paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 10 -year Treasury yield are 
also notably higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights.  
Because of the flat Phillips curve in FRB/US, this policy leaves the trajectory 
9 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium ter m under “asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time-inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to re -optimize the path of the federal funds rate 
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a t ighter 
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out 
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the 
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function . For the other three 
specifications of the loss function, the simulation results under commitment and discre tion are not much 
different from one another .

for inflation close to those of all except one of the other loss functions over 
the period shown, even though it keeps the unemployment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate.10 
• With the exception of the simulation with a minimal weight on rate 
adjustments, the federal funds rate paths prescribed  by optimal control under 
the above loss functions are about ¼ percentage point lower , on average, than 
in the June Tealbook over the period shown, reflecting lower projected 
inflation in the near term and the revision to the real longer -run federal 
funds rate.  
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described above. 
10 After 2022, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes above and 
sometimes below the case of equal weights.

Appendix 
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds ra te 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants , price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic 
implications  of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment 
strategies. 
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they m ay be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be d erived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives the expressions for the four simple policy 
rules reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  The t able also reports the expression for 
the inertial Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses an intercept -adjusted version of that rule in the 
construct ion of the Tealbook baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate for 
quarter t. The right -hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter co re 
PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output 
gap estimate for the current period ( ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead an nual

change in the output gap ( ∆4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, 
denoted πLR, is 2 percent. 
The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal income, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the l og of  the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value , denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 ∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the 
sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level 
it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1 
Simple Rules 
The first two of the selected rules were studie d by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have  been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 The intercepts of these four rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 , 
are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer -run inflation objective 
and a longer -run real federal funds rate of 0.5 percent.3  The prescriptions of the first- difference 
rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
Near -term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters . When the Tealbook is

expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and

published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand- side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inert ial rules, the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are conditional on the previous 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal 
funds rate in the current Tealbook f or the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy R ules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The “Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter 
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter 
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large- scale ec onometric model 
of the U.S. economy.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  The measure is 
derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR -based expectations— that is, 
agents u se small -scale statistical models so that their expectations o f future variables are 
determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the averag e of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and 
the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes 
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* 
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close 
the output gap at the e nd of this time frame , whereas in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal 
funds rate can vary over time. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulat ions are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations an d are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the

simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION O F OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In th e following e quation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽 0.9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all th ree components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty t o the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5  The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights. 
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

For each of these four specificati ons of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not af fect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits.

    1. Other means of financing include checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and changes in other financial assets and liabilities.
    2. Gross saving is the current account surplus plus consumption of fixed capital of the general government as well as government enterprises.    3. HEB is gross saving less gross investment (NIPA) of the federal government in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the staff's measure of potential output and the
natural rate of unemployment.  The sign on Change in HEB, as a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed.  Quarterly figures for change in HEB are not at annual rates.
    4. Fiscal impetus measures the contribution to growth of real GDP from fiscal policy actions at the general government level (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum of the direct contributionsto real GDP growth from changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution from real consumption and investment that is induced by discretionary policychanges in transfers and taxes.
