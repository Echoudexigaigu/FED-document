Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Notwithstanding the devastati on wrought by Hurricane Harvey, na tional output 
and employment still look on track to post above-trend increase s this year.1  Real GDP 
rose at a solid pace in the second quarter—and by more than we had estimated in the July 
Tealbook—following a lackluster f irst quarter.  Smoothing throu gh the quarterly swings 
in activity likely to be indu ced by Harvey, we expect output gr owth to average 3 percent 
at an annual rate in the second half of this year.  On this for ecast, real GDP will rise to 
nearly 1½ percent above potential  by year’s end, slightly more than in the July Tealbook.  
Labor market conditions have also continued to tighten, largely  as expected, with payroll 
employment gains through August running well above the pace req uired to absorb the 
trend growth in the labor force .  The unemployment rate, at 4.4  percent in August, has 
moved down 0.3 percentage point on net since the end of last year, and we expect it to 
decline a little further over  the remainder of the year.   
Beyond this year, we expect real GDP growth to slow gradually—t o 2¼ percent 
in 2018, 2 percent in 2019, and 1½ percen t in 2020—as monetary policy tightens.  We 
anticipate this slowing despite the small boost to growth from expansionary fiscal policy 
that we continue to assume will  begin next year.  Altogether, G DP stands a bit more than 
2 percent above potential by t he end of 2019, a touch higher th an in the July Tealbook.  
In 2020, with GDP rising less quick ly than potentia l, the outpu t gap begins to narrow.  
The unemployment rate is project ed to fall to 3.7 percent in 20 19 and then to hold at that 
level in 2020, about 1 per centage point below our revised estim ate of its natural rate.   
Smoothing through hurricane-related effects, our forecast for i nflation is about 
unrevised.  Although the incomi ng data on consumer prices throu gh July again surprised 
us slightly to the downside, we expect the monthly readings on core PCE price inflation 
to pick up modestly in the second ha lf of this year as recent l ow readings prove transitory 
and rising core import prices pass through to domestic consumer  prices.  As resource 
utilization tightens further a nd the anomalously low inflation readings of this year are not 
1 We are also monitoring Hurrican e Irma, which is projected to m ake landfall in Florida this 
weekend.  More than 19 million Floridians live in the projected  path of Hurricane Irma, including the 
Miami and Tampa metropolitan areas.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is above the project ions from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017 
but matches the Blue Chip forecast in 2018 . The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is 
below Blue Chip in 2017 and 2018 but matches the SPF forecast in 2017.  The s taff’s 
projection for CPI inflation is above Blue Chip in 2017 and 2018 and is above SPF in 2017. 
The staff’s projections for overall and core PCE price inflation are in line with the SPF 
forecast s in both 2017 and 2018 . 
Note: SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures. Blue Chip does not provide results for 
PCE price inflation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from about 
50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP 
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the June FOMC meeting.  The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection 
with the one we presented in the June Tealbook. 
Since June , we have revised up our projection for the increase in real GDP slightly in 2017 and 
by a similar amount over the next few years .  This upward revision comes despite the fact 
that in the July Tealbook we reduced the size of our assumed fiscal policy expansion.  T he 
unemployment rate falls somewhat more than in the June forecast and stands at 3.7 percent 
at the end of 2020 , reflecting both the somewhat faster pace of GDP growth and a 
0.1 percentage point downward revision to our estimate of the natural rate to 4.8 percent.  
On balance, resource utilization, as measured by the gap between the unemployment rate 
and its natural rate, is a little tighter in this projection . 
The news since June led to a slightly lower forecast for core PCE price inflation this year, but 
as we continue to view this year’s weak inflation readings as importantly reflecting 
idiosyncratic and transitory factors , inflation is essentially unrevised thereafter.  Total PCE 
inflation is still projected to move up modestly , reach ing 2 percent in 2019 and 2020 . 
Despite showing a marginally tighter GDP gap , the federal funds rate path from the 
intercept -adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our baseline forecast is below 
that of the June Tealbook, reflecting a downward revision to our estimate of r*. 1 
1 In the July Tealbook we revised down our estimate of r* in the long run by 50 basis points. Half of this 
downward revision reflected the smaller and less durable boost that we now expect from fiscal stimulus.

repeated, the pace of both total a nd core PCE price inflation i s projected to move up from 
1.5 percent this year to 1.9 pe rcent in 2018 and then to 2 perc ent in 2019 and 2020.   
Hurricane Harvey 
Historic rainfall and widesprea d flooding from Hurricane Harvey  have profoundly 
altered the lives of many indivi duals and severely disrupted ec onomic activity in 
Houston, the fourth-largest cit y in the United States, and othe r communities along the 
Gulf Coast.  The full extent of  the personal loss and property damage is still unknown, 
and with only limited data available , any estimate of Hurricane Harvey’s effect on the 
economy will necessarily be tentative. 
We currently estimate that Hu rricane Harvey will subtract ½ per centage point at 
an annual rate from GDP gr owth in the third quarter.2  As the level of pr oduction returns 
to its normal pre-hurricane path and a small portion of lost spending is made up, we 
anticipate a slightly larger  boost to growth in the fourth quarter.  Our review of past 
hurricanes suggests that the m akeup of the lost spending and production, as well as some 
rebuilding of damaged property, wil l be gradual and stretch over several years.  Thus, the 
anticipated effect of Hurricane Harvey on the contour of growth  in our medium-term 
forecast is negligible in any particular year. 
 The disruption of energy and petr ochemical production is the la rgest 
single channel by which Hurricane Harvey is adversely affecting 
economic activity.  Several large  oil refineries and petrochemi cal plants 
along the Gulf Coast of Texas wer e in the path of the storm.  A t the peak 
of the storm’s impact, 21 percent  of U.S. refining capacity was  offline, and 
another 8 percent was operati ng at reduced capacity.  In additi on, about 
60 percent of U.S. petrochemical capacity was shut down, and cr ude oil 
and natural gas production also slowed in the region.3  We estimate that 
the net loss in production in t he energy and petrochemical sect ors will 
subtract roughly 2 percentage point s at an annual rate from the  growth of 
2 Our estimate of Hurricane Harve y’s economic effect draws on analysis of previous hurricanes, 
specifics of the affected Gulf Coast economy, information colle cted by the Federal Reserve Banks 
(including Dallas, Atlanta, and Richmond), and high-frequency data on production and spending.  For more 
details, see the August 31, 2017, staff memo to the FOMC titled  “Preliminary Assessment of Effects of 
Hurricane Harvey on the U.S. Economy.” 
3 Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, it appe ars that many facilities remain 
offline and others are only slowly returning to normal operatio ns.  These lingering e ffects of the hurricane 
are expected to be a drag on the growth rate of industrial prod uction in September.

industrial production in the third quarter and about 0.3 percen tage point 
from the growth of GDP.  We have assumed that industrial produc tion 
returns to normal by the end of the year. 
We also anticipate that the hurricane will reduce consumer spen ding in the 
third quarter.  Consistent with this expectation, daily payment  transactions 
since the hurricane showed a sha rp drop in retail sales in the state of Texas 
(see figure below) and in Houston in particular.4  We expect the consumer 
spending channel to subtract ¼ per centage point from GDP growth  in the 
third quarter, with an offsetti ng boost to growth in the fourth  quarter as 
spending returns to normal.5 
4 These daily, geographically detailed spending series from cred it and debit transactions are the 
outcome of our collaboration with Palantir Technologies and Fir st Data Corporation as p art of our effort to 
expand the range of economic indicators we rely on to measure e conomic activity and price inflation. 
5 This estimate also reflects a dr ag from higher g asoline prices, a relatively modest effect on 
monthly new light vehicle sales, and a small assumed offset fro m government transfers to households for 
disaster relief.

 The destruction of homes, busines ses, public infrastructure, au tomobiles, 
and other personal property fro m high winds and flooding caused  by 
Hurricane Harvey was substantia l.  Estimates of property damage  are still 
evolving and generally range from $75 billion to $100 billion.  Over the 
next few years, we foresee addi tional residential construction and business 
investment to repair and partially replace damaged housing and 
capital stocks.6 
 We anticipate an increase in federal government outlays for hurricane 
relief of about $70 billion over the medium term, mostly in the  form of 
transfer payments to individua ls and businesses affected by the storm 
(including flood insurance payments).  
 Disruptions at refineries a re putting upward pressure on gasoli ne prices, 
and we expect national gasoline  prices to average $2.72 per gal lon in 
September on a seasonally adjus ted basis, an increase of $0.45 per gallon 
since August.  Prices are expect ed to remain elevated but edge lower in 
October and then return to pre- hurricane levels by November.  T his boost 
in gasoline prices contributes about 0.4 percen tage point to th e 12-month 
change in total PCE prices in S eptember and October.  We also n udged up 
core inflation by a couple of basis  points in September to refl ect a 
temporary effect of the hurricane  on non-energy prices (such as  airfares, 
housing services, and motor vehicles).  
 Both exports and imports through T exas ports have been disrupte d by 
Hurricane Harvey.  However, our bas eline estimate is that the c ontribution 
of net exports to GDP growth will be mostly unaffected as inter national 
trade flows will be rerouted t o other U.S. ports.  Petroleum ex ports may be 
harder to reroute given Texas’s  major role in producing and exp orting 
these goods.  However, because these exports are less than 5 pe rcent of 
U.S. exports of goods and services , even if petroleum exports w ere to 
temporarily decline, the effect  on the net export contribution would 
be modest.  
6 These reductions in the value of capital stocks  will probably have small implications for our 
estimates of capital services, potential output, and productivi ty.

 In terms of the national labor market, we anticipate some impri nt from 
Hurricane Harvey.  Indeed, the sha rp jump in initial unemployme nt 
insurance claims for the wee k ending on September 2 is reported ly related 
to the hurricane, though it was somewhat smaller than the tempo rary 
increases following Hurricanes  Katrina and Sandy.  We expect th at 
Hurricane Harvey will reduce priv ate payroll employment gains b y 50,000 
in September, with a rebound occu rring in October and November.7 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 Considerable uncertainty remains  about the potential size, timi ng, and 
composition of federal fiscal policy changes that may be enacte d during the 
forecast period.  That said, we have retained our placeholder a ssumption that 
adjustments to federal fiscal policy will increase the primary budget deficit 
(that is, the deficit excludi ng interest costs) by ½ percent of  GDP, and that this 
fiscal expansion will take the form of a cut in personal income  taxes that starts 
in the first quarter of 2018 and then will begin to phase out after five 
years.  This fiscal expansion is expe cted to boost the level of real G DP about 
¼ percent by the end of 2020, exclusive of multiplier effects a nd any offsets 
from higher interest rates  and a stronger dollar. 
 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government 
(including the small effects of  the assumed hurricane relief ou tlays) will have 
a roughly neutral effect on real GDP growth in 2017 but will boost output 
growth about ¼ percentage point per year in 2018, 2019, and 2020.   
 The federal government continues to face multiple fiscal deadli nes, though the 
horizon now appears to have been pushed back to December.  The most 
notable items requiring action are  the federal debt limit—we es timate the 
Treasury will exhaust its extraord inary measures in the first w eek of 
October—and appropriations for t he fiscal year beginning October 1.8  We 
7 The survey reference week for payroll employment in August was before Hurricane Harvey hit. 
8 A lapse of appropriations that results in a short-term shutdow n of the federal government would 
have only minor implications for the outlook.  For example, the  staff estimates that the 16-day shutdown in 
October 2013 reduced measured real  GDP growth by ¼ percentage p oint in the fourth quarter of that year

assume these deadlines will be na vigated such that there are no  meaningful 
disruptions to government operations or financial markets.  Ind eed, on 
September 8, the Congress passed legislation th at funds the gov ernment and 
raises the debt ceiling, both t hrough early December, and also provides a first 
installment of Hurricane Harvey a id; the legislation is expecte d to be signed 
by the President.9 
Monetary Policy 
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than  1 percentage point 
per year, on average, over the projection period and to average 3.9 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 2020.  This pa th is a bit steeper than in  the July Tealbook, 
reflecting the slightly tighter  economy we are projecting. 
 The SOMA portfolio is assumed to begin a gradual and predictabl e decline in 
the fourth quarter as reinvestme nts from principal repayments o n securities 
held in the portfolio are phased out. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise over the medium  term from an 
average of 2.3 percent in the c urrent quarter to 3.5 percent by  the end of 2020; 
by the end of 2019, the level of the 10-year yield is a touch h igher than our 
July projection.  
 The path of the 30-year fixed mor tgage rate is also little revi sed.  However, 
we lowered our projection for t he triple-B corporate bond sprea d slightly in 
the near term in response to the  persistently lower-than-projec ted spread 
observed over the past several months. 
and boosted it by an equal amount in the following quarter.  This calculation embodies our judgment that 
there were no material effects on  private investment or consump tion due to reduced confidence or increased 
uncertainty.  In contrast, the consequences of a failure to lift the debt ceiling are not well understood and 
could potentially be large.  (See the box “Debt Ceiling” in the  Financial Markets section.) 
9 Under the Senate bill, the Treasury Department would be able t o implement extraordinary 
measures; therefore, the next debt limit exhaustion date would not occur until sometime in early 2018.

Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 The change in equity prices sin ce the July Tealbook has been cl ose to our 
expectation.  As before, we see notable valuation pressures as limiting the 
scope for further stock price appreciation over the medium term .  
Accordingly, equity prices are pr ojected to rise at an average annual rate of 
only ½ percent from here forward, a bout the same as in the July  Tealbook.   
 Incoming data on house prices have been mostly in line with our expectations, 
and we have kept our forecast for  house price appreciation this  year around 
6 percent.  We judge that the ra tio of house prices to rents is  marginally above 
its long-run trend.  We project th e growth in home values to sl ow to about 
4 percent per year over the medium term, a pace that would stab ilize the ratio 
of house prices to rents.  
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
 Foreign real GDP growth pick ed up to an annual rate of 3¼ perce nt in the 
second quarter, ½ percentage point f aster than estimated in the  July Tealbook.  
This revision largely reflects stronger-than-expected growth in Canada, along 
with a gentler slowdown than we es timated in Mexico, and we exp ect foreign 
growth to moderate to 2¾ percent in the second half of this year, a bit stronger 
than forecast in July Tealbook.  F oreign growth is then project ed to settle at 
just above 2½ percent for the remainder of the forecast period, supported in 
part by accommodative m onetary policies.  
 The broad nominal dollar has depr eciated about 3  percent since the time of the 
July Tealbook, bringing the cumul ative depreciation since the D ecember 2016 
Tealbook to almost 7½ percent.  For the rest of the forecast pe riod, we expect 
the broad real dolla r to appreciate at a n annual rate of 1¾ per cent, as market 
expectations for the federal f unds rate move up toward the staf f forecast. 
Relative to the July Tealbook, the path of the broad real dolla r starts about 
3 percent lower, with the rate of  appreciation little revised.

the global economic outlook, Nig eria agreeing to cap production , and the 
increased likelihood of a three-m onth extension of the current OPEC 
production agreement.  These factor s mainly affect the near ter m, however, 
and futures prices for Bre nt have moved up only about $1 per barrel.10  In line 
with the relatively flat futures curve, we project that the pri ce of imported oil 
will be little cha nged over the projection period, averaging $4 8 per barrel. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We now estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3¼ perc ent in the second 
quarter, a noticeable step-up fro m the modest pace of growth in  the first quarter.  
Available indicators point to c ontinued, solid GDP growth in th e second half of the year, 
although, as discussed earlier, Hurricane Harvey will likely af fect the quarterly pattern of 
growth.11  For the year as a whole, we  now expect real GDP growth of 2½ percent, up 
¼ percentage point from the Ju ly Tealbook and 1 percentage poin t above our estimate of 
potential output growth.  
 Real PCE increased 3½ percent at  an annual rate in the second q uarter, a solid 
bounceback, as we had expected, from a tepid first quarter.  Th e pace of 
spending on most consumer goods remained firm through July.12  However, 
motor vehicle sales fell unexpectedly by ¾ million units in Aug ust.  Although 
we attribute only a small portion of  this decline to the hurric ane, we think the 
weakness in August will prove transitory.  More broadly, we are  projecting 
real PCE to increase 2¾ percen t in the second half, on average,  supported by 
ongoing gains in income and wealth as well as by upbeat consume r sentiment.  
In its annual revision in July, t he BEA substantially marked do wn its estimate 
of wage and salary income last year with only minor revisions to consumer 
10 Hurricane Harvey has had little  effect on the Br ent price of o il.  Reflecting reduced demand 
from refineries, the spot price of the domestic benchmark WTI i nitially declined $2 per barrel, but the price 
has returned to a level comparable to before Harvey. 
11 As displayed in the table “Fede ral Reserve System Nowcasts of 2017:Q3 Real GDP Growth,” 
the median of the proj ections generated by the near-term foreca sting approaches used within the System 
stands at 2.5 percent.  However, only the Kansas City Fed model  includes an explicit hurricane effect.  The 
staff’s judgmental pro jection excluding hu rricane effects is 2. 8 percent. 
12 The advance estimate of retail sales for August will be releas ed on Friday, September 15.  The 
Census Bureau’s advance estimate (with a small sample and poten tial reporting delays due to the storm) 
may not fully capture t he hurricane’s effect.

spending.  Thus, the personal sa ving rate in the second quarter  of this year is 
now 3.7 percent, about 1½ pe rcentage points le ss than in the Ju ly Tealbook.13 
 Investment in equipment and intan gibles rose at an annual rate of 7½ percent 
in the second quarter, and the lat est data point to a similarly  solid pace in the 
second half.  Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods continued to 
rise through July, and readings on business sentiment remain up beat.  Indeed, 
the 7 percent increase in invest ment in equipment and intangibles that we 
expect this year (which is some what stronger than in the July T ealbook) is a 
striking improvement from the lack of any growth last year.  
 We now expect that the sizable boos t to GDP growth from nonresi dential 
structures investment in the f irst half of this year will give way to a modest 
drag on output growth in the sec ond half.  A leveling off of th e number of oil 
rigs in operation and the fairly flat path for crude oil prices  suggest that the 
recovery of investment in drilli ng and mining structures will s low markedly 
this quarter and next, even aside f rom any hurricane-related disruptions.  
Outside of the energy sector , nonresidential construction spend ing is estimated 
to have fallen sharply in June a nd July; these monthly indicators led us to 
lower the near-term trajectory substantially. 
 Residential investment decline d at an annual rate of 6¼ percent in the second 
quarter following a sizable gain  in the first.  Most of the ava ilable data suggest 
a further decline but at a more modest pace in the second half of the year.  
Overall, the weakening in residential investment this year is b roadly 
consistent with the rise in mortgage rates since last fall.  In  addition, supply 
constraints also appear to be  weighing on construction in some markets.  (See 
the box “Supply Constraints in the Single-Family Housing Market.”) 
 Government purchases are expected to edge up in the second half of this year 
after declining in the first ha lf.  However, the latest data on both construction 
and employment in the state and local sector have been disappoi nting; 
13 This downward revision to the l evel of histori cal measured inc ome partially resolves what had 
been puzzling weakness in the level  of spending last year but  had little effect on our PCE growth forecast 
going forward.  For more discussion, see the nonfinancial staff briefing to the Board on May 22, 2017.

accordingly, the overall contribution of government purchases t o GDP growth 
this year is somewhat weaker  than in the July Tealbook.  
 Exports grew briskly in the first half of 2017, supported by st rong foreign 
GDP growth and the weakening in th e dollar.  In contrast, impor ts, after 
having surged in late  2016, returned to the ir earlier pattern o f being weaker 
than would be suggested by domestic demand growth and dollar mo vements.  
As a result, overall net exports made a positive contribution o f ¼ percentage 
point to U.S. GDP growth in the f irst half of this year.  We now look for a 
similar positive contribution in the second half.  These contri butions are 
revised up from the July Tealbook, m ainly reflecting stronger export and 
weaker import data than we expected.  
 Inventory investment was near z ero in the first half of this year, and the step-
down from the elevated pace of late last year s ubtracted ¾ percentage point 
from GDP growth.  Smoothing thr ough hurricane-related disruptio ns, 
inventory investment is expected  to return to more sustainable levels in the 
second half, providing a modest boost to GDP growth. 
 Manufacturing production rose at  an annual rate of about 2 percent in the first 
half of this year, but we expect  the gains in factory output to  soften some in 
the second half.  Readings on new orders in the regional and na tional 
manufacturing surveys remain upb eat, but, given elevated motor vehicle 
inventories, we expect output in that sector will provide only a modest 
impetus to production, on balance,  through the end of the year.14 
For the medium term, we projec t real GDP will increase 2¼ perce nt in 2018, 
2 percent in 2019, and 1½ percent in 2020.  This forecast for g radually slower growth 
over the next few years is littl e revised from the July Tealboo k and reflects the ongoing 
normalization of monetary policy. 
14 We project that light vehicle production will fall in the thir d quarter largely b ecause of problems 
with model-year changeovers and retooling in July.  However, with days’ supply remaining high, we 
project only a moderate rebound in fourth-quarter light vehicle  assemblies.

Supply Constraints in the Single -Family Housing Market 
The pace of single -family housing construction , the blue line in figure 1, remain s fairly slow by 
historical standards and appears insufficient to accommodate population growth, further economic 
expansion, and demographic changes.1 In recent years , much of the increase in home demand has 
been absorbed by declining vacancy rates (figure 2 ). Meanwhile, house prices —the black line in 
figure 1 —and rents have been rising at a steady clip, and the market for existing homes appears 
especially tight.  In combination, these patterns and the evidence presented in this discussion 
suggest that supply conditions in the single- family housing market are tighter today than before the 
recession.  
The Beige B ook and other sources report claims by home builders that they face shortages in the 
supply of construction labor; however, empirical evidence on such claims is mixed . On the one hand, 
the workweek for production workers in the construction industry, shown in figure 3, is above the 
levels observed during the housing boom in the mid -2000s. On the other hand, the elevated 
workweek has not translated to a sustained pickup in wage growth (figure 4 ). 
1 This discussion focuses on single- family homes to ensure consistency between data sources. Single- family 
homes account for the bulk of new construction and, with their relatively high value per unit, are an even larger share 
of residential investment.

Anecdotal reports have also pointed to short supplies of vacant developed lots —that is , graded 
parcels with road and plumbing connections.  The supply of such lots remains somewhat elevated in 
the aggregate, but this aggregate masks substanti al geographic heterogeneity. In particular, as 
shown by the red line in figure 5, the supply of vacant developed lots in “inelastic ” metropolitan 
areas —those facing geographic or regulatory barriers to development —has fallen substantially 
relative to pre- recession levels.2 Price changes (not shown) are consistent with lot availability 
inhibiting construction : Since the national house price trough in 2012, house prices have risen faster 
in inelastic metropolitan areas , such as New York and San Francisco, and slowe r in elastic areas , such 
as Houston and Atlanta. These patterns suggest that limited lot availability is restraining 
construction activity in a subset of areas . 
Supply conditions vary within metropolitan areas as well. Over the period from 2000 to 2015 , Census 
tracts between 2 and 10 miles from the city center— neighborhoods that are, for the most part, 
already built out—saw faster price growth but smaller net increases in the number of single- family 
homes than tracts beyond 10 miles ( figure 6).3 This pattern is suggestive of more- restrictive supply 
in the 2- to 10-mile band. These close- in neighborhoods face potentially binding regulatory 
constraints: With existing lots already built out, restrictive zoning laws commonly prevent the 
subdiv ision of large lots into townhouse or other dense development. Tracts b eyond 10 miles, by 
contrast, are more likely to include vacant land and thus have lower development costs . At the 
fringes of cities, regulations may include density or other restrictions but generally allow single-
family construction . 
The staff’s medium -term construction and house price projections are consistent with supply 
constraints restraining investment now and loosening somewhat over the projection period. 
Although it is difficult to precisely quantify the effects of easing supply constraints, the staff forecast 
calls for a continued strengthening in construction activity toward the pace we estimate to be 
consistent with demographic requirements and for a deceleration in house price growth. 
2 The elasticity estimates come from Albert Saiz (2010), “The Geographic Determinants of Housing Supply,” 
Quarterly Journal of Economics , vol. 125 (3), pp. 1253– 96. Saiz estimates city supply elasticities as functions of 
geographic features (for example, coastlines and mountains) and regulation (for instance, zoning laws). From 2000 
to 2015, the 11 inelastic metropolitan areas accounted for 22 percent of total net unit growth. 
3 Tracts within two miles are excluded; they are difficult to compare because of an abundance of multifamily 
housing, a different regulatory environment, and growing demand for urban amenities (see Victor Couture and Jessie 
Handbury (2017), “Urban Revival in America, 2000 to 2010,” working paper, University of Pennsylvania, July ).

 Relative to the July Tealbook, the  support provided to real activity from the 
lower exchange value of the dol lar is partly offset by higher p rojected 
interest rates.  
 We continue to assume that potential GDP growth will edge up to 1¾ percent 
by the end of the medium term.  With real GDP growth expected to outpace 
potential growth throughout much of the projection, resource utilization 
tightens further.  In 2020, real GDP is projected to exceed its potential level 
by 2 percent, nearly unrevised from the July Tealbook. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
On balance, the two employment reports received since the July Tealbook 
indicate that labor market condi tions continued to improve larg ely as we expected.   
 Private payroll gains are estimated to have averaged 191,000 pe r month over 
the past three months, about 15,000 m ore per month than in the July Tealbook 
projection.  However, government employment edged down, on aver age, over 
the same period and is now somewh at weaker than in the July Tea lbook, 
mainly reflecting softer estimat es for the state and local educ ation sector.15 
Since the start of the year, the monthly increase in total nonf arm payrolls has 
averaged 176,000, 11,000 lower than th e average gain over the w hole of 2016, 
because of flat government employment. 
 In the household survey, the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in August, a 
touch higher than expected.  The une mployment rate has been abo ut flat since 
April, but it is still 0.3 percentage point below the level at the end of last year.  
The labor force participation r ate came in at 62.9 percent in A ugust, 
0.2 percentage point higher than  expected, and has been close t o this level 
since the beginning of the year.  A s a result, the employment-t o-population 
ratio, at 60.1 percent in August , was one-tenth higher than exp ected and up 
0.2 percentage point since the  beginning of the year.  
 In the remaining months of the y ear, we expect the gains in tot al payroll 
employment to average a bout 190,000 per month, about 20,000 more than in 
15 We have taken only a small signal from these disappointing dat a for our forecast, as government 
payrolls—and, in particular, education payrolls—tend to be vola tile around this time of the year.

the July Tealbook.  We expect job g ains in September to be held  down about 
50,000 by the aftereffects of Hurrica ne Harvey but anticipate t hat this shortfall 
will be made up by November.  We con tinue to project that the u nemployment 
rate will average 4.2 percent in  the fourth quarter, while the participation rate 
is now expected to edge down only to 62.8 percent, 0.1 percentage point 
higher than in our pr evious projection. 
In response to the ongoing strengt h in labor force participatio n, we made a small 
upward revision to our estimate of the trend labor force partic ipation rate, raising its level 
0.1 percentage point at the end of  this year and 0.2 percentage  point by the end of 2020.  
We also revised down the natural rate of unemployment to 4.8 pe rcent.  Higher trend 
participation and the lower natural rate of unemployment led to a small upward 
adjustment in the level  of potential output.   
 Although the unemployment rate in August was a little (15 basis points) 
higher than we had expected at the time of the July Tealbook, t aking a longer 
perspective, the rate has come  down by more than we would have predicted 
6 or 12 months ago, given our usual Okun’s law relationship.  M oreover, 
inflation has been surprisingly low recently, and wage growth has remained 
modest.  Accordingly, we nudged down our  estimate of the natura l rate 
another tenth, to 4.8 percent at t he end of last year, and carr ied this revision 
through to the end of the medium-term projection. 
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little changed,  the outlook for the 
labor market is similar to  our July Tealbook projection.  
 After having decreased about 1¼ percentage points since early 2 015, the 
unemployment rate is projected t o decline anothe r ¾ percentage point over the 
next two years, reaching a low of 3.7 percent in 2019 and where  it remains in 
2020, 0.2 percentage point below the previous Tealbook.  One-te nth of the 
revision to the unemployment rate  reflects the downward adjustm ent to the 
natural rate; the other tenth ref lects tighter labor market con ditions.

 The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend next year 
and in 2019, as sustained job gain s and rising wages continue t o draw 
individuals into the labor for ce while also slowing outflows.  On net, the 
participation rate is projecte d to be ¼ percentage point above our new, higher 
estimate of its trend lev el at the end of 2019. 
 We project that productivity will increase slightly less than 1  percent per year 
over the forecast period---slightly below our estimate of its structural pace, 
though a little higher than its ave rage over the preceding several years.16 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The 12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.4 percent in July,  and we expect it 
to edge up only to 1.5 percent by year-end.  Taking account of hurricane-related effects 
on gasoline prices, we expect the  12-month change in total PCE prices to move up to 
1.9 percent in September before moving back down to 1.5 percent  by the end of the year.   
 Core consumer prices edged up in July, slightly less than we ha d expected.17 
We continue to view the negative surprises this y ear as largely  transitory, 
driven by idiosyncratic movements in a few specific categories,  and we 
project that core price infla tion will pick up modestly in the second half.  In 
response to the larger projected increases in import price infl ation over the 
remainder of the year, we slightly revised up our core PCE pric e projection for 
the second half of this year.  We continue to think that a small amount of 
residual seasonality will restra in the inflation readings in th e second half.18 
 PCE energy prices dropped in t he second quarter following sizab le increases 
in the previous two quarters.  Smoothing through the fluctuatio ns associated 
with the hurricane, we expect c onsumer energy prices to move up  modestly in 
the second half of this year. 
16 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pac e when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly because  a larger share of workers hired in a ti ght labor market have below-average 
productivity than is the case du ring a slack labor market. 
17 The August CPI will be release d on Thursday, September 14. 
18 Our current estimate (based on average effects over the past 10 years) is that residual seasonality 
in prices adds roughly 0.1 percentage point at an annual rate t o core PCE price inflation in the first half of 
the year and subtracts a comparable amount in the second half.

 PCE food prices have remained sof t, increasing only 1 percent a t an annual 
rate in the first half of this  year after having declined in 20 16.  We expect food 
price inflation to pick up slight ly over the second half of the year.  
 Core import price inflation is expected to step up from a 2½ percent pace in 
the second quarter to 4 percent  by the fourth quarter, reflecti ng recent dollar 
depreciation and higher commodit y prices.  Import price inflati on then slows 
to a ¾ percent pace by late 2018, consistent with moderate fore ign inflation, a 
gradually appreciating dollar , and slowly declining commodity prices. 
The latest readings on longer-term inflation expectations accor d with our view 
that these expectations r emain reasonably stable. 
 In the final August report from th e University of Michigan Surv eys of 
Consumers, the median inflati on expectation over the next 5 to 10 years was 
2.5 percent, near the midpoint see n over the past couple of yea rs but lower 
than the readings before then.   
 The August reading on median thr ee-year-ahead expected inflatio n from the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York ’s Survey of Consumer Expectati ons was 
2½ percent, at the low end of the  range of values observed this  year. 
 The median projection for 10-year  average PCE price inflation f rom the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (a reading taken in August) ticked back 
down to 2.0 percent in t he third quarter. 
 The TIPS-based measure of five-year-forward inflation compensat ion 
currently stands at 1¾ percent, l ittle changed from its value a t the time of the 
July Tealbook.   
Beyond the near term, our outlook f or inflation is unrevised.  We continue to 
project that both headline and core PCE price inflation will mo ve up to 1.9 percent next 
year and 2 percent in 2019 and 2020, as the transitory factors pushing down inflation this 
year abate and resource utiliz ation continues to tighten.19 
19 We have maintained for now our assumption that trend inflation  rises gradually from 1.8 percent 
in recent years to 1.9 per cent in 2019 and 2020.

The information received on hourly compensation since the July Tealbook sent 
mixed signals on underlying wage growth.  The latest readings o n average hourly 
earnings (AHE), the employment co st index, and the Atlanta Fed’ s Wage Growth Tracker 
are all broadly consistent with a gradual pickup in wage growth  over the past several 
years.  In contrast, compensat ion per hour was revised down sub stantially last year as a 
result of the BEA’s annual revisi on; we suspect that last year’s compensation per hour 
reading was anomalously low.  Taken together, we continue to fo recast that the relatively 
tight labor market will bring about a step-up in the growth of hourly compensation to a 
pace of 3 percent this year a nd around 3½ percent over the medium term. 
 The AHE of all employees in August was about as we expected in the July 
Tealbook.  It increased 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in  August, 
about even with the gain a year e arlier, but higher than the av erage pace seen 
before that.  
 The employment cost index (EC I) rose 2¼ percent in the second q uarter, in 
line with our forecast in the J uly Tealbook.  On a four-quarter  basis, ECI 
growth has picked up slightly in recent years.  
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3 .3 percent 
in July, below its recent highs but  still well above the pace o bserved a few 
years ago. 
 Compensation per hour is now estimated to have edged down 0.1 p ercent 
during 2016, a downward revision of  1¾ percentage points.  Grow th in the 
first half of this year was highe r than we had expected in the July Tealbook, 
but even so, the four-quarter c hange as of the second quarter o f 2017 is 
1¼ percent, well below the pace of more than 3 percent in 2015. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We lowered our assumption for the natural rate of unemployment to 
4.8 percent in the longer run.  We co ntinue to assume that the growth rate of 
potential GDP will be 1.7 percent.  
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing

extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by late 2021. 
 Real GDP growth slows to about  1¼ percent in 2021 and hovers ar ound that 
pace through 2023.  The unemployment rate moves up to 3.9 perce nt in 2021 
and rises gradually toward its assumed natural rate in subseque nt years.  
 PCE price inflation moves  up to 2.1 percent in 2021 and remains  slightly 
above the Committee’s long-run objective for several years befo re moving 
back to 2 percent.  
 With output above its potential le vel and inflation a bit over the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, the nominal  federal funds rate is about 1½  percentage 
points above its long-run valu e of 2.5 percent in 2021.  It the n moves back 
toward its long-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Recent data from abroad have reinforced  our narrative of a solid global expansion 
coupled with low inflation.  Foreign real GDP growth picked up further from an annual 
rate of 3 percent in the first quarter to 3.3 percent in the second —well above trend and 
½ percentage point higher  than estimated in the July Tealbook.  Stronger -than-expected 
growth in Canada, along with a gentler slow down than we estimated in  Mexico, 
contributed the most to the upward revision.  The sustained and broad-based pick up in 
foreign growth in the first half of 2017 has been supported by accommodative monetary 
policy , especially in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), and it has been 
accompanied by a recovery in international trade. 
We expect that foreign growth will moderate to 2¾ percent  in the second half 
of 2017 primarily as economic activity in Canada slows to a more sustainable pace.  This 
forecast is a bit  stronger relative to the July Tealbook , as we have taken some signal from 
the better -than-expected GDP data.  Thereafter, our outlook is little changed , as effects 
from greater momentum are largely offset by those from the recent appreciation of many 
currencies  against the dollar.  All told , we project that foreign growth will settle by early 
next year at a near -potential pace of  just above 2½ per cent. 
Foreign inflation surprised us on the downside in the second quarter, and recent 
data have remained somewhat weak .  In the AFEs, inflation declined to a meager 
0.3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from 2.3 percent in the first, largely 
reflecting plunging retail energy prices. Core inflation  held up better, though it also fell .  
Data through August suggest that overall AFE inflation will increase to 1 percent in the 
current quarter, but that is still a bit  lower than forecast in July.  A s retail energy prices 
stabilize and resource slack diminishes, we continue to project that inflation will rise 
toward the central banks’ 2 percent targets in most AFEs .  In the emerging market 
economies (EMEs), inflation came in  at 3.2 percent in the second quarter, about as 
expected .  We project that EME inflation will decline to 2½ percent in the current 
quarter, depressed by widespread declines in food prices , before settling at near 3 percent 
later in the forecast period . 
We continue to anticipate that monetary polic y will remain highly accommodative

discussing tapering its asset purchases, we now assume that the European Central Bank 
(ECB) will normaliz e its policy s tance a bit more gradually than assumed in the July 
Tealbook. We also see the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and the Bank of England (BOE) keeping 
their policies on hold a little longer than foreseen in July.  In Canada, in contrast, in 
response to the better -than- expected GDP data, the Bank of Canada (BOC) raised its 
policy rate in September , and we expect the BOC to tighten  its policy more rapidly than 
previously anticipated.  In the EMEs, several central banks have continued to ease policy, 
given the relatively low incoming inflation data , including in Brazil, Colombia, India, and 
Indonesia, while the Bank of Mexico (BOM) stopped its tightening  in June. 
Although our forecast calls for foreign inflation to gradually pick up, we cannot 
rule out the possibility that it w ill remain low  despite strong g rowth, especially in the 
AFEs,  prompt ing a slower normalization of AFE monetary policy and an appreciation of 
the dollar.  This risk is explored in the alternative scenario “Stronger Foreign Growth and 
Lower Inflation  in the AFEs” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  In addition, whereas 
financial markets have been fairly quiescent thus far in 2017 and many threats from 
abroad appear less pronounced than over the past several years, important risks remain. 
In particular, we continue to be concerned that the expansion of credit needed to support China’s strong growth may be further fuel ing financial imbalances. As such, we also 
feature a “China-Driven EME Turbulence with Financial Sp illovers ” alternative scenario 
in the Risks and Uncertainty section. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Canada. Real GDP growth strengthened further in the second quarter, to 4.5 percent, 
from an already robust pace of 3.7 percent in the first quarter.  Household 
consumption remained the key driver of growth, whereas residential investment 
contracted, in part because of measures taken over the past year that were aimed at 
slowing the rapid increases in house prices.  With GDP growth surprising on the 
upside—almost 2 percentage points higher than we had written down in July—and monthly indicators remaining strong, we see greater momentum in the economy ; 
accordingly, we have revised up our growth projection in the second half of this year 
½ percentage point to 2½ percent.  We still see growth slowing to about 1¾ percent 
(near potential) by early next year and staying at about that rate over the remainder of 
the forecast period.

Quarterly inflation slowed more sharply than expected in the second quarter, to about 
zero, as retail energy prices declined more markedly than anticipated  and core 
inflation came in surprisingly weak .  However, inflation showed some life in the July 
data, and we expect a reb ound to about 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the second half 
and to 2 percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  Citing the stronger GDP 
data, t he BOC unexpectedly raised its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points to 
1 percent  in September, marking its second str aight meeting with a rate hike .  With 
economic slack rapidly diminishing and inflation expected to rise, we now assume the 
BOC will tighten its policy further in each of the next three quarters , taking the 
overnight rate to 1.75 per cent by mid -2018.  We expect the policy rate to reach 
2.75 percent by end-2020 ; this path is ½ percentage point higher, on average, over the 
forecast period relative to the July Tealbook. 
• Japan.  The pace of activity picked up from 1.2 percent in the first quarter to 
2.5 percent in the second, well above the estimated trend pace of ½ percent . The 
positive tone of incoming data, including July’s rebound in exports, led us to revise 
up growth a bit this quarter and next.  Thereafter, w e see growth moderating to 
1 percent in 2018 before stalling in 2019 because of a legislated tax hike. 
Inflation  has continued to disappoint—with both overall and core inflation remaining 
negative in the second quarter—despite the relatively strong growth and a tight labor 
market. Accordingly, we now forecast that  inflation will edge  up to only ¼ percent i n 
the current quarter and rise to slightly above 1 percent by 2020, thus remaining well 
below the BOJ’s 2 percent target.  Against this background, we anticipate that the 
BOJ will keep the current settings of its “yield curve control” policy in place a bit 
longer than previously assumed, holding the deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent through 2020 and targeting a rate around 0 percent for the 10- year Japanese 
government bond yield through the end of 2018. 
• Euro Area.  Real GDP growth rose from 2.2 percent in the first quarter to 2.6 percent 
in the second, its fastest pace in more than two years.  Indicators through August, 
such as PMIs and surveys of economic sentiment, suggest that activity in the current 
quarter will continue to expand at a solid pace, supported by highly accommodative 
monetary policy.  Growth should then settle near 1¾ percent , a bit above potential, by 
mid-2018.  The outlook for 2018 and 2019 is down slightly from  the July Tealbook, 
reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro .

Quarterly i nflation fell to almost zero in the second quarter as the result of a sharp 
decline in retail energy prices .  Data through August suggest that retail energy prices 
have continued to decline, though at a slower pace.  On a 12-month basis, however, 
the numbers were more encouraging, with headline inflation at 1.5 percent in August; 
core inflation was 1.3 percent, well up from the average pace of 0.8 percent over 
the 2014–16 period.  W e forecast that headline inflation will remain near 1½ percent 
in 2018 but edge up to 1¾ percent by 2020.  Compared with the July Tealbook, this 
projection is down a touch because of the stronger  euro. 
Given the subdued inflation outlook and the concerns ECB officials have expressed 
about euro appreciation, we expect that monetary policy will be a bit more 
accommodative than we assumed in the July Tealbook.  At the press conference 
following the ECB’s September meeting, President Draghi acknowledged that the 
Governing Council started discussing the future trajectory of the asset purchase 
program and signaled that a decision could be reached in October ; however, as this 
discussion comes after several meetings in which the withdrawal of stimulus was not 
debated, it appears there is a lack of strong consensus on the way forward.  
Accordingly, w e now assume that the ECB will keep purchasing a ssets a bit longer 
than previously anticipated.  Amid considerable uncertainty as to exactly how its 
policy will evolve, we assume that the ECB will step down its monthly purchases 
from €60 billion to €30 billion in January  and maintain this pace until mid -2018, 
before tapering them to zero  over the third quarter.  We also delayed the first rate hike 
one quarter to early 2019. 
• United Kingdom.  E conomic activity has picked up a bit, with r eal GDP growth of 
1.2 percent in the second quarter relative to 0.9 percent in the first.  The main driver 
of growth was government spending, while private consumption slowed sharply.  
Incoming data on retail sales and PMIs suggest that growth will rise  to only 
1½ percent this quarter, ¼ percentage point lower than forecast in the July Tealbook.  
Going forward, growth should settle around a near -potential pace of 1¾ percent, as 
we expect the drag on spending exerted by Brexit -related uncertainties to be offset by 
continued accommodative monetary policy. 
Inflation , which had been boosted by the earlier depreciation of the exchange rate, fell 
from 3.9 percent in the first quarter to 3 percent in the second, and we forecast a 
further decline to 2 percent in the third, mainly due to fall ing retail energy prices .  We 
expect headline inflation to rise a bit at the end of this year as energy inflation

rebounds and the sterling depreciation continues  to pass through, but then to 
gradually edg e down to the BOE’s 2 percent target.   Even so, given recent 
disappointing data on activity, sluggish wage growth, and uncertainties surrounding 
Brexit  and its effects on the economy, w e anticipate that the BOE will remain quite 
accommodative, and we have moved the timing of the first policy rate increase to the 
third quarter of 2018, a quarter later than assumed in the July Tealbook.  The policy 
rate rises only to 1¼ percent by the end of the forecast period. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• China. Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth moderated a touch to 
6½ percent in the third quarter from 6.8 percent in the second.  Industrial production 
contracted in July after a very strong expansion in June.  Other indicators, such as 
PMIs and retai l sales, were solid, and investment has held up better than expected in 
the face of the authorities’ modest credit tightening since late last year. With the 
generally strong tone of data in recent quarters, we now expect economic activity to 
slow somewhat more gradually  over the forecast period than we did in the July 
Tealbook, to 6¼ percent by the fourth quarter and to 5¾ percent by 2020.  Inflation 
has remained subdued this year, albeit buffeted by swings in food prices, and we 
expect it to average 2½ pe rcent going forward .  
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth fell to 3.4 percent in the second quarter 
from an unusually strong 4.3 percent pace in the first.  This slowdown resulted 
primarily from  Korea and Taiwan, where exports took a breather, and India, where 
the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) appears to have disrupted 
activity.  We expect exports in the region to rebound in the third quarter as anticipated 
new product launches boost demand for the region’s high-tech products.  Incoming indicators, however, suggest that this rebound may be less pronounced than 
previously expected.  In addition, while we anticipate a bounceback in Indian growth, 
we expect the GST implementation  to continue to weigh on growth in the third 
quarter.  All told, we see growth edging up to 3¾ percent in the second half of the 
year and remaining at about that pace throughout the forecast period.  Relative to the 
July Tealbook, our forecast is down slightly in the current quarter but is up a touch over the rest of the forecast period, in line with the small upward revision to 
Chinese growth.

• Mexico.  Real GDP grew 2.3  percent in the second quarter, down from 2.7 percent in 
the first but ¾ percentage point above our July Tealbook estimate.  D emand -side 
components of GDP have not been released yet, but monthly indicators suggest that 
household demand held up better than we expected, while investment remained weak 
amid tight fiscal and monetary policies .  We expect the tight policy stance to continue 
to weigh on growth in the second half of the year but then see growth moving 
gradually up to 3 percent by the end of the forecast period, supported by diminishing 
fiscal drag, some monetary easing, and past reforms in the energy sector. A powerful 
earthquake struck off the coast of southern Mexico as the Tealbook was going to 
press.  Although early indications suggest that the damage is limited, the situation is 
still evolving. 
With the fading effects of January’s fuel price hikes, headline inflation eased from 
9.9 percent in the first quarter to 6.9 percent in the second, a still-high figure that 
reflected a sharp rise in food prices.  Data through August suggest that, although food 
inflation remains elevated, core inflation is falling.   We continue to see inflation 
moving back down, almost reaching the BOM’s 3 percent inflation target by early 
next year .  The BOM kept its policy rate unchanged at its August meeting , and w ith 
inflation project ed to move down further, we anticipate some easing in 2018 
and 2019. 
• Brazil.   Economic growth slipped from 4.2 percent in the first quarter to 1 percent  in 
the second, a step -down we largely expected, given that the first -quarter surge was 
driven by a temporary spike in agricultural exports.  Even so, household spending 
increased in the second quarter, and recent indicators, including industrial production 
for July , have been relatively upbeat.  Accordingly, we project that growth will 
increase slightly to 1½ percent in the current quarter.  However, with monetary and 
fiscal policies still tight, and political uncertainty weighing on investment, we 
continue to see growth rising only to a modest 2 percent by 2018 and 2¼ percent 
thereafter, despite Brazil’s emergence from the deepest recession in its history. 
Twelve- month inflation fell to 2. 5 percent in August , its lowest level in 18 years and 
below the lower end of the central bank’s target range.  Citing low inflation and a 
gradual recov ery, the central bank has cut its policy rate twice since the July 
Tealbook, by a cumulative  200 basis points to 8.25 percent .  We now expect the rate 
to fall to 7 percent by early 2018.

• Venezuela. The political and economic crisis has substantially deteriorated. 
Although official data on GDP and inflation have not been released since 2015, 
economic activity is collapsing and inflation is estimated to be approaching 
800 percent per year.  Amid rising social unrest, on July 30, the country held a high ly 
controversial election for a new assembly to rewrite the constitution, effectively 
empowering the government to dissolve the opposition-controlled congress.  
Subsequently, the U.S. government imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, prohibiting 
U.S. businesses from buying new debt issued by the Venezuelan government or 
government- controlled enti ties, such as the state o il firm PDVSA.

Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, longer-dated nominal Treasury yie lds moved lower 
on the heels of intensifying geopolitical risks and waning expectations for pro-growth 
U.S. fiscal policies but were little affected on balance by mixed economic data.  At the 
same time, the continued weak incoming inflation data appeared to weigh on 
expectations for monetary polic y.  Corporate bond spreads widened moderately while 
broad equity price indexes were little changed on net over the period, even as Hurricane 
Harvey and anticipation of Hurricane Irma’ s landfall pushed down share prices in the 
insurance industry.  Rates for T reasury bills maturing just ahe ad of the mid-October debt 
ceiling deadline initially rose during the intermeeting period but dropped back after 
reports that the Congress would pass a short-term debt limit ex tension.  Other short-term 
funding markets exhibite d no material effects.   
 A straight read of market quotes i mplies that the probabilities  of a rate 
increase at the September and the November meetings are close t o zero, while 
the probability of a rate hike occurring in December has declined to about 25 percent, although the true probability may well be higher du e to the 
presence of negative term premiums.  FOMC communications reinfo rced 
investors’ expectations that balance sheet normalization plans will be 
announced at the September meeting. 
 The 5- and 10-year Treasury yiel ds decreased 25 basis points an d 29 basis 
points, respectively.  Most of the declines reflect lower real yields, as the 
5- and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based measures of inflation compensati on were little 
changed on net.  Option-adjust ed spreads on production-coupon M BS moved 
slightly lower. 
 On net, broad U.S. equity price i ndexes were little changed.  T he VIX spiked 
twice in August in response to political uncertainties at home and abroad but 
was little changed on net over the intermeeting period.  Corpor ate bond yield 
spreads widened modestly.

 In the AFEs, both sovereign bond yi elds and equity prices declined, driven in

POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Domestic Developments  
Over the intermeeting period, FOM C communications were apparent ly 
interpreted as indicating a some what slower-than-expected pace of policy rate increases.  
Market participants were atten tive to the Committee’s assessmen t of recent below-
expectations CPI data and the ac knowledgment in the July FOMC minutes that inflation 
might continue to run below 2 percent for longer than expected.   A straight read of 
federal funds futures rates suggests that market participants n ow place essentially zero 
odds on the next rate hike occurri ng at either the September or  the November meeting.  
The odds of a rate hike at or before the December meeting decli ned from around 
50 percent to roughly 25 percent, t hough adjusting for term premiums would indicate 
higher odds.1  In addition, the OIS-implied f ederal funds rate at year-end in 2018 and 
2019 moved down 18 basis points and 30 basis points, respective ly, with a staff model 
attributing most of the declines  to decreases in expected rates . 
Meanwhile, market expectations that the Committee will announce  balance sheet 
normalization plans at the September meeting appeared to have s olidified further.  
Market participants interpreted both the Committee’s guidance in the July FOMC 
statement that it expects to be gin implementing its balance she et normalization program 
“relatively soon” and a passage i n the July FOMC minutes noting that most participants 
supported deferring the decision t o “an upcoming meeting” as signaling that the 
Committee is close to announci ng a change in reinvestment polic y. 
Nominal Treasury yields decrease d noticeably since the July FOMC meeting, led 
by longer-dated tenors.  Treasury yields fell following the July FOMC meeting and then 
dropped further with rising geopol itical tensions surrounding N orth Korea and, 
apparently, reduced prospects fo r implementation of the Administration’s economic 
1 According to one staff model, adjusting for term premiums woul d imply a probability of a rate 
hike by year-end of about 60 percent.  The September Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey indicated that 
the December meeting is still wide ly viewed as the most likely date for the next rate hike.

policy agenda.  While the marke t reportedly remained focused on  the continued weak 
inflation data, yields appear ed to be little affected on net by  the mixed bag of economic 
data releases.  Staff models attribute about half of the declin es in longer-term Treasury 
yields over the intermeeting period to declines in term premium s.  
Over the intermeeting period, bot h the 5-year and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based 
measures of inflation compensa tion were little changed on net.  The option-adjusted 
spreads of yields on the production-coupon MBS over Treasury yi elds moved slightly 
lower.  Market participants rep ortedly continue to expect a lim ited price effect from a 
reduced pace of MBS purchases by th e Federal Reserve following a change in the 
FOMC’s reinvestment policy.   
Since the July FOMC meeting, the S&P 500 index was little chang ed on net.  The 
one-month-ahead option-implied volatility of the S&P 500 index— the VIX—also 
changed little on net despite brief spikes associated with shif ts in geopolitical tensions 
and domestic political uncertainties.  Stock prices of utilitie s outperformed the broader 
market while banks underperforme d, which is typical when intere st rates fall.  Largely 
owing to the anticipated damag e from Hurricane Irma, on top of that from Hurricane 
Harvey, stocks in the S&P 500 Insurance group were down about 6  percent over the 
period.   
Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields of investment-g rade bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury s ecurities widened a bit on net bu t remained below the 
middle of their histo rical distributions.  S preads on speculati ve-grade bonds also rose but 
remained near the lower-end of the ir historical distributions. 
Foreign Developments 
Since the July FOMC meeting, ri sing tensions with North Korea and increased 
political uncertainty in the Unite d States resulted, at times, in an increase in volatility in 
financial markets.  Risky asset prices were mixed, on balance, with equity indexes falling 
in the AFEs and rising in most EMEs. 
Despite better-than-expected foreign economic data, long-term y ields in the AFEs 
declined, driven by escalating ge opolitical tensions, U.S. poli tical uncertainty, and 
foreign central bank communicatio ns.  As expected, the Bank of England kept its 
monetary policy stance uncha nged at its meeting on August 3 but  lowered its outlook for 
growth, which pushed yields lower .  The ECB also kept its polic ies unchanged at its

September 7 meeting, but communi cations over the period shifted  expectations toward a 
more gradual withdrawal of stimulus.  In contrast, the Bank of Canada surprised markets 
with a 25 basis point increase at its September 6 meeting.  On net since the July FOMC 
meeting, 10-year sovereign yiel ds are lower by nearly 30 basis points in the United 
Kingdom and Germany but are dow n only 8 basis points in Canada. 
The dollar continued to weake n on waning expectations of pro-gr owth U.S. fiscal 
policies and improving economic pr ospects abroad.  Since the previous FOMC meeting, 
the broad dollar index depreciated about 2¼ percent.  The decli ne was widespread:  The 
dollar declined by 4 percent agains t the Chinese renminbi, which was boosted by strong 
economic data prints and less pr essure from net capital outflows.  The euro appreciated 
on better-than-expected data releases, and the Canadian dollar rose after the Bank of 
Canada tightened policy sooner than expected.  Following escalating tensions in the Korean peninsula, the Korean w on modestly depreciated, while th e Japanese yen, 
commonly viewed as a safe-haven currency, appreciated. 
Despite generally better-than-expe cted earnings releases, most advanced economy 
stock market indexes declined s lightly, with bank stocks underp erforming broader 
indexes.  Outside of Korea, emerg ing market asset prices have b een largely resilient to 
the recent escalation of geopol itical risks, supported by lower interest rates in the 
advanced economies and higher commodity prices.  Most emerging market equity indexes climbed, with the notable exception of the Korean Kospi index, which fell 4 percent.  Net flows to emergi ng market mutual funds, which ha ve been positive since 
January, briefly turned negative in early August but have since  returned to positive 
territory.  EME sovereign spreads edged down. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
Following news of an agreement be tween the Administration and t he Congress to 
extend the debt ceiling by three months, rates on Treasury bills maturing in October retraced their entire increase f rom early in the intermeeting p eriod (see the box “Debt 
Ceiling”).  Outside of the Treasury bill market, conditions in domestic short-term funding 
markets remained stable over the intermeeting period.  Excludin g month-ends, the 
effective federal funds rate held steady at 1.16 percent, close ly tracked by the overnight 
Eurodollar rate.  Overnight triparty Treasury repo rates remain ed around the low end of 
the federal funds target ra nge.  Term funding rates, both secur ed and unsecured, also 
remained roughly flat.  Volumes across money markets were rough ly stable.  ON RRP

Debt Ceiling 
On September 6, the Administration and congressional leaders announced an 
agreement to extend the debt ceiling by three months.1 The U.S. Treasury had 
announced earlier that it would be critical for the Congress to act by September 
29; the Board staff had estimated that the Treasury could operate with the cash it 
would have on hand without breaching the debt ceiling until midOctober. 
Concerns about the possibility of an October debt ceiling impasse were apparent 
in Treasury yields during most of the intermeeting period. As shown by the red 
line in figure 1, yields on Treasury bills maturing in October increased by as many 
as 20 basis points, with one week forward bill rates (the red line in figure 2) 
showing the largest increase for the first week in October. Yields on Treasury 
coupon securities maturing around early October appeared to increase for some 
time as well.2 These increases were generally consistent with moves seen in 
previous debt limit episodes, though the rise in bill yields began much earlier than 
in previous episodes. Immediately following reports on September 6 of the 
forthcoming agreement, however, yields on bills maturing in early October 
retraced much of these moves (the black line in figure 2). 
1 At the time of writing this box, specific details on the agreement had not yet been 
released. 
2 Of note, yields on Treasury coupon securities can be volatile as they approach their 
maturity date, and it is therefore difficult to identify debt ceiling effects.

During the 2011 and 2013 debt ceiling impasses, money market funds (MMFs) 
experienced sizable net redemptions and made significant portfolio shifts. No 
evidence of serious concerns emerged among MMFs during the intermeeting 
period, although anecdotal reports indicated that some funds were avoiding 
Treasury securities maturing in October, and MMFs remain vulnerable to 
potential debt ceiling risks. Following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s 
MMF reforms, the government MMF sector today is much larger, with 
substantially greater holdings of Treasury securities than two years ago. As such, 
MMF redemptions and portfolio shifts could be sizable if a debt ceiling impasse 
extends close to an anticipated breach date. Moreover, “flight to quality” shifts 
in MMF portfolios could result in greater MMF usage of the Federal Reserve ON 
RRP facility than in past debt ceiling episodes, which would drain cash from the 
market.

Financi ng Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households continued to be 
accommodative and supportive of growth in spending and investment in recent months.  
The only markets in which terms and standards appear ed to have tightened are subprime 
auto loans and subprime credit cards.  Nonetheless, even in these markets conditions 
overall appeared  to be accommodative for subprime auto loans and only somewhat tight 
for subprime credit cards.  Most indicators of credit quality for businesses and households 
were consistent with strong loan and corporate bond performance, although delinquency 
rates continued to tick up for subprime auto and credit card loans.  
• Gross issuance was robust for both corporate bonds and e quities  in July and 
August.  I nstitutional leveraged loan issuance slowed in July , probably 
because of seasonal factors , after a strong pace of issuance in the first half of 
the year. 
• Bank lending to nonfinancial firms stayed relatively subdued in July and 
August.  Although commercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth ticked up 
from its pace in the first half of the year, it remained much weaker than earlier 
in the economic recovery.   
• Household debt continued to increase at a moderate pace in the second 
quarter, albeit at a slightly slower pace than disposable income.  
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Over the intermeeting period, financing conditions for large nonfinancia l firms 
remained accommodative.  Gross issuance of corporate bonds increased in August over 
its robust pace in July, and companies reportedly continued to earmark most of the proceeds of issuance for refinancing e xisting debt.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance 
in June continued its robust pace, although it slowed notably in July as it entered the 
typically quiet summer season.   Gross equity issuance was solid in July and August, 
mostly reflecting the pace of seasoned equity offerings.

C&I loan growth over July and August ticked up but remained weak .  Responses 
to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) 
suggest that lackluster demand was a key factor in this weakness earlier this summer, and 
more recent reports indicate that  loan demand has remained weak, especially at 
large banks. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained favorable over the 
intermeeting period.  The volume of corporate bond upgrades exceeded that of downgrades in both July and August, and the trailing bond default rate in July remained 
near its lowest level since 2014.  Meanwhile, the expected year-ahead default rate stayed 
near the midpoint of its historical range in August. 
The corporate earnings reporting season for the second quarter drew to a close 
over the intermeeting period .  Aggregate earnings for S&P 500 firms increased 
1.3 percent from their levels in the first quarter (seasonally adjusted ) and 10 percent over 
their year-ago levels .  The outlook for corporate earnings remained favorable through 
mid-August , as the strong projec tions by Wall Street analysts for year-ahead earnings for 
S&P  500 companies were essentially unrevised relative to the previous month.   
Small Businesses 
Overall, credit market conditions for small businesses have remained fairly stable, 
with small busine ss lending activity staying relatively flat in recent months.  The most 
recent Wells Fargo Small Business Index survey and the SLOOS  continued to suggest 
that the growth in small business lending activity is limited by weak demand for credit 
rather than by  tight credit standards.  Delinquency rates on existing debt remained just 
above record lows.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions for CRE remained accommodative, although loan growth at 
banks continued to moderate in July and August.  The weakening was concentrated in 
nonfarm nonresidential loans and in construction and land development loans, especially 
at large banks. Meanwhile, CMBS issuance so far this year has been in line with the 
same period last year. 
CMBS s preads decreased slightly sinc e the July FOMC meeting and remain ed 
near the lower end of the range seen since the financial crisis.  Delinquency rates on loans 
in CMBS pools also declined slightly but remained elevated for loans originated before

the crisis. However, as the staff has noted previously, these delinquencies were largely 
expected by market participants and do not appear to be hav ing a ny material effect s on 
credit availability or market conditions .1 Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages 
held by other financial institutions continued to drift down from low levels. 
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets continued to be accommodative on 
balance.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds remained solid  in August.  Yields on 20- year 
municipal bonds were little changed, and their ratios over comparable- maturit y Treasury 
yields increased a touch relative to the Ju ly FOMC meeting.   The credit quality of state 
and local governments improved in recent months, as the numbe r of credit rating 
upgrades notably outpaced the number of downgrades. While CDS spreads on Illinois 
bonds have been falling since the state’s budget was approved in early July, they 
remained very elevated . 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Residential Real Estate 
Financi ng conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative 
for most borrowers over the intermeeting period.  Mortgage rates decreased in line with 
longer- term Treasur y and MBS yields. The rate on 30 -year fixed -rate mortgages  now 
stand s at abo ut 3.9 percent, 20 basis points lower  than at the July FOMC meeting .  
Overall, historically low mortgage rates and accommodative mortgage credit availability 
have supported a continued increase in mortgage originations for home purchases.  
However, credit conditions remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or with hard-to-document incomes.  
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative, 
although lending standards and terms have tightened somewhat for auto and credit card 
loans, particularly in the subprime segments of these categories .  The tightening is likely 
a response, in part, to rising delinquenc y rates on  such loans, albeit from relatively low 
levels. Consistent with  the tighter standards in the subprime auto sector , auto loan

originations to subprime borrowers declined so far this year, and the average credit 
score of borrowers who took out auto loans in the second quarter remained close to the 
upper end of the range seen in recent years. Even so, auto loan credit appeared  to be 
available to most subprime borrowers, while s tandards for subprime credit cards we re 
somewhat tight. 
That said, overall consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace 
through the second quarter, with credit card, auto, and student loans all posting g rowth 
rates of around 6 percent on a year -over- year basis in June.  More -recent data indicate 
that growth in credit card balances at banks picked up somewhat further this summer.  
(The box “ Recent  Trends in Credit Borrowin g and Convenience Use” places the growth 
in credit card balances in a larger context .)  The ABS market continued to provide steady 
support for consumer lending.  In particular, year-to-date issuance of consumer ABS 
remained robust and outpaced that of the previous year amid tight er yield spreads and 
favorable market conditions.

Recent Trends in Credit Card Borrowing and Convenience Use 
Outstanding balances on credit cards have risen 5½ percent at an annual rate for the past 
three years, raising concerns that some households are becoming overextended. Unlike 
other types of household borrowing, however, not all increases in credit card balances 
represent higher household indebtedness. Aggregate credit card balances can rise when 
households use credit cards to pay for a larger share of their purchases even if such a 
shift in use generates additional “convenience balances” that are paid in full each month. 
This discussion introduces a new measure of the share of outstanding credit card 
balances that represents actual borrowing as opposed to convenience balances. The 
measure uses data collected from the Quarterly Report of Credit Card Plans . As shown by 
the black line in figure 1, this “borrowing share” of outstanding credit card balances 
hovered above 80 percent before the financial crisis. It then stepped up to more than 
90 percent in the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, likely reflecting card holders 
tapping credit cards to meet spending needs during this period of financial stress. Since 
early 2011 the share has been trending down, reaching about 77 percent in early 2017. 
Accordingly, although both convenience balances (the orange area in figure 1) and total 
balances have expanded to historical highs, balances associated with actual borrowing 
(the yellow area in figure 1) remain a bit below the precrisis peak level. The subdued 
increase in actual borrowing may reflect two factors. First, tight lending standards since 
the financial crisis made credit cards less available for borrowers with subprime credit 
histories. Such borrowers are more likely to be budget constrained than prime 
borrowers, and they are particularly likely to deploy their cards for borrowing rather than 
convenience use. Second, consistent with the broad post crisis trend of household 
deleveraging, credit card holders, in aggregate, may have become more cautious about 
accumulating debt. 
This trend, however, is not uniform across all lenders and households. Figure 2 shows our 
borrowing share measure for a particular institution whose credit card lending is 
concentrated in the subprime sector. In contrast to the aggregate measure, this measure 
has been rising steadily for three years. This heavy borrowing among the subset of 
subprime borrowers who are able to access credit card debt may help explain the recent 
rise in delinquencies among such borrowers.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of econ omic activity as 
being in line, on balance, with t he average over the past 20 ye ars, the benchmark used by 
the FOMC.  Many empirical indicato rs that are frequently interp reted as reflective of 
macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued:  Corporate bond sprea ds have largely 
moved sideways recently and remai n low, while the VIX has moved  up some but remains 
near the low end of its historical range.  In addition, we continue to see less uncertainty 
associated with the foreign ec onomic outlook than through most of last year.  That said, it 
appears to us that considerable  uncertainty remains about the f uture direction of several 
aspects of federal  fiscal policy.   
We continue to judge the risks a round our medium-term projectio ns for both GDP 
growth and the unemployment rate a s balanced.  Consistent with that view, estimates of 
the distribution of risks around the staff forecasts for GDP gr owth and the unemployment 
rate conditional on available in dicators, shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying 
Macroeconomic Risk,” are not part icularly skewed.  Moreover, the risks to our outlook 
associated with monetary policy having to return to the effecti ve lower bound (ELB) 
remain substantially lower than they were earlier in the recove ry.  Based on stochastic 
simulations in the FRB/US model around the current baseline for ecast, we estimate that 
the probability of returning to the ELB sometime over the next three years, shown in the 
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound R isk Estimate,” has moved down a  little since the 
previous Tealbook.1 
With regard to inflation, we stil l see the current level of unc ertainty around our 
projection as in line with the  average over the past 20 years a nd the risks to the downside 
and upside as roughly balanced.  This assessment is consistent with the estimates of the 
conditional distribution of inf lation forecast risks.  To the d ownside, the recent soft 
readings on inflation could prove to be more persistent than we  have assumed.  Also, the 
Michigan survey measure of longe r-run inflation expectations ha s drifted down since 
1 These ELB risk estimates and th e confidence inte rvals around t he baseline projection were 
calculated using the revised meth od for stochastic simulations described in the memo “A New Procedure 
for Generating the Stochastic Simulations in FRB/US” distribute d to Federal Reserve Bank research 
directors on September 7, 2017.

2013, and although it appears to have flattened out more recently, it remains at a low 
level.  However, other survey-b ased measures of longer-run infl ation expectations have 
not moved down.  To the upside, wit h the economy projected to b e operating above its 
long-run potential, inflation ma y increase more than in the sta ff forecast, consistent with 
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  The fir st two scenarios explore 
downside and upside risks to our  inflation outlook.  In the fir st scenario, a different 
inflation process is assumed in w hich both the wage and price P hillips curves are even 
flatter and inflation expectations  are lower, such that inflation remains pers istently below 
the FOMC’s 2 percent objective .  In contrast, the second scenar io examines the risk that 
the response of wages and, in turn, prices to a further tighten ing of labor market 
conditions will be stronger than we have assumed.  In the third  scenario, we present the 
implications of a negative shoc k to aggregate demand in an envi ronment of lower long-
run inflation expectations.  The f ourth scenario illustrates th e effects of a broad policy 
disappointment in which consumer, business, and investor expectations deteriorate 
markedly, as the anticipated f iscal expansion and reduction in regulatory burdens do not 
materialize. The fifth scenario  envisions that inflation in th e advanced foreign economies 
(AFEs) remains very low despite robust economic growth, inducin g AFE central banks to 
normalize policy more slowly tha n in the baseline.  The last sc enario considers the 
possibility that a slowdown in Chi na’s economy triggers financial turbulence in emerging 
market economies (EMEs), with s ignificant spillovers to advance d economies. 
We simulate these scenarios using three staff models.2  (Forecast errors over 
recent years from two of these models, FRB/US and EDO, are disc ussed in the box at the 
end of this section.)  In all of t he scenarios, the federal fun ds rate is governed by the same 
policy rule as in the baseline.  The size and composition of th e SOMA portfolio are 
assumed to follow the baseline pa ths in all of the scenarios. 
2 The models used are FRB/US, which  is a large-scale macroeconom etric model of the U.S. 
economy; EDO, which is an estimat ed medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy; 
and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

Different Inflation P rocess [FRB/US] 
In the baseline forecast, core PCE price inflation is projected  to reach 2 percent in 
2019.  This outlook is consistent w ith a relatively flat Phillips curve and well-anchored 
long-run inflation expectations—f eatures incorporated in both t he judgmental forecast 
apparatus and the FRB/US model .  However, it is possible that t he process for inflation 
has changed over the past two decades in ways that are not yet embedded in the baseline 
projection for inflation.  In part icular, the Phillips curve ma y be even flatter, and thus the 
projected tight economy may contri bute much less—if at all—to t he return of inflation to 
the 2 percent objective.  Furthermore, long-run inflation expec tations may prove more 
important for inflation dynamics  than in the baseline.  In this scenario, we reestimate the 
price–wage block of the FRB/US m odel on the (admittedly rather short) post-2000 
sample and indeed obtain a much flatter Phillips curve and a greater role for expectations 
than in the baseline version of the model.    
Under these circumstances, the flatter Phillips curve eliminate s the upward 
pressure to inflation from tightening labor resources in the ba seline.  Lower actual 
inflation feeds through into lower long-run inflation expectati ons and—given the greater 
role of these expectations in driv ing actual inflation—results in further downward 
pressure on inflation.  As a result, inflation hovers around 1½ percent until the end of 
2020 before edging up to only 1¾ percent in 2022.   
In response to the lower path for inflation, the federal funds rate increases less 
rapidly than in the baseline.  Real  GDP growth is a bit faster,  and the unemployment rate 
falls more rapidly, bottoming out at 3½ percent in 2020 and rem aining lower than in the 
baseline for some time thereafter. 
Steeper Phillips Curve [FRB/US] 
Alternatively, as labor and product markets continue to tighten , inflation could 
rise much faster than in the baseline.  Some recent research su ggests that the relationship 
between labor utiliza tion and wage growth, and hence price infl ation in the FRB/US 
model, may become stronger—the Ph illips curve may steepen—as the labor market

continues to tighten.3  This scenario captures that  risk by boosting the response of wages 
to tightening labor utilization.4 
Inflation reaches 2¾ percent  by 2022, compared with just over 2 percent in the 
baseline.  In response to the higher path of inflation, the fed eral funds rate increases more 
rapidly, peaking at 4½ percent in 2021; real longer-term intere st rates are also slightly 
higher.  Real GDP growth is a touch slower, and the unemploymen t rate is ¼ percentage 
point above the baseline by the end of 2022. 
Lower Inflation Expectations and Weaker Aggregate Demand [EDO] 
The baseline projection assumes th at inflation ex pectations are  roughly consistent 
with the Committee’s  2 percent objective.  H owever, those expec tations could be driven 
lower—for example, by the persis tent experience of inflation be low 2 percent in recent 
years.  In addition, inflation expectations may decline if households and firms perceive 
that the ELB introduces a si zable asymmetry in inflation dynami cs.5  In this scenario, we 
explore the implications of adve rse aggregate demand developments in an environment 
of low inflation expectations.  I n particular, expectations of inflation over the next 
five years fall 25 basis points rel ative to the baseline.  Against that background, an 
adverse shock to aggregate dema nd pushes inflation even further below the FOMC’s 
objective. 
Under these circumstances, real GDP growth slows to 1½ percent in the middle of 
2018 and then rebounds to 2¼ percent in 2019.  The unemployment  rate increases to 
4½ percent at the beginning of  2018, ½ percentage point above t he judgmental

Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vo l. 9 (13) (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank

4 In the calibration of this scena rio, we assume that the slope of the wage Phillip s curve is four 
times larger than in the current  version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the increase reflects a 
comparison between estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the 
late 1990s.  Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those 
representing inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

projection.  Inflation rem ains around 1½ percent in 2018 and 20 19 and then rises to only 
1¾ percent in 2021, ¼ percentage poin t below the baseline.  In response to persistently 
weaker inflation and lower resour ce utilization, the federal fu nds rate runs about 
¾ percentage point lower tha n the baseline in 2018 and 2019.   
Broad Policy Disappo intment with Market C orrection [FRB/US] 
In this scenario, we assume tha t federal policymakers fail to i mplement the fiscal 
expansion that is incorporated  in the baseline.  Other policy c hanges that financial market 
participants may have priced into current asset values, such as  an easing of regulatory 
burdens, also fail to materialize.6  Moreover, this scenario ass umes that the staff has not 
fully appreciated the positive effects on consumer and business  sentiment of anticipated 
fiscal and regulatory actions.  C onsequently, in addition to th e direct, conventional 
restraint on aggregate demand ste mming from the fact that the f iscal expansion does not 
materialize, economic activity is also curtailed by an erosion in consumer sentiment and 
an increase in perceived ris k by businesses and financial marke ts.  In particular, we 
assume that equity and bond risk pr emiums rise more quickly tha n in the baseline.  By 
mid-2018, equity prices fall about 15  percent, while the term premium on Treasury 
securities rises 40 basis points.  A t the same time, the triple -B corporate bond spread rises 
about 55 basis points above the baseline.7 
Primarily reflecting the deteri oration in sentiment assumed in this scenario, real 
GDP growth slows to ¾ percen t in 2018, roughly 1½ percentage points below the 
baseline.  The unemployment rate rises to its natural rate of 4 .8 percent in 2019, and 
inflation is a bit lower tha n in the baseline in the 2019–22 period.  With a lower level of 
resource utilization and slightl y lower inflation than in the baseline, the federal funds rate 
rises only very gradually aft er the first half of 2018, reachin g 2¼ percent at the end of 
2020, about 1½ percentage points be low the baseline rate. 
Stronger Foreign Growth and Lowe r Inflation in the Advanced For eign 
Economies [SIGMA] 
In our baseline forecast, we expect that inflation in the AFEs will gradually edge 
up to their central banks’ target s as output expands at a solid pace and labor markets 
progressively tighten.  This scen ario considers the possibility  that foreign activity in both 
6 To be clear, in both the baselin e and the alternative simulati on, regulatory relief is assumed to 
not affect the economy directly but rather indirectly through i ts effects on sentiment and asset values.

the AFEs and EMEs continues to surprise to the upside, but that inflation in the AFEs 
remains mired at undesirably low l evels, which in turn induces their central banks to 
normalize monetary policy more sl owly than in the baseline.  Sp ecifically, we assume 
that foreign GDP expands at an a verage pace of 3½ percent in 20 18 and 2019, about 
1 percentage point above the baselin e, but that AFE inflation r uns at only around 
1 percent through most of 2018.  The more accommodative monetar y policy stance in the 
AFEs pushes down AFE bond yields rel ative to the baseline, incl uding through effects on 
term premiums, and induces an app reciation of the broad real do llar of around 2 percent. 
These developments raise U.S . output, as the stimulus to net ex ports from higher 
foreign activity more than offset s the restraining influence of a slightly str onger dollar.  
In addition, because the easier monetary policy abroad reduces U.S. term premiums, 
domestic demand is also higher.  On net, U.S. real GDP expands 2½ percent in 2018, about ¼ percentage point more than in the baseline, and the une mployment rate dips 
below 3½ percent in 2019.  Core PCE inflation runs slightly above 2 percent over most of the forecast period, as the boost from stronger activity is onl y partly offset by the dollar 
appreciation.  The federal funds rate rises somewhat faster tha n in the baseline, increasing 
to 4½ percent by the end of 2020. 
China-Driven Emerging Market Economy Turbulence with Financial 
Spillovers [SIGMA] 
In our baseline forecast, we exp ect Chinese real GDP growth to gradually 
moderate from about 7 percent in t he first half of this year to  a still-solid 5¾ percent pace 
by the end of 2020.  However, given C hina’s underlying vulnerab ilities—including high 
corporate debt and a large and opa que shadow banking system—adverse shocks could 
trigger a quicker and more pronounced slowdown of Chinese GDP g rowth and renewed 
pressures on the renminbi, with negative spillovers to other EM Es.  This scenario 
assumes that such a risk materi alizes.  GDP growth in China and  other EMEs falls to just 
3 percent and 1 percent, respec tively, in 2018, as corporate bo rrowing spreads increase 
150 basis points and confidence declines.  The stresses in EMEs  also trigger a sizable rise 
in borrowing spreads in the Unite d States and in the AFEs, whil e flight-to-safety flows 
cause the dollar to appreciate 10 percent and depress term prem iums on U.S. government 
bonds.  Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central  banks are assumed 
to tighten monetary policy to mitigate the upward pressure on i nflation that arises from 
the depreciation of their currencies.   
The appreciation of the dollar , weaker foreign activity, and ad verse financial 
spillovers cause U.S. GDP growth to moderate to about 1¼ percen t in 2018 and the

Sources of FRB/US and EDO Forecast Errors 
This discussion reports realtime forecast errors for the FRB/US and EDO models over the past 
three years and compares them to the errors of the judgmental Tealbook projection.1 The 
forecast errors are then decomposed into contributions from the structural shocks inferred by 
the models. Such decompositions are useful, in part, because they can be used to understand the 
economics behind both forecast errors and revisions to models’ projections. 
Tables 1 and 2 report the forecast errors of the judgmental projecti on and of the FRB/US and EDO 
models in 2014, 2015, and 2016, computed using the judgmental and model forecasts as of the 
April Tealbook of the corresponding year. The tables also report the revisions to the 2017 
projections since April 2016. 
The FRB/US and EDO forecast errors are, on average, somewhat larger than the judgmental 
forecast errors, and neither model uniformly dominates the other one in forecasting 
performance. FRB/US slightly overpredicted GDP growth in 2016 as it did in 2015, while EDO 
projections were very close to the observed data. Like the judgmental projection, both models 
underpredicted the decline in unemplo yment in 2014 and 2015.2 In 2016, while the EDO model

core PCE inflation, and for the Q4 forecast for the unemployment rate.

2 The improvement in the forecasting accuracy for unemployment in the EDO model in 2016 relative to the 
two previous years is linked to a revision of the steady state level of unemployment to align it with the Tealbook 
assumptions about the natural rate of unemployment at that time.

was still surprised on the downside by unemployment, FRB/US predicted a sharper decline in the 
unemployment rate than the realized one, leading to a positive forecast error. FRB/US did well in 
forecasting total PCE inflation from 2014 to 2016. That said, both models viewed inflation as 
having been surprisingly weak in 2016, conditional on the fundamentals, which is in contrast to 
the view in the judgmental projection that inflation was unexpectedly strong, conditional on the 
fundamentals; both models have revised down their forecast for this year significantly. 
Overall, the economy in 2016 was somewhat weaker than the FRB/US model had projected, with 
lower GDP growth, a highe r unemployment rate, and weaker inflation. The lower than expected 
GDP growth in 2016 is accounted for by softer than expected fiscal data and weaker supply side 
conditions.3 The model largely attributed the upward surprise in the unemployment rate to 
transient labor market shocks. Similarly, the model attributed the bulk of the forecast error in 
core PCE inflation to “own” shocks affecting non energy price equations in other words, the 
surprise could not primarily be explained by misses in other conditioning variables such as slack. 
The smaller forecast error in headline PCE inflation reflects offsetting shocks to the energy sector 
equations. 
FRB/US promulgates a number of the shocks that resulted in forecast errors in 2016. For instance, 
the more adverse supply conditions are persistent, which, all else being equal, translates to a 
downward revision to the 2017 projectio n for GDP growth. However, these weaker supply side 
factors are partially offset by the more accommodative than expected stance of monetary policy 
since April 2016 FRB/US expected the path for the federal funds rate to follow that prescribed by 
the inertial Taylor rule, and the outc ome has been flatter. Likewise, the weaker non energy prices 
are propagated in the projection horizon, leading to a downward revision for both measures of 
inflation in 2017. 
Real activity in 2016 was a bit stronger than predicted by the EDO model, although, as previously 
mentioned, inflation surprised to the downside. The model interpreted the positive news about 
GDP growth as a transient improvement in productivity that offset softer than expected 
government and foreign spending and business investment. The model attributed the lower 
unemployment rate to softer than expected wages (shocks to the wage Phillips curve that made 
hiring more favorable). The lower inflation is attributed not only to these negative shocks to the 
wage Phillips curve, but also, given the upward surprise to GDP growth, directly to idiosyncratic 
movements in the price data, as in FRB/US. In the EDO model, these idiosyncratic movements 
take the form of negative shocks to the price Phillips curve. 
As in the FRB/US model, monetary policy in 2016 was more accommodative than the EDO model 
expected, and, as a result, the model projection for 2017 GDP growth was revised up and the 
unemployment rate was revised down. The model also projected forward the negative shocks to 
the wage Phillips curve—it revised down the projected path for wage growth, which contributed 
to a further downward revision to the projection for unemployment and also resulted in lower 
inflation. 
3 Over the course of 2016, the supply side assumptions in the judgmental forecast were also revised, 
including a reduction in the estimate of structural productivity growth.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies 
In this section, we consider a selection of strategies for setting the federal funds 
rate and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with 
those in the Tealbook baseline.  The simple rules and optimal control exercises reviewed 
below prescribe trajectories for the federal funds rate that are little changed or slightly 
higher than in the July Tealbook, r eflect ing the staff’s small upward revisions to the 
projected output gap.  In the special exhibit “ Implications of Policy Inertia in a 
Recession ,” we discuss a number of monetary policy strategies in a recession scenario. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also 
known as the “balanced approach” rule) , a first -difference rule, and a nominal income 
(NI) targeting rule .1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for 
the output gap and inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels, and, except for the first -difference rule, use the staff’s assumption for the longer-run real federal funds 
rate of 50  basis points as the intercept term.  The middle panel also provides the staff’s 
baseline path for the federal funds rate , which is constructed using a n inertial version of 
the Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary adjustment to the intercept.  Because this 
adjustment is small, the baseline rule yields essentially the same path for the federal 
funds rate as the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule without the temporary 
adjustment; we therefore omit results under the latter rule. 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules are slightly 
higher than  in the July Tealbook, reflecting the small upward revisions to the 
staff’s forecasts  of the output gap.  The prescriptions from these rules, which 
do not feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the Tealbook 
baseline po licy path. 
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section.

• The prescriptions of the first-difference rule are a bit higher than those in the 
July Tealbook, reflecting small upward revisions in the staff’s near -term 
projections of core inflation and the change in the output gap. 
• Under the NI targeting ru le, monetary policy reacts to the gap between the 
level of actual nominal GDP and a target  path determined by growth in 
potential output plus 2 percent inflation.  The nominal income gap can be 
expressed as the sum of the current output gap and the shortfa ll of the GDP 
deflator from the level it would have attained had it increased at an annual rate 
of 2 percent since a reference date.  The amount of stimulus that NI targeting 
delivers depends importantly on the initial deviation in nominal GDP that 
policym akers seek to offset. In our implementation, the reference date is 
2011:Q4, and the initial shortfall in nominal GDP is 3.5 percent.  As a result, 
unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, the NI targeting rule 
does not call for raising the federal funds rate in the near term .

of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that is generated using the FRB/US mod el given 
the staff’s baseline projection.  This Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period, would 
bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• At 2.32 percent, t he estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* is slightly 
higher than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s small upward revisions 
to the projected output gap. 
• The average projected real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline is 
1½ percentage points below the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* because the 
policy reaction function used by the staff in constructing the baseline forecast includes an interest rate smoothing term, reacts to both the output gap and inflation deviations from 2 percent , and, more generally , is not designed to 
close the output gap in three years.

SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS 
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and 
the NI targeting rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output 
gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified 
policy rules.2 The simulations are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers 
commit to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial market 
participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow 
through on this commitment, but also understand the macroeconomic implications of 
policymakers doing so.3 
• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, t he federal funds rate increases, on 
average, a little more than ¼  percentage point per quarter through early 2019.  
The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 
4 percent in 2021 before slowly moving toward its long er-run level of 
2½ percent. 
• The Taylor  (1999 ) rule call s for an immediate , large tightening in policy. The 
real federal funds rate lies above the Teal book baseline through 2021, leading 
to a higher real 10-year Treasury y ield through 2019.  Consistent with the 
tighter financial conditions, the unemployment rate is higher than under the Tealbook baseline through 2021.   
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate tightening in policy but 
prescribes lower policy rates than the Taylor (1999) rule over the period 
shown because it responds less strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level. The real federal funds rate falls below the Tealbook 
baseline for a sustained period  starting in 2020.  Market participants anticipate 
these lower rates and, as a result, the real 10 -year Treasury yield is lower than 
the Tealbook baseline path over the period shown.  The more accommodative 
2 Because of these endogenous responses, the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit. 
3 Contrary to our modeling assumptions, the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC 
might well entail a period during which the public learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic 
implications.  Large changes in policy strategy might be especially likely to be associated with drawn -out 
learning periods or a misinterpretation of the Committee’s intentions by the public.  We abstract from such 
considerations here.

financial conditions are associated with a higher trajectory for inflation and, 
eventually, a lower trajectory for the unemployment rate than under the 
Tealbook baseline. 
• The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate for the next two years  than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower 
path for some years thereafter.  The latter divergence occurs because the first -
difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap 
rather than to its level, re acts to the narrowing of the output gap over the next 
decade.  The associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction 
with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer -term 
real rates over the entire projection period t han in the Tealbook baseline and 
therefore higher levels of resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower 
than, and inflation outcomes that exceed , the corresponding outcomes in the 
Tealbook baseline projection. 
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate than the other rules because the rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as measured by the growth rate of the 
GDP deflator ) from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.  
Because we assume that the FOMC credibly commits to closing this gap, and 
that economic agents correctly anticipate the long pe riod of low federal funds 
rates, inflation is higher and nominal and real 10 -year Treasury rates are lower 
than under the other policy rules and the Tealbook baseline.  The path for the 
unemployment rate is substantially lower than for all the other simulations shown, dropping slightly below 3¼ percent in the middle of 2020. 
• The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are slightly higher than those 
conditional on the July Tealbook projection, reflecting the staff’s small upward revisions to the projected output gap.

OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT 
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.4 
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices, which 
may improve economic outcomes.5 
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place the same wei ghts on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate path.  This higher path arises 
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natu ral rate over the next several years, an outcome 
that policymakers judge to be costly.  The tighter policy results in a path for 
the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somew hat lower than in the Tealbook 
baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with a limited response of 
inflation to changes in levels of resource utilization in the FRB/US model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss functi on 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate 
is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal 
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications; the appen dix in this Tealbook section 
provides technical details on the optimal control simulations. 
5 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers improve economic 
outcomes by m aking promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from 
the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). Moreover, these 
promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  Under the 
alternativ e assumption of optimal policy under discretion, which does not rely on the credibility of 
policymakers’ promises, the results differ significantly only in the simulation in which there is an 
asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a 
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent 
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared 
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

weights; it is also below the Tealbook baseline path.  With the asymmetric 
loss function, policymakers choose this r elatively accommodative path for the 
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2  percent is not tempered 
by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  Because 
the public believes that policymakers will follow through on th is policy rate 
path even as the unemployment rate substantially undershoots its natural rate, 
the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2  percent somewhat more quickly 
than in the case of equal weights.  Starting in 2026 (not shown), the 
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as 
policymakers seek to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the 
prolonged period in which resource utilization is elevated .6 
• The third simulation exercise, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a 
loss function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is 
five times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise identical to that specification .  The result ing optimal strategy is only slightly 
more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses 
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an 
unappealing tradeoff because inflation responds only weakly to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to raise inflation in the 
near term only a modest amount—a p olicy strategy that is seen as costly under 
this specification of the loss function. 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but 
that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights. In the 
resulting optimal strateg y, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than 
under the specification with equal weights and remains near 6 percent over 
much of the remainder of the period shown.  This strong tightening of policy 
6 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “Asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time inconsistent in the sense that, given the opportunity to re -optimize the path of the federal funds rate 
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter 
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out 
time-inconsistent out comes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the 
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function .

results from an effort to prevent the projected  undershooting of the natural rate 
of unemployment.  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 
10-year Treasury y ield are also notably higher for a couple of years than in the 
case of equal weights. Because the short- run Phillips curve is qui te flat in the 
FRB/US  model , this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to that in 
the equal -weights case over the period shown, even though it keeps the 
unemployment rate much closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.7 
• The federal funds rate paths prescribed  by optimal control under the above 
loss functions are somewhat higher than in the July Tealbook over the period 
shown.  These higher paths reflect a slightly lower unemployment rate relati ve 
to the natural rate in the staff’s basel ine projection than in the July Tealbook.8 
IMPLICATIONS OF POLICY INERTIA IN A RECESSION 
In this special exhibit, we use the FRB/US model to examine how the degree of 
policy inertia affect s economic outcomes in a recession scenario.  Our simulations are 
based on the alternative scenario titled “Broad Policy Disappointment w ith Market 
Correction ” in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook, but with larger 
negative shocks than considered in that scenario .9  In our scenario, re al GDP begins to 
contract  in the third quarter of 2018 and continues to decline for four quarters. We 
display simulations of this scenario under four alternative monetary policy strategies:  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule used to construct the scenario , the (non- inertial) 
Taylor (1999) rule, the Reifschneider -Williams (2000) rule (described below) , and 
optimal control with equal weights  in the loss function.  The start of the simulation period 
coincides with the beginning of the recession. 
7 After 2023, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes above and 
sometimes below the corresponding values observed in the case of equal weights. 
8 The staff lowered its estimate of the longer -run natural rate of unemployment from 4.9 percent to 
4.8 percent and lowered the projected unemployment rate by a slightly larger am ount. 
9 As in the alternative scenario “Broad Policy Disappointment with Market Correction,” we 
assume that the federal government fails to implement the fiscal expansion projected in the baseline , that 
other policy changes expected by financial market par ticipants also fail to materialize , and that economic 
activity is further curtailed by an erosion in consumer sentiment as well as an increase in perceived risk by 
businesses and financial markets following the policy disappointment. However, the decline in consumer 
and business sentiment is larger, and the cumulative decline of equity valuations by the third quarter of 
2018 is twice as large in our recession scenario compared with the alternative scenario in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section.

• When policymakers follow the prescription of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, 
the federal funds rate falls only gradually because of the interest rate 
smoothing term in the rule.  The federal funds rate bottoms out near ½ percent 
at the end of 2020 before rising gradual ly to just above 2 percent at the end of 
the period shown.  Under this strategy, the unemployment rate peaks at 
6 percent  in the first quarter of 2020, up nearly 1¾ percent age points from the 
current level .  Inflation stays below 2 percent even after the end of the 
recession.10 
• When  policymakers follow the prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) rule, which 
has no interest smoothing term, they lower the federal funds rate more 
aggressively than under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, reaching the effective 
lower bound in the second quarter of 2019.11 Despite this more aggressive 
action , the resulting path for inflation is further below  2 percent throughout 
the period shown, whereas  the unemployment gap is only a little lower in the 
first couple of years  and higher thereafter .  The reason for these difference s 
lies in the prescribed path of the federal funds rate over the medium term:  
The non- inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a higher federal funds rate path 
than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule starting in 2021 .  Because the public 
anticipates the stance of monetary policy in the future, the more substantial 
tightening in the medium term pushes longer- term rates up while the quicker 
monetary easing a t the beginning of the recession pushes longer- term rates 
down.  Thus, the effects of the lack of  inertia in the Taylor (1999) rule on 
economic activity in the near term are ambiguous . 
• Our implementation of the Reifschneider -Williams (RW) rule seeks to 
compensate for policymakers’ inability to lower the federal funds rate below 
its effective lower bound.  Under the RW rule, policymakers delay increases 
in the federal funds rate during the econom ic recovery until they have ma de 
up for the cumulative shortfall in policy accommodation caused by a binding 
10 This persistent shortfall in inflation results from an assumption in the construction of the 
scenario that inflation expectations erode during and after the recession . Inflation eventually returns to 
2 percent, helped by a period of tight resource utiliz ation beyond the period shown. 
11 In this simulation, we add a downward intercept adjustment of 25 basis points to the Taylor 
(1999) rule in the third quarter of 2018 only.  Absent this adjustment, this rule would call for a modest 
increase in the federal f unds rate in the first quarter of the recession.

effective lower bound.12 When  policymakers follow the prescriptions of this 
rule, they initially lower the federal funds rate at a pace virtually identical to 
that of the Taylor (1999) rule but they then keep the federal funds rate at the 
effective lower bound for two more quarters.  The resulting monetary policy 
stance is only very slightly more accommodative than that prescribed by the 
Taylor (1999) rule because t he cumulative shortfall in policy accommodation 
is small. Therefore, the paths of inflation and the unemployment rate are 
almost the same as those obtained under the Taylor (1999) rule.  
• When policymakers follow the prescriptions of optimal control with equal 
weights , they optimally take into acco unt that macroeconomic outcomes are 
affected by both current and future policy choices . In this case, the federal 
funds rate drops to the effective lower bound at a pace similar to that under 
the Taylor (1999) rule but then stays there until the second quarter of 2022 
before rising to just under 2 percent at the end of the period shown.  This 
monetary policy stance is unambiguously more accommodative than those 
associated with the policy rules described above.  It is also worth noting that 
the initially  quick pace of easing under optimal control occurs despite the 
costs associated with  policy rate adjustments because these costs are judged to 
be small when compared with those associated with high unemployment 
during and after the recession . 
• These simulations illustrate that the absence of inertia in the policy response 
has two opposing effects.  On the one hand, lowering the policy rate quickly at the onset of a recession provides additional accommodation; on the other 
hand, a more rapid  pace of subsequent normalization can offset this 
accommodation if it is anticipated by the public.  Under our modeling 
assumptions, the effective amount of accommodation provided by monetary easing in a recession depends not so much on how quickly the federal funds 
rate is lowered over the first few quarters, but rat her on the public’s 
expectations about the entire path of the policy rate over the short run and 
medium term. Moreover, because changes in the stance of monetary policy 
affect the economy with long lags, they can counter only some of the rise in

the unemployment rate and the drop in inflation that accompany large 
negative shocks to aggregate demand. 
• Several caveats apply to these results.  Notably, as in all simulations in this 
Tealbook section, it is assumed that the public immediately understands which 
policy strategy  is being f ollowed by policymakers .  But it is possible that the 
initial policy action s of policymakers are taken as signals about the nature of 
the strategy that policymakers will subsequently follow.  For example, a 
gradual  policy response to an incipient recession of the kind prescribed by the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule could well lead the public  to conclude that 
policymakers are intent on maintaining a tighter policy stance  than that 
prescribed by that rule; this conclusion could, in turn, exacerbate the recession .  Moreover, in these simulations, the public perfectly anticipates the 
future path of policy, even at long horizons.
13 If the public instead had an 
incomplete understanding of the policy path further  in the future, or if the 
public doubt ed that policymakers would follow through with the medium-
term prescriptions of their policy strategies , the pace of monetary policy 
easing a t the beginning of the recession could be more important for spending 
and pricing decisions than the uncertain normalization phase later on.14 
Finally , the model underlying the simulations abstracts from the effects of 
policy actions and communications on economic confidence more generally .  
A strong a nd swift monetary policy response at the onset of a recession could 
be valuable if it provided a timely boost to economic confidence. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously. 
13 Our assumption of “model -consistent expectations” implies that the public knows the structure 
of the economy, understands policymakers’ strategy concerning current and future settings of the federal 
funds rate, and uses that knowledge when forming expectations of future movements in asset prices, wages, 
and inflation. 
14 Indeed, when we conduct the simulations in this special exhibit under the alternative assumption 
that the public forms expectations based solely on historical relationships as represented by small -scale 
statistical models (frequently called “VAR -based expectations” in Tealbook A), the difference in effective 
accommodation p rovided by the Taylor (1999) rule and optimal control diminishes considerably.

Appendix 
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy but also fully understand the macroeconomic 
implications  of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment 
strategies. 
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and because they respond only to variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  An d, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess t he various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
routinely reported in the Monetary Po licy Strategies section .  It also reports the expression for the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline projection .  The 
table further reports the expression for the rule proposed by Reifschneider  and Williams  (2000), 
as implemented in the special exhibit.  𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 𝑠𝑠 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by 
policy rule s for quarter t; for quarters prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 𝑠𝑠

corresponds to the historical value in the economic projection.  T he right -hand- side variables 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four- quarter core PCE price inflation for the current 
quarter and three quarters ahead (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(ygap t), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap ( ∆4ygap t+3|t).  
The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation  objective, denoted πLR, is 2 percent. 
The nominal income targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal income, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the log of the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 ∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage p oints per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the 
sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level 
it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1 
Simple Rules 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have  been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 The Reifschneider -Williams rule used here 
adjusts the Taylor (1999) rule to make up for any cumulative shortfall in accommodation ( 𝑍𝑍𝑡𝑡 ) due 
to a binding effective lower bound of 12½ basis points by delaying normalization of the stance 
of policy .

2 The staff uses the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, augmented with a temporary

Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer -run inflation objective and a longer-run real 
federal funds rate of 0.5 percent.3 The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer -run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003). 
The “Near -term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown. 
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the l ines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbo ok projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy R ules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The “Tealbook- consistent 
FRB/US r*” is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter 
period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter 
of that period using the output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large- scale econometric model 
of the U.S. economy.4 This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of 
which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  The measure is 
derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-based expectations— that is, 
agents u se small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future variables are 
determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*. The average projected real federal funds rate and 
the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* may produce somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes 
even when their values are identical. The reason is that, in the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* 
simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period to close 
3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360- day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis. 
4 For a discussion of this and other concepts of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and 
others (2016).

funds rate can vary over time. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations an d are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural  rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following e quation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽 0.9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty t o the unemployment rate falling be low the natural rate. 
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no

weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5  The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights. 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not af fect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits. 
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution. Loss Functions

Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.   4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum       of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
       household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
       to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
