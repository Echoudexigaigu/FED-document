Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data we have received since the September Tealbook indicate  that economic 
activity continues to advance at  a solid pace.  Smoothing throu gh the effects of the 
hurricanes, we expect real GDP to rise at an annual rate of 3 p ercent in the second half, 
unrevised from the previous projection.  Payroll employment in the September labor 
report appeared to be held down ma rkedly by the effects of Hurr icanes Harvey and Irma, 
and we expect that job gains w ill be boosted this month and nex t as payrolls return to a 
more normal level.  The unemp loyment rate ticked down to 4.2 pe rcent in September, 
and the labor force participation rate moved up.  Overall, we a ssess that the economy has 
continued to improve at around the same pace we anticipated in the September Tealbook.  
Over the medium term, we expect real GDP growth to slow gradual ly from 
2½ percent this year to 2 per cent in 2019, and then to 1½ perce nt in 2020 as monetary 
policy continues to tighten.  This pace of growth is sufficient  to push the level of real 
GDP about 2 percent above our estim ate of its potential in 2020 , similar to our forecast in 
September.  Likewise, the unemplo yment rate is projected to fal l to 3.6 percent by the 
end of 2019 and to remain at th at level in 2020, about 1¼ perce ntage points below our 
estimate of its natural rate. 
The incoming data on consumer prices through September once aga in point to 
softer-than-anticipated PCE price inflation, and our forecast f or core inflation this year is 
a bit lower than in the Septe mber Tealbook.  We still view the low readings this year as 
largely transitory and expect cor e PCE price inflation to pick up next year.  However, in 
this projection we have carrie d forward a small portion of this year’s downward inflation 
surprise into 2018.  Both total and c ore PCE price inflation ar e projected to move up from 
about 1½ percent this year t o 1¾ percent in 2018, and then to 2  percent in 2019 and 2020.   
The Effects of the Recent Hurricanes 
In recent months, Hurricanes Ha rvey, Irma, Maria, and Nate caus ed significant 
destruction and dislocation in the  United States and its territories.1  As shown in the table, 
1 Hurricane Maria has been devasta ting for Puerto Rico, but we d o not include its effects in the 
calculations shown, as economic activity in U.S. territories is  not included in aggregate U.S. GDP or labor 
market statistics.  In addition, a nalysis from the San Francisc o Fed suggests that the effects of the wildfires 
in California will be too small t o noticeably affect the nation al economic statistics.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is above the project ions from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus forecast in 2017 
but is close to the Blue Chip forecast in 2018 . The staff’s unemployment rate forecast 
is below Blue Chip in 2017 and 2018 but matches the SPF forecast in 201 7.  The s taff’s 
projection for CPI inflation is above Blue Chip and SPF in 2017; for 2018 , the staff ’s 
projection is in line with the Blue Chip and below the SPF. The staff’s projections for 
overall and core PCE price inflation are somewhat line with the admittedly stale S PF 
forecast s in both 2017 and 2018.  That is, the staff outloo k for PCE inflation is lower for 
core in 2017, lower for total in 2018, and consistent elsewhere. 
Note: SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures. Blue Chip does not provide results for 
PCE price in flation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from about 
50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

we currently estimate that the  hurricanes subt racted ½ percenta ge point at an annual rate 
from real GDP growth in the thir d quarter, the same as in the p revious Tealbook.  We 
factored in the hit to economic activity from two more hurrican es, Irma and Nate, which 
made landfall on the U.S. mainla nd after the time of the Septem ber Tealbook projection; 
however, we revised down the estimated effect of Harvey.2  As the level of production 
returns to its pre-hur ricane path, rebuilding continues, and a small portion of lost 
spending is made up, we anticipat e a boost to growth in the fou rth quarter that is slightly 
larger than the third-quarter l oss.  Beyond the near term, the makeup of the lost spending 
and production, as well as the reb uilding of damaged property, will be gradual.  Thus, the 
hurricanes do not leave a discer nable imprint on the contour of  growth in the medium-
term projection. 
 We estimate that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma reduced payroll emp loyment by 
200,000 in September.3  That said, we anticipate employment will rebound in

Irma.  For more details about those earlier estimates, see the staff memo to the FOMC from September 14, 
2017, titled “Preliminary Assessm ent of Effects of Hurricane Irma on the U.S. Economy and Updated 
Assessment of Hurricane Harvey.” 
3 The uncertainty around this est imate is large, but it is consi stent with data from the household 
survey showing an unusually large number of people (1.5 million ) being absent from work due to bad 
weather during the third week of September, the reference week for the household and payroll surveys. July Aug. Sept. Oct. Nov. Dec. 2017: Q3 2017: Q4 2018: Q1

October and November.  In the household survey, workers absent from work 
because of bad weather are counted as employed regardless of wh ether they 
are paid during that period, and the  BLS Commissioner’s stateme nt noted that 
the hurricanes had negligible effects on the unemployment rate and 
participation rate in September. 
 For industrial production, the di sruptions to the energy and petrochemical 
sectors from Hurricane Harvey account for most of the overall h urricane 
effect.  We estimate activity in affected industries to be returning to normal 
over the course of the fourth quarter. 
 Retail gasoline prices climbed in t he wake of Hurricane Harvey but have since 
trended down as production at storm- affected refineries has ret urned to 
normal.  We expect this boost to gasoline prices will have reve rsed by next 
month.  As a result, the 12-month change in total PCE prices is boosted only in September and October.  Gasolin e prices did not move much in  response to 
the subsequent hurricanes, whi ch caused only modest refinery disruptions. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 At the end of September, congres sional and Administration leadership 
released a broad framework for  tax reform, and the Congress has  begun the 
initial legislative steps to make policy changes.  Nonetheless,  considerable 
uncertainty remains about the potential size, timing, and compo sition of 
federal tax policy changes that may be enacted.  We have retain ed our 
placeholder assumption that a tax cut will increase the primary  budget 
deficit—that is, t he deficit excluding interest costs—by ½ perc ent of GDP, 
and that it will take the form of a reduction in personal incom e taxes that starts 
in the first quarter of 2018 and then begins to be phased out a fter five years.  
This policy action is expected t o boost the level of real GDP about ¼ percent 
by the end of 2020, exclusive of multiplier effects and any off sets from higher 
interest rates and a stronger dollar. 
 We anticipate an increase in federal government outlays for hurricane relief of about $85 billion over the medium term, mostly in the form of transfer

 We project that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government 
will have a roughly neutral e ffect on real GDP growth in 2017 b ut will boost 
output growth about ¼ percentage  point per year in 2018 through  2020.4 
Monetary Policy 
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule used in our projection calls 
for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than 1 percentage point per 
year, on average, over the projection period and to average 4 p ercent in the 
fourth quarter of 2020, in line wit h our previous forecast.  
 The SOMA portfolio begins a grad ual and predictable decline in the current 
quarter as securities are redeem ed in a manner consistent with the June 2017 
addendum to the Committee’s Policy N ormalization Principles and  Plans. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise over the medium  term from an 
average of 2.5 percent in the c urrent quarter to 3.6 percent by  the end of 2020.  
During this period, the 10 ‐year valuation window m oves through a period of 
rising short-term interest rate s, and the term premium—the comp ensation that 
investors require for the risk of holding longer-term instrumen ts—is projected 
to increase to more normal levels. 
 The paths of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B c orporate bond 
rate generally follow the contour of the 10-year Treasury yield .  
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices have come in about  4 percent higher than we had a nticipated in 
the September Tealbook, and we carri ed that higher level forwar d in our 
4 Federal government appropria tions expire on December 9.  We assume the Congress will pass 
appropriations in time to avoid a disruption in government oper ations.  That said, a lap se of appropriations 
that results in a short-term shutdown of the federal government  would have only minor implications for the 
outlook.  For example, the staff estimated that the 16-day shut down in October 2013 reduced GDP growth 
¼ percentage point in the fourth  quarter of that year and boost ed it by an equal amount in the following 
quarter.  This estimate embodies our judgment that there were n o material effects on private investment or 
consumption due to reduced confidence or increased uncertainty.

projection.  However, we view the increase as limiting the scop e for further 
stock price appreciation over the medium term, and we nudged do wn the 
average rate at which we exp ect equity values to rise beyond 20 17 to just 
below ½ percent per year.   
 Incoming data on house prices have been in line with our expectations.  We 
project that house prices will rise 5½ percent this year before decelerating to 
an average annual rate of about 4 pe rcent over the next three y ears.  Despite 
the brisk pace of house price incr eases, the ratio of house prices to rents is 
projected to remain only margina lly above its estimated long-ru n trend.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
 We estimate that foreign economic growth will moderate from an annual rate 
of 3¼ percent in the second quart er to a still-strong 2¾ percen t pace in the 
second half.  Over the medium term, we project economic growth abroad to 
hover around 2½ percent per year, in line with our estimate of foreign 
potential growth. 
 After having depreciated ar ound 9 percent year-to-date by the t ime of the 
September Tealbook, the broad nomin al dollar has since appreciated nearly 
2 percent, reflecting in part an  increase in U.S. interest rate s over this period.  
We expect the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate  of 1½ percent 
through the forecast period, as market expectations for the federal funds rate 
move up toward the staff forecast.  As a result of the recent a ppreciation of the 
dollar, our projection for the br oad real dollar by the end of 2020 is 
1¼ percent higher than in t he September Tealbook. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oi l has risen to $58 per barrel, about $4 per 
barrel higher than at the time  of the September Tealbook.  The impetus for 
this rise comes from foreign developments—political tensions in  the Iraqi 
Kurdish region and continued effort s by Saudi Arabia to curtail  oil supply— 
rather than from disruptions t o U.S. Gulf Coast production; acc ordingly, U.S. 
benchmark prices have increase d by less than Brent prices.  In an environment 
of robust supply growth, these oil price increases are expected  to be 
temporary.  Indeed, current spot o il prices are somewhat above that of farther-

dated futures, which have moved $1 per barrel lower since the S eptember 
Tealbook.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
Real GDP growth is expected to step up from an annual rate of about 2 percent in 
the first half of this year t o 3 percent in the second half, re flecting a positive swing in the 
contributions of inventory investment and net exports that we anticipate to be short lived.  
Private domestic final purchase s, or PDFP, are expected to cont inue to advance at a 
healthy clip.  As mentioned prev iously, we think the effects of  recent hurricanes will 
leave little imprint on real GDP growth in the second half.5  For this year as a whole, we 
continue to expect real  GDP growth of 2½ percent. 
 Readings on consumer spending through September were positive, on 
balance, and included a jump in motor vehicle sales.  Incoming data and 
anecdotal reports suggest that mu ch of the spike in motor vehicle sales in 
September was attributable to tr ansitory factors —including robu st 
replacement of vehicles followi ng Hurricane Harvey and a surge in fleet sales 
to rental car companies—so we expect sales to drop back in comi ng months.  
We continue to project that real PCE growth will average 2¾ per cent over the 
second half of the year, a bit above its pace in the first half .  Consumer 
spending is likely being supported by ongoing gains in income and wealth as 
well as by buoyant consumer sentiment.  (The box “Student Loan Debt and 
Aggregate Consumption” points ou t that the run-up in student loan debt over 
the past decade likely has not  been holding down consumption growth 
materially.) 
 Business investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is expec ted to 
increase at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second half of t his year—its 
fastest pace since 2014—follo wing a healthy gain of nearly 6 pe rcent in the 
first half.  This year’s pickup c omes on the heels of moribund E&I spending 
in 2016 and corresponds to an upswin g in several measures of bu siness 
optimism and expected profitabi lity.  Moreover orders and shipm ents of 
5 Within the second half of the year, we project GDP growth of 2 .9 percent in the third quarter and 
3.2 percent in the fourth.  Despite the swing in output related  to the hurricanes, the gr owth rates for the two 
quarters are similar, in part b ecause of the concentration of t he inventory and net export boost in the third 
quarter. We receive the BEA’s advance estimate of GDP for the third quarter on October 27.

Student Loan Debt and Aggregate Consumption Growth 
Between 2001 and 2016, the real amount of student debt owed by American households more than 
tripled, from about $340 billion to more than $1.3 trillion.  The increase largely reflect s an acceleration in 
student loan originations that was mainly due to a s urge in college enrollment and ongoing increases in 
real tuition levels. The expansion of student loan borrowing, and the associated increase in post -college 
student loan debt service, has raised concerns that this borrowing is constraining consumption and 
economic growth. Although student debt service is undoubtedly a source of severe financial strain for 
some individuals, in this discussion we show that the direct effect of increased student debt service on 
aggregate consumption growth is likely small.  We also argue that indirect —and hard -to-quantify — 
channels , such as the effect of student loan debt on access to credit or debt aversion, are probably small 
as well, but we cannot rule out that these channels could hold down consumption more meaningfully . 
It is important to emphasize that as long as student loans are leading to better education al outcomes , 
the increase in student loan originations over the p ast couple of decades could be associated with a 
positive effect on consumption growth . Indeed, the existing literature suggests that, on average, 
college graduates have substantially higher incomes than high school graduates and that this income 
differential may be rising over time.1 Nevertheless, the average returns to education mask su bstantial 
heterogeneity, and there is a concern that the increase in student loan originations since 2001 ( and 
especially during the Great Recession) was concentrated among students who received little value from 
their additional education .2 Moreover, continued increases in tuition costs since the Great Recession 
contributed to a rise in post -college debt payments that might have outpaced any education -related 
gains in income. Given these concerns, we explore an extreme scenario of what the negative effects of 
the loans could be had there been no positive effect of increased education on borrowers’ incomes .3 
The most direct way in which increased student loan debt service payments could hold back 
consumption is by crowding out other household spending . Had student loan originations stayed at 
their 2001 level of roughly $60 billion in real terms per year (the blue dotted line in the figure on the next 
page ) through the end of the 2015–16 school year, we estimate that annual debt service payments would 
have been $50 billion lower by 2016—representing 0.3 percent of personal income .4 Even if we assume 
(in the spirit of our upper bound) that those debt payments held back household consumption dollar-
for-dollar, the drag on real GDP growth would be less than 0.05 percentage point in any particular year.5 
Although increases in debt payments since 2001 appear to have had, at most , only a small direct effect 
on consumption, increased student loan debt could hold back consumption through other indirect 
channels. First, high levels of student loan debt may increase debt -to-income ratios or reduce credit 
scores, so some borrowers may lose access to other types of loans , such as mortgages and auto or credit 
card loans.  C urtailed access to credit more broadly could potentially reduce aggregate consumption 
1 Christopher Avery and Sarah Turner (2012) , “Student Loans: Do College Students Borrow Too Much —or Not 
Enough?” Journal of Economic Perspectives , vol. 26 (Winter), pp. 165–92. 
2 For instance, enrollment surged in for-profit schools, which are associated with lower returns to education, lower 
graduation rates, and higher rates of loan delinquencies. 
3 Student loans could also boost consumption through other channels not considered here such as an increase in 
education -related expenditures and higher profits for lenders or schools. 
4 To estimate this effect, we assume that all student loan debt origina ted in a given year starts being repaid by 
borrowers four years later under a fixed 10-year plan with an interest rate of 6.8 percent —the maximum rate for 
undergraduate federal student loan borrowers from 2001 to 2016. Under these assumptions, the effect of increased 
originations on debt service payments builds gradually over time. 
5 Our strong dollar -for-dollar assumption might be justified if the relevant households are credit constrained. If, 
instead, some of the households are unconstrained and forwar d looking, the higher debt would merely reduce their net 
worth, yielding a smaller effect on consumption throu gh the standard wealth effect.

growth beyond the level estimated earlier.  T here is evidence that student loan borrowers in their mid -
20s who are saddled with greater student debt delay their first home purchases , in part because of 
reduced access to mortgages .6 However, homeownership by itself does not boost consumption if a 
household simply converts from rental to ownership in the same size and quality unit. Moreover, even if 
a reduced homeownership rate is associated with reduced spending on housing services and home-
related durables, the small number of affected households suggests that this effect is not large in the 
aggregate.7 Although access to auto loans also could be curtailed by student loan debt , higher student 
loan debt does not appear to lower the likelihood of purchasing a vehicle.8 Finally, reduced access to 
credit card loans might hold back consumption for some borrowers , although there is no available 
evidence that we can lean on to quantify this channel . 
Second , borrowers may have psychological responses to debt that could affect consumption.  In 
particular, if borrowers are especially averse to debt , they may choose to curtail consumption to repay 
their student loans more quickly.  Available evidence points to the existence of debt aversion in different 
settings, sugges ting this mechanism might play some role in reducing consumption .9 
Finally, increases in student loan debt could be problematic for lenders, posing risks to financial stability . 
However, we currently view that outcome as unlikely . The federal government guarantees more than 
90 percent of outstanding student loan debt, and , thus , financial institutions are not highly exposed to 
the associated direct credit risk. Moreover, the s ubpopulation of borrowers who have been struggling 
to meet their student debt obligations typically owe only small amounts on other debts.  Consequently, 
lenders do not appear to face much indirect exposure through loans to borrowers currently having 
trouble paying their student loans .

Homeownership,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016 -010 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, June), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.010r1. 
7 Estimates from Mezza and others (2016) imply that roughly 20 percent of the decline in the homeownership 
rate for young adults since 2005 was due to increased student debt. This percentage accounts for less than 800,000 
households. If rent ing has held back the total spending of each of these households by $25,000 annually —the difference 
in average spending between homeowners and renters in the Consumer Expenditure Survey —the total effect on 
aggregate consumption would be less than $20 billion.

nondefense capital goods have been solid, and we expect a small  addition to 
spending as firms replace capital lost in the hurricanes.  By c ontrast, 
investment in nonresidential struct ures is anticip ated to edge down in the 
second half of the year, as inve stment in oil drilling structur es decelerates 
sharply following its surge in the first half and as investment  in nondrilling 
structures declines. 
 Residential investment is forecast to decline at an annual rate  of 3½ percent in 
the second half of the year.  Single-family and multifamily hou sing starts have 
been lackluster since the start of the year, in part because th ere appear to be 
some constraints on the availability of labor and developed lots.  Sales of 
existing homes ticked up in Septemb er following three consecuti ve months of 
declines, but they remain below their level from a year ago.  Although we 
think that this year’s higher mor tgage interest rates have cont ributed to the 
recent softening in sales, healthy labor market conditions and increased 
household formation point to a gradual improvement in the pace of home sales 
next year. 
 Government purchases are expected to move sideways, on balance, in the 
second half of this year after de clining in the first half.  Th e incoming data on 
state and local construction spe nding have been surprisingly we ak, and 
although we expect construction activity to bounce back somewha t in the 
fourth quarter, the contributi on of total government purchases to GDP growth 
this year is still lower than in the previous Tealbook.  
 Net exports are expected to cont ribute ½ percentage point to real GDP growth 
in the second half of 2017 and then to be a neutral influence o n growth in 
2018.  After starting 2017 strong, growth of both exports and imports slowed, with imports declining in the th ird quarter, given notable weak ness in oil and 
consumer goods imports.  However, we expect this weakness in ov erall 
imports to be transitory.  Growth rates for exports, supported by foreign 
demand, are expected to firm this quarter and remain elevated f or the rest of 
the forecast period.  Compared with the September Tealbook, the  contribution 
of net exports to the rate of r eal GDP growth is nearly ¼ perce ntage point 
more positive in the second half, reflecting incoming data.

 Inventory investment is expect ed to swing from a sizable drag o n output 
growth in the first half of 2017 to a small positive in the sec ond half. 
However, the uncertainty about our projection for inventory inv estment is 
even greater than normal due to the effects of the hurricanes. 
 After rising nearly 2½ p ercent at an annual rate in the first h alf of this year, 
manufacturing production is expect ed to move sideways in the se cond half.  
Hurricane-related outages and aut omaker retooling disruptions d amped 
production in the third quarter , but we anticipate factory outp ut to climb 
2¾ percent this quarter, consiste nt with a pickup in automakers ’ production 
schedules as well as ebullient r eadings from regional and natio nal 
manufacturing surveys. 
Over the medium term, we project real GDP will increase 2½ perc ent in 2018, 
2 percent in 2019, and 1½ percent in 2020, a deceleration that reflects the ongoing 
tightening of monetary policy.   
 Our forecast is little changed relative to the September Tealbo ok, as the 
positive effects of the higher projected trajectory for equity prices are mostly 
offset by the negative effects of  the stronger path for the dol lar.   
 We continue to assume that potential GDP growth will edge up to 1¾ percent 
by the end of the medium term.  With real GDP growth expected to outpace 
potential growth throughout much of the projection, resource utilization 
tightens further.  In 2019 and 2020, r eal GDP is projected to e xceed its 
potential level by about 2 percent. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
Looking through the effects of the recent hurricanes on payroll  employment, 
conditions in the labor market a ppear to have tightened further  in September.  We expect 
the labor market to continue to tighten over the medium term at about the same pace as in 
the September Tealbook projection. 
 Total nonfarm payroll employ ment fell 33,000 in September, and there were 
some downward revisions to payr olls in previous months.  As not ed earlier, 
we estimate that the hurricanes  reduced payroll employment by 2 00,000 in 
September.  Excluding the effects of the hurricanes, we estimat e that payroll

gains averaged around 160,000 over the past three months, about 20,000 less 
per month than we had expected  in the previous Tealbook. 
 In the household survey, the unemp loyment rate declined to 4.2 percent in 
September, a touch below our previous forecast.  The labor forc e participation 
rate rose to 63.1 percent, about ¼ percentage point higher than  we expected.   
 The near-term labor market forecast is little changed, on balan ce, from the 
September Tealbook.  Excluding the hurricane adjustments, we re vised down 
our current-quarter projecti on for payroll growth by roughly 15 ,000, to 
176,000 per month.  Factoring in a po st-hurricane rebound in Oc tober and 
November, we now project payr olls to rise about 240,000 per mon th this 
quarter.  We project the unemployment rate to remain at 4.2 per cent through 
December; the year-end level is unrevised from our September pr ojection.  As 
a consequence of some unusual movements in the underlying labor  flows data 
in September, which we think w ill largely unwind, we expect tha t the rise in 
the participation rat e last month will reverse over the next few months.6  As a 
result, the labor force particip ation rate is forecast to end t he year at 
62.8 percent, the same as i n our previous projection. 
 Our projection for the unemploym ent rate in the current quarter  is 
½ percentage point below our estimat e of its natural rate, and the participation 
rate is 0.2 percentage point above  its estimated trend.  (See t he box 
“Alternative View:  H ysteresis and the Natural Rate Fallacy” for a different 
perspective suggesting that the natural rate of unemployment moves with the 
actual unemployment rate, and that the natural rate is now subs tantially lower 
than the staff assumes.) 
With our medium-term forecast for real activity little revised,  the outlook for the 
labor market is similar to our S eptember Tealbook projection an d calls for a further 
tightening of labor market conditions through 2019.  
 After decreasing ¾ percentage point over the past two years, the 
unemployment rate is projected t o decline anothe r ¾ percentage point over the 
6 In September, there was a noti ceable and unexpected increase i n the number of individuals who 
moved from out of the labor force to employed, a pattern that, based on history, we expect to largely 
reverse by the end of the year.

Alternative View: Hysteresis and the Natural Rate Fallacy 
The most vexing puzzle for U.S. monetary policymakers is the absence of rising 
inflation in the face of the apparent closing of the unemployment rate gap. To account 
for this puzzle, we need to reconsider an implicit assumption behind the staff’s 
judgmental forecast—namely, the notion that the behavior of the natural rate of 
unemployment is independent of the behavior of actual unemployment. 
Some Keynesians have resisted this implicit assumption. They argue that the fallacy of 
the natural rate hypothesis is in the belief that the natural rate is solely determined by 
supply factors that cannot be affected by aggregate demand. They point out the 
possibility that as demand pushes unemployment away from the current natural rate, 
this causes the natural rate itself to change over time. 
This alternative hypothesis, known as “hysteresis,” has been heavily studied in the 
research literature, but the degree to which it has been accepted by policymakers in 
the United States is less clear. This alternative view updates Ball (1997) to test for the 
presence of hysteresis today.1 The approach is to let changes in the inflation rate reveal 
innovations to the natural rate. Ball’s method involves an accelerationist Phillips curve 
that links changes in the quarterly core PCE inflation rate to the unemployment rate 
gap: 
ߨ௧ െߨ௧ିଵ ൌെ ܽሺݑ௧ െݑ௧ேሻ, ܽ ൐ 0.			 		ሺ1ሻ 
This specification has a number of advantages. First, equation (1) uses a Phillips curve 
associated with the natural rate hypothesis. Second, because expected inflation is 
represented by an observable variable (lagged inflation), the only latent variable in 
equation (1) is the natural rate. Third, equation (1) is extremely parsimonious, as it has 
only one unknown coefficient. 
Following Mankiw (2001), I calibrate a as 1/8 based on what he described as an old 
convention that a year of above normal unemployment of 1 percentage point is 
associated with a ½ percentage point decline in inflation.2 Later, I consider a 
significantly flatter Phillips curve and show that it strengthens the results. By inverting 
equation (1), one derives the natural rate as 
ݑ௧ே ൌݑ௧ ൅ܽିଵሺߨ௧ െߨ௧ିଵሻ.			 ሺ2ሻ 
The idea is to infer a lower natural rate if inflation is falling. Ball (1997) recommended 
taking only the lowfrequency movement from 	ݑ௧ேmeasured by a Hodrick Prescott (HP)

Unemployment,” Economic Journal, vol. 111 (May), pp. C45–61. The ½ percentage point decline is 
calculated by multiplying 4 (annualization of the quarterly rate) by 1/8 (the slope of the Phillips curve).

filtered series,ݑො௧ே. In my update of Ball’s analysis, I posit a structural break in the 
relationship between the actual and natural rates of unemployment in 1991:Q1. That 
quarter marks the end of the recession that began in 1990:Q3, and it is a natural choice 
because we know that inflation dynamics appear fundamentally different before and 
after the early 1990s. I compute 	ݑ௧ே using equation (2) for the two samples, and I apply 
the HP filter to the two sets of subsample estimates to get 	ݑ ො௧ே. I then test the 
hysteresis effect: 
ݑ ො௧ே ൌݑො௧ିଵே ൅ܾ∆ݑ ௧. ሺ3ሻ 
If b is positive and statistically significant, that points to the presence of hysteresis. 
Estimates of Hysteresis Effects 
(A) 1965:Q3 1990:Q4 (B) 1991:Q1 2017:Q2 (C) 1991:Q1 2017:Q2 
a=1/8 a=1/8 a=1/40 
b ‐0.02 0.26 0.29 
(t‐stat) (‐0.71) (7.40) (6.98) 
The table shows the results. During the early sample period, the absence of hysteresis 
cannot be rejected, as shown by column (A). In other words, actual events appeared to 
support the dichotomy between the actual and natural rates of unemployment in the 
earlier sample. However, as shown by column (B), the absence of hysteresis can be 
easily rejected in the second sample: One fourth of every 1 percentage point change in 
ݑ௧  is now transmitted to the natural rate. Column (C) shows the cas e of assuming a 
flatter Phillips curve, where the slope of the Phillips curve is assumed to be 5 times 
smaller. Because we infer what happened to the natural rate by inverting the Phillips 
curve, the flatter the Phillips curve, the larger the change in the natural rate assumed 
from a given change in inflation. Thus, the estimate of hysteresis can only go up. 
Hysteresis is found only in the second sample period, because the volatility of the 
unemployment rate did not change much between the two periods despite a large 
reduction in inflation volatility. The only way for the accelerationist Phillips curve to 
reconcile the asymmetry of unemployment and inflation volatilities is to infer that the 
natural rate must have been tracking the actual unemployment rate in the more recent 
period. This procedure indicates that the current point estimate of the natural rate can 
be as low as 3.9 (a=1/8) percent or 2.8 (a=1/40) percent.3 
The implication for monetary policy is clear: There should be no rush to tighten 
monetary policy. The binding effective lower bound in the aftermath of the Great 
Recession  implied that the economy faced a tremendous demand shock. If hysteresis 
was at work, such a shock affected supply in the absence of other stimulative policies. 
However, if reverse hysteresis also is now at work, “it might be possible to reverse 
these adverse supply side effects by temporarily running a ‘high pressure economy,’ 
with robust aggregate demand and a tight labor market.”4 
3 Note that if I replace the lagged inflation term in the Phillips curve with anchored inflation 
expectations of 2 percent, the point estimates are even lower.

next two years, reaching 3.6 pe rcent in 2019 and remaining at t hat level in 
2020, 0.1 percentage point below the previous Tealbook.   
 Total payroll employment gains ar e expected to slow from an ave rage 
monthly pace of about 180,000 this year and next to about 140,0 00 in 2019 
and 110,000 in 2020.   
 The participation rate edges down a touch more slowly than its trend in the 
projection, as sustained job gains and rising wages continue to  draw 
individuals into the labor for ce while also slowing outflows.  The participation 
rate is projected to be 0.4 per centage point above our estimate  of its trend 
level at the end of 2020. 
 We project that productivity wil l increase about 1 percent per year over the 
forecast period—slightly below our e stimate of its structural p ace, though a 
little higher than its average  over the preceding several years .7 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
The incoming data on consumer pri ces indicate that inflation ha s been slightly 
lower than we anticipated in the September Tealbook.   
 Core PCE prices rose 0.1 percen t in August, a touch below our expectations in 
the previous Tealbook.  With the m ost recent CPI and PPI data i n hand, we 
estimate that core PCE prices a lso rose 0.1 percent in Septembe r, again less 
than we expected, leaving the  12-month change in that month at 1.3 percent.   
 We project core PCE prices to c ontinue increas ing just 0.1 perc ent per month 
this quarter, held down by the resi dual seasonality that we see  in these data.  
We project the 12-month change in c ore PCE prices to fluctuate between 
1.3 and 1.4 percent until March of next year when it steps up t o 1.6 percent, as 
the unusual decline in core pri ces seen this past March drops o ut of the 
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pac e when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly because workers h ired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to 
workers hired during a  slack labor market.

calculation.8  We project the 12-month change i n total PCE prices to be about 
the same as for core prices from December through March. 
 PCE prices for energy are exp ected to move up in the second hal f of this year, 
reflecting recent increases in oil prices.  (We expect the hurricane-related 
boost to gasoline prices to have reversed by November.) 
 PCE prices for food increase d at a subdued pace of about 1 perc ent in the first 
half of the year, which is nevertheless a step-up from the decl ines seen in 
2016.  We expect food price inflat ion to continue to run at abo ut a 1 percent 
pace in the second half, held down by recent declines in commod ity prices.  
 Core import price inflation is expected to step up from a 1½ percent pace in 
the third quarter to 3¼ percent in the fourth.  Our fourth-quar ter inflation 
forecast reflects price pressures arising from dollar depreciat ion and 
commodity price increases that occurred in the third quarter.  That said, the 
second-half increase has been r evised down notably relative to the September 
Tealbook, reflecting both weaker-tha n-expected incoming data an d an 
expected drag from more recent  dollar appreciation.  Starting i n the second 
half of 2018, import price inflat ion is expected to slow to a ¾ percent pace, 
consistent with moderate forei gn inflation, a gradually appreci ating dollar, and 
slowly declining commodity prices. 
 On balance, the latest readi ngs on longer-term inflation expect ations from 
survey- and market-based measures accord with our view that the se 
expectations remain relatively stable. 
While the continued soft readi ngs on core infla tion give us pau se, unexplained 
movements of several tenths i n inflation are not unusual.  Inde ed, in 2016, core PCE 
inflation, at 1.9 percent, was not ably higher than we can readi ly explain, given our 
judgment that soft core import prices and earlie r declines in e nergy prices were holding 
down core inflation and that t he underlying inf lation trend has  been lower than 
2 percent—that is, 1.8 percent.  None theless, while we continue  to think that most of this 
8 The unusually large decline in w ireless telephone plan prices that occurred in March 2017 held 
down that month’s core PCE reading about 0.1 percentage point.  Other components also contributed to the 
low reading in core PCE inflation in that month.

year’s soft core inflation will  prove to be transitory, we have  taken a small signal from 
the recent downward surprises for our 2018 projection.9  As a result, core PCE price 
inflation is projecte d to move up to 1.8 percent in 2018, 0.1 percentage point lower than 
we had previously projecte d.  For 2019 and 2020, both total and core PCE price inflation 
step up further to 2 percent, in lin e with the September Tealbo ok projection, as the 
transitory factors ho lding down inflation this year abate, reso urce utilization continues to 
tighten, and our judgmental underl ying inflation trend edges hi gher. 
We received only a little news on wages since the previous Teal book.10  Hourly 
labor compensation growth is projected to step up from a pace o f 3¼ percent this year to 
around 3½ percent in each of the next  three years, as the labor  market continues to 
tighten.  Over the medium term, c ompensation growth is unrevised.  
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm pay rolls rose 
faster than expected in Septemb er, and earnings in previous mon ths revised 
up, which together boosted the  12-month change to 2.9 percent.  We expect 
the outsized September rise, which we think in part reflected a  hurricane-
related shift in employment awa y from lower-wage workers, to pa rtially 
reverse in October.  Even so, we still expect the 12-month chan ge to be 
2.8 percent by December, the same as in 2016 but higher than th e preceding 
several years. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 
3.6 percent in September, also about the same pace as a year ago but up from 
earlier years. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment is 4.8 percent in 
the longer run, and that potential GDP growth will be 1.7 perce nt.  
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
9 This judgment reflects the fact  that this year’s downside misses have been both persistent and 
concentrated in the market-based  price categories, which tend t o be less volatile than nonmarket prices.  In 
contrast, a large fraction of last year’s higher-than-can-be-ex plained inflation was driven by unusually high 
nonmarket prices, which tend to carry little signal for future inflation.  
10 The ECI for September will be r eleased on October 31, the firs t day of the FOMC meeting.

extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by late 2021.  
 Real GDP growth slows furth er to about 1¼ percent in 2021 and remains 
around that pace through 2023.  The unemployment rate moves up to 
3.8 percent in 2021 and rises gradually toward its assumed natu ral rate in 
subsequent years.  
 PCE price inflation edges up to 2.1 percent in 2021 and hovers slightly above 
the Committee’s long-run objective for several years before edg ing back down 
to 2 percent.  
 With output materially above its po tential level and inflation a bit over the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, t he nominal federal funds rate  is about 
1½ percentage points above its long-run value of 2.5 percent in 2021.  It then 
moves back toward its lo ng-run value thereafter.

 International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign economic growth seems to be coming  off the boil, but the pot continues 
to simmer .  Recent indicators suggest that growth abroad slowed  from an annual rate of 
3.2 percent in the second quarter to about 2¾ percent in the third.  We had anticipated 
some slowing, as activity in some economies —most notably, Canada and Japan —had 
been running at an unsustainable pace, and we judge our estimated third -quarter growth 
to still be slightly above potential , in contrast to the weakness observed early  last year .  
The pickup in growth over the past year has been underpinned by a rebound in trade and manufacturing  activity around the globe and, in some countries, by stronger  investment 
growth .  These factors are still supporting activity, and we have growth staying at near 
2¾ percent over the rem ainder of the forecast period.  Even though growth abroad 
remains at about potential, we see the foreign recovery becoming more self -sustain ed and 
less dependent  on monetary stimulus over time .  Overall, our forecast is little changed 
relative to the September Tealbook. 
Despite our relatively benign forecast, a number of downside risks remain.  
Grabbing headlines of late, political developments in the euro area—including the separatist movement in Catalonia and increased anti –European Union (EU) populism in 
Austria, Germany, and Italy —could intensify, damping the euro -area recovery and 
weighing on global growth.  This possibility is explored in the “Stronger Dollar and 
Weaker Foreign Growth” alternative scenario  in the Risks and  Uncertainty section.  
Inflation remains stubbornly low in th e advanced foreign economies ( AFEs ), with 
core inflation running at an estimated annual rate of 1¼ percent in the third quarter.  After plunging to a mere ¼ percent  in the second quarter, headline inflation in the AFEs rose to 
an estimated 1 percent in the third, as the drag from declining retail energy prices 
moderated.  We see AFE  headline inflation rising further to 1½ percent in the current 
quart er and inchi ng higher over the forecast period as output gaps narrow.   
With inflation below target in many AFEs  and projected to remain so for some 
time, we continue to see monetary policies remain ing accommodative.  We e xpect  the 
European Central Bank (E CB) to announce at its October  26 meeting an extension of its 
asset purchases through September 2018, albeit  at a reduced pace.  W e also expect the 
Bank of Japan ( BOJ) to remain on hold.  Consistent with the hawkish signals sent by the 
Bank of England (BOE ) at its September meeting , we believe that a rate hike is

imminent, but we still expect the pace of  subsequent tightening to be gradual.   Similarly, 
we see the Bank of Canada (BOC) proceeding  cautiously in withdrawing stimulus.  
However, AFE inflation  could surprise on the upside, triggering a faster- than-expected 
normalization of AFE monetary policy and a tightening of global financial conditions.  
We discuss such a situation in the “ Inflation -Driven Tightening in the AFEs ” alternative 
scenario  in the Ris ks and  Uncertainty section.  
In the emerging market economies ( EMEs ), inflation has been fairly stable in 
recent quarters at around 3 percent, with declines in Latin America roughly offset by 
increases in emerging Asia, and we expect it to hover at around this pace over the forecast period.  In contrast to l ast year’s above -target readings, inflation is  now more 
subdued in most South American economies, held down by previous monetary policy tightening and still- weak domestic demand .  Monetary policy in some of these economies 
(notably, Brazil and Colombia), as well as in other EMEs, such as India, Indonesia, and Russia, has eased  in recent months.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro Area.  Recent indicators suggest that real GDP growth remained near 2½ percent in the third quarter.  We project growth to moderate to 2 percent this  
quarter and then, as economic slack diminish es, to just above its potential rate of 
1½ percent by late 2020.  Although political uncertainty is likely to  weigh  on growth 
in Italy and Spain , we do not expect it to  derail recovery in the euro area.  We assume 
that the Catalan independence movement will ultimately lose steam , partly as 
attention focuses more closely on the economic costs of exiting the euro area and EU.  
That said , heighten ed tensions in Catalonia and growing anti-EU populism elsewhere 
(including in Austria, Germany, and Italy) have increased downside risks to euro- area 
prospects.
 
Core inflation remained subdued at 1.4 percent in the third quarter and is projected to remain below 1½ percent through 2018, reflecting modest wage growth and the 
recent appreciation of the euro.  ECB  officials now appear to be considering 
extending asset purchases into the second half of 2018, albeit at a reduced pace.  
Accordingly, we project that the ECB will soon announce an extension of its 
purchases through September  2018 at a pace of € 20 billion per month (down from 
€60 billion a month at present ) and will wait until the first  quarter of 2019 to begin 
raising its policy rate .

• United Kingdom.  Incoming data suggest that real GDP grew 1¼ percent in the third 
quarter, m aintaining its second -quarter pace.  G rowth is projected to edge up to about 
1¾ percent by 2020, supported by a recovery in real wages.  Twelve -month inflation, 
currently at 3 percent, should fall back to the BOE’ s 2 percent target, partly as the 
pass-through from earlier sterling depreciation fades .  Our reading of the BOE’s 
communication following its September meeting  is that the central bank is less 
willing to look through the elevated inflation rate and will likely raise the policy rate this quarter, t hree quarters earlier than assumed in the September Tealbook.  We see 
the policy rate rising  to 1½ percent by the end of 2020, ¼ percent higher than 
projected in September . 
 
• Japan .  With consumption indicators weakening, we estimate that GDP growth 
slowed from 2.5 percent in the second quarter to 1½ percent last  quarter —still well 
above our ¾ percent estimate of potential growth .  We expect growth to moderate 
further to 1  percent in 2018 before stalling in 2019 because of a legislated increase in 
the consumption tax.   
In the third quarter—following two quarters of slight deflation—higher energy prices 
and a depreciated yen  boosted inflation to an estimated ½ percent , and these factors 
should push it up further in the fourth quarter .  However, because wage g rowth 
remains sluggish (despite a very tight labor market) and inflation expectations have not picked up, we expect inflation to be stuck around 1 percent through 2020, well below the 2 percent target.  As such , we see the BOJ  maintaining its highly 
accomm odative policy, with the deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent through 2020 and 
asset purchases sufficient to keep the 10 -year yield around zero through end-2018.  In 
parliamentary elections on October 22, we expect Prime Minister Abe’s party to retain its strong majority, which should provide continued support for the stimulative 
policies  known as Abenomics.  
• Canada.  After growing at a blockbuster 4 percent pace in the first half of the year , 
driven by unusually strong consumption growth and a pickup in investment in the 
energy sector, recent indicators suggest that growth moderated to 2½ percent in the 
third quarter.  We expect growth to average around 2 percent through mid-2018 and 
to settle at its potential pace of 1¾ percent thereafter.  Governor Poloz r ecently 
emphasized that the BOC  will proceed cautiously with monetary policy normalization 
amid heightened uncertainty about the underlying strength of the economy and the

implications of this uncertainty for inflation .  We continue to project that the pol icy 
rate (currently at 1 percent) will increase only gradually , reaching 2¾ percent in  2020.  
EMERGING MARKET  ECONOMIES  
• China.   Real GDP growth slowed  to a still-solid 6. 6 percent in the third quarter from 
7 percent in the first half of the year, a touch above our September Tealbook forecast.  
The slowdown reflected some moderation in export and manufacturing activity from unsustainably strong growth in previous quarters.  Although the authorities  have 
modestly tightened credit conditions since late last year , the effect of this tightening 
has been relatively muted .  Moreover, i n late September, the authorities announced 
targeted cuts to the reserve requirement ratio for banks that meet certain thresholds 
for lending to small businesses , which should temper the effe ct of previous credit 
tightening .  Nevertheless, we expect GDP growth to slow gradually to 5¾ percent 
by 2020 as the authorities ’ efforts  to rein in credit growth gain traction and as 
potential growth slows .   
The Chinese Communist P arty C ongress  is under way.  President Xi will likely  
emerge from the Congress having significantly consolidated his power within the 
Party  at the start of his second five- year term .  We expect little change in the pace of 
market reforms, which has been disappoint ing in recent years . 
• Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that real GDP growth edged up to a solid  
3¾ percent in the third quarter.  Growth in the region was boosted by a partial 
rebound in India from disruptions following the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax  in July and, elsewhere in the region, by a resurgence in high- tech 
exports after a brief hiatus in the second quarter.  W e expect  growth in the region to 
rise to 4 percent in the fourth quarter as Indian growth fully recovers, and then to 
slow gradua lly to 3½ percent , about the trend rate, by 2020.   
• Mexico.   Available data suggest  that economic growth , having slow ed gradually since 
the middle of last year because of tight  fiscal and monetary policies , fell further to 
1½ percent in the third quarter.  Investment contracted  markedly in July, and private 
consumption growth slowed.  Activity was also disrupted, but likely only temporarily, 
by two major earthquakes in September.  W e see growth rising to 2 ½ percent in the 
fourth quarter—boosted by  a sharp projected pickup in U.S. manufacturing and a 
recover y from earthquake disruptions—and edging up to 3 percent by 2020.  Growth 
should be supported by diminishing fiscal drag, looser monetary policy, and past

reforms in the energy sector.   Downside risks to our forecast are substantial amid 
heightened uncertainty about the future of NAFTA , where negotiations have become 
bogged down, and political developments ahead of next year’s presidential election .  
Officials recently extended the timetable to renegotiate the NAFTA agreement 
into 2018.   
Despite continued upward pressure from food prices, quarterly inflation fell to 
5 percent in the third quarter—down from a peak of 10 percent in the first—as earlier 
monetary tightening and peso appreciation have helped bring down core inflation.  We expect the Bank of Mexico , which raised its policy rate a cumulative 400 basis 
points between late 2015 and the middle of this year,  to begin easing policy  
in mid-2018. 
• Brazil.   Brazil’s economy continues to c rawl out of its recession.  We estimate that 
real GDP growth picked up to 1½ percent last  quarter from 1 percent in the second.  
The recent fall in  inflation is boosting real incomes, diminish ed political uncertainty 
is supporting business confidence, and monetary easing is beginning to boost activity.  However, we see growth rising to only 2 percent in 2018 amid tight fiscal policies . 
Inflation has declined from double-digit rates in early 2016 to 2½ percent on a 
12-month basis in September, well below the authorities’ 4½ percent target.  The 
central bank has lowered the policy rate 6 percentage points since September 2016, and we expect it to cut the rate further to a historic low of 7 percent by the end of the year.  
• Turkey.   A number of political developments, including heightened tensions after the 
Kurdish referendum in Iraq and diplomatic problems with  the United States , led to a 
selloff  of Turkish assets .  With  inflation running over 10 percent, a current account 
deficit of  4 percent of GDP, and heavy relian ce on short- term external financing , 
Turkey’s economy is vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment.

Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, cha nges in financial asset prices  reflected FOMC 
communications that were slightl y less accommodative than inves tors anticipated, 
domestic economic data releases that came in somewhat stronger than expected on 
balance, and increased market e xpectations for U.S. tax reform.   On net, both short- and 
longer-dated nominal Treasury yields moved modestly higher, bro ad equity price indexes 
increased, corporate bond spread s narrowed moderately, and the dollar appreciated 
against most currencies.  There was no discernibl e reaction in financial markets to the 
FOMC’s widely anticipated chang e in its balan ce sheet policy. 
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability o f a rate increase 
at the November meeting is clos e to zero, while the probability of a rate hike 
occurring at the December FOMC  meeting has increased to about 7 5 percent.  
 Nominal Treasury yields increas ed modestly, on net, across the curve, with 
2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury yields rising 16, 13, and 8 basis points, 
respectively.  TIPS yields rose slightly more than their nomina l counterparts, 
leaving inflation compensation a touch lower.  Option-adjusted spreads on 
current-coupon MBS were little changed. 
 On net, broad U.S. equity price indexes ended about 2 percent h igher, led by 
shares of small-cap and financial firms.  The VIX continued to hover near its 
historical low.  Credit spread s on corporate bonds declined mod erately. 
 The broad dollar appreciated 1½ pe rcent over the intermeeting p eriod amid 
the rise in U.S. interest rates .  Global equity indexes continu ed to climb. 
POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS 
Domestic Developments  
FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were reportedl y seen by 
investors as somewhat less accommodative than expected.  The Co mmittee’s decision at 
the September FOMC meeting to leave the target range for the fe deral funds rate 
unchanged and to announce the star t of its balance sheet normalization program in 
October had been widely antic ipated by the public.  However, market participants noted

that the median projections in the September SEP continued to s uggest one additional 
rate hike of 25 basis points th is year and three next year, whe reas some investors had 
expected slight downward revisi ons to those median projections.   In addition, market 
commentaries noted that despite low inflation readings in recen t months, the 
characterization of the inflati on outlook in the statement was little changed, and FOMC 
participants made only modest downward revisions to their near- term inflation 
projections in the SEP.  Chair Y ellen’s speeches and other comm unications by FOMC 
participants over th e intermeeting period were also seen as rei nforcing expectations for 
further gradual removal of policy accommodation.   
Domestic economic data release s over the intermeeting period ca me in mostly 
above expectations and reportedl y also contributed some to investors’ confidence in the 
prospect of continued policy ra te increases.  Judging from futures quotes and without 
adjusting for term premiums, ma rket participants appeared to pl ace essentially zero 
probability on the next rate increase occurring at the November  meeting, while the odds 
of a rate hike at the December  meeting rose from 50 percent jus t prior to the September 
FOMC meeting to close to 75 percent.1  The probability curre ntly assigned to a 
December rate hike is higher than those seen before the rate increases in December 2015 
and December 2016 at comparable dates, likely reflecting in par t recent FOMC 
communications that were interpreted as indicating stronger sup port among FOMC 
members for a rate increase  by year-end than in the two previou s episodes.  Furthermore, 
the OIS-implied federal funds rates at the end of 2018 and 2019  moved up 15 basis points 
and 17 basis points, respectively;  a staff model that adjusts f or estimated term premiums 
suggested a more modest upward rev ision in the expected policy path.    
The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up and flattened somew hat over the 
intermeeting period, with yiel ds on 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasur y securities higher by 16, 
13, and 8 basis points, respectivel y.  Treasury yields rose not  only following the 
September FOMC meeting communications and mostly better-than-ex pected domestic 
data releases, but also following t he release of the GOP’s tax reform framework.  Staff 
models attributed the increase in medium- and longer-term Treas ury yields about equally 
to increases in expected rates  and term premiums.  Geopolitical  developments over the 
intermeeting period appeared to have left little imprint on yie lds on balance.  Near-term 
1 According to a staff model that adjusts for term premiums, mar ket quotes implied a probability 
of a rate hike by year-end of close to 90 percent.  About 96 percent of respondents to the October Blue 
Chip Financial Forecasts saw the  December meeting as the most l ikely timing of the next rate increase.

measures of option-implied volat ility on 10-year swap rates were little changed, on net, 
over the intermeeting period and r emained near historically low  levels. 
Since the September FOMC meetin g, the 5- and 5-to-10-year TIPS- based 
measures of inflation compensa tion have both edged lower by 5 b asis points on net.  The 
September CPI data were slightl y below expectati ons, and inflat ion compensation 
measures moved down following the release.   
Option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS over Treasury yields were little 
changed over the intermeeting peri od.  The Committ ee’s announce ment at the September 
FOMC meeting that it would initia te its balance sheet normaliza tion program in October 
appeared to have little eff ect on MBS spreads, as the announcem ent of gradual securities 
redemptions was well anticipated. 
The S&P 500 index increased jus t over 2 percent, on net, while the Russell 2000 
index was up just over 4 percent.  Broad equ ity price indexes reacted only modestly to 
the release of the GOP’s ta x plan on September 27.  However, ma rket participants cited 
increased expectations of tax reform as supporting the Russell 2000’s outperformance, 
particularly on the day of the announcement, when the Russell 2 000 increased nearly 
2 percent; this index is  heavily weighted tow ard domestically o riented firms that would 
presumably benefit more from a corporate tax cut than larger, m ore internationally 
focused firms.  Indeed, stock prices  of small firms with relati vely high domestic tax 
liabilities outperformed small firms with relatively low domest ic tax liabilities over the 
intermeeting period.  Likely because of proposed tax policy ref orms along with the rise in 
Treasury yields, financial companies also outperformed broader market indexes.  On net, 
bank equities increased around 4 pe rcent over the intermeeting period.  Meanwhile, one-
month-ahead option-implied vo latility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—remained 
extremely low, reaching an all-time daily low at the close on O ctober 5. 
Spreads on yields of both investme nt- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury secu rities narrowed modestly.  Cor porate bond spreads 
remained quite low by historical s tandards, particularly for speculative-grade bonds, 
which are below the 10th percentil e of their historical range.  The low levels of corporate 
bond spreads likely reflect elevate d investor risk tolerance as  well as low expected 
defaults.

Foreign Developments 
Since the previous FOMC meeting, the broad dollar index has moved up about 
1½ percent amid the rise in U.S. i nterest rates.  Increased sup port for anti-EU parties in 
the German and Austrian electi ons and political uncertainty sur rounding the Catalonia 
referendum weighed on the euro at times but did not seem to hav e a material imprint on 
net.  The British pound depreciate d 2½ percent against the doll ar, in part because of a 
lack of progress in Brexit negot iations.  The Mexican peso depr eciated more sharply and 
is down about 5½ percent against the dollar on uncertainty around NAFTA negotiations 
and political developments in Mex ico.  Increased po litical tens ions between the United 
States and Turkey put further downw ard pressure on the Turkish lira, which was lower by 
about 4½ percent over the period.  
Over the intermeeting period, market-based measures of expected  policy rates in 
AFEs were little changed, and longer-term yields edged lower, w ith the exception of 
Japan.  The declines in German yi elds have been linked to political developments in 
Europe and, to a greater extent, reports that the ECB may soon extend its asset purchase 
program through September 2018, potentially signaling more acco mmodation than 
previously anticipated by market participants.  Canadian yields  declined following dovish 
comments by Bank of Canada Governor Poloz. 
Most global equity indexes m oved 1 to 4 percent higher over the  intermeeting 
period, and measures of implied vol atility remained well below long-run averages.  An 
exception is Spain, where equity p rices fell following the Catalan independence 
referendum.  The aggregate MSCI EME equity index was near its h istorical high amid 
continued strength in f lows to EME equity funds.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
Conditions in domestic short-term  funding markets remained stab le over the 
intermeeting period.  Aside from qua rter-end, the effective federal funds rate held steady 
at 1.16 percent, and rates and volum es in other unsecured and secured overnight and term 
funding markets remained stable.  Assets under management and n et yields of MMFs 
were little changed.  Excludi ng quarter-end, ON RRP take-up ave raged about 
$150 billion.  At the end of Septe mber, the changes in money ma rket rates and volumes

While the FOMC’s new balance sheet  policy was effective October 1, the first Treasury auction with 
reduced Federal Reserve participation occurred on October 19, a nd MBS purchases were first reduced on 
October 16.  There was no measur able market reaction in either case.  See the Balance Sheet Projections

Financi ng Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households continued to be 
broadly accommodative and supportive of growth in spending and investment in 
recent  months. 
• Gross financing flows to large nonfinancial businesses through capital markets 
continued to be robust amid highly accommodative conditions.   
• In contrast, the growth of bank- intermediated credit to such firms remained 
relatively sluggish.  Respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported weaker demand for loans 
by business customers a mid highly competitive lending c onditions.   
• Consumer credit growth has moderated compared with the rates of increase seen 
in previous years .  Credit appeared to be available for most borrowers, although 
conditions remained tight in the subprime credit card market .  According to t he 
SLOOS , banks again tighte ned their credit policies on consumer loans during the 
past three months.   
• The collapse in Puerto Rican bond prices following Hurricane Maria left little 
imprint in the broader municipal bond market. 
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
During the intermeeting period, financing through capital markets to large 
nonfinancial firms remained very robust amid highly accommodative market conditions.  
Gross issuance of corporate bonds dipped a bit in September but remained high overall 
by historical standards in the third quarter.  Institutional leveraged loan originations were 
moderate in September, owing to a slowdown of issuance used for refinancing purposes, 
while new -money originations remained robust and implied risk spreads remained quite 
low by historical standards .  Gross equity issuance was solid in September, with seasoned 
equity offerings at about their average pace over the past few years , and initial public 
offerings picking up somewhat following a slower -than-typical summer.

In contrast to the robust capital market activity, growth in banks’ C&I loans 
continued to be sluggish, although the rate picked up a bit in the third quarter .  Responses 
to the October SLOOS  suggest that lackluster demand among banks’ business customers 
was a key factor in this subdued growth.  The survey also reported a notable increase in 
the share of banks that narrowed loan spreads for C&I loans to firms of all sizes  over the 
past three months, with many respondents, on net, citing more aggressive competition 
from other bank or nonbank lenders as an important reason for doing so.  The box 
“Which Borrowers Account for the Recent Decline in  Banks’ C ommercial and Industrial 
Loan Growth? ” provides a disaggregated analysis of the industrial sectors  and g eographic 
regions that have driven the step -down in C&I lending in recent quarters. 
The credit performance of bonds and loans extended to nonfinancial corporations 
remained strong  over the intermeeting period.  In September, the volume of nonfinancial 
corporate bond upgrades roughly matched that of downgrades, while the six-month 
trailing bond default rate remained near its lowest level since 2014.  The outlook for 
corporate earnings remained  broadly favorable , as the strong projections by Wall Street 
analysts for year-ahead earnings for S&P  500 companies were essentially unrevised. 
Corporations’ a ggregate i nterest expenses relative to earnings remained at historical lows 
even as the aggregate ratio of debt to assets for this sector inched up to its highest level in 
more than two decades. 
Small Businesses 
Overall, credit market conditions for small businesses remained stable, with small 
business lending activity staying relatively flat in recent months.  The latest readings 
from several surveys, including the October SLOOS , continued to suggest that the limited 
growth in small business lending activity is due to weak demand for credit rather than 
tight credit standards. Delinquency rates on existing small business debt remained just 
above record-low level s. 
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing flows for commercial real estate were more robust in capital markets 
than from banks in the third quarter.  CRE l oan growth at banks decelerated , especially 
for nonfarm nonresidential loans.  In the October SLOOS,  banks reported that demand 
for CRE loans had weakened over the third quarter on net.  SLOOS respondents also 
indicated that they  had not eased lending standards relative to the somewhat tight levels 
noted in the July SLOOS.

Which Borrowers Account for the Recent Decline in Banks’ 
Commercial and Industrial Loan Growth? 
Domestic c ommercial and industrial (C&I) loan growth at banks has declined noticeably this 
year.  In particular, over recent quarters, C&I loan s at the largest U.S. banks expanded at a 
seasonally adjusted annualized rate of about 1½ percent , on average, after having grown at a 
pace of nearly 7 percent in 2016 and 11 percent both in 2015 and in 2014 .1 In this discussion 
we provide some new information about the borrowers that account for the slowdown 
based on an analysis of banks’ loan -level data.   
We focus on C&I lending by the set of large domestic banks that undergo the Federal 
Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR banks . These banks 
hold about 70 percent of the C&I loans outstanding on domestic banks ’ balance sheets and 
account for more of the recent step -down in aggregate C& I lending than would be 
suggested by their share of C&I loans alone.  
Figure 1 rank s the industries , from left to right , to which the CCAR banks have reported the 
largest decline in recent C&I lending (the tan bars) , relative to an earlier base period , 
2014:Q1 to 2016:Q 3 (the blue bars) .  While the recent decline in banks’ C&I lending has been 
widespread across industries, the step -down has be en most pronounced for borrowers in 
the oil and gas and manufacturing sectors .2 The oil and gas sector witnessed a sizable 
contraction in outstanding loans in recent quarters after remaining about flat in the earlier 
period, while the manufacturing sector experienced subdued positive lending compared 
with robust lending in the earlier period .  Together, these two sectors account for about 
45 percent of the recent slowdown in C&I lending at the CCAR banks .  
1 These numbers are based on staff calculations using the Board’s weekly FR 2 644 data (“Weekly Assets 
and Liabilities of Domestically Chartered Commercial Banks and U.S. Branches and Agencies of Foreign 
Banks”). In this discussion, we do not consider C&I loans booked by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign 
banks; these institutions account for about 18 percent of the C&I loans outstanding to U.S. nonfinancial 
corporations. Growth in such C&I loans has also stepped down significantly this year. 
2 Within the manufacturing sector, borrowers in the industry subsegments of computer and electronic 
products as well as chemicals account for particularly large shares of the recent decline in C&I loan growth.

Figure 2 shows that the recent decline in C&I loan growth has been widely evident across 
geographic regions of the U nited States , with businesses headquartered in all but one 
Federal Reserve District having experienced such a decline.  The declines in C&I loans 
outstanding in the Dallas and Kansas City regions primarily reflect the reduction in lending to 
borrowers in the oil and gas industries.  The declines in other Districts, such as San Francisco, 
Richmond, Atlanta, and New York, reflect the broader step -down in C&I lending across 
industries. 
While t he factors behind the decline in C&I loan growth across the industrial sectors and 
geographic regions depicted in figures 1 and 2 are difficult to precisely identify , the decline in 
banks’ exposure to borrowers in the oil and gas industry began last year, likely in light of 
greater realized and anticipated losses on loans to this sector amid prolonged declines in 
energy prices. For example, when answering special questions in the April 2016 Senior Loan 
Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported that they 
anticipated greater losses on their loans to the oil and gas sector and had tightened their 
lending standards and terms on such loans in response . 
We believe that the likely cause of the slowdown in l ending to borrowers in other industrial 
sectors is a broad -based reduction in businesses’ demand for bank credit .  Indeed, 
respondents to the SLOOS have indicated that demand for C&I loans from firms of all sizes 
has w eakened , on balance , in each of the first three quarters of 2017 . Banks have cited a 
range of reasons for this general weakening in their customers’ demand for C&I loans , 
including borrowers’ increased usage of alternative sources of financing —such as retained 
earnings, the capital markets, or other nonbank lenders —as well as fewer planned finance 
investment projects or merger and acquisition activity .

With respect to capital markets , CMBS issuance has continued to be robust and in 
line with last year ’s pace.  Spreads on lower- rated CMBS have widened slightly since the 
September FOMC meeting but remained near the lower end of the range seen since the 
financial crisis. Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools continued to decline in 
September, largely reflecting the shrinking share of risky loans that were originated 
before the financial crisis .  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative on 
balance, as the collapse in Puerto Rican bond prices following Hurricane Maria left little 
imprint in the broader municipal bond market.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds 
remained solid in September, while the overall credit quality of the state and local 
government sector remained stable, with the number of ratings upgrades approximately 
matching that of downgrades.  Yields on 20- year general  obligation municipal bonds 
have moved roughly in line with comparable- maturity T reasury securities since the 
September FOMC meeting. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative 
for most borrowers .  The rate on 30- year conforming mortgages offered to well-qualified 
borrowers hovered around 4 percent, quite low by historical standards.  However, credit 
standards remained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or with hard- to-document 
incomes.   Mortgage originations for home purchases have slowed in recent months ; 
responses to the October SLOOS suggest ed that weaker demand may underlie some of 
the recent slowdown. 
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely 
accommodative o n balance.  Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace through the 
third quarter, in line with the more subdued pace of growth observed earlier  in 2017 
relative to the fairly rapid pace in the previous few years .  ABS issuance funding 
consumer loans remained robust and a bit ahead of last year’s pace.

Banks continued to report tightening their credit policies for auto and credit card 
loans in the October SLOOS.  Credit  bureau data on loan originations and credit limits 
suggest that this tightening has been most pronounced in the subprime segment of the 
market .  In response to a special set of questions, SLOOS respondents identified the most 
important reasons for tightening in the subprime sector over this year as a more uncertain 
economic outlook and an expected deterioration in loan portfolio performance.  In the 
case of auto loans, respondents also cited a reduced tolerance for risk, increased concerns 
about regulatory or supervisory changes, and concerns about a future decrease in 
collateral values .  Notwithstanding this report ed tightening  by the banking s ector, credit 
bureau data indicate that subprime auto loan originations overall have declined only a bit 
after having r ebounded substantially since the financial crisis.  In contrast, credit card 
limits for subprime borrowers have been almost flat for several years and remained at 
very subdued levels.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
As in the September Tealbook, we  view the uncertainty around ou r forecast of 
economic activity as being in lin e with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark 
used by the FOMC.  Many empirical i ndicators that are frequentl y interpreted as 
reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued.  For ex ample, both corporate 
bond spreads and the VIX remain near the low end of their histo rical ranges.  That said, 
considerable uncertainty remains  about the future direction of a number of federal 
government policies.   
We continue to judge the risks a round our medium-term projectio n for GDP 
growth as being balanced.  We vi ew the risks around the unemplo yment rate projection 
as being in line with those for GDP and therefore also balanced .  Consistent with that 
view, estimates of the distribu tion of risks around the staff f orecasts for GDP growth and 
the unemployment rate conditional on available indicators, show n in the exhibit “Time-
Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are  not particularly skewed.  More over, as shown in the 
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Ris k Estimate,” the risk of retu rning to the ELB 
sometime over the next three years has edged down recently and stands at about 
16 percent.1 
With regard to inflation, we stil l see the current level of unc ertainty around our 
projection as in line with the  average over the past 20 years a nd the risks to the downside 
and upside as roughly balanced.  This assessment is consistent with the estimates of the 
time-varying risks for the inf lation forecast.  To the downside , this year’s string of soft 
readings on inflation could prove to be more persistent than we  have assumed.  Also, we 
think there is a risk that infl ation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could 
be lower currently than in t he baseline or may not edge up in t he coming years as we 
have assumed.  To the upside, with  the economy projected to be moving further above its 
long-run potential, inflation ma y increase more than in the sta ff forecast, consistent with 
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.  
1 If the ELB risk were computed around the path for the median f ederal funds rate from the 
FOMC’s September Survey of Economic Projections (SEP), the prob ability would be 24 pe rcent, reflecting 
the lower funds rate path in the SEP compared with that in the Tealbook.

 Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveilla nce assessment, which judges the overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. 
financial system to be moderate.  V ulnerabilities stemming from  asset valuation pressures 
remain at an elevated level and have edged up over the past few  months.  However, these 
valuation pressures have not bee n accompanied by an increase in  other vulnerabilities.  
Borrowing in the nonfinancial secto r continues to increase at o nly about the same pace as 
nominal GDP.  While aggregate le verage among corporations remains elevated, 
borrowing by the riskiest firms  has slowed in recent years.  Vu lnerabilities from leverage 
in the financial system conti nue to be low, as both banks and insurance companies are 
highly capitalized by historical s tandards.  Vulnerabilities fr om liquidity and maturity 
transformation also remain low, partly because large bank holdi ng companies’ use of 
short-term wholesale funding remains moderate and the decline i n assets under 
management at prime money market mutual funds appears to have r educed run risk.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  In the first scenario, a different 
inflation process is assumed in w hich both the wage and price P hillips curves are even 
flatter and inflation expectations  are lower than in the baseli ne, and in which the negative 
inflation shocks seen this year continue next year.  In contrast, the second scenario 
examines the upside inflation ri sk that the response of wages and, in turn, prices to a 
further tightening of labor market conditions will be stronger than we have assumed and 
that inflation expecta tions will be more res ponsive to a rise i n actual inflation.  In the 
third scenario, we pres ent the implications  of a marked correct ion in asset valuations.  
The fourth scenario illustrates  the effects of a lower natural rate of unemployment that is 
initially misperceived by policym akers.  The fifth scenario stu dies the implications of a 
stronger economy.  The sixth scena rio analyzes the effects of a  resurgence of political 
risks in Europe that undermines confidence in the recovery and weakens foreign 
economic growth, leading to an a ppreciation of the dollar.  The  last scenario envisions a 
pickup of inflation in the AFEs t hat prompts faster monetary policy normalization 
abroad, thereby tightening financial conditions in the global e conomy.

We simulate these scenarios using four staff models.2  In all of the scenarios, the 
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in th e baseline.  In addition, the 
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follo w the baseline paths in 
all of the scenarios. 
Different Inflation P rocess [FRB/US] 
In the baseline forecast, PCE pr ice inflation is projected to r each 2 percent in 
2019.  This outlook is consistent w ith a relatively flat Phillips curve and well-anchored 
long-run inflation expectations—f eatures incorporated in both t he judgmental forecast 
apparatus and the FRB/US model .  However, it is possible that t he process for inflation 
has changed in ways that are not incorporated in the baseline p rojection for inflation.  In 
particular, the Phillips curve may be even flatter, and thus th e projected tight economy 
may contribute much less—if at all—to the return of inflation to the 2 percent objective.  
Furthermore, inflation expecta tions may react more to actual inflation than in the 
baseline.  In this scenario, we  use parameters that have been r eestimated for the price– 
wage block of the FRB/US model on the (admittedly rather short)  post-2000 sample 
period, which yields a flatter Phillips curve and a greater role for expectations than in the 
standard version of the model.  Even with the flatter Phillips curve, the model is unable to 
account for the low inflation r eadings over the past year.  Whi le the staff assumes that 
only a small portion of the downwar d surprise to inflation persists into next year, this 
scenario carries the entire su rprise forward through next year and then assumes that it  
gradually fades out. 
Under these circumstances, the f latter Phillips curve essential ly eliminates the 
upward pressure to inflation from tightening labor resources in  the baseline, and the 
negative shocks to prices also contribute to lower inflation.  This lower actual inflation 
feeds through into lower inflati on expectations and—given the g reater role of these 
expectations in drivi ng actual inflation—res ults in more downward pressure on inflation 
than would otherwise be the case.  As a result, inflation hovers around 1 percent in 2018 
and 1½ percent until the end of 2020 before reaching only 1¾ pe rcent in 2022.   
2 The four models used are FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroe conometric model of the U.S. 
economy; a calibrated DSGE model with search and matching frict ions in the labor market; an estimated 
medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. economy based  on Del Negro, Giannoni, and 
Schorfheide (2015); and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicount ry DSGE model.

In response to the lower path for inflation, the federal funds rate increases less 
than in the baseline.  Real GDP  growth is a bit faster, and the  unemployment rate falls 
further than in the baseline. 
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US] 
Alternatively, the projected fur ther tightening of resource utilization in the 
baseline could cause inflation to rise much faster than project ed.  Some recent research 
suggests that the relationshi p between labor u tilization and wa ge growth, and hence price 
inflation in the FRB/US model, m ay become stronger—the Phillips  curve may steepen— 
when the labor market is very tight.3  This scenario captures that risk by boosting the 
response of wages to tightening labor utiliz ation, and by assum ing that longer-run 
inflation expectati ons become more sensit ive to the higher realized price inflation that 
stems from faster wage growth.4 
Inflation reaches 3 percent  by 2022, compared with about 2 perc ent in the 
baseline.  In response to the higher path of inflation, the fed eral funds rate rises more and 
peaks at 5 percent in 2022; real longer-term interest rates are also slightly higher.  As a 
result, real GDP growth is a bit slower, and the unemployment r ate is about ¼ percentage 
point above the baseline by the end of 2022. 
Market Correction [FRB/US] 
Broad equity market indexes have increased significantly since last year, and 
standard equity valuation measur es, such as the price-to-earnin gs ratio, suggest elevated 
valuation pressures.  Moreover,  interest rate spreads on both i nvestment-grade and high-
yield bonds currently are near the ir lowest levels since the fi nancial crisis.  While some of 
the decline in bond spreads reflect s improvements in the credit  quality of these 
borrowers, estimates of bond ris k premiums suggest that bondhol ders are now more 
3 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth a nd slack, see, for example, 
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet?   Assessing Progress toward Full 
Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vo l. 9 (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas, October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documen ts/research/eclett/2014/el1413. pdf; and Jeremy

4 In the calibration of this scena rio, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four tim es larger than in the 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the incr ease reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that cover s the late 1980s to the late 1990s. 
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this s cenario are well belo w those representing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

willing to take on risk.  Similarly, there is a risk that the c urrent unusually low Treasury 
term premium will move toward historically average levels. 
In this scenario, we assume that both equity and bond risk prem iums return more 
quickly to historically normal levels.  By the middle of next year, equity prices fall about 
20 percent; the term premium on Tr easury securities rises halfw ay to its assumed long-
run value; and the triple-B co rporate bond spread rises about 3 0 basis points above the 
baseline, enough to move it back c lose to its median historical  value.  The market 
correction is assumed to cause  an erosion in consumer and busin ess sentiment. 
Real GDP growth slows to a bout 1¾ percent in 2018, roughly ¾ percentage point 
less than in the baseline.  The  unemployment rate remains aroun d 4 percent through 
2022.  With labor market utiliza tion less tight and inflation a lso slightly lower, the federal 
funds rate rises more gradually and is 3½ percent at the end of  2020, about ½ percentage 
point below the baseline. 
The asset price declines in thi s scenario have relatively mild consequences, in 
striking contrast to the decline in house pr ices before the Gre at Recession.  This outcome 
reflects in part our assumption in this scenario that the losse s resulting from these market 
corrections do not primarily fall  on leveraged households and f inancial intermediaries 
and do not result in major disrup tions in the functioning of in terbank and other financial 
markets. 
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [Search and Mat ching 
Model] 
In the baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to 3.6 pe rcent by the end of 
2019, with the natural rate of unemployment unchanged at 4.8 pe rcent.  This scenario 
assumes that the natural rate  of unemployment declines 1 percen tage point over the next 
few years.  The natural rate c ould be driven lower by a variety  of influences, such as 
demographic factors or improvements in job-matching efficiency.   A lower natural rate 
might also reflect the effects of  a sustained low actual unemployment rate if “hysteresis” 
was at play, as suggested in the D omestic Economic Developments  and Outlook box 
“Alternative View:  H ysteresis and the Natural Rate Fallacy.”  In this scenario, we 
assume that the source of a lower natural rate is a decline in worker bargaining power.  In 
addition, we assume that learning a bout the lower natural rate occurs only gradually and, 
thus, that a considerable gap be tween the actual and perceived natural rates persists 
through the end of 2022.

Economic activity is somewhat str onger than in the baseline as firms create more 
jobs and expand production in respon se to lower wages.  As a re sult, the unemployment 
rate falls to 3¼ percent by the end of  2019.  However, because the unemployment rate 
does not decline as much relative to the baseline as the true n atural rate does, resource 
utilization is less tight, and inflation re mains persistently b elow the baseline through the 
end of 2022.  Despite the lower pat h for inflation in this scen ario, the federal funds rate is 
only slightly lower than the baseline because of policymakers’ misperception of the 
degree of tightness in the labor market. 
Stronger Economy [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model] 
Business investment grew faster this year than in the previous year, which may 
indicate that the underlying pace  of real activity is stronger than assumed in the baseline.  
Moreover, labor market conditions  have tightened further, and s everal surveys show 
upbeat consumer and business sentiment in recent months.  Motiv ated by these positive 
developments, this scenario assu mes faster growth in consumer a nd business spending 
than in the baseline. 
Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 3 percent in 2018, compared  with a 
2¼ percent pace in the baseline .  The unemploymen t rate falls m ore rapidly, bottoming 
out at 3¼ percent in 2019 and remai ning lower than in the basel ine for some time 
thereafter.  The Phillips curve in this model is very flat—typi cal of this class of estimated 
DSGE models—such that inflation i s essentially unchanged from t he baseline.5  This is in 
contrast to the large movements of inflation in the first two scenarios, in which the 
Phillips curve is modified and inflation is shocked directly.  In response to faster economic growth, the funds rate pa th is somewhat higher than in  the baseline, reaching 
4½ percent in 2020, about ½ percentage  point higher than in the baseline. 
Stronger Dollar and Weaker Foreign Growth [SIGMA] 
Although the dollar has depreciate d on balance over the past year as economic 
growth abroad has picked up, the f oreign economies continue to face risks, including a 
slowdown in China and sizable spi llovers to EMEs from U.S. mone tary policy 
normalization.  More recently, the rise of populist and antiestablishment parties within 
Europe—as well as the Catalan i ndependence movement in Spain—could set in motion a 
new wave of political instabilit y.  In this scenario, we assume  that some of these 
5 The same scenario implemented i n the staff’s EDO model would p redict a very similar evolution 
of inflation.

downside political risks in Europe m aterialize, weakening inves tor confidence in 
European institutions, fueling fin ancial stresses, and leading to sizable flight-to-safety 
flows toward dollar assets.  Low er growth and financial stresse s in Europe spill over to 
the global economy.  Foreign GDP growth falls to about 2¼ perce nt per year in 2018 and 
2019, nearly ½ percentage point less than in the baseline, and increased uncertainty about 
the foreign outlook boosts the broad real dollar 7 percent rela tive to the baseline by the 
end of 2018.   
Weaker foreign demand and the str onger dollar depress U.S. real net exports.  
Consequently, U.S. real GDP  expands 2 percent in 2018 and 1½ percent in 2019, about 
¼ percentage point less than in the baseline.  The U.S. unemplo yment rate remains above 
the baseline through 2022.  Amid low er resource utilization and  falling import prices, 
U.S. core PCE inflation is  only 1½ percent in 2018, about ¼ percentage point below the 
baseline, and runs below 2 percent through 2020.  The federal f unds rate follows a 
shallower path than in the baseline, rising to only 3¾ percent by the end of 2022.   
Inflation-Driven Tighten ing in the AFEs [SIGMA] 
In our baseline forecast, we see  underlying inflation in the AF Es gradually 
returning to central bank targe ts, supported by accommodative m onetary policy.  Given 
the tightness of labor markets, how ever, a sharper-than-expecte d pickup in inflation could 
prompt AFE central banks to embark on markedly faster policy no rmalization than in the 
baseline, tightening financial  conditions both there and elsewh ere in the world.  In this 
scenario, we assume that such a risk materializes .  Inflation i n the AFEs rises 
½ percentage point relative to the baseline i n 2018, inducing t heir central banks to 
increase policy rates more aggres sively than what is prescribed  by the baseline policy 
rule.  The faster policy normaliza tion triggers an increase in AFE corporate and 
household borrowing spreads, and a rise in AFE sovereign bond yields, including through 
effects on term premiums.  Tighter financial conditions in the AFEs spill over to the rest 
of the world, and the broad real  dollar depreciates 5 percent. 
Lower foreign demand and tighter financial conditions weigh on economic 
activity in the United States, notwithstanding the stimulus to net exports from the 
depreciation of the dollar.  U.S . GDP growth moderates to 2 per cent in 2018, about 
¼ percentage point below the base line, and core PCE inflation runs a touch below the 
baseline through 2022.  The federal funds rate rises more slowl y than in the baseline, 
reaching only 3¾ percent in 2022.

been published, the preceding quarter is taken as the latest historical observation.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies 
In this section, we consider a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection. In the special exhibit “Estimates of the Equilibrium 
Real Federal Funds Rate in the Longer Run,” we summarize recent evidence on the 
longer-run equilibrium real federal funds rate from several time-series econometric 
models as well as forecasts from various surveys. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule (also 
known as the “balanced approach” rule) , a first -difference rule, and a nominal income 
(NI) targeting rule .  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  The middle panel also provides the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is 
constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.
1 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules are somewhat 
lower in the near term than in the September Tealbook, primarily reflecting 
the downward revisions to the staff’s near-term projections for core inflation .  
The prescriptions from these rules, which do not feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding policy rat es in the 
Tealbook baseline. 
• The prescriptions of the first- difference rule are also somewhat lower in the 
near term than those in the September Tealbook, again reflecting the 
downward revisions to the staff’s near- term projections for core inflation . 
• Under the NI targeting rule, the federal funds rate responds to the current 
output gap and the shortfall of the GDP price deflator from the level it would 
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section. Except for the 
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined herein use as the intercept term 
a value of 50 basis points, equal to the longer -run real federal funds rate assumed by the staff. 
See the end of this section for a list of all references.

    1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook" projection 
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the 
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the 
current quarter) in the FRB/US model sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the 
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the September 2017 median SEP 
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

have attained had it increased at an annual rate of 2 percent since 2011: Q4; the 
current shortfall in the GDP price deflator is about 4 percent.   Unlike the other 
rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, the NI targeting rule does not call for 
raising the federal funds rate in the near term from its current level because 
this rule tries to make up for the shortfall in the GDP price deflator . 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL 
FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimate s of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two alternative baselines: the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians of the September 2017 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).2 Both estimates use the FRB/US model to 
conduct the necessary  simulations.  This notion, labeled FRB/US r*, corresp onds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period (starting in 
the current quarter), would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• At 2. 56 percent, t he estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* is slightly 
higher than in the September  Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s slightly larger 
projected output gap in the medium term.  The average projected real federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook baseline, at 0.99 percent,  is 1½ percentage points 
below the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*. 
• At 0.83 percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* because output exceed s its potential value by 
a considerably smaller amou nt in coming y ears under the median SEP 
projections than in the Tealbook forecast despite a lower median path for the 
real federal funds rate in the SEP .  The average projected federal funds rate 
under the SEP-consistent baseline, at 0.34 percent, is ½ percentage point 
lower than the SEP-consistent FRB/US r*. 
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP inform ation to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the September 2017 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project vari ables not covered 
in the SEP—for example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

• The fact that , for each projection, FRB/US r* is higher than the corresponding 
12-quarter average projected real federal funds rate may reflect factors other 
than closing of the output gap in three years that are embedded in the 
Tealbook-baseline reaction function and in FOMC participants’ views on the 
course of appropriate policy. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS 
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and 
the NI targeting rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output 
gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified 
policy rules.3 The simulations are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers 
commit to following the prescriptions of each rule in the future and that financial market 
participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow 
through on this commitment, but also understand the interest rate and macroeconomic 
implications of policymakers doing so.4 
• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, the federal funds rate increases, on 
average, a little less than 1 percentage point per year through 2020.  The 
federal funds rate peaks at 4 percent in 2021 before slowly moving  toward its 
longer-run level of 2½ percent. 
• The Taylor (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial tightening of 
monetary policy, with the real federal funds rate exceeding the corresponding 
Tealbook values by ¾ percentage point or more over the remainder of this 
decade.  Despite this relatively sharp tightening, the unemployment rate is at 
most about ¼ percentage point higher in coming years under Taylor (1999) 
than in the Tealbook baseline.  The reason the sharp tightening of policy under the Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy 
is that agents in the model are forward looking and correctly anticipate that 
monetary policy beyond the period shown will be more accommodative than 
3 Because of these endogenous responses, the n ear-term prescriptions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit. 
4 In contrast to our modeling assumptions, the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the 
FOMC might well entail a period during which the public learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic 
implications.  However, we abstract here from considerations of this kind.

under the Tealbook baseline.  This anticipation makes unemployment lower 
than it would otherwise be.  It also  helps raise inflation modestly above the 
Tealbook baseline over the period shown because inflation in the FRB/US 
model is sensitive to anticipated macro economic developments over 
long periods. 
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp policy tightening but 
otherwise prescribes lower policy rates than does the Taylor (1999) rule over 
the period shown because it responds less strongly to the projected rise in 
output above its potential level.  Because the path of interest rates is not as 
high as in the case of the Taylor (1999) rule, and because agents correctly 
anticipate the path , the unemployment rate is closer  to its Tealbook baseline 
path in the near term and is lower over the remainder of the period shown.  
Similarly, inflation under the Taylor (1993) rule exceeds inflation under the 
Tealbook baseline by more than under the Taylor (1999) rule. 
• The first -difference rule prescribes a slightly higher path for the federal funds 
rate for the next three years than the Tealbook baseline, followed by a lower 
path for some years thereafter.  The latter difference occurs because the first -
difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap 
rather than to its level, reacts to the narrowing of the output gap over the next decade.  The associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction 
with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer -term 
real interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of 
resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower than, and inflation outcomes that exceed, the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection. 
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate than the other rules because this rule seeks to compensate 
for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as measured by the growth rate of the 
GDP price deflator) from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011. 
Because we assume that policymakers credibly commit to closing this gap and 
that economic agents correctly anticipate the long pe riod of low federal funds 
rates, the path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate is  lower than under the other 
policy rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years .  Accordingly, t he

the projected output gap in the medium term. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT 
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5 
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.6 
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate p ath.
7  This higher path arises 
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome 
that policymakers in the model judge to be costly.  The tighter policy results 
in a path for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s 
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations. 
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers secure improve d economic 
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from 
the perspective of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent). Furthermore, 
these promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  Under 
the alternative assumption of optimal policy under discretion, which does not rely on the credibility of 
policymakers’ promises, the results differ significantly only in the simulation in which there is an 
asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap. 
7 When we use the SEP -consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal funds rate 
under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at just below 4 percent in 2020:Q3 
compared with 6½ percent in 2020: Q4 under the Tealbook baseline.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a 
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective, 
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the 
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in 
the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with the 
limited response of inflation to the level of resource utilization in the 
FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, but that is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate 
is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate 
is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal 
weights; it is also below the Tealbook baseline path.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path for the 
policy rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2  percent is not tempered 
by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  Because the public believes that policymakers will follow through on this policy rate 
path even as the unemployment rate substantially undershoots its natural rate, 
the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2  percent somewhat more quickly 
than in the case of equal weights. Starting in the middle of the next decade 
(not shown), the unempl oyment rate runs a little above its natural rate for 
several years as policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures 
stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization.

• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five 
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical to that specification.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses 
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an 
8 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer -run inflation objective and the undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “Asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time inconsistent in the sense that, if given the opportunity to re -optimize the path of the federal funds rate 
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter 
monetary policy. Under the alternative assumpt ion of optimal control under discretion, which rules out 
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the 
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function .

unappealing tradeoff because inflatio n responds only weakly to resource 
utilization.  Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial 
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment to raise inflation in the near term only a modest amount—an outcome that is seen as costly under thi s 
specification of the loss function. 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but 
that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weig hts.  In the 
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate rises much faster in 2017 than 
under the specification with equal weights and remains near 6 percent over much of the remainder of the period shown.  This strong tightening of policy 
results f rom an effort to prevent the projected undershooting of the natural rate 
of unemployment.  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 10-year Treasury y ield are also notably higher for a couple of years than in the 
case of equal weights. Because the short -run Phillips curve is quite flat in the 
FRB/US model, this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to that in the equal -weights case over the period shown, even though this policy  keeps 
the unemployment rate much closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
through 2020.

• The federal funds rate paths prescribed  by optimal control under the above 
loss functions are somewhat higher, on average over the period shown, than in the September Tealbook.  These higher paths primarily reflect the fact that , in 
the staff’s current projection , the unemployment rate is slightly lower in 
relation to its natural rate than was the case in the September Tealbook.  
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONG ER RUN 
The equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate in the longer run—denoted 
rLR—is the rate consistent with the economy operating at its potential once the cyclical 
effects of economic shocks have abated.  This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation 
objective, determines the longer-run level of the nominal federal funds rate and other 
interest rates in the staff’s projection and economic models.  rLR is also a parameter in 
9 From 2020 onward, the nominal and real federal funds rates for this simulation are sometimes 
above and sometimes below the corresponding values observed in the case of equal weights.

many of the simple policy rules, inc luding the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in 
this and other section s of Tealbook A. 
In the special exhibit, we provide an overview of recent evidence on rLR based on 
time-series studies from the research literature and the uncertainty around those 
estimates .  For comparison, we also show several survey- based estimates .10 To 
summarize the main findings, rLR seems to have b een declin ing since well before the 
Global F inancial  Crisis and is currently likely at a historically low level , although there is 
substantial uncertainty regarding its precise level . 
• The top panel  plots the range of point estimates from eight time -series models 
of rLR . 11  Although the modeling approaches and econometric techniques 
differ acro ss the various models, the studies have the common feature that 
they use time -series methods to infer rLR from the co -movement of either 
macroeconomic series like inflation, interest rates, and output, or both 
macroeconomic and f inancial market s data, like TIPS yields .  The most recent 
point estimates range from negative ¼ to positive 1¾ percent. All the point 
estimates used to compute the range have declined since the early 2000s.12 
• Time -series estimates of rLR are su bject to sizable uncertainty .  As depi cted in 
the middle panel, the 68 percent uncertainty  bands range from ±½ percentage 
point in the case of Del Negro and others (2017) to ±2½ percentage points in 
the case of Laubach and Williams (2003).  The sources of this uncertainty 
vary across the studies , reflecting factors such as the choice of the 
econometric approach as well as uncertainty about the prevailing state of the 
economy and parameters of the  model. 
10 See the appendix to this section for sources, concepts, and methodology.  This special exhibi t 
complements the evidence presented for a small number of time -series estimates in the boxes “The 
Equilibrium Real Rate in the Longer Run” presented in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the July 
2017 and January 2016 Tealbooks. 
11 All time -series e stimates reported herein have been computed using data updated through 
2017:Q2. 
12 There are differences in the paths of rLR across the studies. In particular, while some of the 
paths (such as Laubach and Williams, 2003) hint at the possibility that the re cent recession played a key 
role in the decline of the equilibrium rate, others (such as Johannsen and Mertens, 2016, and Christensen 
and Rudebusch, 2017) entail a slow decline —a pattern more consistent with the importance of secular 
factors such as change s in demographics or a productivity growth slowdown.  The role of demographics is 
considered by Gagnon, Johannsen, and L ópez-Salido (2016).

• The bottom panel reports estimates of rLR from various sources: the Tealbook , 
the SEP, the Survey of Primary Dealers , Blue Chip Financial Forecasts , and 
the Congressional Budget Office .  The Tealbook estimate, at ½ percent , is 
similar to, though a touch lower than, the others.13 However , the evidence 
presented in this special exhibit, taken as a whole, indicates that the staff’s 
current assumption for rLR is consistent with time-series and survey estimates, 
especially once account is taken of the fact that all these estimates are subject 
to considerable uncertainty. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously. 
13 The staff, FOMC participants, and other forecasters have lowered their estimates of rLR in recent 
years.  For exam ple, at the beginning of 2012, both the Tealbook baseline estimate and the median SEP 
estimate stood at 2¼ percent.

Appendix 
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies. 
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial kno wledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  It also reports the expression for the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline pro jection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t; for quarters prior to 
the projection pe riod under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  T he right -hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter

core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the 
output gap estimate for the current period (𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead 
annual change in the output ga p (∆4𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡). The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation 
objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent. 
The nominal income  targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal income, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the log of the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value , denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡 ∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage p oints per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the 
sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortf all of the GDP deflator from the level 
it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1 
Simple Rules 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have  been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.3 The prescriptions of the first -difference rule

𝑠𝑠=2012 :𝑄𝑄1 , 
where ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑠𝑠 denotes the annualized quarterly rate of growth of the GDP deflator for quarter s. 
2 The staff uses the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, augmented with a temporary 
intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baselin e projection.  For applications, see, for 
example, Erceg and others ( 2012).  
3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consis tent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis. Taylor (1993) rule 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿) + 0.5𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡

do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of ch anges in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the l ines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy R ules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines : a 
Tealbook- consistent baseline and another one consistent with the Summary of Economic 
Projections ( SEP).  The laboratory for simulations is the FRB/US model, the staff’s large -scale 
econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate that, if 
maintained over a 12 -quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap 
equal to zero in the final quarter of that period using the output projection consistent with the 
Tealbook baseline or SEP- consistent baseline.4 This measure depends on a broad array of 
economic factors, some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables.  The measure is derived un der the assumption that agents in the model form VAR-
based expectations —that is, agents u se small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of 
future variables are determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time. 
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other con cepts 
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations an d are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in t hat quarter; when the Tealbook i s published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following e quation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the futur e using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽 0.9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕 � 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉 𝑇𝑇 
𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎 �𝜆𝜆𝜋𝜋 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 − 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)𝟐𝟐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑢𝑢,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏)𝟐𝟐 + 𝜆𝜆𝐿𝐿(𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉 − 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉−𝟏𝟏 )𝟐𝟐�. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty t o the unemployment rate falling be low the natural rate. 
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specifi cation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5  The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights. 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not a ffect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits. 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the special exhibit shows a range of estimates from eight time-series 
models based on the following studies: Christensen and Rudebusch (2017); Del Negro, 
Giannone, Giannoni, and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach , and Williams (201 7); Johannsen 
and Mertens (2016) ; Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003) ; Lewis and Vazquez-Grande 
(2017); and Lubik and Matthes (2015). All computations use the latest vintage of historical data 
through 2017:Q2.  The estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point in time, they 
make use of historical data only up to that point in time. 
Where possible, t he middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each 
model’s point estimate for 2017:Q2.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are 
specific to each stud y.  Loss Functions

The bottom panel shows the selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate 
in the longer run from various surveys and analyses, which were computed as follows: 
• “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run. 
• “Median SEP ” is the median of FOMC members’ projections of the federal funds 
rate in the longer run less the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the 
September 2017 S EP. 
• The Survey of Primary Dealers estimate equals the long-run median dealer forecast 
for the target rate less the longer -run median dealer forecast of PCE inflation as of the 
September 2017 s urvey. 
• The Blue Chip estimate equals the consensus five- year average (2024 –28) forecast 
for the federal funds rate less the consensus five- year average (2024 –28) forecast for 
the GDP chained price index as of the June 2017 B lue Chip Financial Forecasts 
survey. 
• The Congressional Budget Office estimate equals the federal funds rate in 2027 less 
the PCE index in 2027 as of the June 2017 CBO Baseline Forecasts.

    1. Annual values stated on a fiscal year basis. Quarterly values not seasonally adjusted.    2. Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.    3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum        of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
        household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
        to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
