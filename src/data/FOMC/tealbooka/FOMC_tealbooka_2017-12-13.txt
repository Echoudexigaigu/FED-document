Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming data suggest that economic  activity has c ontinued to e xpand at an 
above-trend pace.  Real GDP appears to be rising at a solid ann ual rate of 2¾ percent in 
the second half of this year.  The  labor market looks to have t ightened further, with the 
unemployment rate dropping to 4.1 p ercent in October and the ga in in payroll 
employment bouncing back after be ing depressed by the effects o f the recent hurricanes.   
Over the medium term, we expect real GDP growth to slow gradual ly from 
2½ percent this year and next, to 2 percent in 2019, and then t o 1¾ percent in 2020 as 
monetary policy continues to ti ghten.  As in the previous proje ction, we assume tax cuts 
will be implemented in early 2018, b ut we have shifted the comp osition of the cuts 
toward corporate taxes and have a lso incorporated some small positive effects on 
aggregate supply.  Nonetheless, by the end of 2020 t he level of  real GDP is essentially 
the same as in our October Tealbook forecast. 
As in our previous projection, we forecast that output growth w ill be sufficient to 
push the level of real GDP 2¼ percent above our estimate of its  potential by mid-2019, 
and we expect the output gap to remain near that level through the end of the medium 
term.  Correspondingly, the unemplo yment rate is projected to f all to 3½ percent in 2019 
and to remain at that level  through 2020, 1¼ percentage points below our estimate of its 
natural rate. 
PCE prices rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in Octobe r, and core PCE 
prices rose 1.4 percent; both m easures were a touch higher than  in our October Tealbook 
projection.  We continue to view the  unanticipated softness of this year’s readings as 
largely transitory and expect cor e PCE price inflation to pick up next year.  As resource 
utilization tightens further and underlying inflation gradually  edges up, core PCE price 
inflation is projected to move up to 2 percent in 2019, while t otal PCE price inflation hits 
2 percent in 2020.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookComparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is a little below the project ions from 
both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus in 2017 
and similar to both of them in 2018 . The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is similar 
to the SPF and Blue Chip forecasts in 2017 and about ½ percentage point below them 
in 2018.  The s taff’s projection for CPI inflation is above the Blue Chip and SPF forecasts 
in 2017 but in line with both in 2018 .  Th e staff’s projections for overall PCE price 
inflation is a little higher than the S PF forecast in 2017 and similar in 2018, while the 
staff’s projection for core PCE price inflation is similar to the SPF forecast in both 
years .  
Note: SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures. Blue Chip does not provide results for 
PCE price inflation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from about 
50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookRevisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP 
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the September FOMC meeting.  The table below compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the September Tealbook. 
GDP growth this year now looks to be a little weaker than it did in September.  Nonetheless, 
we have upgraded our growth outlook slightly for next year and beyond, reflecting financial 
assumptions that are a little more supportive. The unemployment rate has again come in a 
bit lower than we had projected , and with a further reduction in our estimate of the natural 
rate of un employment (to 4.7 percent ), our projection for the unemployment rate over the 
medium term is revised down 0.2 percentage point relative to September. Thus, r esource 
utilization, as measured by the unemployment gap or the output gap , is slightly tighter i n 
this projection than in September. 
Our projection for core PCE price inflation in 2017 is unrevised relative to the September 
Tealbook , while a rise in oil prices has pushed our projection for headline inflation higher in 
the near term. We continue to view this year’s weak core inflation readings as being largely 
transitory, though we have reduced our core inflation projection for 2018 slightly since 
September.  We continue to project that both total and core inflation will edge up further 
after next year and will reach 2 percent over the medium term . 
With both resource utilization and inflation close to our September projection s, the federal 
funds rate path from the intercept -adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our 
baseline forecast is also close to that in the September T ealbook.

previous Tealbooks, we had assumed t hat adjustments to federal fiscal policy 
would increase the primary budget deficit—that is, the deficit excluding 
interest costs—by ½ percent of GDP , and we implemented this fiscal 
expansion through a cut in personal income taxes starting in th e first quarter 
of 2018.  Since the October Teal book, however, the House and Se nate have 
unveiled tax legislation that w ould cause the bulk of the tax cuts to accrue to 
businesses.  Accordingly, we  have altered the composition of ou r placeholder 
to one-third personal tax rate c uts and two-thirds corporate ta x rate cuts, but 
we have kept the total size and starting date the same.1 
o We continue to assume that in fiv e years, with an elevated and rising debt-
to-GDP ratio, the Congress will begin enacting deficit reductio n measures 
that gradually bring annual deficits back to sustainable levels . 
 Now that the composition of the pr ojected tax policy changes se ems 
somewhat clearer, we have built i n some aggregate supply respon ses. 
o We assume that the personal inc ome tax rate cuts lead to a small increase 
in potential labor supply, and that the corporate tax rate cuts  will boost the 
capital stock and lead to slightly higher structural productivi ty.  All told, 
these effects raise the level  of potential output 0.1 percent b y the end of 
2020.  
o These supply effects also translate into higher demand as house holds 
begin to realize the higher labor  income associated with greate r 
productivity and labor f orce participation. 
 The placeholder tax cuts raise the level of real GDP at the end  of 2020 by 
about ½ percent, a little larger  than what we have assumed in p revious 
Tealbook projections because of our ne w aggregate supply effect s. 
 We continue to project t hat discretionary policy actions across  all levels of 
government will have a roughly neutral effect on aggregate dema nd in 2017 
1 The tax cuts recently  passed by the House  and currently being considered by the Senate are 
heavily front-loaded such that the size of the tax cuts decline s notably over a 10-year budget window on 
net.  Our fiscal placeholder assu mes that the tax legislation ultimately passed into law will not be front-
loaded.  Accordingly, over the ne xt three years our assumed tax  cuts are smaller—by roughly one-third— 
than ones in the current Hou se and Senate legislation.

but will boost output growth about ¼ percentage point per year from 2018 
through 2020, exclusive of any multiplier effects and offsets from reactions in 
interest rates and the dollar. 
 Federal government operations are funded through December 8.  W e assume 
the Congress will pass appropriations in time to avoid disrupti ons, although 
the chance of a temporary shutdow n appears greater than it was a month ago.2 
Monetary Policy 
 The intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule used in our projection calls 
for the federal funds rate to increase a little less than 1 percentage point per 
year, on average, over the projection period and to average 4 p ercent in the 
fourth quarter of 2020, in line wit h our previous forecast.  
 The SOMA portfolio declines grad ually and predictably as securi ties are 
redeemed in a manner consistent with the June 2017 addendum to the 
Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise over the medium  term from an 
average of 2.4 percent in the c urrent quarter to 3.6 percent by  the end of 2020.  
During this period, the 10 ‐year valuation window m oves through a period of 
rising short-term interest rates, and the term premium is proje cted to increase 
to more normal levels.  In this forecast, similar to previous p rojections, the 
yield curve is inverted fro m 2020 through late 2026, as discuss ed in the box 
“Why Is the Yield Curve Inverte d in the Tealbook Projection?” 
 The paths of the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the triple-B c orporate bond 
rate generally follow the contour of the 10-year Treasury yield .  
2 A lapse of appropriations that results in a short-term shutdow n of the federal government would 
have only minor implications for the outlook.  For example, the  staff estimated that the 16-day shutdown in 
October 2013 reduced GDP growth ¼ percentage point in the fourt h quarter of that year and boosted it by 
an equal amount in the following quarter.  This estimate embodi es our judgment that t here were no material 
effects on private investment or consumption due to reduced con fidence or increased uncertainty.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookWhy Is the Yield Curve Inverted in the Tealbook Projection ? 
In the baseline projection, the federal funds rate implied by the s taff’s assumed intercept -
adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule rises above the 10 -year Treasury yield starting in the 
second quarter of 2020, resulting in an inverted yield curve that lasts until late 2026, as 
illustrated in figure 1. 
We construct the projected 10-year yield as the sum of an expectations -hypot hesis 
component and a term -premium component.  In our framework, two factors explain th e 
projected inversion . First, the policy rule used in the staff projection implies that the federal 
funds rate begins to overshoot its estimated long -run value of 2.5 percent in early 2019, 
reach ing 4¼ percent by the end of 2021 and then converging back very slowly .1 During most 
of the period of this overshoot, the federal funds rate is high relative to its 10-year- forward 
moving average (the expectations -hypothesis component of the 1 0-year yield).  Second, t he 
10-year term premium is currently quite low and is assumed to increase only gradually to a 
long -run value of about 40 basis points , which is still very low by historical standards. All else 
being equal, a regime with lower term premiums makes a yield curve inversion more likely , 
as the required overshoot in the federal funds rate is smaller in that case.2 
Figure 2 shows the evolution of the term premium on 10 -year Treasury securities estimated 
using the procedure developed by Kim and Wright (2005) . The term premium appears to 
have trended materially lower over time, and there is evidence of structural breaks in 
its mean .3 
Figure 1: Interest Rate Projections 
1 This overshoot, in turn, is mainly a consequence of an overshoot in the projected output gap . Inflation 
is projected to exceed its target , but only slightly . 
2 The box “The Flattening of the U.S. Yield Curve since December 2015 ” in the Financial Market 
Developments section explores the reasons for the recent decline in the slope of the yield curve, focusing 
on the spread between 2-and 1 0-year Treasury yields. The behavior of the slope of the yield curve in the 
projection is qualitatively similar at present using either the 2 -year Treasury yield or the federal funds rate. 
3 See Don H. Kim and Jonathan Wright (2005), “An Arbitrage -Free Three -Factor Term Structure Model 
and the Recent Behavior of Long -Term Yields and D istant -Horizon F orward Rates, ” Finance and Economics 
Discussion Series 2005 -33 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August), 
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2005/200533/200533pap.pdf. The estimated structural break dates in 
figure 2, indicated by vertical lines, are as follows: January 1986, April 19 95, October 2004, and August 2011.

Figure 2: Kim -Wright 10-Year Term Premium (1980 –2017) 
The current regime is estimated to have started in late 2011 and implies an average term 
premium of only 14 basis points . This term premium is significantly lower than it was 
between 1995 and 2011 , for example, when it averaged about 1 percent. Mechanically, and 
keeping everything else constant, had we assumed the term premium would return to its 
1995 –201 1 average by the end of the medium term, the projection would not imply an 
inverted yield curve. 
Historically, an inverted yield curve has often signaled an oncoming recession. Indeed, a 
yield curve inversion has preceded each of the p ast seven recessions in the United States.4 
However, in many of these instances, the inversion occurred as the FOMC increased the 
federal funds rate aggressively, with the goal of curbing significant inflation pressures even 
at the cost of a recession .5 In contrast, over the forecast period, inflati on is never more than 
about 0.1 percentage point above target and the federal funds rate tightening implied by the 
assumed policy rule is correspondingly relatively mild . 
In the baseline forecast, the inverted yield curve is indeed associated with a period of subpar 
growth as the policy rule coaxes the economy toward its longer-run equilibrium , but not 
with recession.  To be sure, the risk of recession during this period is elevated because a 
smaller adverse shock would be sufficient to tip the econ omy from subpar growth into 
outright contraction.  But the inverted yield curve that is forecast to prevail during this 
period should not be interpreted as an exogenous signal that a recession will mechanically 
follow . 
4 There also have been inversions that were not followed by a recession. 
5 These instances are broadly consistent with the “Romer and Romer dates” as identified in Christ ina D. 
Romer and David H. Romer (1989), “Does Monetary Policy Matter? A New Test in the Spirit of Friedman and 
Schwartz, ” in Olivier Jean Blanc hard and Stanley Fischer, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual , vol. 4 
(Cambridge., Mass.: MIT Press), pp. 121– 84; and i n Christ ina D. Romer and D avid H. Romer (1994 ),

Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are revised  4¼ percent higher starting in 2018, i n part reflecting 
our new tax policy assumptions.  Equity prices have probably al ready been 
bolstered by the prospects of a  corporate tax cut, and we assum e some 
additional increases when the ta x package is en acted.  However,  we view the 
scope for further stock price appreciation over the medium term  as limited, 
and we continue to expect equit y values to rise beyond the firs t quarter of 
2018 at just below ½ percent per year on average.   
 Incoming data on house prices have been in line with our expectations.  With 
data through September, we projec t that house prices will rise 5½ percent this 
year before decelerating to an average annual rate of about 4 percent over the 
next three years.  The ratio of  house prices to rents is projec ted to remain only 
marginally above its estimated long-run trend. 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
 We estimate that real GDP growt h in the foreign economies stepp ed down 
from an annual rate of 3 percen t in the second quarter of 2017 to 2¼ percent 
in the third quarter, ½ percentage  point weaker than estimated at the time of 
the October Tealbook.  With some of this step-down in growth re flecting 
temporary factors in Canada a nd Mexico, growth is expected to rebound to 
3 percent in the current quarter .  Over the remainder of the me dium term, 
growth moderates to a pace just under 2¾ percent. 
 The broad nominal dollar is dow n a touch, on net, since the Oct ober Tealbook.  
Early in the period, more-accommod ative-than-expected communica tions by 
AFE central banks boosted the dolla r, but the dollar later resu med its 
downward trend from earlier in the  year.  We expect the broad r eal dollar to 
appreciate at an annual rate of 1½ percent over the forecast pe riod as market 
expectations for the federal f unds rate move up toward the staf f forecast. Our 
projection for the broad real do llar is about ¾ percent lower b y the end of 
2020 than in the October Tealbook. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude oi l jumped in early November and now stands at 
$63, about $5 per barrel higher than at the time of the October  Tealbook.

Prices for futures contracts  with delivery at the end of 2020 a re up about 
$2 per barrel, at $57.  Prices moved higher in response to rece nt political 
developments in Saudi Arabia and ongoing tensions in the Iraqi Kurdish 
region.  Some observers have suggest ed that the responsiveness of U.S. shale 
oil production to prices would o ffset Middle Eastern supply sho cks in the 
medium term.  However, the recent rise in farther-dated futures prices 
suggests that this offset is not  complete.  (For further analysis, see the box 
“The Limited Effectiveness of S hale Oil in Moderating Oil Price 
Fluctuations.”)  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We expect real GDP to increas e at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the second half 
of this year, up from 2 percent in the first half.  Much of the  step-up reflects a rebound in 
inventory investment, which was  a large drag on GDP growth in the first half and is 
projected to boost growth slight ly in the second half.  Relativ e to the October Tealbook, 
second-half growth is a little slower, ref lecting weaker-than-e xpected data on consumer 
spending and net exports. 
Within the second half of this y ear, real GDP rose at a 3¼ perc ent pace in the 
third quarter, and we project a 2¼ pe rcent gain in the fourth q uarter.3  Swings in 
inventory investment are estim ated to have boosted GDP growth ¾ percentage point in 
the third quarter, and we expect they will restrain growth by ½  percentage point in the 
fourth quarter.  For the first quarter of 2018, we expect outpu t to expand at an annual rate 
of 2½ percent, similar to the average pace in 2017. 
 Real PCE appears on track to rise at a moderate 2½ percent pace over the 
second half of the year, somewhat  less than in our October Tealbook forecast. 
Motor vehicle sales have b een boosted by hurricane-related vehi cle 
replacement demand in recent months, while growth of consumer s pending 
outside of motor vehicles has been modest.  We expect consumer spending to 
expand about 2¾ percent in the f irst quarter of next year, supp orted in part by 
the personal income tax cuts.  
3 If not for the hurricanes, the s wing in GDP growth between the  third and fourth quarters would 
have been even larger.  We continue to estimate that the effect s of the hurricanes held down real GDP 
growth ½ percentage point in t he third quarter and will boost i t ¾ percentage point in the fourth.

 Business investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) appears to be 
increasing at an annual rate of  8¾ percent in the second half o f this year and 
7¼ percent for 2017 overall—a marked improvement from flat E&I spending 
in 2016.  Data on orders and shipm ents of nondefense capital go ods in 
September and October were posit ive, on balance, and recent ind icators of 
business optimism and expected profitability remain upbeat.  In contrast, 
investment in nonresidential structures appears to be declining  in the second 
half of the year, as investment in nondrilling structures falls  and the recovery 
in drilling activity that began last year further subsides.  We  expect that 
overall business fixed investment will continue to expand at a moderate rate in 
early 2018, with the tax cuts ge nerating a modest boost to inve stment through 
the medium term.  
 Following declines in the second and third quarters of this yea r, residential 
investment is forecast to advance at a 2 percent pace, on avera ge, in the fourth 
and first quarters.  Over the course of 2017, residential inves tment has been 
held down by higher mortgage interes t rates as well as supply c onstraints 
caused by the limited availabilit y of labor and developed lots. 
 Net exports have been contributing positively to GDP growth for  most of the 
year as a result of strong for eign demand and weaker-than-expec ted import 
growth, especially for consumer goods.  In the current quarter, net exports are expected to make a neutral contribution to real GDP growth as i mport growth 
picks up.  Next year the net expor t contribution is also expect ed to be near 
neutral, as the recent strength in imports persists and, suppor ted by recent 
dollar depreciation, export growth continues at its 2017 pace. 
 Recent indicators of manufacturing activity, including data on October 
production and readings from manufacturing surveys, have been u pbeat and 
point to strong growth of about 6¼ percent at an annual rate in  the current 
quarter.  Much of that strength ref lects transito ry factors, mo st notably the 
recovery from the hurricanes a nd a bounceback in motor vehicle assemblies 
after a third-quarter lull. With essentially all of the catch- up from the 
hurricanes having concluded, we e xpect growth in manufacturing production 
to step down to a moderate pace of about 2 percent in the first  quarter.

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookThe Limited Effectiveness of Shale Oil 
in Moderating Oil Price Fluctuations 
Recent political turmoil in the Middle East has again raised concerns about the stability of global 
oil supplies, pushing up the spot price of oil. In recent years, some commentators have 
suggested that U.S. shale oil production is flexible enough to moderate, or even neutralize, oil 
price shocks in the medium term.1 Here we critically examine th e hypothesis that shale oil has 
altered the perceived persistence of oil price chang es.2 We estimate that the co-movement of oil 
price futures with the spot price of oil has not declined following the rapid growth of shale 
production, suggesting that the potential buffering effect of shale production might be 
overstated, or, at least , that market participants have not yet fully internalized that effect into 
their expectations for prices.  
The potential for shale oil production to moderat e oil price shocks is based on two key 
differences between shale and conventional oil production. First, shale oil wells move more 
quickly from planning to production than conventional wells . Second, the output of a producing 
shale well naturally declines more quickly.  As such, with a greater share of production coming 
from shale wells, U.S. production can respond more quickly to prices and possibly moderate the 
price effects of changes in oil market supply and demand. 
As shown in figure 1 , shale production has responded to shifts in oil price s, falling back when 
prices started declin ing in mid-2014 and then resuming growth relatively quickly after prices 
troughed in early 2016.3 
1 This hypothesis is discussed in Spencer Dale (2015 ), “The New Economics of Oil,” Oxford Institute for Energy 
Studies, October, https://ww w.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp -content/uploads/2015/10/The -New- Economics -of-
Oil.pdf . 
2 The role of the perceived persistence of oil price changes in determining macroeconomic outcomes is 
discussed in Sylvain Leduc, Kevin Moran, and Robert Vigfusson (2016), “Learning in the Oil Futures Markets: 
Evidence and M acroeconomic Implications, ” International Finance Discussion Papers 1179 (Washington: Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2016.1179. 
3 As discussed in the June 2017 Tealbook box “Why Is U.S. Oil Output So Strong? ,” although the U.S. oil 
industry did dramatically reduce the number of operating drilling rigs, strong productivity growth moderated t he 
decline in shale output.

If market participants perceive that shale oil production largely moderates oil price spikes, then 
oil price changes should be less persistent and farther- dated futures prices should co-move less 
with spot prices.  To test this claim, figure 2 reports t ime-varying estimates of how oil price 
futures co-move with spot prices.4 In the 2003–14 period , a $1 change in the spot price was 
associated with 12-month -ahead futures increasing 75 cents.  In mid -2014, the link between spot 
and futures temporarily weakened but quickly bounced back.  The current co-movement is much 
higher than its average in the 1990s, when oil markets believed that OPEC would stabilize the 
long -term price of oil.  
Why has increased shale oil production not made oil price futures less responsive to spot prices? 
One possibility is that shale production is indeed flexible enough to buffer price shocks in the 
medium run, but, after a 15- year period when oil prices went from $20 to $ 145 and then back to 
$26 per barrel, market participants are reluctant to believe that longer -term oil prices have 
stabilized .  Over time, market participants could internalize the increased flexibility of shale 
production , disconnecting futures prices from spot prices. 
Another possibility is that market participa nts are accurately assessing the reality that aggregate 
shale production is less flexible than boosters would suggest.  The flexibility of individual shale oil 
wells may not directly scale up to overall production because of industry -wide constraints on 
materials, labor, and transportation.  For example, to increase production beyond existing 
pipeline capacity require s transporting oil by rail, putting an additional $ 10 wedge per barrel 
between wellhead and delivery prices . 
Whether shale oil will ultimately prove flexible enough to neutralize the effects of foreign supply 
disruptions is yet to be determined and could change over time as the industry evolves , 
constraints are relaxed, and new technologies are developed.  But at present, even though the 
domestic shale oil industry would expand in response to a foreign supply outage, it appears that 
markets would expect that expansion to have only a modest effect on global oil prices.5

discusses macroeconomic effects of oil price changes.

Over the medium term, we project real GDP growth will slow stea dily from 
2½ percent in 2018 to 1¾ percent in  2020 as monetary policy con tinues to tighten.  
Relative to the October Teal book, the output gap is essentially  unrevised at the end 
of 2020. 
 With the assumed composition of t ax cuts now tilted more toward  corporate 
taxes and less toward personal ta xes, we have increased the boo st from fiscal 
policy to business investment a nd scaled back the boost to cons umer 
spending.  
 Potential GDP growth edges up t o 1¾ percent by the end of the m edium term.  
With real GDP growth expected to o utpace potential growth throu ghout much 
of the projection, resource utiliz ation tightens further.  In 2 019 and 2020, real 
GDP is projected to exceed its potential le vel by around 2¼ percent on 
average. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Since the October Tealbook, labor  market conditions have contin ued to tighten on 
balance.4  We expect further t ightening over the medium term at a similar pace to the one 
in the October T ealbook projection. 
 Following an upwardly revised gain of 18,000 in September, total nonfarm 
payroll employment rose 261,000 in October, as the labor market largely 
recovered from the effects of the hurricanes.5  Excluding those effects, we 
estimate that payroll gain s averaged around 180,000 over the pa st three 
months and will continue to expand at this pace through the fir st quarter— 
well above the estimates of 80,000 to 120,000 or so per month t he staff thinks 
would be consistent with unchanged labor market slack.  (See the box 
“Measuring the Labor Market Usi ng ADP Microdata” for a discussi on of 
4 The employment report for Nov ember will be released on Decembe r 8, the Friday before the 
FOMC meeting.  We will provide a forecast update that afternoon . 
5 Given the upward revision to September payrolls and the smaller-than-expected job gains in 
October, we now estimate that the hurricanes temporarily depressed payroll employment by 150,000 in 
September (about 50,000 less than in the October Tealbook), boo sted job gains in October by 100,000 (also 
50,000 less than in our earlier projection), and will further boost job gains in November by 50,000. We do 
not think that the hurricanes had any material effect on the unemployment and participation rates.

alternative data sources that we  are beginning to use to inform  our assessment 
of labor market conditions.) 
 The unemployment rate decline d to 4.1 percent in October, 0.1 p ercentage 
point below our previous forecast, and has now fallen nearly ¾ percentage 
point since the end of last year .  We expect the unemployment rate to remain 
at this level through Decembe r and to tick down to 3.9 percent by March—a 
downward revision of 0. 1 percentage point.   
 The labor force participati on rate (LFPR) fell sharply to 62.7 percent in 
October, a little below our prev ious projection.  Nevertheless, since the end of 
last year and, indeed, for the pa st several years, the LFPR has essentially 
moved sideways, consistent with m odest labor market tightening on this 
dimension when judged against i ts declining trend.  We expect t he LFPR to be 
62.8 percent for the remainder of  the year and to edge back dow n to 
62.7 percent in the first quart er, about the same as in our pre vious projection. 
 Other labor market data in Octobe r were also consistent with fu rther 
tightening, including declines in t he share of workers who repo rt being 
employed part time for economic  reasons and the share of the po pulation out 
of the labor force but who report wanting a job.  These measure s have both 
fallen on net this year and are near their pre-recession levels . 
We have made some small revisions to our aggregate supply assum ptions this 
round. 
 Since the September Tealbook when we last made a small downward adjustment to the natural rate, th e unemployment rate has come in a little 
lower than expected, continuing a pattern of surprises seen over the course of 
the year on net.  Also over the y ear, core price inflation has been soft, which 
seems inconsistent with the addi tional labor market tightness s uggested by the 
greater-than-expected decline i n the unemployment rate.  We hav e interpreted 
this constellation of data as suggesting that the natural rate is slightly lower

Domestic Econ Devel & OutlookMeasuring the Labor Market Using ADP Microdata 
A key challenge for both policymakers and staff is to gauge the current state of the 
macroeconomy, including the labor market. The payroll employment series from the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics (BLS) Current Employment Statistics (CES) program is one of the most 
carefully constructed measures of labor market activity, but even this series is subject to 
sampling and nonsampling errors.1 Indeed, the 90 percent confidence interval around the 
monthly change in private payroll employment is +/– 111,000 due to sampling error alone. 
Moreover, the variation of actual (preliminary tobenchmark) revisions to this series since 
2003, which reflects both some sampling and some nonsampling errors, is even larger than 
would be implied by the sampling base d confidence interval. New sources of labor market 
data offer an opportunity to complement official statistics and to produce more timely, 
accurate, and detailed analyses of labor market activity. In this regard, the Board’s staff has 
been working with data from the payroll processing company ADP that cover 20 percent of 
the private workforce and are available weekly in near real time.2 
The BLS and ADP data are both based on large samples of firms that cover roughly equal 
fractions of private payroll employment. The BLS measure is based on a probability sample of 
establishments.3 In contrast, the ADP data set consists of the firms that hire ADP to manage 
their payrolls, which may introduce sample selection issues. These potential selection issues 
are reduced to some extent by the fact that we reweight the ADP data by establishment size 
and industry to match the characteristics of the universe of firms along these dimensions. 
Reassuringly, our ADP employment index (the black line shown in figure 1) has a similar mean 
and variance to, and is highly correlated with, the BLS series (the red line). 
Figure 1: BLS and ADP Monthly Employment Growth 
1 Sampling error arises because the estimate of payroll employment is based on responses from a 
sample of employers, not a census. Nonsampling error arises because of issues such as respondent errors, 
errors in data processing, and bias due to nonresponse. 
2 One existing use of ADP data is ADP’s monthly National Employment Report (NER). The NER 
forecasts BLS payroll employment changes using a combination of ADP derived data and other publicly 
available data. By contrast, our primary goal in using the ADP microdata is to produce an estimate of 
employment changes independent from the BLS payroll series as well as other data sources. 
3 The BLS payroll series is benchmarked annually to administrative data, which increases the 
reliability of the historical series. However, the administrative data are available only with several months’ 
delay.

The ADP data have several useful properties. First, the data cover each week of the month, so 
the ADP index captures employment developments for the month as a whole, whereas the 
BLS series covers only the pay period including the 12th of the month. Second, our ADP 
employment index helps predict BLS employment changes in real time, even after accounting 
for private forecaster expectations and other standard indicators. Third, the ADP index is 
useful for dealing with a particular anomaly of the BLS data: In recent years, the first BLS 
estimate of employment changes for August has tended to be too low and has subsequently 
been revised upward, while the ADP index does not have this bias. Finally, the ADP data can 
be updated every week and include full geographic detail. This timeliness and detail allow 
better analysis of transitory or localized events such as storms. The staff has already started 
to incorporate such insights in its assess ment of the labor market, including when estimating 
the effects of the recent hurricanes. 
A natural question is whether we can create a more precise estimate of employment growth 
by pooling the information in the BLS and ADP payroll employment data. In preliminary work, 
we combine the information in the two series using a statistical tool called the Kalman filter. 
The resultant measure of underlying employment growth is the blue line in figure 2, plotted 
along with the model based confidence interval. A similar exercise that excludes ADP data 
and only uses BLS data yields a confidence interval that is about 20 percent wider. The Kalman 
filter places roughly equal weight on the BLS series and the ADP series, which is consistent 
with the fact that ADP and BLS cover roughly equal sized samples from the establishment 
population.4 
These results are encouraging in their own right. Moreover, they point to the possibility of 
even greater gains if information from other large payroll processing companies could be 
incorporated into the estimates as well. Over the coming years, we are hopeful that ever
expanding technological possibilities combined with a rise in the availability of private data will 
continue to impr ove economic measurement. 
Figure 2: Combining BLS and ADP Monthly Employment Changes with the Kalman Filter 
4 For comparison, the same exercise with the BLS payroll employment series and the employment 
series from the household survey (adjusted to match the scope of the payroll series) puts a weight of well 
over 90 percent on the payroll series.

than what we have been assuming, and we nudged down our estimat e from 
4.8 percent to 4.7 percen t by the end of 2017.6 
 As noted earlier, we assume that the cut to corporate taxes wil l boost 
structural productivity slightly  through greater capital deepen ing, and that the 
cut to personal income taxes will  increase potential labor supp ly through a 
slightly higher trend LFPR.  Toge ther, these effects boost the level of potential 
output 0.1 percent by 2020. 
We continue to expect the labor market to tighten further throu gh 2019. 
 The unemployment rate is projected to decline more gradually go ing forward 
than it has this year, reac hing 3.5 percent in 2019 and remaini ng at that level 
in 2020—0.1 percentage point below th e previous Tealbook.  However, with 
the 0.1 percentage point downward r evision to the natural rate,  at the end of 
the medium term the difference between the natural and actual u nemployment 
rates is the same as in the October Tealbook. 
 Total payroll employment gains ar e expected to slow from an ave rage 
monthly pace of about 175,000 thi s year and next to 150,000 in 2019 and 
120,000 in 2020.   
 Over the medium term, the LFPR edges down a little more slowly than its 
trend, as sustained job gains a nd rising real wages continue to  draw 
individuals into the labor for ce while also slowing outflows, e nding 2020 
0.4 percentage point above our estimate of its trend level.  Co mpared with the 
October Tealbook, the LFPR is a t ouch higher in the medium term, reflecting 
the labor supply response to the  cut in personal income taxes. 
 We project that labor productivit y in the business sector will increase about 
1 percent per year over the forecast period—slightly less than our estimate of 
6 In addition to our revision to t he natural rate, we made a small downward adjustment to our 
estimate of the trend growth rate of output per hour for the ec onomy as a whole in 2017.

its structural pace, though a li ttle faster than its average ov er the preceding 
several years.7 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
 Although core PCE inflation in S eptember and October came in a little above our 
expectations, inflation has r emained subdued overall, with total PCE prices increasing 
1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in October and core price s rising 1.4 percent.  We 
continue to expect the transitory factors that have held down inflation this year to largely 
dissipate next year. 
 We project core PCE prices to increase 0.1 percent per month in  November 
and December—held down by the resi dual seasonality that we thin k still 
affects data in these months —and 0.2 percent per month on average in the 
first quarter.  We project the  12-month change in core PCE pric es to fluctuate 
around its current level until March of next year when it will step up to 
1.7 percent, as the unusual declin e in core prices seen this pa st March drops 
out of the calculation.8 
 Since the October Tealbook, gaso line and oil prices have increa sed, boosting 
our near-term projection for PC E energy prices and thus total P CE price 
inflation.  We now expect the 12-month change in total PCE pric es to move 
between 1.5 percent and 1.8 percent in the next several months,  up about 
0.2 percentage point since  our previous projection.   
 Core import prices are expect ed to rise 2 percent at an annual rate in the 
second half of this year.  This pace is a bit faster than earli er in the year but 
slower than we expected in the  October Tealbook, reflecting both weaker-
than-expected incoming data and lower nonfuel commodity prices.  Import 
price inflation is expected to s low to a ¾ percent pace in the medium term, 
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pac e when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly because workers h ired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to 
workers hired during a  slack labor market. 
8 The unusually large decline in w ireless telephone plan prices that occurred in March 2017 held 
down that month’s core PCE reading about 0.1 percentage point.  Other components also contributed to the 
low reading in core PCE inflation in that month.

consistent with still-moderate f oreign inflation, a gradually a ppreciating 
dollar, and slowly declin ing commodity prices. 
 Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved 
little since October on balance .  Median 10-year inflation expectations for 
PCE prices in the fourth-quarter  Survey of Professional Forecas ters were 
stable at 2.0 percent, the median of expectations over the next  5 to 10 years 
from the Michigan survey edge d down to 2.4 percent in November,  and the 
3-year-ahead measure of inflati on expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was unchanged in Oct ober at 
2.8 percent.  Similarly, market-based measures, such as the TIP S-based 
measure of 5-to-10-year forwar d inflation compensation, were re latively 
stable during the intermeeting period.  
Core PCE price inflation is  projected to move up to 1.8 percent  in 2018, mainly 
reflecting the abating of this ye ar’s surprising weakness.  Cor e price inflation then moves 
up further, to 2 percent in 2019 a nd 2020, as continued tighten ing in resource utilization 
and a gradual increase in our judgmental underlying inflation trend more than offset an increasing drag from core import prices.
9  Total PCE price inflation also rises in the 
medium term, from 1.7 percen t this year to 1.9 percent in 2019 and then to 2.0 percent in 
2020.  Relative to the October Teal book, the forecast for core PCE price inflation is up 
0.1 percentage point this year and is unrevised over the medium term.  Total PCE price 
inflation is up 0.2 percentage poi nt this year and essentially unrevised over the 
medium term.  
9 In light of this year’s surprisingly low inflation, in this fo recast we have slightly pushed back the 
upward drift in our estimate of underlying inflation.  (We defi ne underlying inflation to  be the level that we 
estimate inflation would return to in the absence of upward or downward pressure from resource utilization 
or supply shocks, and which we think is ultimately determined by the inflation expectations of wage and 
price setters.) We now assume t hat underlying PCE inflation remains at 1.8 percent in 2018—the same as 
in 2017 and previous y ears—and starts to ed ge up thereafter, re aching 1.9 percent in 2020; in previous 
projections it started to edge up in 2018 and reached 1.9 percent in 2019. This revision resulted in no 
perceptible changes to  our forecast for core  PCE inflation in t he medium term. For 2018, our reaction to 
this year’s low inflation had already been built into the forec ast.  For 2019, the small downward revision to 
trend was offset by other small influences.

The data on labor compensation r eceived since the October Tealb ook have been 
mixed, with some measures showing signs of mild acceleration re lative to a few 
years ago.   
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm pay rolls rose 
2.4 percent over the 12 months e nding in October, well below th e elevated 
reading in September; while we had viewed the September reading  as 
transitory, we were neverthele ss surprised to the downside by t he October 
data.10  We expect the 12-month change  to pick up to 2¾ percent over t he next 
couple of quarters, a pace sim ilar to 2016 and above the roughl y 2 percent 
average seen earlier in the expansion.  
 Compensation per hour in the business sector—an extremely volat ile series— 
is estimated to have risen 1.0 per cent over the four quarters t hrough 2017:Q3, 
below our estimate in the October Tealbook, refle cting sizable downward 
revisions to compensation in the  second and third quarters of t his year.  
Hourly labor compensation growth is projected to step up from a n average 
pace of around 2¼ percent over the past five years to about 3½ percent in each 
of the next three years amid tight labor market conditions. 
 The employment cost index ros e 2.5 percent over the 12 months e nding in 
September, a touch more than we expected, and has shown some ac celeration 
relative to its pace in recent years. 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 
3.4 percent in October, also about the same pace as a year ago but up from 
earlier years. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 In the longer-run projection, the  natural rate of unemployment holds steady at 
its slightly downward revised level of 4.7 percent.  We continu e to assume 
that long-run potential GDP growth will be 1.7 percent. 
10 Average hourly earnings in September rose substantially, which  we think in part reflected a 
temporary shift in employment aw ay from lower-wage workers due to the hurricanes.  This effect was 
unwound in October when these workers returned to payrolls.

 We have maintained our assumption t hat the real equilibrium fed eral funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent.  Wh ile some of the 
tax changes are anticip ated to persist, the baseline projection assumes that 
other budget adjustments will eventually be implemented such th at the federal 
debt is sustainable in the long run.   
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by late 2021.  
 Real GDP growth slows furth er to about 1¼ percent in 2021 and remains 
around that pace through 2023.  The unemployment rate moves up from 
3.5 percent in 2020 to 3.7 percent in  2021 and rises gradually toward its 
assumed natural rate in subsequent years.  
 PCE price inflation moves  up a bit to 2.1 percent in 2021 and h overs slightly 
above the Committee’s long-run objective for several years befo re edging 
back down to 2 percent.  
 With output materially above its po tential level and inflation a bit over the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, t he nominal federal funds rate  is about 
1¾ percentage points above its long-run value of 2.5 percent in 2021.  It 
moves back toward its lo ng-run value thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Foreign GDP  growth stepped down from a strong annual rate of 3 percent in the 
second quarter to an estimated 2¼ percent in the third , main ly reflecting a contraction in 
Mexico induced by its recent hurricane and earthquakes and a slowing in the red -hot pace 
of activity in Canada.  Largely because of an expected rebound in Mexican activity, 
foreign growth is projected to bounce back to 3 percent in the current quarter.  
Subsequently, foreign growth is proje cted to stabilize around its potential pace of just 
below 2¾ percent in 2018 and over the remainder of the forecast period.  Even though 
growth abroad remains at about potential, we see the foreign recovery becoming more 
self-sustained , allowing for the gradual normalization of monetary policy.  On balance, 
this projection is little changed from the October Tealbook. 
Despite a boost from recent increases in crude oil prices, inflation in the advanced 
foreign economies ( AFEs ) is expected to remain muted .  In the euro area and Japan, 
inflation is projected to remain below target over the forecast period, creeping up to 
1¾ percent and just above 1 percent, respectively , by 2020.  In the United Kingdom, as 
the effects of past currency depreciation wear off, inflation is projected to slow from 
2¾ percent in the current quarter to the 2 percent target by the end of the forecast period. In Canada, inflation is expected to rise from 1 .2 percent in the third quarter to just under 
2½ percent in 2018, boosted by higher oil prices and a tight labor market, before declining to target  by 2020. 
With prospects for a sustained pickup in underlying inflation still uncertain, 
especially in the euro area and Japan, we expect that AFE central banks will maintain accommodative policies. Although the Bank of Canada (BOC) and the Bank of England 
(BOE) have begun withdraw ing stimulus, both central banks are expected to proceed 
cautiously with further policy normalization. 
Developments in oil markets, however, could upset our projection of only gradual 
increases in interest rates abroad. For example, an  escalation of geopolitical tensions in 
the Middle East  could lead to a much sharp er increase in oil prices than the moderate rise 
observed to date.  In the context of tight labor markets, such an increase could further 
boost headline and core inflation , possibly prompting a quicker normalization of 
monetary policy in the AFEs  and a tightening of global financial conditions.  We discuss

such a situation in the “Higher Oil Prices and Faster Advanced Foreign Economy 
Tightening” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.   
Global financial conditions could also tighten as a result of spillovers from 
adverse developments in China , a risk that is magnified by how surprisingly quiescent 
global financial markets have been lately .  We explore this possibility  in the “China-
Driven  Emerging Market Economy Turbulence” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Canada. Real GDP growth slowed from 4 .3 percent in the second quarter to 
1.7 percent in the third, as private consumption growth moderated and disruptions in 
the auto industry weighed on exports.  As exports recover, we expect GDP growth to 
rise to 2¼ percent in the current quarter before gradually slowing to its potential pace 
of 1¾ percent by 2019.  Relative to the October Tealbook, this projection is a touch 
stronger in 2018 and 2019 owing to the positive effect of  higher oil prices on 
investment. 
The BOC, which raised its overnight rate target from ½ percent to 1 percent earlier 
in 2017, signaled that it will be cautious about future rate hikes, pointing to elevated 
uncertainty about potential output , the dynamics of wage and price inflation, and the 
sensitivity of highly indebted households to higher interest rates .  Accordingly, we 
now expect the BOC to wait until early 2018 to tighten policy further, one quarter 
later than assumed in the October Tealbook. 
• Euro area. Real GDP grew 2. 5 percent in the third quarter, supported by solid 
domestic and foreign demand.  More -recent indicators , such as PMIs and economic 
sentiment, suggest that activity will expand at a similar pace in the current quarter.  
Growth is projected to slow to 1¾ percent by mid-2018 and remain at that pace, 
slightly above potential growth, through 2020.  Compared with  the October Tealbook, 
this outlook is about ¼ percentage point stronger in the current quarter as a result of 
stronger- than-expected incoming data and a touch weaker in 2018 largely because of 
higher oil prices.  Data through November suggest that core i nflation declined from 1.4 percent in the 
third quarter to ¼ percent in the current quarter , partly reflecting one -off changes in 
service p rices.  Even so, headline inflation should edge up to 1½ percent in the

current quarter as a result of  higher retail energy prices, and we see it reaching 
1¾ percent by 2020 as the output gap closes.  Given the subdued inflation outlook, 
the European Central Bank (ECB) announced on October 26 its intention to continue 
purchasing assets at least through September 2018 , albeit at a reduced pace of 
€30 billion per month starting in January 2018.  W e expect the ECB to wait until 
late 2018 to end its purchases and until mid -2019 to start hiking its policy rates. 
• United Kingdom . Real GDP growth increased from about 1 percent in the first half 
of 2017 to 1.6 percent in the third quarter, largely reflecting a strong pickup in private 
consumption growth.  Based on better- than-expected incoming data—including 
PMIs, consumer confidence, and retail sales through October —we project that growth 
will edge up slightly to 1¾ percent in the current quarter.  Thereafter, growth should 
remain near this pace, supported by accommodative monetary policy.  
We expect inflation to rise to 2¾ percent in the current quarter before gradual ly 
falling back to the BOE’s 2 percent target  over the forecast period as the pass -through 
from earlier sterling depreciation fades.  The BOE raised its policy rate to 0.5 percent 
on November 2 but also signaled a very gradual pace of tightening over the next few 
years , partly because of  concerns about downside risks from Brexit . In line with this 
guidance, we now see the policy rate rising to only 1.25 percent by the end of 2020, 
¼ percentage point less than assumed in the October Tealbook. 
• Japan. Real GDP growth slowed to 1.4 percent in the third quarter, still well above 
our potential growth estimate of ¾ percent.  Based on solid recent data, including 
exports for October and PMIs through November, we expect growth to remain just 
below 1½ percent in the current quarter before slowing to a more sustainable 
1 percent pace in 2018.  In line with recent news, we now assume that proceeds of the 
2019 tax hike—rather than being used exclusively to reduce the deficit —will partly 
fund new  childcare and education programs.  Accordingly, we revised our growth 
forecast  up a touch to ¼ percent in 2019 and to ¾ percent in 2020. 
Inflation turned positive in the third quarter, with both overall and core consumer 
prices rising at a modest 0.4 percent annual rate.  E levat ed resource utilization should 
push up inflation further over the forecast period, though only to about 1 percent , 
given that inflation expectations remain well below the Bank of Japan’s 2 percent 
target .  Against this background, we continue to assume that monetary policy will 
remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• Mexico. After growing a paltry 1.1 percent in the second quarter , real GDP 
contracted 1¼ percent in the third quarter as two major earthquakes and a hurricane 
significantly disrupted economic activity.  This estimate is about 2 ¾ percentage 
points below our October Tealbook projection.  As temporary disruptions from these 
natural disasters  unwind and reconstruction gets under way, growth is projected to 
rebound to 3½ percent in the current quarter.  Thereafter, we expect diminishing 
fiscal drag, past reforms in the energy sector, and monetary easing  to support real 
GDP growth at an average pace of around 2¾ percent over the forecast period .  
However,  uncertainties stemming from the July 2018 presidential election and the 
NAFTA renegotiation process present downside risks to growth. 
Headline inflation eased from 6.9 percent in the second quarter to a still-high 
5.1 percent in the third.  Highlighting risks of another pickup in inflation, the Bank of 
Mexico kept its policy rate unchanged at 7 percent at its November meeting , the last 
meeting before Alejandro Dí az de León succeeds Agust ín Carstens as governor.  As 
inflation falls further to just above 3 percent in 2018, the Bank of Mexico is projected 
to begin reducing its policy rate gradually in mid -2018. 
• Brazil. The recovery from Brazil’s long and deep recession remains very weak. Real 
GDP growth slowed from 2.7 percent  in the second quarter to 0.6 percent in the third; 
a strong r ebound in imports more than offset the boost to GDP from improving 
domestic demand .  We expect growth to pick up to a still-tepid 2 percent pace 
in 2018, supported by substantial monetary policy easing  but held back by political 
uncertainty, household and corporate deleveraging,  and fiscal retrenchment .     
As drag from earlier declines in food prices fades, inflation is projected to rise from 
2¼ percent in the second and third quarter s to 3¾ pe rcent in the fourth.  With 
inflation still below the central bank’s current target of 4½ percent and domestic 
demand recovering very slowly , we expect the central bank to cut its policy rate 
50 basis points to 7 perce nt at its December meeting, bringing the cumulative 
reduction in the policy rate since October 2016 to 7½ percentage points.  
• Venezuela. Amid economic freefall, soaring inflation, and inadequate international 
reserves, Venezuela has  struggled to service its sovereign and state- owned oil 
enterprise bonds.  The current situation is murky; there are reports that some bond

payments have been made with significant delays, but other payments remain 
overdue.  These payment delays beyond grace periods led credit agencies t o 
downgrade some bond ratings to “selective default.” So far, Venezuela’s travails 
have generated little spillover to global markets. 
• China. Recent data have been mixed .  Although indicators have softened in some 
sectors , such as manufacturing and construction, other data, such as PMIs and retail 
sales , suggest that the overall pace of growth is holding up.  All told, we expect real 
GDP to grow 6½ percent in the fourth quarter, little changed from its third -quarter 
pace but down from 7 percent during the first half.  We continue to see growth 
slowing further, reaching  5¾ percent by 2020.  
We see h eadline inflation rising from 2 percent in the third quarter to 3 percent in the 
fourth, primarily because of rising food and energy prices.  As the temporary boost 
from commodity prices fades, inflation is projected to settle around 2½ percent 
in 2018 and stay there over the remainder of the forecast period. 
• Other Emerging Asia. Real GDP growth rose from 4.1 percent in the second quarter 
to 5.1 percent i n the third, mainly driven by stronger exports to China and to the 
United States as well as a pickup in domestic consumption.  With export and PMI 
indicators pointing to a modest slowdown in Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, we 
expect growth in emerging As ia excluding China to slow to 4¼ percent  in the current 
quarter.  Thereafter, growth is projected to gradually decline to about 3½ percent 
by 2020, as Chinese imports slow, the global trade boom moderates, and monetary 
policy becomes less accommodative.

Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, th e nominal Treasury yield curve flattened, as 
short-dated yields increased notably while long-dated yields mo ved up only slightly.  The 
Treasury Department’s quarterl y refunding statement and the Tre asury Borrowing 
Advisory Committee recommendati on that pointed to increased iss uance of short-dated 
securities were reportedly seen a s the main drivers behind the rise in short-dated Treasury 
yields.  FOMC communications an d slightly stronger-than-expected economic data 
releases have reinforced market expectations for a December rat e hike.  As the likelihood 
of the passage of U.S. tax legisla tion increased, broad equity price indexes rose modestly.  
The dollar weakened moderately aga inst a broad basket of curren cies. 
 The market-implied probability of a rate hike at the December F OMC meeting 
rose slightly to a level of near certainty.  A straight read of  market quotes 
implies that a further rate hi ke is fully priced in for the fir st half of 2018, 
while a staff model that adjusts  for term premiums suggests tha t market 
participants may be expecting tw o rate hikes in that period.  
 The 2-year Treasury yield rose  20 basis points over the intermeeting period, 
and the 10-year yield edged up 6 ba sis points.  TIPS-based meas ures of 
inflation compensation we re little changed on net.   
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 3 percent.  The VIX ticked up 
a bit but remained near its hist orically low levels.  Credit sp reads on both 
investment- and speculative-gra de corporate bonds were about fl at on net.  
 The broad dollar depreciated 1¼ percent amid strong data releas es from the 
euro area.  Advanced foreign econo my (AFE) yield curves flatten ed slightly.  
Movements in foreign risky asset prices were mixed.

reinforcing the perceived likeli hood of an increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate at the December mee ting.  Domestic economic data rel eases, on balance, came 
in slightly stronger than anticipated.  In particular, market participants highlighted the 
October CPI release, which was s een as consistent with a modest and sustained 
strengthening in inflation.  
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts su ggests that the 
probability that market participants attach to a rate hike at t he upcoming FOMC meeting 
edged up to around 95 percent.  Beyond the current year, a straight read of OIS-implied 
federal funds rates suggests th at one rate hike is fully priced  in for the first half of 2018, 
while a staff model that adjusts  for term premiums implies two rate hikes in that period.  
Overall, implied rates at the end of 2018 and 2019 moved up som ewhat. 
The nominal Treasury yield curve  flattened over the intermeetin g period, as yields 
on 2-year nominal Treasury securi ties rose 20 basis points and 10-year yields edged up 
6 basis points.  The spread betw een 10- and 2-year Treasury yie lds narrowed to 64 basis 
points, its lowest level sin ce 2007.  Short-dated Treasury yiel ds rose and the yield curve 
flattened following the November  1 release of the Treasury’s qu arterly refunding 
statement and the recommendati on by the Treasury Borrowing Advi sory Committee that 
the Treasury increase the issuan ce of short-dated securities wh ile maintaining recent 
longer-term issuance levels.  We attribute the flattening of th e yield curve over the 
intermeeting period mostly to these releases.  Incoming economi c data, on net, have 
explained only a small portion of t he increase in short-term Treasury yields, and the 
expected path of policy appears t o have risen only a bit.  (For  additional discussion of the 
decline in the slope of the yield curve, see the  box “The Flatt ening of the U.S. Yield 
Curve since December 2015.”)  TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation were little changed, on net, since the November FOMC meeting. 
Option-adjusted spreads on current production-coupon MBS yields over Treasury 
yields stayed roughly the same over the intermeeting period and remained stable since the FOMC’s announced change to reinv estment policy in September.  O verall, market

The Flattening of the U.S. Yield Curve since December 2015 
On balance since the FOMC began its current tightening cycle in December 2015, 
the 2 -year nominal Treasury yield (the red line in figure 1) has risen about 70 basis 
points while the 10 -year yield (the blue line) is little changed , leaving the spread 
between these yields (the green line) at its lowest level since 2007.1 This analysis 
puts this flattening of the Treasury yield curve in to historical perspective, 
discusses factors that appear to explain these movements in yields , and then 
describes the signal that may be taken for real economic activity in the near term . 
Although the recent flattening of the yield curve has attracted significant 
attention by market participants , the current spread between 10- and 2 -year 
yields , seen in figure 2 , is not unusually low by historical s tandards —it stands at 
about the 40 th perce ntile of its distribution since August 1971.  In addition, t he 
extent of the recent narrowing of the spread since December 2015 has been 
smaller than that observed at a comparable stage in three previous tightening 
cycles (figure 3).2 
Separate factors appear to explain the recent movements at the short and long 
ends of the yield curve since liftoff.  The increase in short -term yields has 
1 The spread between the 10 -year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate—an 
alternative measure of the slope of the yield curve that is used in the staff’s baseline economic 
projections —has similarly declined. 
2 The three previous tightening cycles began in 1988, 1994, and 2004. Of course, this 
sample is small and each cycle had different characteristics, which makes a direct comparison 
with the current cycle difficult. For example, the current cycle has been characterized by a 
relatively gradual pace of rate increases. How one dates the start of each cycle also matters 
for comparison purposes. For example, the dashed green line in figure 3 shows the cumulative 
change in the spread since December 2016 , a period that more closely resembles previous 
cycles.

reflected the gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation over this 
period as well as expectations for cont inued removal over the n ear term. At the 
same time, other factors appear to have held down longer- term yields .3 There is 
some evidence that expectations of the longer- run equilibrium real interest rate, 
or r *, may have fallen: A Blue Chip survey- based measure of 5- to-10-year- ahead 
real rate expectations has moved down by about 30 basis points since the end of 
2015 , many model- based estimates of r * have remained persistently low relative 
to pre- crisis levels, and survey expectations of longer-run GDP growth have also 
declined.4 Furthermore, spillovers from unconventional monetary polic ies 
abroad, particularly in the euro area and Japan, also seem likely to have put some 
downward pressure on the term premium component of longer- term T reasury 
yields over this period . Indeed, since December 2015, staff estimates of the 
10-year term premium have declined about 30 basis points. 
More recently this year, market commentaries have pointed to two additional 
factors that may have contributed to the flattening of the yield curve.  First , 
investors appear to have revised down their expectations for expansionary U.S. 
fiscal policy amid slower- than -expected progress with the Administration’s 
legislative agenda; this factor has reportedly led to some unwind ing of the 
steepening of the yield curve seen immediately following the U.S. election late 
last year. Second , the generally weaker- than -expected incoming inflation data 
3 For a more detailed discussion of factors holding down longer -dated yields, see the 
memo to the FOMC titled “Recent Movements in Longer -Term Treasury Yields: Causes and 
Potential Policy I mplications ,” by th e staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, dated J uly 14, 2017 . 
4 The Monetary Policy Strategies section in the October 2017 Tealbook discussed a 
range of recent time- series estimates of r * and showed that they are subject to sizable 
uncertainty. The median respondent to th e November 2017 Survey of Primary Dealer s 
expected “longer run” growth of 1.8 percent, down from 2.1 percent in the December 2015 
survey.

this year may have led some investors to assess a higher risk of continued low 
inflation. TIPS -based measures of 5-to-10-year inflation compensation have 
declined 14 basis points , on net, this year though they remain slight ly higher than 
in December 2015, and both survey -and model -based estimates of long -term 
inflation expectations are generally little changed over these period s. 
A large empirical literature has documented that the slope of the yield curve 
helps predict real economic activity .5 We look at two reg ression models that are 
typical of this literature: One examines the signal from the current spread 
between the 10 -and 2 -year yields for near- term growth of real GDP; the other 
uses that spread to estimate the probability that the economy will enter a 
recession during the coming year. As shown in figure 4 , the results indicate that 
the current slope of the yield curve is historically associated with 2.5 percent real 
GDP growth over the coming year (the red line) and a 15 percent probability that 
the economy will be in an NBER recession a year from now (the blue line) , about 
30 basis point s lower and 10 percentage point s higher, res pectively, than in 
December 2015. 
There may be reasons why the results of these simple models should not be 
interpreted as pointing to a deterioration in near- term growth prospects. 
Estimates of the term premium component of longer-dated yields have declined 
steadily in recent decades, and so the information content of the slope of the 
yield curve on future economic activity may have changed over time.  Such a 
decline implies that , all else being equal, the same economic outlook would be 
associated with a flatter yield curve. (See the box “Why Is the Yield Curve 
Inverted in the Tealbook Projection?” in the D omestic Economic Developments 
and Outlook section of this Tealbook for a discussion of the effect of the declin e 
in the term premium on the staff forecast .) 
In addition, information from surveys and movements in other asset price s do 
not point to a nota ble deterioration in investors’ growth outlook since liftoff .  For 
example, the expected GDP growth over the next four quarters for the median 
respondent to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealer s has only declined modestly 
since December 2015, from 2.6 percent then to 2.2 percent in the most recent 
(October to November) survey. Furthermore, the median probability of a 
recession in six months’ time in the Desk survey has remained unchanged over 
this period at 10 percent . Finally, movements in risky asset prices since December 
2015 , including rising equity prices and narrowing corporate credit spreads (not 
shown ), could suggest that investors have become more, not less, optimistic 
about near- term growth prospects over this period . That said , past recessions 
have proved difficult to foresee, and the staff will continue to closely monitor the 
yield curve and any signals it may contain for future economic growth.

a Predictor of U.S. Recessions, ” Current Issues in Economics and Finance, vol. 2 (June ), pp. 1–6.

reinvestments.1 
Broad stock price indexes move d up about 3 percent, reflecting in part increased 
expectations for the passage  of U.S. tax legislation.  In parti cular, the average stock prices 
of firms that recently had high effective tax rates notably out performed those of firms 
with low effective tax rates.  O ne-month-ahead option-implied v olatility on the S&P 500 
index—the VIX—ticked up a bit but remained near the very low en d of its historical 
range. 
Spreads of yields on triple-B-rate d and speculativ e-grade corpo rate bonds over 
yields on comparable-maturity Tre asury securities were little c hanged, but spreads on 
speculative-grade bonds issued by companies in the telecommunications sector widened 
somewhat.  Corporate bond spreads remained below their historical median levels, 
particularly for speculative-g rade bonds, whose spreads ended t he period at about the 
10th percentile of their his torical distribution.   
Foreign Developments 
Since the previous FOMC meeti ng, foreign financial markets have been generally 
quiet.  The dollar resumed the dow nward trend that has been evi dent over most of 2017, 
and AFE yield curves flattened slightly.  Movements in risky as set prices were limited.  
Over the intermeeting period, th e broad dollar index fell about  1¼ percent on net.  
Despite uncertainty around effort s to establish a coalition gov ernment in Germany, the 
euro rose over 2 percent agains t the dollar, in part because of strong economic data from 
the euro area.  Emerging market currencies also strengthened ag ainst the background of 
still-strong growth prospects.  A dditionally, the Mexican peso partially reversed previous 
declines despite limited progre ss in the fift h round of NAFTA n egotiations. 
Similar to developments in the U nited States, an increase in sh ort-term yields in 
Germany and the United Kingdom resulted in some flattening of t he yield curves in those 
countries over the period.  The Bank of England (BOE) announced  a widely expected 
rate hike of 25 basis points at its meeting on November 2 but indicated that further rate

$6 billion of Treasury securities were redeemed in October and November, and $4 b illion of MBS were

during the November reinvestment period, which runs from mid-No vember to mid-December.

related risks.  The BOE comm unications initially weighed on U.K . yields and the British

On balance, AFE equity price inde xes have declined a touch sinc e the FOMC 
meeting, while emerging market e quity indexes have changed little on net.  Venezuela 
was assigned selective default status by S&P and Fitch following the expiration of the 
30-day grace period for its coupon p ayments due in October.  The International Swaps 
and Derivatives Association als o declared both Venezuela and the state-owned oil giant 
PDVSA in default, potentially t riggering payouts on related cre dit default swaps.  
Venezuelan spreads have widened notably, but spillovers to othe r markets have been 
minimal, as some form of default was widely expected.  Emerging  market sovereign 
spreads were little changed, and net flows to emerging market f unds remained positive.   
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS 
Conditions in short-term unsecured funding markets remained sta ble over the 
intermeeting period.  The effective federal funds rate held ste ady at 1.16 percent 
excluding the month-end and was c losely tracked by the overnight Eurodollar rate.  
Overnight rates on commercial pape r (CP) were als o little chang ed.  Term rates on CP 
and negotiable certificates of de posit increased moderately, consistent with firming 
expectations for a December rate hike. 
In secured funding markets, overnig ht triparty and GCF Treasury  repo volumes 
were little changed, and their rates averaged 1.04 percent and 1.19 percent, respectively, 
which were 2 basis points and 7 basi s points higher than those over the previous 
intermeeting period.2   Meanwhile, Treasury bill supply i ncreased, and short-dated b ill 
rates rose to levels above the ON RRP offering rate.  Combined,  these recent 
developments notably damped take- up of ON RRPs; such take-up averaged $52 billion, 
$84 billion lower than that over th e previous intermeeting peri od.  While money market 
2 The calculation of average rates and volumes over the previous  intermeeting period excludes the 
September quarter-end.  The increases in repo rates will likely  be damped over th e next few weeks, 
reflecting a shift into more short-term lending by market parti cipants ahead of t he December FOMC 
meeting, a decline in net bill i ssuance ahead of the end of the  debt limit susp ension period on December 8, 
and dealer balance sh eet reductions ahead of the year-end.

funds (MMFs) reduced their take- up of ON RRPs markedly, they in creased their holdings 
of short-term Treasury bills and private repos, continuing a tr end seen since August of 
this year.  Total MMF assets under management increased slightly.  
In the near term, the Treasury is expected to reduce net bill i ssuance to prepare for 
the end of the debt limit suspension period on December 8.  After that time, the staff 
estimates that the Treasury can use the cash it has on hand and extraordinary measures to 
operate without breaching the debt ceiling until February or ea rly March of 2018. 
To date, the change in the Federa l Reserve’s reinvestment polic y has not been 
associated with significant changes in banks’ holdings of secur ities or reserve balances, 
reflecting the limited runoff of S OMA securities holdings since  the balance sheet 
normalization program began on October 1.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Financing conditions for businesses and households were little changed over the 
intermeeting period and continued to be broadly supportive of growth in spending 
and investment. 
• Financi ng flows to nonfinancial firms through capital markets remained 
robust.  In contrast, banks’ lending to businesses moderated, as both C&I and 
CRE loan growth declined.  Despite tepid loan growth so far this year, higher 
interest rates charged on business loans have supported bank profitability. 
• Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market r emained 
accommodative for most borrowers, while c redit standards for those with low 
credit scores continued to loosen gradually from tight levels.  
• Consumer credit growth picked up modestly in the third quarter compared 
with previous quarters.  Financing conditions remained large ly 
accommodative, particularly for consumers with strong credit histories . 
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Over the intermeeting period , financing conditions for large nonfinancial 
corporations through capital markets remained accommodative on balance. After a 
typically slow October, gross issuance of corporate bonds strengthened in November, 
driven by investment- grade offerings .  In the i nstitutional leveraged loan market, issuance 
rose sharply in November to a level in line with the first quarter of this year, as borrowers 
took advantage of favorable market conditions to refinance their debt.  Net commercial 
paper issuance by nonfinancial companies rebounded in October after a typical quarter -
end drop and was  slightly negative in November .  Gross equity issuance in October and 
November has been solid , as the volume of initial public offerings ha s exceeded the 
average volume seen in the previous quarter, and seasoned equity issuance was close to 
its average pace of the past few years.  The volume of completed M&A deals picked up 
in the third quarter from its already robust pace in the second quarter. In contrast, share 
repurchases continued to decline in the third quarter, reportedly reflecting high stock 
market valuations and a growing a ppetite for capital expenditures.

Growth of bank -intermediated credit to nonfinancial firms , however, was tepid in 
October and November .  In particular, C&I loan growth declined relative to the third 
quarter , primarily reflecting  a contraction in domestic loans held by foreign banks. 
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinanc ial corporations was little c hanged over 
the intermeeting period and a ppeared to remain solid.  The volume of nonfinancial 
corporate bond r ating upgrades roughly matched that of downgrades in October, but 
upgrades have trailed downgrades notably thus far in November.  In October, th e six-
month t railing bond default rate remained near its lowest level since 2014, while the 
November expected y ear-ahead d efault rate f or all fi rms is projected to stay onl y a bit 
higher t han the midpoi nt of its range s een during nonrecessionary periods even as 
aggregate leverage in t he corporate sector remained elevated.  
The third-quarter corporate earnings season drew to a close over the intermeeting 
period, and the reports for the quarter were generally consistent with the strong 
expectation s of Wall Street analysts.  Despite some notable losses in the insurance sector, 
which were partly due to recent hurricanes and other natural disasters,  earnings per share 
for S&P 500 firms are estimated to have increased  about 5 percent from the second 
quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis.  The outlook for corporate earnings appears to 
have remained  favorable , as the strong year-ahead projections by Wall Street analysts 
have be en revised slightly higher. 
Small Businesses    
Overall, s mall business financing  conditions appeared to have remained favorable 
over the intermeeting period .  Small business lending activity has slowed modestly in 
recent months, and data from the Wells Fargo Small Business Index (WFSBI) survey for 
the fourth quarter suggest t hat this slowdown is due to weak loan demand among small 
business owners.  With respect to credit supply, the fraction of respondents in the WFSBI 
survey who reported difficulty in obtaining credit over the past 12 months reached a new 
post- crisis low  in the fourth quarter, and the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey 
on Bank Lending Practices showed some net easing of standards and narrowing of 
spreads on loans to small businesses over the past three months.  Indicators of loan 
performance remain ed strong, and credit quality concerns are not expected to 
significantly affect the ability of small businesses to obtain credit in  the near term.

Financing conditions for CRE remained accommodative over the intermeeting 
period.  CRE f inancing from capital markets remained more robust than that from banks, 
as CMBS were issued at a somewhat faster pace in the third quarter relative to the same 
period last year.  Spreads on CMBS remained toward the lower end of the range seen 
since the financial crisis.  Delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools continued to 
decline in October, largely reflecting the shrinking share of loans that were originated 
before the financial crisis , which have much higher- than-average delinquency rates .  
That said , the growth  of CRE loans held by banks continued to decline in October 
and November.  This slowdown has been concentrated at the largest banks , especially  in 
the multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loan categories ; CRE loan growth at smaller 
banks has remained strong overall and even accelerated a bit in October. In addition, 
new CRE mortgages funded by insurance companies remained soft in the third quarter 
following a drop in the second quarter, consistent with anecdotal rep orts that insurance 
companies are pulling back a bit from lending to this sector . 
Banking Conditions 
Despite the slowd own in core loan growth, net interest margins at banks, a 
measure of lending profitability, ticked up in the third quarter.  So far this year, m uch of 
the boost to net interest margins has come from increased loan income from higher 
interest rates , especially on business loans with floating interest rates .  While the cost of 
funding at banks has also increased this year, especially for nondeposit sources of bank 
financing, the additional income generated by loans and other assets has served to offset 
banks’ higher funding c osts.    
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Financing conditions in municipal bond markets remained a ccommodative  over 
the intermeeting period , on balance, and Puerto Rico’s ongoing f inancial distress 
continued to have little effect on the broader municipal bond market.  Gross issuance of 
municipal bonds was strong in October and the first few weeks of November .  The credit 
quality of general obligation (GO) bonds remained stable, with the number of ratings 
upgrades slightly outpacing that of rating  downgrades.  Yields on GO bonds moved 
roughly in line with comparable- maturity Treasury securities.

HOUS EHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Residential Real Estate 
In the residential mortgage market , financing conditions remained 
accommodative for most borrowers.  Loan growth in the banking sector remained at a 
pace above that seen in the first half of the year, although it declined in October and 
November relative to the third quarter .  More broadly, mortgage originations for home 
purchases rose in October, presumably as the drag on housing demand from the rise in 
mortgage rates toward the end of last year waned further.  The rate on 30 -year 
conforming mortgages offered to well-qualified borrowers continued to hover around 
4 percent, which is quite low by historical standards.  Credit standards are still tight for 
borrowers with low credit scores and hard- to-docum ent incomes but have been loosening 
gradually for borrowers with low credit scores.  
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely 
accommodative overall .  Consumer credit has been readily available at relatively 
attracti ve terms to borrowers with strong credit histories, but conditions for b orrowers 
with subprime credit scores remained tight in credit card market s and continued to tighten 
for auto loans.  Indeed, credit bureau data indicate that new loan extensions to subprime borrowers fell over the past several quarters for auto loans and flattened this year for 
credit cards.  Consistent with these developments, average credit scores for new and used auto loans stayed higher than a year ago , and credit card limits for borrowers with 
subprime credit scores remained at historically low levels .  
Total c onsumer credit, driven mostly by robust credit expansion in September, 
expanded at a slightly faster pace in the third quarter compared to previous quarters.  It is 
possible that th is recent increase in consumer credit growth reflected sizable hurricane-
related borrowing by households in the affected areas, although preliminary staff analysis 
has found only weak evidence to support this view.  ABS issuance funding consume r 
loans was robust in recent months and a bit ahead of last year’s pace, and ABS spreads 
were about unchanged over the intermeeting period .

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
As in the October Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of 
economic activity as being in lin e with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark 
used by the FOMC.  Many empirical i ndicators that are frequentl y interpreted as 
reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued.  For ex ample, corporate bond 
spreads and the VIX continue t o be near the low end of their hi storical ranges.  At the 
same time, considerable uncertain ty exists about the future dir ection of a number of 
federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook. 
We continue to judge the risks  around our projec tions for both real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as bein g balanced.  Consistent with that view, estimates of the 
distribution of risks around those forecasts conditional on ava ilable indicators, shown in 
the exhibit “Time-Varying Macro economic Risk,” are not particul arly skewed.  
Moreover, as presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Ri sk Estimate,” the risk of 
returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three years is 
estimated from stochastic simulations in the FRB/US model to be  about 14 percent.1 
With regard to inflation, we stil l see the current level of unc ertainty around our 
projection as in line with the  average over the past 20 years a nd the risks to the downside 
and upside as roughly balanced.  This assessment is consistent with the estimates of the 
time-varying risks for the inf lation forecast, as shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying 
Macroeconomic Risk.”  To the downside, this year’s string of soft readings on inflation 
could prove to be more persiste nt than we have assumed.  Also, inflation expectations 
relevant for wage and price sett ing could be lower currently than in the baseline or may 
not edge up in the coming years as  the staff assumes.  To the u pside, with the economy 
projected to be moving further  above its longer-run potential, inflation may increase more 
than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize 
nonlinear effects of resou rce utilization on inflation. 
1 If the ELB risk were computed around a lower path for the fede ral funds rate, then the 
probability naturally would be higher.  For example, the probab ility is 22 percent if calculated using the 
median federal funds rates from the FOMC’s September Survey of Economic Projections.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct al ternatives to the 
baseline projection using simula tions of staff models.  In the first scenario, we study a 
downside risk for inflation in w hich households and businesses have lower inflation 
expectations than in the baseli ne because they perceive that mo netary policy will be too 
tight to return inflation to the  FOMC’s 2 percent objective ove r the medium term.  In 
contrast, the second scenario examines the upside risk that the  response of wages and 
prices to the further tightening of labor market conditions wil l be stronger than we have 
assumed and that inflation expect ations will be more responsive  to a rise in actual 
inflation.  In the third scenari o, we present the implications of a substantia l correction in 
asset valuations.  The fourth scen ario illustrates the effects of a lower natural rate of 
unemployment that is initiall y misperceived by the central bank .  The fifth scenario 
envisions that a pickup in globa l inflation driven by higher oi l prices prompts faster 
monetary policy normalization i n the advanced foreign economies  (AFEs), thereby 
tightening financial conditions in the global economy.  The las t scenario considers the 
possibility that a slowdown in Chi na’s economy triggers financial turbulence in emerging 
market economies (EMEs), with sig nificant spillovers to the glo bal economy. 
We simulate these scenarios using four staff models.2  In all of the scenarios, the 
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in th e baseline.  In addition, the 
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follo w the baseline paths in 
all of the scenarios. 
Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model] 
Headline PCE price inflation has been below the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
for most of the past five year s.  It has averaged about 1¼ perc ent during this period and 
has remained subdued more recentl y even though resource utiliza tion now exceeds our 
estimate of its sustainable lev el.  In the baseline projection,  inflation is assumed to drift 
up to the 2 percent target by 2020, in part reflecting further tightening in resource 
utilization and a gradual rise i n inflation expectations.  However, especially in light of the 
persistently low inf lation of the past several years, there is a risk that the public will 
perceive the stance of monet ary policy as being too tight now a nd in the future to achieve 
2 The four models used are an estimated medium-scale New Keynesi an DSGE model of the U.S. 
economy based on Del Negro, Giannoni, and Schorfheide (2015); F RB/US, which is a large-scale 
macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy; a calibrated DSGE m odel with search and matching 
frictions in the labor market; and SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

the 2 percen t target; for that reason, longer-run inflation exp ectations in this scenario are 
assumed to be ¼ percentage point l ower than in the baseline. 
Lower inflation expectations cau se actual inflation to be lower  than in the baseline 
and to reach only 1¾ percent in 2022.  Consequently, the federal funds rate increases less 
than in the baseline, but real i nterest rates as perceived by the private sector are initially 
slightly higher.  As a result, r eal GDP growth is a touch lower  in 2018 than in the 
baseline.  The unemployment rate  runs about ¼ percentage point above the baseline in 
2018 and remains above the baseline through 2022.3 
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US] 
Alternatively, the further tight ening of resource utilization in the baseline could 
cause inflation to rise much faste r than projected.  Some resea rch suggests that the 
relationship between labor uti lization and wage growth may beco me stronger—the 
Phillips curve may steepen—when the labor market is very tight.4  In FRB/US, faster 
wage growth implies higher price inflation as well.  This scenario captures the risk of that 
nonlinearity by boosting the respon se of wages to tightening la bor utilization and by 
assuming that longer-run inflation expectations become more sen sitive to the higher 
realized price inflation that st ems from faster wage growth.5 
Inflation reaches 3 percent  by mid-2021, compared with about 2 percent in the 
baseline.  In response to the higher path of inflation, the fed eral funds rate rises more and 
peaks at 5 percent in 2022; real longer-term interest rates are also slightly higher.  As a 
3 The Phillips curve in this mode l is very flat, so it may seem surprising that inflation falls 
noticeably despite only a modest i ncrease in the unemployment r ate.  That outcome arises because price 
setters in the model are very forward looking, and production c osts fall little but persistently. 
4 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth a nd slack, see, for example, 
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet?   Assessing Progress toward Full 
Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vo l. 9 (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas, October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documen ts/research/eclett/2014/el1413. pdf; and Jeremy 
Nalewaik (2016), “Non-Linear P hillips Curves with Inflation Regime-Switching,” Finance and Economics 
Discussion Series 2016-078 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August), 
http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.078 . 
5 In the calibration of this scena rio, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four tim es larger than in the 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the incr ease reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that cover s the late 1980s to the late 1990s. 
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this s cenario are well belo w those representing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

result, real GDP growth is a bit slower, and the unemployment r ate is about ¼ percentage 
point above the baseline by the end of 2022. 
Market Correction [FRB/US] 
Broad equity market price indexe s have increased significantly in recent years, 
and standard equity valuation meas ures, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, are high by 
historical standards.  Moreover, interest rate spreads on both investment-grade and high-
yield bonds currently are near the ir lowest levels since the fi nancial crisis.  While some of 
the decline in bond spreads reflect s improvements in the credit  quality of these 
borrowers, estimates of bond ris k premiums suggest that bondhol ders are now more 
willing to take on risk.  Also, the  Treasury term premium is currently unusually low.  
In this scenario, we assume that both equity and bond risk prem iums move fairly 
quickly toward historically nor mal levels.  By the end of next year, equity prices have 
fallen about 20 percent; the term premium on Treasury securitie s has risen halfway to its 
assumed long-run value; and the t riple-B corporate bond spread has increased about 
30 basis points above the baseli ne, enough to move it back clos e to its median historical 
value.  That correcti on in asset values is assumed to also caus e an erosion in consumer 
and business sentiment.  
Real GDP growth slows to a bout 1¾ percent in 2018, roughly ¾ percentage point 
less than in the baseline.  The  unemployment rate remains aroun d 4 percent through 
2022.  With labor utilization le ss tight and inflation slightly lower, the federal funds rate 
rises more gradually and is  3¾ percent at the end of 2022, abou t ¼ percentage point 
below the baseline. 
Unlike the decrease in house prices before the Great Recession, the asset price 
declines in this scenario have relatively mild consequences.  T his outcome reflects in part 
our assumption in this scenario that the losses resulting from these market corrections do 
not induce significant disrupti ons to the broad functioning of the financial system. 
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [Search and Mat ching 
DSGE Model] 
In the baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to 3.5 pe rcent by the end of 
2019, with the natural rate of une mployment assumed to hold ste ady at 4.7 percent 
through the projection period.  However, the natural rate could  be driven lower by a 
variety of influences, such as demo graphic factors or improveme nts in job-matching

efficiency.  This scenario assum es that the natural rate of une mployment declines 
1 percentage point over the next f ew years, and we assume that the source of a lower 
natural rate is a decline in w orker bargaining power, which ero des wage inflation and, 
hence, price inflation relative to the baseline.  In addition, we assume that learning by the 
central bank about the lower natu ral rate occurs only gradually  and, thus, that a 
considerable gap between the actual and perceived natural rates  persists through the end 
of 2022.6 
Economic activity is somewhat str onger than in the baseline as firms create more 
jobs and expand production in respon se to lower wages.  As a re sult, the unemployment 
rate falls to 3¼ percent by the end of  2019.  However, because the unemployment rate 
does not decline as much relative to the baseline as the true n atural rate does, resource 
utilization is less tight, and inflation re mains persistently b elow the baseline through 
2022.  Despite the lower path for i nflation in this scenario, t he federal funds rate is only 
slightly lower than in the baseline because of the misperceptio n of the degree of tightness 
in the labor market. 
Higher Oil Prices and Faster Adva nced Foreign Eco nomy Tightenin g 
[SIGMA] 
Although we project that oil prices will decline gradually from  recent highs, 
political tensions in the Middl e East could lead to oil supply disruptions that boost global 
oil prices substantially a nd put upward pressure  on headline in flation.7  Our expectation is 
that most foreign central ba nks would look through an oil-driven rise in headline inflation 
and, hence, not adjust their po licy stance materially.  However , this scenario considers 
the plausible risk that a sharp and persistent rise in oil pric es against the backdrop of 
fairly tight AFE labor markets could prompt noticeably faster m onetary policy 
6 Central bank learning  about the true natur al rate of unemploym ent is assumed to solve a signal 
extraction problem.  Importantly, the amount of uncertainty is informed by the ve ry wide confidence 
interval around estimates of the natural rate of unemployment in Douglas O. Staiger, James H. Stock, and 
Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Preci se Are Estimates of the Natura l Rate of Unemployment?” in Cristina 
D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and Strategy  (Chicago:  University of 
Chicago Press), pp. 195–246.  Th us, learning is slow and the ce ntral bank revises its estimate of the natural 
rate by only about ¼ percentage point by the beginning of 2020.
7 The Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook box in this Tea lbook “The Limited 
Effectiveness of Sha le Oil in Moderating Oil Price Fluctuations” argues that while an oil-supply disruption 
abroad would induce some expansion of oil production in the Uni ted States, this production response would 
provide only limited offset to the upward pressure on oil price s.

world.    
Specifically, oil prices incr ease $20 per barrel above the base line by early next 
year and remain persistently e levated through the forecast hori zon.  Headline inflation in 
the AFEs rises ½ percentage point relative to the baseline in the first half of 2018, 
inducing their central banks to i ncrease policy rates more aggressively than what is 
prescribed by the baseline polic y rule.  The fas ter policy norm alization trigge rs increases 
in AFE corporate borrowing spr eads and sovereign bond term prem iums.  Tighter 
financial conditions in the AFEs spill over to the rest of the world, and the broad real 
dollar depreciates 3 percent.   
Lower foreign demand, higher oil  prices, and tighter financial conditions weigh 
on economic activity in the Unite d States, notwithstanding the stimulus to net exports 
from the depreciation of the dolla r.  U.S. GDP growth moderates  to 2 percent in 2018, 
about ½ percentage point less than  in the baseline.  Given high er oil prices and the boost 
to import prices from the dolla r’s depreciation, core PCE infla tion runs above 2 percent 
starting in the second half of 2018.  Unlike foreign central banks, the Federal Reserve 
reacts according to the baseline inertial Taylor rule; with cor e inflation higher but 
resource utilization somewhat lo wer, the federal funds rate is little changed r elative to the 
baseline.  
China-Driven Emerging Marke t Economy Turbulence [SIGMA] 
In our baseline forecast, we exp ect Chinese real GDP growth to gradually 
moderate from about 6½ percent in  the second half of this year to a still-solid 5¾ percent 
pace by the end of 2020.  However, given China’s underlying vulnerabilities—including high corporate debt and a large  and opaque shadow banking syste m—adverse shocks 
could trigger a quicker and more pronounced slowdown of Chinese  GDP growth and 
renewed pressures on the renmi nbi, with negative spillovers to other EMEs.  In this 
scenario, we assume that GDP gr owth in China and other EMEs falls to only 3 percent 
and 1 percent, respectively, in 2018, as corporate borrowing sp reads increase 150 basis 
points and confidence declines.  The stresse s in EMEs also trig ger a sizable rise in 
borrowing spreads in the United S tates and in the AFEs, while f light-to-safety flows 
cause the broad real dollar to appreciate 10 percent and depres s term premiums on U.S.

governm ent bonds by 30 basis points.8  Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, 
EME central banks are assumed to tighten monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure 
on inflation arising from the de preciation of their currencies. 
The appreciation of the dollar , weaker foreign activity, and ad verse financial 
spillovers cause U.S. GDP growth to moderate to about 1½ percen t in 2018 and the 
unemployment rate to rise to 4½ percent in 2021.  Weaker econom ic activity and lower 
import prices reduce core PCE  price inflation to about 1¼ perce nt in 2018.  The federal 
funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, reach ing only 3½ percent by the 
end of 2022. 
8 The calibration of the tightening of financial conditions in this scenario takes some important 
cues from developments starting in the summer of 2015 through e arly 2016, when concerns about a 
slowdown in China intensified.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies 
In this section, we consider a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection. In the box “ Substitutability of Policy Instruments ,” 
we summarize an approach for estimating the policy tightening associated with the 
balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule (also 
known as the “balanced approach” rule) , a first -difference rule, and a nominal income 
(NI) targeting rule.  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  The top 
and middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, whi ch 
is constructed using a n inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not 
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding 
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.  The prescriptions are a little  higher than 
the previous Tealbook, reflecting a small upward revision to inflation . 
• The prescriptions of the first- difference rule are essentially the same in the 
near term as the Tealbook baseline.  The prescripti ons are also essentially the 
same in the near term as the prescriptions of the first-difference rule in the 
October Tealbook, reflecting a virtually unchanged path for the output gap. 
• Under the NI targeting rule, the federal funds rate responds to the current 
output gap and the shortfall of the level of the GDP price deflator from the 
path it would have attained had it increased at an annual rate of 2 percent 
since 2011: Q4; the current shortfall in the GDP price deflator is about 
4 percent.   Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call 
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules in the appendix to this section.  Except for the 
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that 
are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

Substitutability of Policy Instruments 
In October 2017 the Committee initiated its balance sheet normalization program , which 
gradually raises caps on redemptions of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings.  In this 
discussion , we use the FRB/US model and the staff’s balance sheet model to express the 
monetary tightening associated with the normalization program in terms of an alternative 
path of the federal funds rate that is consistent with nearly identical outcomes for inflation 
and unemployment .1 Our main finding is that the balance sheet normalization program, in 
combination with the path for the federal funds rate assumed in the staff forecast, is likely to 
have about the same macroeconomic effects as a hypothetical alternative policy combination 
of continuing full reinvestment while raising the federal funds rate about 50 basis points more, 
over the next five years, than assumed in the staff forecast. 
To evaluate the substitutability of the two policy instruments , we compare the path of the 
federal funds rate under two scenarios .  In the Tealbook baseline, policymakers gradually 
reduc e the size and duration of the System Open Market Account ( SOMA ) portfolio acco rding 
to the normalization program announced by the Committee.  In the alternative s cenario, we 
assume that the Committee opted to continue reinvesting maturing securities until the date 
when demand for currency and reserves necessitates expanding the balance sheet from its 
current size. The path of the federal funds rate in the alterna tive scenario is con structed so as 
to keep the paths of inflation and the unemployment rate near ly identical to their paths in the 
Tealbook baseline.2 By compar ing the path for the federal funds rate in the alternative 
scenario with the corresponding path in the Tealbook baseline, we obtain an approximation of 
the tightening in monetary policy implied by balance sheet normalization expressed in terms 
of a revision in the path of the funds rate relative to the Tealbook baseline path .3 
The left panel of the figure shows the estimated 10-year Treasury term premium effects (TPEs ) 
for both scenarios.4 In the Tealbook baseline, the 10 -year Treasury TPE is estimated to be 
negative 90 basis points at the time of the initiation of the program in October.  In the 
alternative scenario, the larger size and longer duration of the balance sheet results in a 
contemporaneous 10-year TPE of negative 12 5 points .  The difference between the two term 
1 We abstract from any costs or benefits of holding a larger balance sheet over the longer -term and 
focus solely on the term premium effects (TPEs) of changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. 
Unmodeled costs of a large balance sheet include the possibility that, in the event of a negative economic 
shock, a purchase program may be less likely to be adopted and could have smaller marginal TPEs. 
2 To construct this alternative scenario, we compute the optimal control path for the federal funds 
rate under a loss function that places equal weight on the unemployment gap and on deviations of inflation 
from 2 percent for both the baseline and alternative TPEs. We then add the difference in the federal funds 
rate paths to the Tealbook baseline policy r ate path. This procedure keeps macroeconomic outcomes 
essentially unchanged. 
3 The alternative simulation begins in 2017:Q4, so that the deviation in policy r ates from the Tealbook 
baseline quantifies the funds rate equivalent of the entire normalization program. The simulations embed the 
assumptions that financial market participants as well as price and wage setters have perfect foresight. 
4 The Tealbook baseline balance sheet, income, and TPE projections are reported in the Balance 
Sheet Projections section of Tealbook B. The Tealbook baseline and alternative TPEs are constructed using an 
implementation of the term structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) under the Tealbook baseline and 
alternative assumptions for the evolution of the balance sheet that would occur under continued 
reinvestment. See Canlin Li and Min Wei (2013), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the 
Federal Reserve’s Large- Scale Asset Purchase Programs,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 9 
(March), pp. 3–39.

premium path s widens to about 55 basis points as the alternative SOMA portfolio maintains it s 
current size for a number of years and includes a larger amount of longer- term Treasury 
securities and agency mortgage -backed securities than in the baseline.  Both TPE paths narrow 
over time because of the aging of the SOMA portfolio and as balance sheets move closer to 
their normalized sizes in proportion to nominal GDP .5

path that , by construction, generate s nearly identical macroeconomic outcomes . Because the 
normalization in the size of the balance sheet under the Tealbook baseline gradually tightens 
financial conditions , the alternative path of the policy rate rises steadily above the baseline 
policy path so as to generate an equivalent gradual tightening in financial conditions.  The 
offsetting federal funds rate path is, on average, about 40 basis points above the baseline over 
the horizon shown , compared with an average difference of 50 basis points for the 1 0-year 
TPEs.  
Our results depend on several assumptions , three of which are particularly notewort hy.  First, 
the staff’s models postulate that balance sheet policies operate through term premium 
effects, estimates of which are subject to considerable uncertainty, and that those effects are 
transmitted to the real economy entirely via aggregate demand channels .6 Second, the 
effects of both balance sheet policy and federal funds rate policy —and therefore our policy -
equivalence estimates —crucially depend on the modeling of the public’s expectations. Third, 
the monetary accommodation associated with a particular reinvestment strategy could differ 
under a different composition of the SOMA portfolio or a different economic projection .7 
5 Beyond the projection period, the TPEs converge to zero as the balance sheet ultimately expands in 
line with growth in Federal Reserve notes and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
6 If balance sheet policy also had implications for the economy’s aggregate supply —for instance via 
unmodeled effects on financial market fluctuations —then policymakers might face a tradeoff between 
stabilizing prices and reaching full employment. Such considerations would, in turn, imply a different degree 
of substitutabili ty between balance sheet policy and policy for the federal funds rate. 
7 These results are valid in the neighborhood of the Tealbook baseline, in which the federal funds 
rate is projected to remain well away from the effective lower bound and mortgage rates are not projected to 
fall precipitously. The difference between the two reinvestment strategies would become more pronounced 
during an economic contraction because the rapid decline in the federal funds rate associated with such a 
scenario would induce prepayments of mortgages. As a result, the difference between the required federal 
funds rate paths across the alternative policies would increase.

A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS 
RATE 
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two alternative baselines: the 
Tealbook ba seline and a projection consistent with the medians in the September 2017 
Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).2 Both estimates use the FRB/US model to 
conduct the simulations. This concept, labeled  “FRB/US r* ,” corresponds to the level of 
the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (starting in the 
current quarter) , would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period. 
• At 2. 21 percent, t he estimate of Tealbook -consi stent FRB/US r* is close to the 
corresponding value in the October Tealbook, reflecting a largely unrevised 
output gap in the medium term.3 
• At 0.83 percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*. The di fference stems from the fact that the 
SEP-consistent projection has output running above potential by a 
considerably smaller amount in the coming years than in the Tealbook 
forecast despite the lower median path for the real federal funds rate in the 
SEP.  The average projected real federal funds rate under the SEP- consistent 
baseline, at 0.34 percent, is 0.5 percentage point lower than the SEP-
consistent FRB/US r*. 
• For each projection—the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-consistent 
baseline—FRB/US r* is highe r than the corresponding 12- quarter average 
projected real federal funds rate.  The higher FRB/US r* reflect s factors other 
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the September 2017 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way. The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relations hip to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value. 
3 For comparability, the previous Tealbook value of FRB/US r* is adjusted to be consistent with a 
minor revision in the model’s fiscal rules.

SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS 
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and 
the NI targeting rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output 
gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified 
policy rules.4 The simulations are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers 
commit to following the prescriptions of each rule in the future and that financial market 
participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow 
through on this commitment, but also understand the interest rate and macroeconomic 
implications of policymakers doing so.5 The policy rate paths prescribed by each rule are 
nearly the same in the medium term as  those obtained conditional on the October 
Tealbook projection. 
• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, the f ederal funds rate increases, on 
average, a little less than 1 percentage point per year through 2020.  The 
federal funds rate peaks a little below  4¼ percent in 2021 before slowly 
moving down toward its longer- run level , which the staff assumes will be 
2½ percent. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate to values that exceed the corresponding Tealbook baseline 
values by an average of about 1 percentage point over the next three years .  
This relativ ely sharp initial increase in the federal funds rate is followed by a 
slightly lower path for the federal funds rate beyond 2021 compared with the 
Tealbook baseline.  In the next few years, the unemployment rate is no more 
4 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths, the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit. 
5 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly 
understands the implications of the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC. In contrast to 
this modeling assumption, the adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a 
period during which the public learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications.  We abstract 
here from considerations of this kind.

current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the 
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the September 2017 median SEP 
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *. The previous−Tealbook r* is adjusted to be consistent with a

than ¼ percentage point higher under the Taylor (1999) rule than under the 
Tealbook baseline and runs below the baseline starting in mid -2022.  Inflation 
under the Taylor (1999) rule runs a bit above its baseline path over the horizon 
shown.  The reason the sharp increase in the federal funds rate under the 
Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy is 
that agents in the model are forward looking and correctly anticipate that the 
federal funds rate beyond the medium term will be lower than under the 
Tealbook ba seline; the result is a path for the 10 -year real Treasury yield that 
runs below that in the baseline over the majority of the next decade.  
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate.  However, it prescrib es lower federal funds rates than does 
the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown, because the Taylor (1993) rule 
responds less strongly to the projected excess  in output over its assumed 
potential level.  As with the Taylor (1999) rule, the initial sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate under the Taylor (1993) rule is not associated with an 
appreciably weaker economy because agents in the model are forward looking 
and anticipate the lower federal funds  rate path beyond the medium term.  
Indeed, beginning in 2020, the Taylor (1993) rule prescribes a path of the 
federal funds rate that runs below the Tealbook baseline for some time.  As a result, there is a large and persistent decrease in the 10 -year real Treasury 
yield relative to the baseline. Accordingly,  inflation under the Taylor (1993) 
rule exceeds inflation under the Tealbook baseline by more than under the 
Taylor (1999) rule.  The unemployment rate is closer  to the Tealbook baseline 
path in the near term and is lower than the path implied by both the baseline 
and the Taylor (1999) rule over the remainder of the period shown.  
• The path for the federal funds rates prescribed by the first -difference rule is 
similar to the path in the Tealbook baseline over the next two years but runs below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter divergence 
occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the expected 
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the projected 
narrowing of the output gap beyond the next three years .  The associated 
lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction with expectations of higher 
inflation in the future, implies lower longer- term real interest rates  than in the 
Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of resource utilization and

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to

inflation.  Thus, the first- difference rule generates outcomes for the 
unemployment rate that are lower than, and inflation outcomes that exceed, 
the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection. 
• The NI targeting rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate than the other rules because this rule seeks to compensate 
for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as measured by the rate of increase in 
the implicit price deflator for GDP ) from an annual rate of 2 percent since the 
end of 2011.  Because we assume that policymakers can credibly commit to 
closing this gap and that economic agents correctly anticipate the long period 
of low federal funds rates, the path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate is lower 
than under the other policy rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years .  
Accordingly, the path for the unemployment rate is substantially lower than in 
all other simulations shown except the first -difference rule, dropping to just 
above 3 percent in 2020. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT 
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.6 
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.7 The feder al funds rate paths 
prescribed  by optimal control over the simulation period are similar to those obtained 
when conditioned on the October Tealbook projection.   
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
6 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications.  The appendix in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations. 
7 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, policymakers achieve improved 
economic outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be 
optimal from the perspective of those future policymakers (that is , the promises are time inconsistent). 
Furthermore, it is assumed that these promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by 
financial market participants. However, under the alternative assumption of optimal policy under 
discretion, whic h does not rely on the credibility of policymakers’ promises, the results are similar for all 
specifications of the loss function except for that with an asymmetric weight on the unemployment gap.

discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective, 
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the 
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline policy rate p ath.
8  This higher path arises 
because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years —an outcome 
that policymakers with the equal weights cost function judge to be costly.  The 
tighter policy results in a path for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate an d a path for headline PCE 
inflation that is somewhat lower than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with the limited response of inflation to the level 
of resource utilization in the FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate but that is identical 
to the specification  with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above 
the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights  and below the Tealbook baseline path unti l the later part of the 
coming decade.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this 
initially more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to 
raise inflation to 2  percent is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting t he 
natural rate of unemployment.  Because the public believes that policymakers will follow through on this policy rate p ath even as the unemployment rate 
substantially undershoots its natural rate, the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2 percent mo re quickly than in the case of equal weights.  Starting 
in the middle of the next decade (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a 
little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the 
8 When we use the SEP -consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal funds rate 
under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at just below 4 percent in 2020:Q3 
compared with 6½ percent at the beginning of 2021 under the Tealbook baseline.

inflationary pressures stemming from the p rolonged period of elevated 
resource utilization.9 
• The third simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five 
times larger than the specification with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical to that specification.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses 
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming 
years.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an 
unappealing tradeoff  because inflation responds only weakly to resource 
utilization. Hence, to raise inflation in the near term by even a small amount, 
policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershoot of the natural 
rate of unemployment —an outcome that this specification of the loss function 
regards as costly . 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the 
resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate soars to near 9½ percent  in 
2018 and then settles near 6  percent over much of the remainder of the period 
shown.  This sharp  tightening of policy reflects  an effort to prevent the 
undershoot of the natural rate of unemployment projected by the staff .  The 
paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 10 -year Treasury yield are 
also notably higher for a couple of years than in the case of equal weights.  
Because the short -run Phillips curve is quite flat in the FRB/US model and 
agents in the model take the 2 percent inflation objective to be credible, this 
policy leaves the trajec tory for inflation close to that in the equal- weights case 
over the period shown, even though, in the period through 2020, this policy 
9 The simultaneous overshoot of the longer -run inflation objective and the undershoot of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term under “Asymmetric weight on ugap” preferences is 
time inconsistent in the sense that, if given the opportunity to re -optimize the path of the federal funds r ate 
without regard to past policy commitments, policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter 
monetary policy.  Under the alternative assumption of optimal control under discretion, which rules out 
time-inconsistent outcomes, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the 
Tealbook baseline and optimal control under commitment for this loss function.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies. 
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives. And, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial kno wledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular 
model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  It also reports the expression for the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline pro jection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t; for quarters prior to 
the projection pe riod under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  T he right -hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter

core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the 
output gap estimate for the current period (𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead 
annual change in the output ga p (∆4𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡). The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation 
objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent. 
The nominal income  targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal income, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the log of the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value , denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛 𝑡𝑡 ∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP. Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage p oints per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the 
sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortf all of the GDP deflator from the level 
it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1 
Simple Rules 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have  been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2 
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.3 The prescriptions of the first -difference rule

where ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑠𝑠 denotes the annualized quarterly rate of growth of the GDP deflator for quarter s.

3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate.  Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis. Taylor (1993) rule 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿) + 0.5𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡

do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run real interest rate; see Orphanides 
(2003). 
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of ch anges in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the l ines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy R ules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines : 
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using  the FRB/US m odel, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection .4 This measure  depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables. The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use smal l-scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*. For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time. 
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts 
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations an d are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarte r, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the differ ence between four-quarter headline PCE

(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and  squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following e quation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽 0.9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty t o the unemployment rate falling be low the natural rate. 
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specifi cation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5  The table “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights. 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not a ffect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits. Loss Functions

   2. Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.   3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.   4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum       of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
       household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
       to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
