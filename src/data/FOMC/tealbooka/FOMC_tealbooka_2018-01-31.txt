 Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Although labor market informati on has come in very close to what we had 
anticipated in the December Tealbook, spending and production a ppear to be on stronger 
near-term trajectories than w e had expected.  In addition, our outlook for the economy 
over the medium term is markedly stronger, as the projected rev enue reductions in the 
recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) are much larger o ver the next three years 
than we had assumed in the previous Tealbook.   
We now estimate that real GDP i ncreased at an annual rate of 3¼  percent in the 
second half of last year and forecast that it will rise at a 3 percent pace in the first half of 
this year.  Although the unemploym ent rate remained at 4.1 perc ent in November and 
December, average monthly job gains have been solid and faster than what we judge 
would be consistent with unchanged labor utilization.  We proje ct the unemployment rate 
to move down gradually to 3.8 percent by the middle of this yea r as the economy 
continues to expand briskly, supported in part by the initial effects of the tax cuts.   
Over the next few years, real GDP  growth is projected to slow s teadily from 
nearly 3 percent this year to 2 pe rcent in 2020 as monetary pol icy tightens further.  The 
tax changes are assumed to genera te a small expansion in the productive capacity of the 
economy, but GDP growth is proj ected to nonetheless outpace tha t of potential over the 
next two years.  As a result, t he output gap widens to 3¼ perce nt by late 2019 and 
remains at that level in 2020, ending the medium term about 1¼ percentage points larger 
than in the December Tealbook forecast.  The unemployment rate is projected to bottom 
out at 3¼ percent in mid-2019 and remain at that level in 2020, about 1½ percentage 
points below our estimate  of its natural rate. 
Inflation readings since the  previous Tealbook have come in abo ut as expected on 
balance.  Over the 12 months ending in December, we estimate th at total PCE prices rose 
1.7 percent and core PCE prices  rose 1.5 percent, both the same  as in the December 
Tealbook forecast.  We continue t o think that last year’s soft core inflation readings 
primarily reflect idiosyncratic  factors that will not persist.  As that transitory weakness 
passes and as resource utilization tightens more substantially than in our previous forecast, core PCE price inflation is projected to move a littl e above 2 percent by 2019, 
and total PCE price inflation is forecast to reach 2 percent in  2020.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth  in 2017 is a touch above the project ions 
from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus  
and somewhat  above both of them in 2018 .  The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is 
similar to the SPF and Blue Chip forecasts in 2017 and about ½ percentage point below  
them  in 2018.   The s taff’s projection for CPI inflation is above the Blue Chip and SPF 
forecasts in both  2017  and 2018 .  Th e staff’s projections for overall PCE price inflation  
and for core PCE inflation  are a little higher than the SPF forecast s in both  2017 
and 2018.   
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input fro m 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

  KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 We have updated our fiscal policy assumptions to incorporate th e TCJA, 
which was enacted after the December Tealbook projection was fi nalized.  We 
assume that this legislation will reduce average annual tax rev enue by 
approximately 1¼ percent of GDP from 2018 through 2020.  In tur n, those tax 
reductions are projected to raise the level of real GDP 1¼ percent by the end 
of 2020.  (For further analysis, see the box “Macroeconomic Eff ects of the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.”) 
o We continue to assume that in fiv e years, with an elevated and rising debt-
to-GDP ratio, fiscal policymaker s will begin to enact deficit-r eduction 
measures that gradually bring annual deficits back to sustainable levels.  
 We estimate that discretionar y policy actions across all levels  of government 
boosted aggregate demand less th an ¼ percentage point in 2017.  Looking 
ahead, we project that discreti onary government policy actions will increase 
GDP growth about ½ percentage po int per year from 2018 through 2020—
exclusive of any multiplier effect and offsets from reactions i n interest rates 
and the dollar—approximately ¼ per centage point more per year t han in the 
December Tealbook, reflecting the larger-than-anticipated mediu m-term tax 
reductions in the TCJA. 
 The federal government faces two key fiscal-related deadlines r equiring near-
term actions.  The first is the  need to enact appropriations to  fund government 
operations by midnight tonight ( January 19), when the current c ontinuing 
resolution expires, to avoid a shutdown.1  The second deadline is the lifting of 
the statutory federal debt limit , as we estimate that the Treasury Department 
will exhaust available “extraordinary measures” and cash in ear ly March.  
(For further discussion of issu es associated with the debt limit, see the box 
“Projections for Federal Debt Subject to Limit” in the Financia l Market 
                                                 
1 A lapse of appropriations that resulted in a short-term shutdo wn of the federal government would 
likely have only minor implications for the outlook.  For examp le, we estimate that the 16-day shutdown in 
October 2013 reduced real GDP growth ¼ percentage point in the fourth quarter of that  year and boosted it 
by an equal amount in the following quarter.  That estimate embodies our judgment that there were no 
material effects on private inves tment or consumption due to re duced confidence or inc reased uncertainty.

 Macroeconomic Effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  (TCJA) was signed into law after the December Tealbook 
projection closed.  The act is expected to reduce federal tax collections by roughly 
1¼ percent of GDP , on average, over the next three years.1  On the individual income 
side of the tax code, the legislation cuts marginal tax rates and broadens the tax base 
by ending or reducing deductions such as those f or state and local taxes.  In addition, it 
reduces the effective  tax rate on income from certain pass -through businesses.  The 
legislation also makes significant changes to the corporate income tax code:  The top 
marginal tax rate is cut from 35 percent to 21 percent, and the tax base is broadened.  
Furthermore, full expensing of equipment and intangibles  (E&I)  investment is provided 
for the next several years , and the deductibility of net interest payments  is restricted 
somewhat.  Finally, the tax system is shifted from a worldwide tax base toward a territorial system.  
We estimate that the key provisions of the legislation will provide an immediate boost  
to aggregate demand and will also lead to an increase in the productive capacity of the 
economy over time.  Line 2 of  the table on the next page  shows that the direct 
aggregate demand effects of the legislation, which exclude general equilibrium effects —that is , follow -on multiplier effects and financial offsets such as the rise in 
interest rates implied by the intercept -adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) rule—are 
expected to raise the level of real GDP about 1  percent by the end of 2020.   
These direct  aggre gate demand effects operate through multiple channels that affect 
personal consumption expenditure s (PCE) and business fixed investment (BFI).  PCE is 
expected to increase for two reasons.  First, individual income tax cuts generate higher disposable perso nal income for individuals and pass -through businesses.  Second, 
higher after- tax profits from the corporate tax cuts boost  equity prices .
2  The resulting 
increase in household wealth raises consumption.  BFI is expected to increase as a 
result of  reductions in business income taxes.  I n particular, cuts in marginal corporate 
tax rates and, more importantly, full expensing of E&I investment reduce  the user cost 
of capital.3  Moreover, there is a further increase in investment demand due to greater 
business cash flow.  Overall, nearly three- fourths  of the anticipated boost  to aggregate 
demand is due to an increase in PCE, with the remainder attributable to BFI.   
The TCJA is expected to raise potential output by the end of 2020 via two channels.  
First, lower marginal tax rates on labor income increase the supply of labor.  Second, 
                                                 
1 Under the assumption that the tax legislation has no effect on GDP (that is, a static estimate), 
the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that over a 10 -year budget window, the TCJA will reduce 
federal revenues by a bit more than ½ percent of GDP annually on average.  But the tax cuts are much 
greater during the first 5 years of the 10 -year budget window.  Thereafter, many of the provisions of 
the TCJA phase out.   
2 The staff assumes that this  effect  has already been incorporated into equity prices.  
3 With full expensing, marginal tax rates have only a limited effect on the user cost of capital.  
However, nonresidential  structures are not eligible for full expensing under the TCJA; thus, the 
marginal tax rate cuts will significantly reduce the user cost of capital for these investments.

 the additional investment induced by the tax legislation results in capital deepening 
and, therefore, higher stru ctural productivity and potential output.  Over this period, 
we estimate that the level of potential output will increase by 0. 35 percent because of  
the tax legislation ( line 3), mostly as a result of increased labor supply.  The boost  to 
potential output further increases demand as households begin to realize higher labor income; for that reason, the potential output effects on GDP are additive to the direct 
aggregate demand effects in l ine 2 . 
After the initial increase in  aggregate demand, follow -on multiplier effects will further 
augment growth ( line 4).  However, some of the aggregate demand effects will be 
offset by higher interest rates and a stronger dollar as the widening of the output gap leads to a tightening of monetary policy ( line 5).  We estima te that, on net,  the TCJA will 
boost  the level of real GDP 1¼ percent by the end of 2020 ( line 1).  But, owing to the 
increase in potential, the output gap is projected to widen a bit less than 1  percent 
(line 8 ).  Given the increase in the output gap, we also project that the unemployment 
rate will be 0.5 percentage point lower at the end of 2020, while core PCE price inflation 
will be about 0.1  percentage point higher.  
These effects are significantly larger than the ones we built into the December Tealboo k 
(line 7).  And they are sligh tly larger than the effects in the December 7 , 2017 , memo  to 
the FOMC , “Staff’s Revised Fiscal Policy Assumptions” (l ine 6), as the size of the 
medium -term tax cuts in the TCJA turned out to be a little larger than we had assumed 
in that memo.    
Our estimates  of the act’s effects draw on analys es by other government agencies as 
well as a careful reading of the relevant academic literature.  Nonetheless, many judgment calls are required.  Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding 
the effects of this complex legislation.

  Developments section.)  We assume these deadlines will be navigated such 
that there are no significant disruptions to government operati ons or financial 
markets.   
Monetary Policy 
 The intercept-adjusted inertia l version of the Taylor (1999) rule calls for the 
federal funds rate to rise 1.5 pe rcentage points this year, wit h further increases 
averaging around 1.1 percentage poin ts in each of the next two years, bringing 
the rate up to 4.8 percent in t he fourth quarter of 2020.  The federal funds rate 
is assumed to be 80 basis points high er at the end of the mediu m term than it 
was in the December Tealbook, primar ily reflecting the larger p ositive 
output gap. 
 The SOMA portfolio continues a  gradual and predictable decline as securities 
are redeemed consistent wit h the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum  to the 
Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and with the process initiated in 
October 2017. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise significantly o ver the medium 
term, from an average of 2.7 percen t in the current quarter to 4.3 percent by 
the end of 2020, 0.7 percentage poin t higher than in our December projection.  
The upward revision to the path f or the 10-year Treasury yield reflects the 
new path for the federal funds rate and a small  upward revision  to the term 
premium, the latter of which is a consequence of a larger proje cted stock of 
federal debt. 
 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate  and the triple-B corporate bond  rate are also 
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term.  The paths  for these two 
rates were revised up mostly in lin e with revisio ns to the path  of the 10-year 
Treasury yield.   
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 The projected path of stock prices is about 5 percent higher th an in the 
December Tealbook, reflecting recent increases in broad equity price indexes.  
As in previous projections, we assess that valuation pressures will limit the

  scope for future stock price in creases, and we expect equity pr ices to rise after 
the current quarter around 0.4 per cent per year, about the same pace as in the 
December Tealbook.  
 Incoming data on house prices have been slightly above our expe ctations.  We 
estimate that house prices incre ased at an average rate of 6 pe rcent last year 
and expect that the rate of increase will slow to about 4 perce nt over the next 
three years.  Despite the bris k pace of house price increases, the ratio of house 
prices to rents is forecast to remain only somewhat above its e stimated long-
run trend. 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
 We estimate that real GDP in foreign economies grew at an annua l rate of 
about 3 percent in the fourth qua rter of last year, rebounding from a 
temporarily weak 2½ percent pace in the third quarter.  We see economic 
growth abroad continuing at around 3 percent in 2018 before edg ing down to 
2¾ percent thereafter.  This forecast is supported by buoyant f inancial 
markets, still-accommodative m onetary policies, and positive sp illovers from 
strong U.S. economic growth in the  coming years.  Relative to t he December 
Tealbook, our outlook for foreign e conomic growth is about ¼ pe rcentage 
point higher in 2018, with a sligh tly smaller revision over the remainder of the 
forecast period. 
 The broad nominal dollar has depr eciated about 2 ½ percent since the time of 
the December Tealbook amid positive foreign economic data and a  slight 
firming of expectations for mone tary policy normalization abroa d.  We expect 
the broad real dolla r to appreciate at a bout a 2 percent annual rate over the 
medium term, a little faster than in the previous Tealbook, as market 
expectations for the federal funds rate are assumed to move up toward the 
upwardly revised staff forecast.  The higher projected rate of appreciation 
offsets only some of the recent realized depreciation, leaving the level of the 
broad real dollar at the end of 2020 about 1¼ percent lower.  
Oil Prices and Other Commodity Prices 
 Since the December Tealbook foreca st, the spot price of oil and prices for 
many industrial metals reached their highest levels in three ye ars, supported

  by both the strengthening global economic outlook and dollar de preciation.  
Brent crude oil prices closed most recently around $69 per barr el, $6 per 
barrel higher than at the time of the December Tealbook; those prices had also 
been boosted by concerns about politi cal tensions with Iran.  T he price of the 
Brent December 2020 futures con tract increased around $3 per ba rrel, to about 
$60 per barrel.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
We estimate that real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the fourth 
quarter of last year, about 1¼ pe rcentage points faster than in  our previous projection.2  
The upward revision reflects  positive incoming data on consumer  expenditures, business 
spending, and residential invest ment, which more than offset data suggesting that net 
exports were a sizable drag on GDP last quarter.  We took only limited signal from the 
fourth-quarter growth surprises going forward.  As a result, fi rst-half real GDP growth 
has been revised up only s lightly, to 3 percent. 
 Our near-term outlook for consum er spending is noticeably stron ger than in 
the December Tealbook.  We now estimate that real PCE rose 3¾ p ercent in 
the fourth quarter, an upward revision of 1¼ percentage points.   Much of the 
revision reflects unusually strong retail sales in November and  a solid increase 
in December, along with a jump in December vehicle sales that a ppears 
largely to have been fueled by incentives.3  Given solid fundamentals, we 
expect consumer spending to incr ease 2¾ percent in the first ha lf of this year, 
boosted a bit by the initial effect s of the personal tax cuts.   
 Recent data suggest that business investment in equipment and i ntangibles 
(E&I) rose nearly 11 percent at a n annual rate in the fourth qu arter, continuing 
a string of sizable increases  throughout 2017.  Some of the recent strength is 
the result of a presumably trans itory surge in purchases of tra nsportation 
equipment, as well as both continued payback from an unusually weak 2016 
                                                 
2 The BEA’s advance estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter is sc heduled to be published on 
January 26, the Friday before the FOMC meeting.  We continue to  estimate that the effects of the fall 
hurricanes subtracted ½ percentag e point from real GDP growth i n the third quarter and boosted it 
¾ percentage point in the fourth. 
3 We had expected vehicle sales to decline in December, consiste nt with anecdotal reports that 
suggested the impetus to sales f rom replacing hurricane-damaged  vehicles was mostly completed in 
November.

  and upbeat business sentiment and profit expectations.  Although the 
indicators of future spending remain favorable, we expect E&I g rowth to 
moderate to a 6 percent pace in the first half of this year.   
 In contrast, investment in nonres idential structures decreased in the second 
half of last year, as continued declines in investment in nondrilling structures more than offset the recovery in drilling activity.  We expect spending to turn 
up in the coming quarters, dr iven primarily by a rebound of non drilling 
structures.   
 Nearly all of the data on housing activity received since the D ecember 
Tealbook were considerably stronger than we expected.  As a res ult, we now 
estimate that residential investment jumped at an annual rate o f 11¼ percent 
in the fourth quarter of last year after declining in the previ ous two 
quarters.  We have taken on boar d the higher level of housing a ctivity in the 
forecast but expect just modest increases in the first half of this year as the 
impetus from population growth, dem ographic changes, and the he althy labor 
market is tempered by higher intere st rates and the constrained  supply of labor 
and of developed lots availa ble for new construction.
4  
 Net exports are currently estimat ed to have subtracted more than ½ percentage 
point from real GDP growth in the  fourth quarter—whereas we had expected 
trade to be a neutral factor in the December Tealbook—as import  growth has 
rebounded following two very weak qua rters.  In the first half of 2018, net 
exports are expected to shift t oward being neutral for GDP grow th, as recent 
dollar depreciation supports exports and restrains imports.  
 Manufacturing output jumped 7 percen t in the fourth quarter of last year.  
Nearly half of the increase refl ects the recovery from the fall  hurricanes and a 
bounceback in motor vehicle assemb lies after a th ird-quarter decline, but other 
segments of manufacturing production also expanded at a fairly brisk pace.  
Indicators of near-term manufact uring activity, such as the new  orders indexes 
in the various surveys of purch asing managers, are generally up beat, and 
automakers’ assembly schedules  call for light vehicle productio n to rise 
                                                 
4 Relevant demographic changes include the aging of the populati on (which is notable in part 
because of high homeown ership rates among seniors) and a leveli ng out of the historically high share of 
young adults living with their parents.

  further in the coming months.  Consequently, we expect manufact uring 
production to increase at a solid pace of 3½ percent in the fir st half of 
this year. 
We project real GDP to rise nearly 3 percent in 2018 and to dec elerate steadily to 
2 percent by 2020 as monetary polic y tightens.  The projected path of GDP growth is 
¼ to ½ percentage point higher per year than in the December Te albook, primarily 
reflecting the larger-than-antic ipated tax cuts.  The level of GDP at the end of 2020 in 
this projection is more than 1½ perc ent above the previous projection, but this higher 
level does not show through com pletely to the output gap, as we  have also revised our 
aggregate supply assumptions in this forecast.   
 We expect the lower marginal ta x rates on labor income and the corporate tax 
cuts to boost the level of potential output in 2020 by 0.35 per cent, about 
¼ percentage point more than we assumed in the December Tealboo k.5   
 All told, potential GDP growth is projected to move up from abo ut 1½ percent 
in 2017 to just under 2 percent by t he end of the medium term. 
 With the growth of real GDP substantially outpacing that of potential GDP 
throughout much of the projection, resource utilization tighten s significantly 
further.  At the end of 2020, real GDP is projected to exceed i ts potential level 
by 3¼ percent, 1¼ percentage points more than in the December p rojection. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The two labor reports issued since the December Tealbook indica te that labor 
market conditions continued to s trengthen through the end of th e year.6  We expect 
further labor market tightening over the medium term, and to a greater extent than in the 
December Tealbook projection. 
                                                 
5 A higher level of business investment spending in this project ion that is unrelated to the tax cuts 
also led us to raise slightly our estimate of capital deepening  and structural productivity, which increases 
the level of potential output an additional 0.1 percent by the end of 2020.

   After increasing 252,000 in November, payroll employment rose 1 48,000 in 
December.7  Over the final four months of 2017—a period of averaging that  
smooths through hurricane-related effects—monthly employment ga ins 
averaged 162,000, in line with our December Tealbook forecast.  We expect 
payrolls to increase about  185,000 per month in the first half of this year, a 
touch above the December projection and well above the range of  80,000 to 
120,000 per month that we judge to be consistent with unchanged  labor 
market slack.   
 The unemployment rate held steady in November and December at 
4.1 percent; it decreased 0.6 percen tage point over the course of 2017.8  We 
expect the unemployment rate t o edge down over the next few mon ths and to 
average 3.8 percent during the second quarter, the same as in t he December 
Tealbook.  
 The labor force participation rat e (LFPR) also held steady in N ovember and 
December at 62.7 percent.  Despite fluctuating over the course of 2017, the 
LFPR ended the year at the same level as in December 2016; comp ared with 
its declining trend, th is sideways movement represents a contin ued tightening 
along this margin.   
Over the medium term, we expect t he labor market to tighten sig nificantly further. 
 We have marked up the expected pa ce of payroll increases a fair  bit with the 
stronger projected path for output.  After having risen about 1 70,000 per 
month in 2017, total payroll employ ment gains are expected to p ick up to an 
average monthly pace of about 195,000 this year, which is 15,00 0 higher than 
in the December Tealbook, and then to slow gradually, reaching 150,000 
in 2020, in line with the deceleration in real GDP.   
 Similarly, we have marked down the unemployment rate over the p rojection 
period.  The jobless rate declin es to 3.4 percent by the end of  this year (and 
                                                 
7 For 2017 as a whole, monthly payroll gains averaged 171,000, d own about 15,000 from 2016.  
The modest decline reflects a d eceleration in government payrol ls.  Private payroll ga ins averaged 168,000, 
just 2,000 fewer than in 2016.   
8 The decline over the past year w as widespread across racial an d ethnic groups, and the 
unemployment rate for  African Americans in  December, at 6.8 per cent, was the lowest rate in the history of 
the series (back to 1972).

  thus posts about the same annual d ecrease as last year) before moving down to 
3.2 percent in mid-2019 and remaining at that level in 2020, 0. 3 percentage 
point below the previous Tealbook and the lowest jobless rate s ince 
October 1953.  At the end of the m edium term, the unemployment rate is 
1.5 percentage points below the natural rate.  
 Strong job gains and rising real wag es continue to draw individ uals into the 
labor force while also slowing outfl ows, and we expect the LFPR  to remain 
flat at its current level of 62.7 percent over the medium term, ending 2020 
0.5 percentage point above our estimate of its trend and 0.3 percentage point 
above our projection in the December Tealbook.  
 Over the medium term, the labor m arket continues to strengthen along many 
dimensions, including the unemplo yment rate, the LFPR, and the workweek.  
However, given how strained we thin k labor resources are likely  to be in a 
couple of years, we elected to have  a larger-than-usual amount of this 
improvement manifest in the LFPR and the workweek and less in t he 
unemployment rate.9  We have not, however, assum ed that labor resources 
will be sufficiently strained t o importantly impinge on the ove rall GDP 
outlook. 
                                                 
9 Specifically, had we maintained  our usual Okun’s law relations hip throughout the medium term, 
revisions to the output gap sin ce the December Tealbook would h ave led us to lower the unemployment 
rate to 3.0 percent in 2020.  Deviating from our Okun’s law rel ationship in an especially tight economy is 
consistent with research showing that, in the very strong economies of the late 1960s and 1990s, additional 
output growth tended to reduce the unemployment rate by less.  See Brent Meyer and Murat Tasci (2012),

  THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
On balance, the incoming information regarding core consumer pr ices has been 
about as we anticipated, with cor e PCE prices a little lower th an expected in November 
and the core CPI in December somewhat higher.10   
 We continue to estimate that c ore PCE prices increased 1.5 percent over the 
12 months ending in December and t hat total PCE prices rose 1.7  percent, 
with each measure up about ¼ percen tage point from its low last summer.  We 
continue to think that the soft c ore inflation readings seen la st year reflect 
idiosyncratic factors that will no t persist, and we expect inflation to move 
higher this year. 
 We expect the 12-month change in c ore PCE prices to fluctuate a round its 
current level until March 2018, when it moves up to 1.7 percent , as the 
unusually low reading in that mont h last year drops out of the calculation; we 
then expect the 12-month change  to edge up to 1.9 percent by mi dyear.   
 Gasoline prices ended the year a  little lower tha n projected in  the December 
Tealbook, but oil prices have increased, which boosts the proje ction for PCE 
energy prices, and thus total PCE pr ice inflation, in the comin g months.  We 
now expect the 12-month change in total PCE prices to rise from  1.7 percent 
in December to 2.2 percent in June and to then ease back a bit later in 
the year, in line with core inflation.  
 Core import prices rose at an estimated 1½ percent pace over th e second half 
of 2017, less than would have been e xpected given last year’s m ovements in 
the dollar and commodity prices; we expect core import price in flation to pick 
up to a 2¾ percent pace in the first half of 2018, supported by  recent dollar 
depreciation and higher commodit y prices.  Thereafter, import p rice inflation 
slows to a ¾ percent pace, consistent with still-moderate foreign inflation, a 
gradually appreciating dollar , and slowly declining commodity prices. 
                                                 
10 The core CPI in December rose a r elatively large 0.3 percent, but our translation of the CPI and 
low readings on the relevant PPI data point to a 0.1 percent in crease in core PCE prices last month, only a 
couple of basis points  higher than our Decem ber Tealbook projec tion.

   Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved 
little since the time of the December Tealbook and, on balance,  relative to a 
year or so earlier.  Median 10-year inflation expectations for PCE prices in the 
fourth-quarter Survey of Professi onal Forecasters were stable at 2.0 percent 
and have been essentially unchanged for the past several years.   The median 
of expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey ticked 
up to 2.5 percent in early January ; this measure trended down f rom 2014 into 
2016 but has been relatively stable since then.  The 3-year-ahe ad measure of 
inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, whic h also trended down into 2016 before moving up 
a bit, rose 0.1 percentage point  in December to 2.9 percent, a value toward the 
higher end of its range of the  past year or so.  Finally, the T IPS-based measure 
of 5-to-10-year-forward infla tion compensation increased 0.1 pe rcentage point 
to about 2 percent over the inte rmeeting period, but it remains  little changed, 
on net, since late 2016.  
Core PCE price inflation is projected to move up from 1.5 perce nt in 2017 to 
1.9 percent in 2018, with the incr ease reflecting the abating of last year’s surprising 
weakness and the tightening ec onomy.  We expect core inflation to move up to 
2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020 as resource  utilization tightens s ubstantially further.
  Total 
PCE price inflation also rises ove r the medium term, from 1.9 p ercent this year and next 
to 2.0 percent in 2020.  The medium-term forecast for core PCE price inflation is revised up 0.1 percentage point in each year in light of the stronger o utlook for resource 
utilization in this projection.  
The limited new information regarding labor compensation has be en a bit weaker 
than we expected.   
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm pay rolls rose 
2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in December, a pace simil ar to that in 
2016 and a bit less than we antic ipated.  The 12-month change i n this measure 
is forecast to remain around 2½ percent over the next few month s, above its 
average of roughly 2 percent ea rlier in the expansion.  
 We estimate that compensation p er hour (CPH) in the business sector rose 
2½ percent over the four quarters of 2017.  We currently projec t CPH growth

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

  to move up to almost 4 percent  by 2019—¼ percentage point above  the 
December Tealbook projection—reflecting the tighter labor marke t. 
 The employment cost index (ECI) rose 2.5 percent over the 12 mo nths ending 
in September and has shown some acceleration relative to its pa ce of recent 
years.11  The ECI, which is less cyclica lly sensitive than CPH, is proj ected to 
increase 2½ percent this year and to pick up to 2¾ percent in 2 019 and 2020, a 
bit higher than in our pr evious projection.   
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 
3.2 percent in November, toward the  low end of the range it has  traversed 
during the past couple of year s but up from earlier years. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment wil l be 
4.7 percent and that potential  output growth will be 1.7 percen t in the longer 
run.  However, we have adjusted up potential output growth from  2021 
through 2023 to be consistent with t he effects of the TCJA in t he medium 
term.   
 We have maintained our assumption t hat the real equilibrium fed eral funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent.  Wh ile some of the 
tax changes are anticip ated to persist, the baseline projection assumes that 
other budget adjustments will eventually be implemented such th at the federal 
debt stabilizes in the long run, although at a higher level.  T o reflect that 
higher level of feder al debt, we have revised up the assumed te rm premium on 
10-year Treasury yields in the longer run by 25 basis points. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by mid-2021.  
                                                 
11 The ECI for the period ending i n December is scheduled to be published on January 31, the

   Real GDP growth slows furth er to about 1½ percent in 2021 and 1  percent in 
2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral l evel.  The 
unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3.2 percent in 2020 toward its

 International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The outlook for foreign growth remains  upbeat and is notably stronger than we 
anticipated  in the December Tealbook, reflecting solid incoming data and expectations of 
positive spillovers from the recently passed U.S. tax  package.  W e estimate that real 
foreign GDP growth rose to 3 percent at an annual rate last quarter  after dipping in t he 
third quarter, held down by natural disasters  in Mexico.  W e project that growth will 
remain near 3  percent in 2018 before moderating to 2¾ percent  in 2019 and 2020, 
supported by buoyant financial markets, accommodative monetary policies, and a strong 
U.S. economy.  Relative to the December Tealboo k, our foreign growth outlook is about 
¼ percentage point higher over the next few quarters and a bit less thereafter,  reflecting 
stronger- than-expected data and the upward revision to the U.S. outlook. 
In the advanced foreign economies ( AFEs ), despite the firm economic expansion, 
underlying inflation  in some countries shows little sign of a sustained pickup.  Strong 
global demand has boosted the price of oil and other commodities, helping raise 
aggregate AFE headline inflation to an annual rate above 2 percent in the fourth quarter, 
but core inflation moved lower in the euro area and appears to have remained near zero  in 
Japan.  Consequently, we still expect the Bank of Japan to leave its short- term rates 
unchanged over the forecast period.  Recent communication s from  the European Central 
Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Canada (BOC) highlighted the strength of their economies, 
and we marked  up the projected path of monetary policy in these economies a touch .  We 
now project ECB  liftoff  in the first quarter of 2019, one quarter earlier than assumed in 
the December Tealbook, and we have penciled in an additional 25 basis point hike by the 
BOC  in 2019.   
In the emerging market economies , headline inflation has also been boosted by 
rising  oil prices .  Mexico’s inflation is down since the beginning of last year but remains 
well above its 3 percent  target , raising concerns about underlying inflationary pressures .  
Consequently, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) raised its policy rate another 25 basis  point s in 
December .   
The upbeat for eign growth forecast is not without risks.  In addition to perpetual 
concerns about a Chinese hard landing, with market valuations  at high levels in many 
economies , financial market s could suffer a  correct ion.  We explore this risk  in the

 “Global Market Correction” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
But there is also upside potential to our outlook, as the strong momentum of the global 
economy suggests that foreign growth could again positively surprise us.  In this case,  
AFE central banks might normalize monetary policy more aggressively than our baseline 
rules would call for, and we explore the p otential ramifications of this situation in the 
“Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Poli cy” alternative scenario .    
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Canada.  We estimate that GDP growth edged up to 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  
Although this pace is slightly below our December forecast—partly reflecting  
disruptions in the auto and oil industries—indicators from late in the quarter , such as 
the December labor force s urvey, were buoyant.  Boosted by domestic momentum 
and strong foreign demand, growth is expected to step up to 2¼ percent in 2018 
before slowing to just below 2 percent in 2020.  Relative to the December Tealbook, this projection is nearly ¼ percentage point higher over the next three years, largely  
because of stronger projected U.S. demand.  
The BOC raised its policy rate 25 basis points to 1.25 percent at its January meeting, as we expected, alluding to rising inflation and diminishing labor market slack .  
Given the brighter growth outlook, we have added an additional rate hike of 25 basis 
points in 2019, taking our projection of the policy rate to 3 percent by mid -2020. 
• Euro area.  Economic indicators—including PMIs , confidence surveys, and 
industrial production—continue to point to surprising strength.  We estimate that the 
euro-area economy expanded at a 2½ percent pace in the fourth quarter.  We expect 
GDP growth to proceed at a similar  pace this quarter before decelerat ing gradually to 
1¾ percent in 2019, around our estimate of potential.  Compared with December, this 
path is up ½ percentage point and nearly ¼ percentage point in 2018 and 2019, 
respectively, as a res ult of the stronger domestic momentum and external demand. 
Despite robust growth and tightening labor markets, core inflation remained weak and dropped to 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter at an annual rate, in part because of idiosyncratic  factors such as a one-off decline in education fees .  In contrast, headline 
inflation jumped from 1  percent to 1.7 percent as a result  of higher retail energy 
prices .  Headline inflation is projected to fall back this  year before gradually climbing

 again to 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, still below the ECB’s  target of 
2 percent.  
• United Kingdom .  Solid  economic indicators, including PMIs, consumer confidence, 
and industrial production, suggest that real GDP growth edged up slightly to 
1¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.  We project that growth will stay close to 
this pace over the first half of 2018, decelerate modestly to about 1½ percent by the 
first quarter of 2019, and then stay at about that rate thereafter .  Brexit will officia lly 
take effect in March 2019 , followed by a transition period that is still being 
negotiated.  We estimate Brexit should hold down potential growth about 
0.3 percentage point in coming years.  
Inflation is expected to inch down from 3 percent in the fourth quarter to 2¾ percent 
in the current quarter and to continue falling gradually —as the boost from higher oil 
prices and pass -through from earlier sterling depreciation fades —until reaching the 
Bank of England’s (BOE ) 2 percent target in the second half of 2020.  In line with its 
announced forward guidance, the BOE is expected to raise its policy rate only 
gradually over the next few years , reach ing a mere 1¼ percent by the end of 2020. 
• Japan.  Even though we still see real GDP as having decelerated in t he fourth quarter, 
the upbeat tone of recent data, including private consumption data through November, led us to substantially boost our fourth- quarter growth estimate  to 
2 percent, well above our potential growth estimate of ¾ percent.  Given this strong er 
domestic momentum and the higher forecast for global growth, we also revised up 
our outlook for the Japanese economy a bit thereafter .  Even so, we see growth 
moderating further to a more sustainable 1 percent pace in 2018 and, following the 
implementation of a long -planned consumption tax hike, temporarily falling to only 
¼ percent in 2019. 
We estimate that total inflation increased sharply to 2¼ percent at an annual rate in 
the fourth qua rter from just 0.4 percent in the third, reflecting a surge in retail energy 
prices.  Core inflation remained disappointingly weak at less than ½ percent.  With 
extremely tight labor markets still failing to revive underlying inflation, we slightly lowered  the forecast for 2018 and 2019 and have inflation rising to only 1 percent by 
the end of the forecast period.  We continue to assume that monetary policy will 
remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period.

 EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China.   Real GDP growth edged up to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, slightly  above 
our December Tealbook forecast.  Growth was boosted by relatively strong exports, 
which helped offset the drag from domestic credit tightening and curbs on production in heavily  polluting  industries.  We expect domestic demand growth to continue to 
trend downward as Chinese authorities move cautiously to address risks in the financial sector and property market and to curtail local government spending.  Slower domestic demand growth  should be partly offset by strong external demand.  
As such, we see growth slowing only slightly this year to a bit above the authorities’ 
reported 6½ percent growth target before edging down to 6 percent by 2020.  This  
path is about ¼ percentage point above that  in the December Tealbook  as a result of 
incoming data and further projected strengthening of external demand. 
We estimate that inflation rose to 3½ percent in the fourth quarter from very subdued 
levels earlier in 2017, as both food and energy inf lation increased.  We see inflation 
moving back down to its longer -term trend of 2½ percent by the middle of this year.    
• Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that real GDP growth moderated  to 4½ percent 
in the fourth quarter from 5.1 percent in the third qua rter but is still above our 
estimate of trend growth.  Although export growth stepped down after surging in the 
third quarter, strong PMI readings—including new export orders—suggest  that 
manufacturing activity in emerging Asia retains plenty of momentum.   This 
momentum, together with the stronger projected demand from the advanced 
economies, led us to revise up growth ¼ percent age point this year  and a touch over 
the remainder of the forecast period.  We now see growth at 4 percent this year before slowing to a trendlike 3¾ percent pace by 2020.   
• Mexico.   We estimate that real GDP growth rebounded to 2¾ percent last  quarter  
following a contraction related to the hurricane and earthquake in September .  This 
rebound is smaller than we had projected  in December ; while manufacturing exports 
have picked up and oil production has resumed , construction activity  in the wake of 
the earthquake has remained  weak .  However, we see relatively strong 3 ¼ percent 
growth  in the first half of this  year, about ½ percentage point higher than our 
December Tealbook projection , reflecting the upward revisions to the forecast for 
U.S. manufacturing production.  Thereafter, growth should moderate a bit as tighter 
Mexican monetary policy partially offset s the effect s of stronger  external demand.

 Uncertainty about the future of NAFTA and the Mexican presidential election in July 
add significant downside risk to th is outlook. 
 
Although quarterly inflation rates have come down since early last year, they have 
done so only slowly, and base effects helped push 12-month inflation to a 17- year 
high of 6.8 percent in December .  In response, the BOM  raised its policy rate  25 basis 
points to 7¼ percent at its December meeting, the first meeting under its  new 
governor, Alejandro Díaz de León.  We expect the B OM to raise its policy rate 
further in its next two meetings  by a cumulative 50 basis points .  Next year,  as 
inflation declines, we expect the BOM  to begin easing policy. 
 
• Brazil.   Real GDP growth is estimated to have moved up to 1½ percent in the fourth 
quarter from only 0.6 percent in the third.  Tumbling retail sales in October point to a 
weak start to the quarter, although subsequent data releases have been more positive.  
We expect growth to in crease to 2½ percent in 2018, boosted by last year’s  
considerable monetary policy easing  but somewhat constrained by the short-run costs 
of fiscal reform efforts and political uncertainty stemming from elections this  
October.  We see gr owth rising to 3 per cent in 2019 as this uncertainty fades.  
Relative to the December Tealbook, growth is  ½ percentage point higher in 2018 
and 2019. 
 Headline inflation  in Brazil was about 3 percent last year, well below the target of 
4½ per cent.  Amid  substantial resource slack , core inflation was subdued, while 
headline inflation was further restrained  by falling food prices.  As food prices 
normaliz e, we see inflation rising to a still-benign 4¼ percent in the current quarter 
and remaining around that pace over the foreca st period.  With inflation contained 
and activity weak , the Central Bank of Brazil cut its policy rate  50 basis points to 
7 percent in December.  We expect one more 25 basis point cut before the easing 
cycle ends, bringing the cumulative reduction in the policy rate since September 2016 
to 7½ percent age points.

Financial Market Developments 
Treasury yields and prices of dome stic equities have risen substantially on net 
since the December FOMC meetin g, boosted in part by investor pe rceptions of a 
strengthening growth outlook in the  United States and abroad.  Measures of inflation 
compensation also rose amid furth er dollar depreciation and hig her commodity prices.  
FOMC communications over the period appear to have had little e ffect on financial 
markets. 
A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability o f a rate hike at
the January FOMC meeting remai ned close to zero, while the prob ability of a
rate increase in March  rose to 80 percent.
The nominal Treasury yield c urve shifted up, with 2-, 5-, and 1 0-year
Treasury yields all rising about 20 basis points on net.
The rise in nominal yields was about evenly split between incre ases in real
yields and inflation compensati on, with TIPS-based measures of inflation
compensation rising 10 basis point s at the 5-year horizon and 1 6 basis points
at the 5-to-10-year horizon.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 5 percent, led by the energy
and consumer retail sector.  The VIX edged up but remained near  its historical
low.  Credit spreads on both invest ment- and speculative-grade corporate
bonds remained low.
The broad dollar depreciated 3 pe rcent amid strong foreign data  releases and
monetary policy communications tha t were less accommodative than expected
in some economies.  Foreign equity markets were buoyed by posit ive
economic data and, especially in th e emerging markets, rising c ommodity
prices.
Conditions in money markets were  reported to have remained orderly over
year-end, although offshore dollar funding markets were somewha t volatile.

  POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Domestic Developments  
Over the intermeeting period, FOM C communications were generall y viewed by 
market participants as consiste nt with their expectations for continued gradual removal of 
monetary policy accommodation an d did not prompt significant pr ice action.  The 
Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the December 
meeting was widely expected.  Nonetheless, market commentaries highlighted that the 
median projections in the Summar y of Economic Projections for the federal funds rate at 
the end of 2018 and 2019 were unchanged from September, even th ough the median 
projections for real GDP growth over the next three years were revised up and the median 
projections for the unemploym ent rate were revised down.  
Domestic data releases over this  period were somewhat stronger than expected on 
balance.  Both November and December retail sales printed above  market consensus 
forecasts.  Core CPI inflation was softer than expected for Nov ember but came in above 
expectations for December.  The B LS Employment Situation releas e for December was 
seen as slightly weaker than e xpected, on net, but was not cited by investors as materially 
changing their outlook for the dom estic economy or near-term mo netary policy.   
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts sh ows that market 
participants continued to place essentially zero probability on  an increase in the target 
range for the federal funds rat e at the January meeting.  The probability of a rate hike at 
the March meeting increased f rom around 60 percent immediately following the 
December FOMC meeting to 80 percen t.  Further out, the OIS-impl ied federal funds rates 
at the end of 2018 and 2019 moved up 14 ba sis points and 26 basis points, respectively, 
with a staff model attributing a bout half of the i ncreases to l ess negative term premiums.  
The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the intermeeti ng period amid 
investor perceptions of an impr oved domestic and foreign growth outlook and less 
accommodative monetary policy abroad, with the 2- and 10-year y ields both increasing 
about 20 basis points.  The 10-year  yield is now at its highest  level since March 2017, 
while the spread between 2- and 10- year yields remained at arou nd the 40th percentile of 
its distribution since data first  became available in August 19 71 (see the box “The 
International Experience with I nverted Yield Curves” for an int ernational perspective on 
the slope of the yield curve).  T reasury yields rose noticeably over the tw o days leading 
up to the passage of the Tax Cut s and Jobs Act, but market reports did not point to the tax

 The International Experience with Inverted Yield Curve s 
In the extended Tealbook outlook, the federal funds rate surpasses the 10 -year Treasury yield 
starting in 2020 , resulting in an inverted yield curve that lasts into  2026 .  While such prolonged 
yield curve inversion is unusual for the United States, some  advanced foreign economies  
(AFEs ) have had such inversions .1  In this discussion , we examine these  experiences as they 
relate both to recessions and to bank  performance. 
Over the past 20 years  for which we have reliable data, we find nine  episodes in  five AFEs  
where the yield curve was inverted for eight  months or longer (see the table).2  As the 
academic literature suggests, inversion episodes are not perfect predictors of incipient 
recessions:  Only three inversion episodes were associated with recession s.3  In all episodes , a 
monetary policy tightening coincided with or preceded an inversion episode.  In addition, in some cases —for example, the mid -2000s inversions in Australia and the United Kingdom —a 
compression in term premiums contributed to yield curve inversion s.

Source:  Interest rate data used to identify inversion episodes and policy tightenings are from 
Bloomberg, and GDP data used to define recessions are from the International Monetary Fund.  
 
Independent of whether prolonged inversions precede recessions, conventional wisdom 
suggests that yield curve inversions should reduce the profits from maturity transformation —
borrowing  money on a shorter time basis than it is  lent, traditionally an important function 
performed by banks.  To test this notion , we examine d ata for individual commercial banks in 
the countries with  prolonged yield curve inversions starting in the mid -2000s.5  Our analysis  
                                                 
1 The yield curve slope  is defined as the spread between 10-year and 3-month sovereign yields.   
2 These and other AFEs experienced prolonged inversions in earlier periods, but data limitations and 
different banking environments make these inversions harder to analyze and less relevant.  
3 Over the same period, the United States experienced three shorter yield curve inversions, all followed 
by recession s.  Since 1962, in every U.S. episode when a yield curve inversion preceded a recession, the FOMC 
had increased the federal funds rate, in many instances with the goal of curbing significant inflation pressures 
even at the cost of a recession.   For details, see the box “ Why Is the Yield Curve Inverted in the Tealbook 
Projection? ” in the December 2017 Tealbook.  
4 The compressions were attribute d to low term premiums around the world and heavy demand for 
longer -duration assets from institutional investors.  
5 This period better captures more -recent  bank business models and operating environments, the 
available bank data are more complete, and the level and slope of the yield curves in these episodes are 
comparable with those projected for the United States in the extended Tealbook outlook.

shows that the association between net interest rate margins (or broader profitability 
metrics) and the slope of the yield curve was positive but not statistically significant .6  The 
yield curve inversions also d id not appear to adversely  affect bank profitability.  In addition, 
there is little or no systematic association between yield curve inversions and indicators of 
bank soundness , such as the ratio of nonperforming loans to gross loans and provisions for 
loan losses to gross loans , or reliable signs of capital erosion.  Echoing this result, financial 
stability reports  of the mid -2000s by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bank of England as 
well as contemporaneous International Monetary Fund  reports do not mention yield curve 
inversion as a risk to banks . 
A few factors may explain these benign outcomes.  First, for the banking systems in these 
episodes, long -term loans  are largely priced as a markup over benchmark short -term interest 
rates :  Interest payments on such loans adjust on a set schedule so that they generally reflect 
changes in benchmark interest rates .  In particular, residential mortgage loan s (which account 
for the bulk of bank lending) and business loans tend to be variable- rate loans that are priced 
off short -term rates.7  Only holdings of securities and a moderate portion of loans are priced 
off long er-term  rates.  Second, banks’ liabilities are also largely priced off  short -term rates.  
For example, deposits, which mostly have short maturit ies, account for the bulk of banks’ 
liabilities.8  In addition, larger banks reportedly swap  fixed interest rate payments on their 
bonds to variable interest rate payments , which are tied to short -term interest rates .  
Therefore, because loans and, effectively , liabilities are generally priced off short -term 
interest rates , banks’ profits tend to  be insulated from changes in the slope of the yield curve. 
Although these past international experiences are somewhat comforting, it is unclear how 
directly applicable they are for the implications of the extended Tealbook outlook.  U.S. 
commercial banks operate in a different regulatory environment , face different competitive 
pressures, and have different business model and lending practices.9  For example, a larger 
portion of U.S. loan supply is  likely priced off longer- term rates .  That said, the foreign 
experiences do suggest that banks  can operate in ways that limit the negative effects of 
prolonged  yield curve inversions . 
                                                 
6 The analysis uses the methodology (clustering errors by country) of Stijn  Claessens, Nicholas Coleman, 
and Michael Donnelly (2017), “  ‘Low -for-Long’ Interest Rates and Banks’ Interest Margins and Profitability:  
Cross-C ountry Evidence ,” International Finance Discussion Papers 1197 (Washington:  Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, February),  https://doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2017.1197 ; the Bank for International 
Settlements  classification of developed countries ; and unconsolidated commercial bank -level data from 
Bankscope from 2005  to 20 15. 
7 Interest rates on mortgage loans are variable in Australia, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, 
and fixed or variable in Canada.   See Eugenio Cerutti, Jihad Dagher, and Giovanni Dell’Ariccia (201 5), “Housing 
Finance and Real -Estate Booms:  A Cross -Count ry Perspective,” IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN/15/12 
(Washington:  International Monetary Fund, June), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2015/sdn1512.pdf.

temporarily boost bank profitability.

  bill as a major driver for those increases, and the final passage of the tax bill did not 
prompt any reaction in Treasury m arkets.  About half of the inc reases in nominal yields 
over the intermeeting period refle cted higher real yields, as 5- and 10-year TIPS yields 
rose 13 basis points and 8 basis  points, respectively.  Measure s of option-implied 
volatility on interest rates were little changed, on net, and r emained near historically low 
levels.  The Treasury bill mark et showed modest signs of pressu re from concerns about 
the debt ceiling (see the box “Proj ections for Federal Debt Subject to Limit”).   
TIPS-based measures of inflati on compensation rose 10 basis poi nts at the 5-year 
horizon and 16 basis points at the 5-to-10-year horizon.  Both measures are now back to 
their levels in early 2017 before t he start of the recent trend  of mostly weaker-than-
expected CPI readings.  Inflati on compensation fell in response  to the November core 
CPI data release that came in below expectations but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodit y prices, a weakening 
dollar, and the stronger-than-expe cted December core CPI releas e.  Meanwhile, estimates 
of expected inflation based on the staff’s real term structure model edged up.  
Option-adjusted spreads on pr oduction-coupon MBS over Treasury yields were 
little changed over the intermee ting period.  Investors continued to see the ongoing 
normalization of the Federal Reser ve’s balance sheet as leaving  little imprint on MBS 
and Treasury yields.

Since the December FOMC meetin g, the S&P 500 index has continue d to post 
solid gains.  Consistent with a  stronger global economic outloo k and higher commodity 
prices, stock prices of energy a nd consumer retail firms notice ably outperformed those of 
other firms.  Even though stock pr ices of high-tax corporations  moved roughly in line 
with those of low-tax firms over the intermeeting period, the f inal stages and actual 
passage of the new tax bill reportedly also supported positive investor sentiment.2  One-
month-ahead option-implied vo latility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—edged up but 
remained very low by historical standards.   
                                                 
1 As part of the balance sheet n ormalization program, $6 billion  of Treasury securities and 
$4 billion of MBS were redeemed d uring the latest reinvestment period.  Following the Committee’s 
directive, monthly caps on SOMA securities reductions were incr eased to $12 billion for Treasury 
securities and to $8 billion for agency securities in January. 
2 Despite higher stock prices, the staff’s estimate of expected 10-year real return on the S&P 500 
index—which increases when earni ngs rise faster than prices—tic ked higher, reflecting an upward revision 
in the staff’s projection for after-tax earnings following the new tax legislation.

 Projections for Federal Debt Subject to Limit  
The statutory debt limit has been  binding since December 8, 2017 .  The Treasury 
Department has been able to continue operations through its  use of extraordinary 
measures .  
Forecasts of when the Treasury will exhaust extraordinary measures and be unable to meet 
its obligations are subject to considerable uncertainty.  The usual uncertainty associated 
with the timing of refunds during the sprin g tax -filing season  is currently compounded by  
uncertainty created by the recently passed tax bill that will affect a variety of the Treasury’s 
cash flows.  
The staff projection calls for the Treasury to deplete its remaining extraordinary measures 
by the end of February, assuming no legislation is passed .1  By early  March, the Treasury ’s 
cash on hand  is expected  to cover payments for , at most , a few additional days  (see figure).  
At this point, pressures in financial markets related to the debt ceiling appear fairly modest.  
Yields on Treasury bills maturing in early  March have risen  and are currently 7 basis points 
higher than the mid -February bill; moreover, yields on potentially  at-risk Treasury bills have 
moved higher than yields on agency discount notes with comparable maturity dates .  
                                                 
1 The Treasury is allowed to use extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the stat utory debt limit.  
These measures include suspending and redeeming securities from government employee retirement 
accounts a s well as suspending the daily reinvestment of dollar balances held by the Exchange 
Stabilization Fund.

improved risk sentiment pushed ris ky asset prices higher.  Agai nst this backdrop, foreign 
yields rose, in some cases supported by central bank communicat ions.  These 
developments weighed on the dolla r, which continued to deprecia te against most 
currencies.  On balance, the br oad nominal dollar index decline d 3 percent. 
Longer-term sovereign yields moved up in most AFEs, especially in Canada and 
Germany, driven by both higher term premiums and expectations for less accommodative 
monetary policy.  Market- based policy rate e xpectations for Can ada moved up over the 
intermeeting period, especially in response to higher inflation  and stronger employment 
data, and on January 17, the Bank of C anada raised its policy r ate 25 basis points.  The 
Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) left their monetary policy stances unchanged.  However, ECB communications  were interpreted as 
less accommodative than expected, and market-based policy expec tations moved up 
moderately in the euro area, though such measures continue to indicate a very gradual 
pace of monetary policy normalization.         
Foreign equity prices registere d robust gains.  Equity prices i n emerging market 
economies (EMEs) generally outperformed, as commodity prices in creased substantially, 
while emerging market bond spreads narrowed moderately.  Flows into EME bond and equity funds strengthened notably.   
 The cost of offshore dollar funding implied by currency swaps increased sharply 
in late December and reached multiyear highs, reportedly as sev eral major financial 
institutions, including some U.S . banks, were reluctant to expand their balance sheets at 
year-end.  Although market particip ants were surprised by the v olatile funding costs, the 
volume traded at these high pri ces was reportedly low.  Against  this backdrop, the 
December take-up at the ECB swap facility was higher than in re cent years, although it 
remained well below levels obs erved during the European debt cr isis or the Global 
Financial Crisis.  Measures of  implied dollar funding costs quickly returned to more

to very modest levels in t he second week of January. 
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Similar to previous increases in the target range for the feder al funds rate, the 
December policy rate increase was transmitted smoothly to money market rates.  Overall, 
both the effective federal funds  rate and the overnight bank fu nding rate held steady at 
around 1.42 percent except at year -end.  Since year-end, take-u p at the ON RRP facility 
has remained close to the lower  end of its historical range, reportedly because strong 
demand from dealers for repo f inancing has pushed market repo r ates higher relative to 
the ON RRP rate.  
Money market rates and volumes exhibited typical year-end dynam ics that 
quickly faded.  Similar to recent year-ends, rates and volumes in federal funds and 
Eurodollar markets declined on D ecember 29, while in secured ma rkets, Treasury repo 
rates increased.  Spreads betwee n longer-term unsecured commerc ial paper rates and the 
corresponding OIS rates widene d somewhat toward the end of 2017  amid low volumes.  
At year-end, ON RRP take-up inc reased $162 billion from the previous day operation, to 
$320 billion, roughly in line with r ecent quarter-ends.  As expected, government MMFs 
were the predominant particip ants in the operation, given the r eduction in dealer 
borrowing on financial reporti ng days.  After year-end, pressur es in money markets 
abated quickly, and rates and volumes returned to recent non-ye ar-end ranges.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained 
generally accommodative over the intermeeting period  and continued to be supportive of 
economic activity . 
• Net debt f inanci ng flows to nonfinancial firms turned negative in December , 
but the weakness appears to be demand driven and concentrated among larger, 
higher- rated firms.  
• The January Senior Loan Office r Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 
(SLOOS ) suggests that the sluggish commercial and industrial (C&I ) loan  
growth  over the past quarter  was demand  driven:  Banks report ed weaker 
demand from medium and large borrower s while also report ing easing of 
standards on these loans.1   
• Outstanding c onsumer credit accelerated in November —following the  robust 
growth observed earlier in the fall—mainly reflecting a very large expansion 
in revolving credit balances . 
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Overall, f inancing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained quite 
accommodative over the intermeeting period .  Spreads on both high-yield bonds and on 
newly issue d institutional leveraged loans have remained near their  post- crisis low s.  
In addition, respondents to the SLOOS indicated a net easing of standards and terms on 
C&I loans due in part to increased competition from other lenders. 
Despite accommodative conditions, net funds raised by nonfinancial corporations 
through debt instruments  turned decidedly negative in December.  The overall decline in 
                                                 
1 For each loan category, SLOOS results are calculated by weighting each bank’s response by the 
size of its loan portfolio in that category.  For detailed information on the results of the January survey, see

that month reflects negative net bond issuance and a drop in outstanding commercial 
paper, whereas C&I and leveraged loans were both about unchanged over the month. 
While the negati ve net debt financing in December may have been driven in part 
by unusually severe year-end effects, it could also reflect a softening in the demand for 
credit , possibly related to the  anticipation of higher  post- tax cash flows  and repatriation 
of foreign funds.  Indeed, the decline in gross issuance of corporate bonds in December 
was in the investment- grade segment  only, where issuance is more likely driven by shifts 
in financing demand than credit supply.  In contrast, gross issuance of speculative- grade 
bonds and i nstitutional leveraged loan s both remained strong.  SLOOS respondents 
widely reported weak demand for C&I loans in the fourth quarter, particularly from large 
firms .  Respondents attributed this weak demand in part to firms drawing on internally  
generated funds.  
In a set of special questions in the SLOOS inquiring about the outlook for 2018, 
respondent banks forecast that demand for C&I loans from small firms would rise over the next year  but would remain basically unchanged, on net, for large and middle -market 
firms.  Banks also indicated that in 2018 they expected to further ease standards for larger 
firms but leave lending standards for small firms  basically unchanged.  
Corporate earnings  growth is estimated  to have been sizable in the fourth quarter .  
Wall Street analyst forecasts for fourth -quarter earnings and reports to date imply  about a 
5 percent (seasonally adjusted) earnings -per-share gain among S&P 500 firms, or 
20 percent at an annual rate.  The rise in part reflect s a jump in energy- sector earnings 
from the recent upswing in oil prices.  Looking forward , analysts have been revising 
projections of year-a head earning s notably higher as they incorporate the effect s of the 
passage of the tax bill.  These upward revisions are expected to continue for some time , 
as forecast adjustments have not yet fully incorporat ed the direct effects  of the tax 
legislation on after -tax earnings . 
Nonfinancial corporations deployed available funds more aggressively over the 
last quarter of 2017, with the volume of announced stock repurchases coming in notably higher than in the previous few quarters and the volume of announced and completed merger s and acquisitions remaining robust.  Still, o n balance, the credit quality of 
nonfinancial corporations appeared  to stay  solid amid few ratings changes  over the 
intermeeting period , and bond defaults and C&I delinquencies remained very low by 
historical standards.

Small Businesses     
Overall, small business credit market conditions were little changed  and still 
relatively  accommodative over the intermeeting period.  Recent i ndicators of loan 
performance have remained  strong, and credit quality concerns are not expected to be a 
significant factor affecting the ability of small businesses to obtain credit in the n ear term.   
However, c redit growth remained  sluggish, with data suggesting this  sluggishness is 
largely due to continued weak demand for credit by small businesses. 
Commercial Real Estate  
Growth of commercial real estate ( CRE ) loan s held by banks slowed  further in  the 
fourth quarter.  Growth of multifamily and nonfarm nonresidential loans from large 
banks, which had been slowing all year , turned  negative in the fourth quarter.  In contrast, 
CRE loans from small banks and construction loans from large banks expanded  at a more 
robust pace.  On balance, SLOOS respon dents  did not indicate any significant changes in 
demand or lending standards for CRE loans over the fourth quarter, nor did they indicate 
that they expected to change their standards for CRE loans this year . 
Financing conditions in the commercial mortgage -backed securities ( CMBS ) 
market remained accommodative, and CMBS issuance continued at a robust pace in the 
fourth  quarter.  Spreads on CMBS generally held steady during the intermeeting period , 
near their  lowest levels since the financial crisis.   Also, delinquency rates on loans in 
CMBS pools continued to decline in November, largely reflecting the shrinking share of risky loans that originated before the financial crisis .  However, in contrast to the largely 
sanguine conditions, spreads on junior tranches of CMBX that are heavily exposed to the challenged brick -and-mortar retail sector remain ed high  but tighten ed modestly . 
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also  remained accommodative 
on balance.  In the final stages of the new tax bill, uncertainty over the tax- exempt status 
of the interest earned on private activity bonds (PABs) led to a surge in municipal bond issuance in December on the presumption that these bonds would have been 
grandfathered  in.
2  However, the final tax bill preserved the tax-exempt status of PABs.  
                                                 
2 A PAB  is a bond issued by or on behalf of local or state government for the purpose of financing 
the project of a private user. For example, these bonds can be used t o fund manufacturing plants, airports, 
docks, parking garages , or water and sewage plants.

In December, the credit quality of municipal bonds held steady , with the number of 
ratings upgrades slightly outpacing that of rating downgrades. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative 
for most borrowers.  Although the rate on 30-year conforming mortgages offer ed to wel l-
qualified borrowers rose  16 basis points over the intermeeting period  (in line with 
benchmark yields ), the rate remained quite low by historical standards.   Mortgage 
originations for home purchases continued to rebound in November and, after having 
stepp ed down over the summer, came back in line with the steady growth trend of recent 
years.  Originations of loans with a high debt- to-income ratio have picked up some in 
recent months, reflecting an easing  of credit standards for well -qualified borrowers 
instituted by Fannie Mae last July.3  However, credit standards remained tight for 
borrowers with low credit scores or with hard- to-document incomes.  Banks reported that 
demand and lending standards for most mortgage categories were little changed in recent months, although demand for jumbo loans reportedly weakened. 
Consumer Credit 
Overall, financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely 
supportive of economic activity.  Indeed, as  retail sales posted strong growth in recent 
months, consumer credit increased  notably in  November, exceeding the more moderate 
volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year.  Revolving credit expanded at a 
particularly brisk pace in November , while nonrevolving credit also grew robust ly, 
mainly driven by expansion in student and other consumer loans.  In contrast, auto 
lending flows slowed in recent months, consistent with the weakening demand for such 
loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the January SLOOS . 
Credit card interest rates continued to trend up over the past few months, 
consistent with short- term market interest rates.  Auto loan interest rates reported by car

For subprime borrowers, conditions in the credit card market remai ned tight, 
while  conditions in the market for auto loans have tightened considerably over the past 
year.   Indeed, the January SLOOS indicated  that banks’ standards on both credit card and 
auto loans were reportedly tightened  in the fourth  quarter .  Over the coming year, banks 
expect to continue to tighten standards on credit card and auto loans and also anticipate 
that the credit performance of these types of loans will deteriorate.

 Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS  
As in the December Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of 
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark 
used by the FOMC.  Many empirical indicators that are frequently interpreted as 
reflective of macroeconomic uncertainty remain subdued.  Corporate bond spreads and 
the VIX remain near the low end of their historical ranges.  The enactment of the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, following the December Tealbook, h as diminished the uncertainty 
regarding fiscal policy effects, although ambiguity remains about the future direction of a 
number of other federal policies.   
We continue to judge the risks around our projections for both real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate as being balanced.  Consistent with that view, estimates of the 
distribution of risks around those forecasts conditional on available indicators, shown in 
the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly skewed.  
Moreover, as presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the risk of 
returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three years is 
estimated from stochastic simulations around the baseline path in the FRB/US model to 
be about 11 percent.1 
With regard to inflation, we still see the current level of uncertainty around our 
projection as in line with the average over the past 20 years and the risks to the downside 
and upside as roughly balanced.  To the downside, last year’s string of soft readings on 
inflation could prove to be more persistent than we have assumed.  Also, we think there is 
a risk that inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could be lower 
currently than in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming years as we have 
assumed.  To the upside, with the economy projected to be moving further above its long-
run potential, inflation may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the 
predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation. 
                                                 
1 If the ELB risk were computed around a lower path for the federal funds rate, then the 
probability naturally would be higher.  For example, the probability is 22 percent if calculated using the 
median federal funds rates from the FOMC’s December Survey of Economic Projections .

 Our judgmental assessments of typical uncertainty and balanced risks are consistent with 
the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance assessment, which judges the overall financial vulnerabilities in 
the United States and overseas to be moderate.  Asset valuations have increased further 
from already elevated levels both here and in a number of foreign economies.  However, 
these valuation pressures have generally not been accompanied by an increase in other 
vulnerabilities.  While leverage in the U.S. nonfinancial business sector remained 
elevated in the fourth quarter with additional net issuance of risky debt, overall borrowing 
in the nonfinancial sector continued to advance at a slower pace than nominal GDP.  
Vulnerabilities from leverage in the financial system appear low, as both banks and 
insurance companies are highly capitalized by historical standards.  Nevertheless, there is 
some evidence that dealers have eased price terms to hedge funds and real estate 
investment trusts, or REITs, and that leverage used by hedge funds has gradually 
increased.  Vulnerabilities from liquidity and maturity transformation remain low, partly 
because banks continue to hold substantial amounts of high-quality liquid assets that 
exceed their liquidity coverage ratio requirements.  Moreover, the level of assets under 
management at prime money market funds has held steady since the October 2016 
reform, and growth of alternative short-term investment vehicles appears to have  
been weak. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the 
baseline projection u sing simulations of staff models.  The first two scenarios illustrate 
some of the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic effects of the Tax Cut and Jobs 
Act.  In the first scenario, the effects on the economy are larger as investment and labor 
supply respond more than in the baseline.  In contrast, in the second scenario, supply 
constraints in tight labor and product markets,  together with a lower marginal propensity 
to consume, weaken the economic effects of the tax reform.  The third scenario illustrates 
the consequences of a lower natural rate of unemployment that is initially misperceived 
by the central bank.   In the fourth scenario, we study a downside risk for inflation in 
which households and businesses have lower inflation expectations than in the baseline 
because they perceive that monetary policy will be too tight to return inflation to the 
FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In contrast, the fifth scenario

 examines the upside risk that the response of wages and prices to the further tightening of 
labor market conditions will be stronger than we have assumed,  and that inflation 
expectations will be more responsive to a rise in actual inflation.   In the sixth scenario, 
we present the implications of a substantial correction in global asset valuations.  The last 
scenario considers the effects of stronger foreign economic growth in combination with a 
faster normalization of monetary policy in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs). 
We simulate these scenarios using three staff models.2  In all of the scenarios, the 
federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline.  In addition, the 
size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in 
all of the scenarios. 
Larger Effects of the Tax Reform [FRB/US] 
There is considerable uncertainty about the macroeconomic effects of the recent 
tax reform.  This scenario illustrates the possibility that the effects could be stronger than 
we have projected.  We assume that the reduction in personal income taxes raises labor 
supply faster than in the baseline.  In particular, the total increase in labor supply is 
completed by the end of 2020, three years earlier than in the baseline.  In addition, 
investment is assumed to be more responsive to the change in the user cost of capital than 
in the judgmental projection, similar to the parameterization in FRB/US and some outside 
estimates.  Furthermore, the tax legislation leads to a small boost in the trend growth of 
multifactor productivity, linked to an increase in firm entry that the reform is assumed  
to elicit.3   
The stronger increase in aggregate supply boosts economic activity.  However, 
resource utilization is modestly tighter than in the baseline for some time, as actual output 
rises more quickly than potential,  raising the output gap about ½  percentage point above 
the baseline in 2021 .  Real GDP growth peaks at 3¼ percent in mid-2018, and the 
unemployment rate falls to 3 percent in mid-2020 .  With a relatively flat Phillips curve,

 inflation is only a touch higher.  The higher output gap drives the federal funds rate to  
5¼ percent in 2021, ¼ percentage point above the baseline.  
Smaller Effects of the Tax Reform [FRB/US] 
Alternatively, the macroeconomic effects of the tax legislation may turn out to be 
smaller than in the baseline.  In an economy with already hot labor and product markets, 
supply constraints might limit the fiscal impetus.  Furthermore, consumers may spend 
less and save more of the extra income from lower taxes than we assume in the baseline.  
For instance, the personal income tax cuts are skewed toward high-income individuals 
who may have a lower marginal propensity to consume, and we may have insufficiently 
taken account of that distributional effect in the baseline.   In this scenario,  we assume the 
reform boosts aggregate demand by half as much as in the baseline projection and that 
the labor supply effect built into the baseline does not materialize.   
Under these circumstances,  the level of real GDP stands about ½ percent below  
the baseline; the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point higher and the labor force 
participation rate is 0.1 percentage point lower in 2021.  Inflation is essentially 
unchanged, while the narrower output gap leads to the federal funds rate  being below the 
baseline. 
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [FRB/US] 
In the baseline forecast, the unemployment rate falls to 3. 2 percent in 2019,  with 
the natural rate of unemployment assumed to hold steady at 4.7  percent through the 
projection period.  However, the natural rate is estimated with considerable uncertainty 
and could be lower.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate has been 3¾ percent 
for the past few years and will remain at that level in the future.  Furthermore, we assume 
that policymakers and the staff continue, for a time, to misperceive the level of the 
natural rate; their perceptions converge to its true level only gradually and that 
convergence is not complete by the end of 2023.  
Given the lower natural rate, the unemployment rate in the scenario is below the 
baseline path, falling to 2¾ percent in 2020, ½ percentage point below the baseline.  Over 
time, policymakers revise their view of the natural rate downward, but the gap between 
the unemployment rate and the perceived natural rate is similar to the baseline.  Given 
that inflation is only a touch lower and the perceived output gap is about the same as in 
the baseline, the path for the federal funds rate is little changed.  Had policymakers fully

 and immediately recognized the lower natural rate, the perceived output gap would have 
been substantially smaller and the federal funds rate would have been about ¼ percentage 
point lower during the first two  years of the simulation.  The unemployment rate would 
have fallen ¾ percentage point below the baseline in 2020, ¼ percentage point further 
than in the case of misperception.  
Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model] 
Headline inflation, as measured by the change in personal consumption 
expenditures (PCE) price s, has been below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for most 
of the past five years.  It has averaged about 1 ¼ percent during this period and has 
remained subdued more recently even as resource utilization has exceed ed our estimate 
of its sustainable level.  In the baseline projection, inflation is assumed to rebound this 
year and to reach 2 percent in 2020, in part reflecting further tightening in resource 
utilization and a small gradual rise in inflation expectations.  However, in light of the 
persistently low inflation of the past several years, there is a risk that the public perceives 
the stance of monetary policy currently as being too tight,  and as likely to remain so in 
the future,  to achieve the 2 percent target; for that reason, longer-run inflation 
expectations in this scenario are assumed to be ¼ percentage point lower than in the 
baseline. 
Lower inflation expectations cause actual inflation to be lower than in the baseline 
and to reach only 1. 7 percent in 2020.  Consequently,  the federal funds rate increases less 
than in the baseline, but given the inertia in the assumed policy rule, real interest rates as 
perceived by the private sector are initially slightly higher.  As a result, real GDP growth 
is a touch lower in 2018 than in the baseline and t he unemployment rate runs about 
¼ percentage point higher in 2018 and remains above the baseline through 2022.4  
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US] 
Alternatively, the further tightening of resource utilization in the baseline could 
cause inflation to rise much faster than projected.  Some research suggests that the 
relationship between labor utilization and wage growth may become stronger—the 
                                                 
4 The Phillips curve in this model is very flat, so it may seem surprising that inflation falls 
noticeably despite only a modest increase in the unemployment rate.  That outcome arises because price 
setters in the model are very forward looking, and the downward deviation of production costs from the 
baseline—while small—is very persistent.

 Phillips curve may steepen— when the labor market is very tight.5  In FRB/US,  faster 
wage growth implies higher price inflation as well.  This scenario captures the risk of that 
nonlinearity by boosting the response of wages to tightening labor utilization and by 
assuming that longer-run inflation expectations become more sensitive to the higher 
realized price inflation that stems from faster wage growth.6 
Inflation reaches 3 percent by the end of 2020 , compared with about 2 percent in 
the baseline.  In response to the higher path of  inflation, the federal funds rate ris es more 
and peaks slightly above 6 percent in 2022.  As a result, real GDP rises a bit more slow ly 
and the unemployme
nt rate is about ½ percentage point above the baseline by the end of 
2023 (though still slightly below the level of the natural rate). 
Global Market Correction [SIGMA] 
Asset valuation pressures in the
 United States and in many foreign economies 
remain noticeably elevated, with equity price- to-earnings ratios high by historical 
standards, interest rate spreads on corporate debt narrow, and t erm premiums on 
sovereign debt unusually compressed.  In this scenario, we assume that investors become 
very concerned about stretched valuations, and a widespread market correction ensues 
over the course of 2018.  Specifically, equity prices fall 20 percent and corporate 
borrowing spreads increase
 45 basis points in both the United States and abroad.  While 
term premiums on foreign sovereign bonds increase 30 basis points, term premiums on 
U.S. Treasury securities rise only about half as much as investors rebalance their 
portfolios toward dollar-denominated assets; these flight- to-safety flows cause the broad 
real dollar to appreciate about 5  percent.  The fall in global asset prices weakens 
household and corporate balance sheets and weighs on confidence.

Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vol. 9 (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of

http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2016.078 . 
6 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the se increases reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.  
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those representing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

 Tighter financial conditions, weaker foreign activity, and the appreciation of the 
dollar restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States.   U.S. GDP growth 
moderates to 1½ percent in 2018, about 1½ percentage points lower than in the baseline.  
The unemployment rate runs ½ percentage point, on average, above the baseline through 
the end of 2023.  Lower import prices and weaker activity reduce core PCE price 
inflation to 1¼ percent by the end of 2018.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower 
path than in the baseline. 
The macroeconomic effects in our scenario are only moderate.  This outcome 
reflects our assumption that the asset price correction is fairly contained and, in 
particular, does not induce the widespread disruption to the broader functioning of 
financial markets that occurred during the Global Financial Crisis.  Nonetheless, U.S. 
activity and inflation in the current scenario are lower than in the domestic “Market 
Correction” scenario featured in the December Tealbook because of the adverse effects 
stemming from weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar. 
Stronger Foreign Growth and Tighter Policy [SIGMA] 
Our baseline forecast incorporates a slow policy normalization abroad as central 
banks continue to face muted inflationary pressures.  However, foreign economic growth, 
especially in the AFEs, has been stronger than expected in recent quarters,  and recent 
communication by some AFE central banks has pointed to a less accommodative policy 
stance.  This scenario assumes that foreign GDP  growth runs at an average pace of 
3½ percent per year in 2018 and 2019, about ¾ percentage point above the baseline.  
These improved macroeconomic conditions lead AFE central banks to fear they are 
“behind the curve” and prompt them to tighten their policy rates more aggressively than 
what is prescribed by the baseline policy rule.  Higher interest rates abroad — including 
from a rise in term premiums— along with some reversal of earlier flight- to-safety flows 
into U.S. assets contribute to a 5 percent depreciation of the broad real dollar.     
Despite the tightening of monetary policy abroad and some spillovers of that 
tightening into U.S. interest rates, U.S. activity benefits as stronger foreign growth and 
the weaker dollar boost net exports.  U.S. real GDP expands 3¼ percent in 2018 and 
2½ percent in 2019, about ¼ percentage point more than in the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate falls to just under 3 percent by the end of 2019.  Higher import prices 
and stronger economic activity cause core PCE price inflation to run ¼ percentage point 
above the baseline in 2018 and 2019.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in 
the baseline, increasing to 5 percent by the end of 2020.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  As discussed in the Domestic Economic 
Developments and Outlook section of Tealbook A, the output gap is considerably wider 
in the staff’s medium -term projection than in the December  Tealbook.  Reflecting the 
staff’s revised projection for the output gap, the paths for the federal funds rate prescribed by simple rules and optimal control policies are noticeably higher than in December.  A 
special exhibit reports the changes from the previous Tealbook in prescriptions of simple 
rules and optimal control policies as well as in their associated macroeconomic outcomes .   
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor  (1993) rule, the Taylor (19 99) rule (also 
known as the “balanced approach” rule) , a first -difference rule, and  a nominal income 
targeting (NIT) rule .  These near -term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown in the middle panels.  The top 
and middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which 
is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1  
• The prescriptions of all of the simple policy rules are somewhat higher than in 
the previous Tealbook, reflecting the upward revision to the staff’s near -term 
forecast for the output gap.  
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules, which do not 
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding 
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.   
• The prescriptions of the first- difference rule are modestly higher in the near 
term than those in the Tealbook baseline.   
                                                 
1 We provide details on each of these  simple rules  in the appendix to this section.   Except for the 
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that 
are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

    1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the September 2017 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baselineprojections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *. The previous−Tealbook r* is adjusted to be consistent with a
revision in the model's fiscal rules.

  • Under the NIT rule, the federal funds rate responds to the current output gap 
and the shortfall of the level of the GDP price deflator from the path it would 
have attained had it increased  at an annual rate of 2 percent since 2011: Q4; the 
current  shortfall in the GDP price deflator is about 4 percent.   Unlike the other 
rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which  call for raising the federal funds 
rate in the near term , the NIT rule prescribes a level for the federal funds rate 
in this quarter and the next that is near the low end of the current target range 
to help eliminate  the shortfall in the GDP price deflator . 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL  FUNDS 
RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the December  2017 Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).2  Both estimates use the FRB/US model to conduct the 
simulations.  This concept, labeled  “FRB/US r*,” corre sponds to the level of the real 
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (starting in the current 
quarter) , would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  This 
concept of r* is a summary of  the projected underlying strength of the real economy; 
consequently, it is based on a single criterion and does not take into account other 
considerations, such as  achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the 
federal funds rate. 
• At 3.43 percent, the estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* in this 
quarter is about 1 percentage point above the corresponding value in the 
December  Tealbook.  Th e estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* has not 
been revised up so sharply since 2010 and has not been above 3  percent since 
2007.  Th e large upward revision  reflects the fact that the medium- term output 
                                                 
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the December 2017 SEP), the econ omy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

  gap in the current staff forecast is notably wider than in the December  
Tealbook.3  
• At 1. 09 percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook-consistent FRB /US r*.  The difference stems from the fact that the 
SEP-consistent projection, based on information available at the time of the 
December meeting,  has output exceeding  potential by a considerably smaller 
amount from 2018 through 2020 than does  the current  Tealbook forecast 
despite the lower median path for the real federal funds rate in the SEP . 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the fi rst-difference rule, and 
the NIT rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the sp ecified policy 
rules.4  The simulations are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following the prescriptions of each  rule in the future and that financial market 
participants, price setters, and wage setters believe that monetary p olicy  will follow 
through on this commitment and  are aware of the implications for interest rates and the 
macroeconomy of such a policy.5  The exhibit also reports the Tealbook baseline 
projection.   
• Under the Tealbook baseline policy, the federal funds ra te increases, on 
average, about 1.2 percentage points per year  through 2020.  The  federal 
funds rate peaks at 5 percent in 2021 before slowly moving down to its 
longer- run level , which the staff assumes will be 2½ percent.  
                                                 
3 In the previous Tealbook, the estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* for the current quarter 
was 17 basis points higher than for the previous quarter,  reflecting the continued strengthening of the 
economy already embedded in the December Tealbook baseline.  
4 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the  dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.  
5 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly 
understands the implications of the FOMC adopting a particular policy strategy.  In the real world, the 
adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a period during which  the public 
learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications.  We abstract from considerations of this kind.

  • The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values exceed the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values by about 1.4 percentage point s per year , on average , 
over the next three years .  These relatively high values for t he federal funds 
rate are followed by slightly lower  values than in the Tealbook baseline 
beyond 2022.  T he unemployment rate under the Taylor (1999) rule runs 
somewhat higher than the Tealbook baseline through 2021; the unemployment 
rate runs lower than in the baseline starting in 2022.  Inflation under the 
Taylor (1999) rule runs a bit above its baseline path over the period shown in 
the figures .  The reason that the sharp increase in the federal funds rate under 
the Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy 
is because agents in the model are forward  looking and thus correctly 
anticipate that the federal funds rate beyond the medium term will be lower than under the Tealbook baseline; the result is a path for the 10- year real 
Treasury yield that runs below that in the baseline over the majority of the 
next decade, thereby supporting economic activity and inflation.
6 
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate.  The prescriptions of the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than 
the Tealbook baseline over the next two years, though they are lower than  
those of the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown because the Taylor (1993)  rule responds less strongly to the projected excess in output over its 
assumed potential level.  Accordingly, inflation under the Taylor (1993) rule 
exceeds inflation under the Tealbook baseline by more than under the Taylor 
(1999)  rule, whereas the unemployment rate falls below the path in the 
Tealbook baseline sooner.  
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule is 
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline over the next three years 
but runs below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter 
divergence occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the 
                                                 
6 In the FRB/US model,  inflation tends to respond more strongly than the unemployment rate to 
longer -run developments.  In the case of the Taylor (1999) rule, beyond 2022 the rule prescribes a path of 
the federal funds rate that runs, for a time, lower than the Tealbook baseline path.  As a result, there is a 
long period during which the 10 -year real Treasury yield under the Taylor (1999) rule is relatively low.  
Because agents in the model anticipate this period of low real 10 -year Treasury rates, inflation under the 
Taylor (19 99) rule exceeds inflation in the Tealbook baseline.

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

  expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the 
projected narrowing of the output gap beyond the next three years .  The 
associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction with 
expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer- term real 
interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of 
resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first- difference rule generates  
outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower, and outcomes for 
inflation that are higher, than  the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook 
baseline projection. 
• The NI T rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as 
measured by the rate of increase in the GDP price deflator) from an annual 
rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.  Compared with the Tealbook baseline 
policy, t he NI T rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate because the cumulative shortfall of inflation from 2  percent 
since the end of 2011 is currently large , at about 4 percent.  Because the 
simulation embeds the assumption  that policymakers  can credibly commit to 
closing this gap and that financial market participants and price an d wage 
setters  correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates, 
the path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate is lower than under the other policy 
rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years .  Accordingly, the path for 
the unemployment rate is substantially lower  than  in the Tealbook baseline 
and all other simulations shown, dropping to about 2.6 percent in 2021. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future pol icy choices; such a 
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

  Three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for the 
federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection.  High  levels of the real 
federal funds rate are necessary in order to return the unemployment rate to its natural 
rate relatively quickly because, in the FRB/US model, the unemployment rate does not 
respond strongly to changes in real interest rates, a feature that appears to be consistent 
with recent historical experience.  However, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal 
funds rate quickly to the high levels prescribed by most optimal control policies, 
macroeconomic outcomes may well be appreciably different than the benign outcomes 
predicted by the FRB/US model.  The  simulation results  hinge on the assumptions that 
agents in the model have perfect foresight and  that the public believes with certainty that 
policymakers will implement the path for the federal funds rate prescrib ed by the optimal 
control exercises.  While these assumptions may be a reasonable approximation under 
some circumstances, they may not be valid  for historically extreme changes in the federal 
funds rate, particularly  those prescribed by the optimal control exercise that places only a 
minimal penalty on adjustments in the federal funds rate.   
Nevertheless, the three  optimal control policies that prescribe high paths for the 
federal funds rate have prescribed tighter  policy than the Tealbook baseline for several 
years .  Taken at face value,  the additional economic strength embedded in the current  
Tealbook baseline increases the motivation  of policymakers to raise the federal funds rate 
relatively quickly so as  to keep th e unemployment rate from falling  further below its 
natural rate.   
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline path because, in the baseline projection, the unemployment rate falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several yea rs—an outcome that policymakers with  the equal 
                                                 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

  weights cost function judge to be costly.9  The tighter policy results in a path 
for the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate and  a path for  headline PCE inflation that is somewhat lower 
than in the Tealbook baseline forecast over the period shown, consistent with the limited response of inflation to the level of resource utilization in the 
FRB/US  model. 
• The second simulation, “Asymmetric weig ht on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate but that is identical 
to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rat e is above 
the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights  and below the Tealbook baseline path throughout the period shown.  
With the asymmetric  loss function, policymakers choose this initially more  
accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to raise inflation 
to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate 
of unemployment.  Because the public believes that policymakers will follow through on this policy rate path even as the unemployment rate substantially undershoots its natural rate, the tighter labor market brings inflation to 2 percent more quickly than in the case of equal weights.  Starting in the 
middle of the next decade (not shown) , the unemployment rate runs a little 
above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the 
inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated  
resource utilization.  
• The third simulation , “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times larger than the specification  with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical to that specification.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses 
associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming 
years.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymak ers face an 
                                                 
9 When we us e the SEP -consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal funds rate 
under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks below 5 percent, compared with nearly 
8 percent under the Tealbook baseline.

  unappealing tradeoff  because inflation responds only weakly to resource 
utilization.  Hence, to raise inflation in the near term by even  a small amount, 
policymakers would need to engineer a substantial undershoot by the 
unemployment rate of its natural rate—an outcome that this specification of 
the loss function also regards  as costly . 
• The fourth simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting optimal strategy, the federal funds rate soars to near 11 percent  in 
2018 and then settles between 7 and 9 percent over much of the remainder of 
the period shown.  This sharp  tightening of policy reflects  an effort to forestall 
the projected undershoot by the unemployment rate of its  natural rate in the 
Tealbook baseline.  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 
10-year Treasury yield are also notably high er for a couple of years than in the 
case of equal weights.  Because the short -run Phillips curve is quite flat in the 
FRB/US model and agents in the model take the 2 percent inflation objective 
to be credible, this policy leaves the trajectory for inflation close to that in the equal -weights case over the period shown, even though, in the period through 
2020, this policy  keeps  the unemployment rate much closer to the staff’s 
estimate of the natural  rate.

CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTIONS AND OUTCOMES FROM THE  DECEMBER 
TEALBOOK  
The stronger economic outlook embedded in the staff’s baseline forecast implies 
large upward revisions to the paths for the federal funds rate prescribed by simple policy rules and the optimal control policies.   Changes from the December  Tealbook in the 
federal funds rate prescriptions as well as in the unemployment rate and inflation 
outcomes are shown in the fourth exhibit.  The three panels to the left show these changes 
under the simple policy rules, wh ereas  the panels to the right show these changes under 
the optimal control policies . 
• The simple policy rules now prescribe levels for the federal funds rate that are , 
on average over the projection period shown, between ½ and 1 percentage 
                                                 
10 From 2020 onward, the nominal an d real federal  funds rates for this simulation are sometimes 
above and sometimes below the corresponding  values observed in the case of equal weights.

  point higher than in December .  Despite the higher levels of the federal funds 
rate, the unemployment rate falls by more than in the December Tealbook 
because of  the strength of the economic outlook embedded in the current 
Tealbook baseline.  Because the short-run Phillips curve is qui te flat in the 
FRB/US model, inflation outcomes are similar to those in the December 
Tealbook. 
• With the exception of the policy associated with the asymmetric weight on 
ugap, the optimal control policies prescribe  average levels for the federal 
funds rate over the projection period shown that are between 1 and 
1½ percentage points higher than in December.  The tighter policy rates under these policies offset most of the additional strength of the economic outlook 
embedded in the current Tealbook baseline an d imply little change in the path 
for the unemployment rate or inflation from  December.   The optimal control 
policy associated with an asymmetric weight on ugap does not penalize 
deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate and , as a result , 
responds only modestly to the additional strength embedded in the staff outlook.  The unemployment rate under this policy falls further, by about 0.4 percentage point, on average, over the projection period shown, and the path for inflation is little change d from  the December  Tealbook. 
The next four exhibits  tabulate the simulation resu lts for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial kno wledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES  SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
routinely reported in the  Monetary Policy Strategies  section .  It also reports the expression for the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule ; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline pro jection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  The right -hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter

  core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the 
output gap estimate for the current period ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead 
annual change in the output gap ( ∆4𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation 
objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.    
The nominal income  targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal income, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the log of the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value , denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP.  Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage p oints per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be expressed as the 
sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortf all of the GDP deflator from the level 
it would have attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.1 
Simple Rules  
 The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.
2   
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.3  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule

3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same  360-day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB /US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365- day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.  Taylor (1993) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+0.5𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡

  do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
The “Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of ch anges in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines :  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarte r of that period given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection .4  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  The 
measure is derived u nder the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.

  FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the futur e using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕=� 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉𝑇𝑇

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the 
equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The third specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weight to 
inflation gaps.  The fourth specifi cation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used 
                                                 
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

  in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see s this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not a ffect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits.   Loss Functions

2.Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.
3.Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.
4.The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum
of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
