  Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming data suggest that resour ce utilization continues to ti ghten.  In the labor 
market, gains in payroll employ ment have been running substanti ally above the pace we 
estimate is required, on average,  to absorb new labor force ent rants and well above our 
expectations in the January T ealbook.  Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remained at 
4.1 percent in February as labor force participation jumped.  M eanwhile, we now 
estimate that real GDP increas ed at an annual rate of 3 percent in the fourth quarter of last 
year, and we project it to rise  2½ percent in the first half of  this year.  Although these 
rates of output growth are a fai r bit lower than expected in our previous projection, they 
remain sufficient to imply a f urther widening of the gap between actual and potential 
output. 
Beyond the near term, real GDP grow th is a little stronger in t his projection, 
reflecting the boost to government spending expected from the r ecently enacted 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ( BBA 2018).  We anticipate growth  in real GDP will 
gradually slow from 3 percent this year to 2 percent in 2020 as  monetary policy continues 
to tighten.  By the end of 2020, we expect the level of real GD P to be 3½ percent above 
our estimate of its potential, abou t ¼ percentage  point higher than in the January 
Tealbook.  Correspondingly, the unempl oyment rate is expected to gradually fall to 
3.1 percent at the end of 2020, about 1½ percentage points belo w our estimate of its 
natural rate and slightly lower than in our prev ious projection. 
Although inflation on a 12-month basis remains below the Commit tee’s 2 percent 
objective, the past several monthly readings corroborate our view that inflation is moving 
up.  PCE prices rose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in J anuary, and core PCE 
prices rose 1.5 percent; both of  these rates are up about ¼ per centage point from their 
respective lows last summer.  W ith resource utilization tightening substantially further in 
this projection, underlying infla tion inching up, and the extra ordinarily low reading from 
last March dropping out of the cal culation, we expect core PCE price inflation to move 
up to 1.9 percent this year and to reach 2.2 percent in 2020; total PCE price inflation 
climbs to 1.8 percent this year  and reaches 2.1 percent in 2020 .  The rates of inflation at 
the end of the projection are m odestly higher than in the Janua ry Tealbook.  Finally, in 
this forecast, we have not taken on board any effects on either  real activity or inflation 
from higher import tariffs.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is close to the projections from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus  in 2018  and 
¼ percentage point higher than the Blue Chip in 2019.  The staff’s unemployment rate 
forecast is lower than the SPF and Blue Chip forecasts  in 2018 and  nearly  ½ percentage 
point below the Blue Chip in 2019.  The staff’s projection for CPI inflation is nearly the 
same as  the Blue Chip and SPF forecasts in both 2018 and 2019 .  The staff’s projections 
for overall PCE price inflation and for core PCE inflation are about the same as the SPF 
forecasts in both 2018 and 2019.   
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includ es input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following the 
December FOMC meeting.  The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection with 
the one we presented in the December Tealbook.  
Since the December Tealbook, we have updated our fiscal policy assumptions to reflect both the Tax 
Cut and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which account for the higher path for GDP 
growth over the course of the projection.  Meanwhile, t he unemployment rate has been revised 
down, reflecting the stronger aggregate demand.  Thus, r esource utilization, as measured b y the 
unemployment gap or the output gap, is considerably tighter in this projection  than in December.1 
Our projection for both headline and core PCE price inflation in 2018  is revised up a bit relative to the 
December Tealbook, reflecting stronger readings on core inflation and higher oil prices.  We 
continue to expect inflation to move up in coming years, and with resource utilization tighter than in 
the December Tealbook, we now expect both total and core inflation to rise a bit above 2  percent in 
the medium term .  
Relative to our December projection, both resource utilization and inflation are noticeably higher, 
and, correspondingly, the federal funds rate path from the intercept -adjusted inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule that we use in  our baseline forecast  rises more steeply than in the December Tealbook .

1 The downward revision to the unemployment rate (and the upward revision to the output gap) is somewhat 
smaller than would be expected given the upward revision to GDP growth, because we assume that the Tax Cut and 
Jobs Act  will boost potential output growth over the next few years. In addition , with the labor market very tight, 
more of the increased demand for labor is being met by higher labor force participation  than is typical, mitigating 
somewhat the decline in the unemployment rate.

  KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
 The BBA 2018 became law on February 9.  The legislation suspends the debt 
limit until the spring of next year  and includes an agreement t o significantly 
increase federal government sp ending over the medium term.  (Fo r further 
information on this budget legis lation, including its effects o n real activity, see 
the box “The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.”) 
o We project that the increase i n government outlays caused by th e BBA 
2018 will persist for five years and meaningfully increase gove rnment 
debt relative to our projecti on in the January Tealbook. 
o We continue to assume that in fiv e years, confronted with an elevated and 
rising debt-to-GDP ratio, fiscal policymakers will begin to ena ct deficit 
reduction measures that graduall y bring annual deficits back to  sustainable 
levels.  However, with larger deficits to tackle, we anticipate  that the 
necessary budget adjustment will take longer than previously as sumed, 
further pushing up the stock of gove rnment debt relative to our  previous 
projection. 
 We estimate that discretionar y policy actions across all levels  of government 
boosted aggregate demand by less than ¼ percentage point in 201 7, exclusive 
of any multiplier effects and offsets from reactions in interes t rates and the 
dollar.  However, we expect the i mpetus from policy actions to step up going 
forward, raising the growth rate  of real GDP by ½ percentage point in 2018, 
¾ percentage point in 2019, and ½ pe rcentage point in 2020.  Roughly one-
half of that medium-term impetus is due to the recent tax cuts;  about one-
quarter is due to the rece nt spending legislation.  
 Federal government operations are funded through March 23.  We assume the 
Congress will pass appropriati ons in time to avoid significant disruption to 
government operations.1 
                                                 
1 A lapse of appropriations that results in a short-term shutdow n of the federal government would 
have only minor implications for the outlook.  For example, the  staff estimated that the 16-day shutdown in 
October 2013 reduced GDP growth ¼ percentage point in the fourt h quarter of that year a nd increased it by

 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018  
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (BBA 2018) was signed into law on February 9 .  The legislation  
(1) includes  an agreement to increase the  level of discretionary budget authority by roughly 
½ percent of GDP  in both fiscal year 2018 and fiscal 2019  relative to our projection in the January 
Tealbook, (2) suspends the debt ceiling until March 2019, and  (3) authorizes an additional $90 billion 
in disaster relief funding .1  Although the BBA 2018 sets higher caps on budget levels, the additional 
spending is not authorized until the Congress pass es fiscal 2018 and 2019 appropriation bills 
consistent with these levels.  In ord er to provide the Congress with enough time to pass the 
fiscal 2018 appropriation bills , the BBA 2018 includes a temporary funding patch for the government 
through March 23 .  
To project  the effects  on aggregate demand  of increases in budget authority consistent with  the 
BBA  2018, it is necessary to forecast  how quickly government purchases, which we assume pass 
dollar- for-dollar into aggregate demand, will respond to the  increase in budget authority.  Within a 
fiscal year, government agenc ies generally  sign contracts  for goods and services that commit to 
spending that year’s budget authority.  However, a significant share of the spending on goods and 
services typically occurs in subsequent fiscal year s.  Although w e estimate the timing of spending 
using generic  budget authority spendout  rate  estimates  from both the Congressional Budget 
Office (CBO) and the Department  of Defense  (DOD) , we assume a slower spendout rate for two 
reasons :  (1) In this instance, agencies will receive the increase in budget authority ro ughly halfway 
through the current  fiscal year, and (2) it appears that the response of government purchases to 
recent budget deals has been slower than the generic estimates from the CBO and the DOD.   
Consequently, we project  a three- year phase- in period  (with little effect in the first half of this 
year), whereas the CBO analysis implies a two- year phase- in.2  
We estimate that the direct boost to aggregate demand from the increase in federal budget 
authority associated with the BBA 2018 will increase the level of real GDP a little more than 
½ percent by the end of 2020 (rightmost column, line 2 of the table).  Additional impetus will occur 
as a consequence of the usual multiplier effects, shown in line 3, but interest rates will also be higher and the dollar will be stronger (line 4).   All told, we estimate that the BBA 2018 will boost 
the level of real GDP ½ percent by the end of 2020 (rightmost column, line 1).

  Monetary Policy 
 The inertial version of the Taylo r (1999) rule that we use to set the path of 
monetary policy calls for the f ederal funds rate to rise 1.5 pe rcentage points 
this year, with further incr eases averaging around 1.2 percentage points over 
the next two years.  These i ncreases bring the rate up to 5.0 p ercent in the 
fourth quarter of 2020. 
 The SOMA portfolio continues to s hrink as securities are redeem ed in a 
manner consistent with the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum to th e Policy 
Normalization Principles and Pla ns and with the process initiat ed in October 
2017.  
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise significantly o ver the medium 
term, from an average of 2.8 percen t in the current quarter to 4.5 percent by 
the end of 2020, 0.2 percentage point higher than in our January 
projection.  The upward revision t o the path for the 10-year Tr easury yield 
primarily reflects a higher term premium that is a consequence of the larger 
projected accumulation of federal government debt.  
 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate  and the triple-B corporate bond  rate are also 
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term.  The paths  for these two 
interest rates were revised up mo stly in line with revisions to  the path of the 
10-year Treasury yield.    
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are projected to e nd the current quarter about 2 percent lower 
than in the January Tealbook.  B eyond the current quarter, we p roject stock 
prices to rise at an average a nnual rate of ¾ percent, broadly similar to our 
previous projection.   
 We expect annual house price growth to slow from 5¾ percent las t year to an 
average of about 3¾ percent over th e next three years, as inter est rates rise. 
                                                 
an equal amount in the following quarter.  This estimate embodi es our judgment that t here were no material 
effects on private investment or consumption due to reduced con fidence or increased uncertainty.

  Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
 Real GDP in the foreign economies continued to grow at a 2¾ percent annual 
pace in the fourth quarter.  This reading is about ¼ percentage point softer 
than expected in the January T ealbook, reflecti ng downward surprises in 
several economies, including Can ada, Japan, and Korea.  Strong indicators 
thus far for the first quarter , along with the projected streng thening of U.S. 
growth, suggest that foreign economic activity will rise a robu st 3 percent in 
2018, with the pace slowing thereafter, settling to around its potential pace of 
2¾ percent in 2020. 
 Since the January Tealbook, the  broad nominal dollar has appreciated 
1 percent.  However, excluding th e more than 99 percent devalua tion of the 
bolivar announced by the Venezuel an government, the broad dolla r has 
depreciated ¼ percent.2  We expect the broad real dol lar to appreciate at an 
annual rate of about 2 percent th rough the forecast period as m arket 
expectations for the federal f unds rate move up toward the staf f forecast.  Our 
projection for the real dollar at the end of the forecast horizon is about 
¾ percent higher relative to t he January Tealbook, but, excludi ng the dramatic 
depreciation of the bolivar, the  broad dollar would be about ½ percent lower.  
Oil and Commodity Prices 
 Swings in oil and metals prices mirrored those in equity market s.  Oil prices 
have come under additional downward pressure in recent weeks fr om rapidly 
increasing U.S. crude oil production.3  The spot price of Brent crude oil closed 
most recently at $64 per barrel, $5 pe r barrel lower than at th e time of the 
January Tealbook.  The price of t he Brent December 2020 futures  contract fell 
$3 per barrel, to $57 per barrel.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Real GDP is now estimated to have  increased at an annual rate o f 3 percent in the 
fourth quarter of last year, about ½ percentage point slower than in our previous 
projection.  Furthermore, softe r-than-expected incoming indicat ors for consumer 
                                                 
2 The bolivar has a weight of 0.15 percent in the broad nominal dollar index. 
3 Domestic oil production is at an all-time high, having recentl y surpassed the previous high-water 
mark recorded in November 1970.

this year to 2½ percent, roughly ½ p ercentage point lower than in the January Tealbook.4  
However, conditions in the labor  market have tightened by more than we had expected. 
In forming our overall assessment  of the current cyclical position of the economy, we 
balanced the weaker spending indi cators against the continued strong performance of the 
labor market.  As a result, output  is estimated to currently be  1½ percent above its 
potential level, little changed fro m our previous projection. 
 After increasing 4¼ percent in the  fourth quarter, real PCE is now expected to 
rise only 1½ percent in the first quarter—1 percentage point lo wer than in our 
previous projection.  The sluggi sh pace of first-quarter consumption growth 
reflects a sharp deceleration in non -auto retail sales followin g a surge in this 
spending category at the end of las t year; it also reflects a d ecline in motor 
vehicle sales following strong f ourth-quarter demand induced by  hurricane 
damage and aggressive incentives .  Apart from these transitory adjustments, 
though, the fundamentals underpinning consumer demand remain so und; most 
important, the ongoing strengthening  in the labor market is con tinuing to 
bolster incomes and confidence.  Moreover, the boost to paychec ks from the 
recently enacted tax legisla tion should soon begin showing thro ugh to 
spending.  All told, we expect gr owth in consumer spending to pick up again 
in the second quarter.5 
 Business investment in equipment and intangibles (E&I) is estim ated to have 
risen 6¾ percent last year—an increase that likely reflected im proved 
expectations for profit growth a s well as a payback from moribu nd E&I 
spending in 2016.  Despite apparen tly slowing in the current qu arter, E&I is 
expected to post another soli d gain this year, supported by a s trengthening 
economy, ebullient business sentiment, and a further step-up in  expectations 
for after-tax profit growth.  In addition, spending on nonresid ential structures 
rose 5 percent last year.  We expect a similar increase this year, consistent 
                                                 
4 The downward revision to first-half PCE growth is concentrated  in categories of consumer 
spending for which we find no evidence of residual seasonality.  
5 We expect that data in the Febr uary retail sales release, whic h we will receive on the Wednesday 
prior to the FOMC meeting, will be held down by a two-week dela y in federal income tax refunds, which 
will restrain household spending i n February and provide an off setting boost in March.  This pattern, which 
should leave little imprint on the quarter as a whole, reflects  antifraud regulations, first implemented last 
year, that prohibit the IRS from  issuing refunds on tax returns  claiming either the earned income tax credit 
or the additional child tax cre dit before February 15.

  with favorable near-ter m indicators, such as the architectural billings index 
and the count of drilli ng rigs in operation.   
 We project that residential investment will decline slightly, o n net, over the 
first half of this year follo wing a modest 2½ percent increase last year.  More 
generally, smoothing through the con siderable volatility in the se expenditures, 
we anticipate that housing investment will creep up this year, held back by 
higher mortgage interest rates and a constrained supply of labo r and 
developable lots. 
 Government purchases edged up last year, and we expect a simila r lethargic 
pace of growth in the first half of this year.  Thereafter, we anticipate more 
substantial increases due to the BBA 2018.  
 Imports rebounded from the weakness seen earlier in 2017 and ro se 14 percent 
in the fourth quarter—the largest  increase in seven years.  In the current 
quarter, import growth is projected to moderate to 2¼ percent.  Exports are 
also projected to decelerate i n the current quarter, rising 2¾ percent, after 
increasing 7 percent in the fourth quarter.  All told, net expo rts are expected to 
be about neutral for real GDP growth in the first quarter of 20 18 after 
imposing a significant drag in t he final quarter of last year. 
 Gains in manufacturing output have been tepid in recent months,  but the data 
in hand suggest production rose sh arply in February.  Moreover,  the national 
and regional surveys of manuf acturing activit y are quite upbeat, with most 
new orders indexes at or close to five-year highs.  All told, m anufacturing 
output is expected to increas e at a solid pace of about 3½ perc ent in the first 
half of the year, up a touch f rom the January Tealbook.  
Over the medium term, we antic ipate that expansionary fiscal po licy and strong 
foreign growth will buoy aggregat e demand.  In light of general ly accommodative 
financial conditions curren tly and very high rates of projected resource utilization, 
monetary policy is expected to tighten further.  Overall, real GDP growth is forecast to 
slow steadily from 3 percent in 2018 to 2 percent in 2020. 
 Compared with the January proj ection, the growth rates of GDP i n our 
medium-term projection are, on ba lance, a little stronger as th e positive effects

  of the new federal spending leg islation are partially offset by  financial 
conditions that are a bi t less accommodative.   
 Moreover, with resource utiliza tion becoming exceptionally tigh t by 2019, we 
now judge that supply constraints will begin to attenuate the t ransmission of 
increased aggregate demand into increased output.  Consistent w ith that 
notion and as we discuss later , we have also pushed up the rate  of consumer 
price inflation and wage growth slightly at the end of our projection.  
 With real GDP growth expected to o utpace potential growth throughout the 
medium-term projection period, res ource utilization tightens fu rther.  At the 
end of 2020, real GDP is projected to exceed its potential level by 3½ percent, 
¼ percentage point m ore than in the January Tealbook.   
 With the federal government exp ected to run historically large and rising 
deficits over the medium term , national saving is projected to trend downward 
as a share of GDP.  Nevertheless , private investment trends upw ard as a share 
of the economy, with the gap be tween domestic investment and na tional 
saving financed by inflows  of foreign capital. 
 The box “Does Rising Concentration Mean U.S. Markets Are Less 
Competitive?” explores the interpretation of the significant in crease in 
business concentration over the past two decades. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
Taken together, the two employmen t reports received since the January Tealbook 
were stronger than we had expect ed and indicate that labor mark et conditions have 
continued to tighten.   
 Payroll employment rose about 240,000 in January and 310,000 in  February, 
about 90,000 more than expected, on  average, and substantially above the 
range of 90,000 to 120,000 per month that we estimate to be con sistent with 
both an unchanged unemployment rate  and labor force participation declining 
in parallel with its  trend path.  Employers have added an average of around 
210,000 payroll jobs per month over the past six months, and we expect a 
roughly similar pace of gains th rough the second quarter.

 Does Rising Concentration Mean U.S. Markets Are Less Competitive?  
The production of goods and services  in the United States  has become more concentrated in 
recent years.  Figure 1 report s the change in the share of revenue attributable to the top 50 firms 
in selected sectors since the late 1990s.  This share has risen in most sectors, with particularly 
large increases  in transportation and warehousing, retail trade, finance, and wholesale trade.  A 
natural question is whether  rising concentration means less competition and more market power.  
In addition to higher prices and lower output, rising market power could mean restrained investment  and increased  barriers to firm entry , which  could be contributing to low productivity 
growth and could ultimately make the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment less favorable for monetary policymakers.  Moreover, increased monopsony power in labor markets 
could slow the growth of labor income.  However, rising concentration  need not imply rising 
market power and  might instead reflect improvements in efficiency or consumer choice, and 
researchers have not yet shown conclusively that market power is on the rise.    
Concentration measures alone may not be informative about market power for several reasons.  
First, competition generally occurs within narrow industries and, in many cases, limited geographic areas, while most discussions of concentration focus on broad sectoral and national 
aggregat es.  Second, measures of concentration do not necessarily reveal the extent to which a 
market or industry is immune to competition from potential entrants.  Third, growth of dominant firms may reflect changes in consumer tastes , technology , or scale econom ies that improve 
efficiency and benefit  consumers.  For example, consolidation in  retail and wholesale trade during  
the 1990s reflected the rise of highly efficient  retail chains and distributors that reduced prices 
and increased product availability.
1  By contrast, evidence from manufacturing does suggest that 
consolidation driven by merger activity in recent decades reduced competition.2

 Ideally , we would look at direct measures of market power rather than indirect indicators such as 
concentration, but  market power cannot be directly observed.  Instead, researchers must study 
profits or estimated price markups  as indicators of market power.  The estimated share of 
aggregate output accruing to economic profits does appear to have risen  recently , as seen in  
figure 2 , as have some other profit measures .3  A rising profit share may indicate  increased pricing 
power and reduced competition, or it may merely indicate that industries with higher average 
profit shares  have grown faster than lower- profit industries.  As for markups over marginal costs , 
these  are difficult to estimate because we cannot  observe marginal costs and must  rely on 
restrictive assumptions from stylized models.  R ecent research  using one methodology estimates  
that markups  over the cost of goods sold  have risen strongly (the red  line in figure 3) .4  However, 
our own analysis shows that this finding is not robust to reasonable changes in methods and assumptions .  Moreover, another study that uses a broader measure of variable costs  that  
includes marketing and management expenses finds only a modest increase in markups over the same period  (the black line).
5  Importantly, both  of these markup measures can appear to rise for 
reasons other than increases in market power, such as increased product quality or changes in 
firms’ cost structure that improve product development or distribution .6  Finally, further 
investigation shows that the rise of estimated markups is primarily occurring in sectors t hat have 
seen smaller gains  in concentration,  such as education and accommodation and food services , 
which  cast s further doubt on concentration as a market power indicator.   
In sum, the implications of greater concentration  for market power and consumer pricing remain 
highly uncertain .  Much of the research that has explored these effects has come out in the past 
year—some even in recent weeks —so this debate is still open and developing.

   In the household survey, the unemployment rate was unchanged at  4.1 percent 
in February as the labor for ce participation rate jumped 0.3 pe rcentage point 
to 63.0 percent.  We expect the unemployment rate to drift lowe r in the 
months ahead and to average 3.9 pe rcent in the second quarter, a bit higher 
than in the January Tealbook.   
 We now expect the LFPR to fall bac k somewhat in the months ahead, but our 
second-quarter projection, at  62.8 percent, is nonetheless 0.1 percentage point 
above our previous forecast.  All told, the employment-to-population ratio is 
expected to continue tre nding upward in the near term.  
 Overall, across a wide range of indicators—including broader measures of 
labor underutilization such as U- 6, surveys of consumers and bu sinesses, data 
on job openings, and initial claims for unemployment insurance— the labor 
market appears tight. 
We expect the labor market to ti ghten further over the medium term. 
 Total payroll employment gains are expected to move up from an average 
monthly pace of about 180,000 last year to 210,000 this year as  real output 
growth steps up.  Payroll growth is then expected to gradually slow, reaching 
170,000 in 2020, as GDP decelerates.  Relative to the January Tealbook, we have marked up payroll gains in 2019 and 2020 by an average of 10,000 per 
month.  
 We project the unemployment rate to decline roughly ½ percentag e point this 
year—similar to the declin e in 2017—and to reach 3.5 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  The jobless rate m oves down further in 2019, ending the year at 
3.1 percent, and then moves sideways in 2020.  The projection f or the 
unemployment rate at the e nd of 2020 is 0.1 percentage point lo wer than in 
the January Tealbook; if that projection is borne out, the unem ployment rate 
would be at its lowest record ed level since October 1953.   
 The LFPR is projected to end t his year at 62.7 percent and then  hold steady 
through 2020, as sustained job gains and rising real wages continue to draw 
individuals into the labor for ce while also slowing outflows.  At the end of 
2020, the LFPR is 0.6 percentage point above our estimate of it s trend level.

   We have continued to assume that, in an extremely tight labor m arket, a 
larger-than-usual amount of the i mprovement in labor market con ditions over 
the medium term will manifest in a higher LFPR and workweek rat her than in 
a lower unemployment rate.6   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Inflation has continued to run be low 2 percent, with total PCE prices rising 
1.7 percent over the 12 months e nding in January and core price s increasing 1.5 percent.  
That said, the monthly readings  over the past six months have b een consistent with our 
expectation that inflation will move up to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent objective.  For 
example, total PCE price infla tion has averaged 3.0 percent over that period, overall core 
inflation has averaged 2.0 percent, and market-based core PCE inflation has averaged 
1.8 percent.  Each of these figures  is up markedly from six mon ths earlier.  Moreover, we 
continue to expect that the idio syncratic factors that held dow n inflation last year will 
dissipate this year.  (The box “Medical Prices:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects” examines the drivers of muted medical price inflation in recent years and 
possible future developments.) 
 On a 12-month change basis, core PCE inflation is projected to step up from 
1.5 percent in January to 1.8 per cent in March, as the unusual decline in core 
prices in March of last year dr ops out of the calculation.  Cor e inflation is then 
expected to edge up further over the course of the second quart er, reaching 
1.9 percent in June.   
 Similarly, the 12-month change in total PCE price inflation is projected to 
climb to 2 percent in March and t o 2.2 percent by midyear.  Thereafter, total 
inflation falls back a bit, moving more into line with core inf lation by the end 
of the year, as consumer  energy prices decline. 
 We expect core import prices to increase at a 3 percent pace in  the first half of 
2018—up from only 1½ percent in the second half of 2017—support ed by 
earlier dollar weakness and recent commodity price increases.  We project 
core import price inflation to slow to a 1 percent pace in the second half, 
                                                 
6 Were we to maintain our usual O kun’s law relati onship, the une mployment rate at the end of the 
projection would be ¼ percentage point lower.

  consistent with moderate forei gn inflation, a gradually appreci ating dollar, and 
slowly declining commodity prices.  
 On balance, longer-term inflation expectations from survey- and market-based 
measures have moved little since January and continue to accord  with our 
view that these expectations are relatively stable.  Median 10- year inflation 
expectations for PCE prices in the Survey of Professional Forec asters held 
steady at 2.0 percent in the first quarter, median expectations  over the next 
5 to 10 years from the Michigan s urvey were stable at 2.5 perce nt in February, 
and the 3-year-ahead measure of  inflation expectations in the F ederal Reserve 
Bank of New York’s Survey of Cons umer Expectations returned to 2.9 
percent in February after e dging down to 2.8 percent in January.  Finally, the 
TIPS-based measure of 5-to-10-y ear-forward inflation compensati on moved a 
touch higher over the intermeeting period.  
We continue to expect consumer  price inflation to step up over the medium term.     
 Core PCE price inflation is pr ojected to rise from 1.5 percent in 2017 to 
1.9 percent in 2018 as the transito ry factors that had been sup pressing 
inflation abate and resource ut ilization continue s to tighten.  Core inflation 
then moves up further, reaching 2.2 percent in 2020, as a subst antial further 
tightening of the economy and a gr adual increase in our judgmen tal 
underlying inflation trend more th an offset restraint from core  import prices.   
 Total PCE price inflation also r ises over the next few years, f rom 1.8 percent 
this year to 2.1 percent in 2020.  Ove r the medium term, consumer energy 
prices are projected to drift down. 
 Relative to the January Tealbook, the forecasts for both core a nd total PCE 
price inflation are up 0.1 per centage point in 2020.  These revisions reflect the 
tighter labor markets in this  projection, as well as our view t hat the same 
supply constraints that attenua te the transmission of aggregate  demand into 
output in an economy running at extremely high rates of utiliza tion will also 
result in slightly hi gher inflation.

 Medical Prices:  Recent Developments  and Future Prospects  
Medical price inflation—as  measured  using PCE price indexes—has  slowed from an average  
annual pace of 3¼ percent before the Great Recession  to 1¾ percent in recent years.1  The 
deceleration  has received  scrutiny because of  the considerable  weight (25 percent) of  medical 
prices in core PCE.  In this discussion,  we examine the  recent drivers of  medical prices  and 
possible future developments.  
As shown in  figure 1, medical prices  currently  contribute  around 0.4 percentage point to core  PCE 
price inflation, about ¼ percentage point  less than  during the few years  preceding  the Great 
Recession.   The slowdown  can be attrib uted to a decline  in medical services  inflation (the blue 
bars).2  Medical goods prices (the red bars) have a smaller weight, and  their contribution  appears 
roughly stable over time,  with temporary  fluctuations largely  driven by the rate  of introduction  of 
new generic drugs.  
Two main hypotheses  have been advanced  to explain the deceleration of  medical services  prices:  
(1) business  cycle fluctuations  and (2) se ctor‐specific structural  factors, including  legislative  
changes.  Regarding  the first item, economic  downturns  put downward  pressure  on medical 
prices via several channels.   For instance,  as can be seen in figure 2, economic  contractions  tend 
to put downward  pressure  on wages in the health‐care sector, which  feeds through to PCE 
medical services  inflation via lower costs  for providers  and lower Medicare  reimbursement rates.3

1 The 3¼ percent and 1¾ percent figures  refer to the average annual change in PCE medical prices (market‐ 
and non‐market‐based medical services plus medical goods) over the periods from 2004:Q1 to 2007:Q4 and from 
2014:Q1 to 2017:Q4, respectively.  
2 The current weights  of medical services (market‐ plus non‐market‐based)  and medical goods 
(pharmaceutical  products)  in core  PCE are 21 percent and 4 percent,  respectively.  
3 The employment  cost index  is a major source of data used by the Centers for Medicare  and Medicaid  
Services to determine  the annual adjustment  to Medicare  reimbursement  for health‐care services providers.   For 
spillovers  from Medicare  reimbursement  rates  to private providers,  see Jeffrey Clemens and Joshua D. Gottlieb

     In addition,  recessions  tend to reduce  the demand for medical  services,  which in turn tends to put 
downward  pressure  on medical prices.
4 
Sector‐specific structural  factors have also contributed  to the recent slowdown.   For instance,  
budget stress at the state  level has restrained  the growth of  Medicaid  reimbursement  rates.5  
Further, legislation passed  in recent years has  reduced both the level and  the growth rate of  
Medicare  reimbursement rates.  Important pieces  of legislation  include the  Affordable  Care Act, 
which changed  starting in 2012 the way Medicare’s  payments  to hospitals  are calculated;  the 
Budget Control  Act of 2011, which  included  a one‐time 2 percent cut to Medicare  payments;  and 
the Medicare  Access and  CHIP Reauthor ization Act (the 2015 “doc fix”), which overhauled  the 
way Medicare  payments  to physicians  are determined. 
The staff projects inflation in the medium term based on macro relationships  in the economy  and 
not by building up sector forecasts.  That said, we  have implicitly  assumed  a gradual  acceleration  
of medical prices  as the economy  tightens further, but  not a return to pre‐recession rates,  as 
structural  factors are likely to persist.   We think the risks around our forecast are balanced.   On 
the one hand, if inflation responds  in a nonlinear  fashion to slack, then medical prices  could be 
among the pieces that would rise more than we expect.  On  the other hand, recent structural  
reforms could restrain increases  in medical prices  by more than we implicitly  assume, in which 
case core inflation could rise more slowly than we anticipate,  all else being equal.6

Usage,” NBER Working  Paper Series 15843 (Cambridge,  Mass.:  National  Bureau of Economic  Research,  March), 
www.nber.org/papers/w15843 . 
5 Medicaid ‐to‐Medicare  fee ratios for physicians  declined from 72 percent to 66 percent between  2008 and 
2011, as estimated  in Stephen Zuckerman  and Dana Goin (2012), “How Much Will Medicaid  Physician  Fees for

6 The staff assumption  about  the underlying  trend of core PCE price  inflation is informed  by a suite of models 
that suggest trend core PCE inflation has remained  relatively  constant  at around 1¾ percent over the past

  The incoming data on labor compens ation have been mixed relativ e to our 
expectations, but, overall, we con tinue to view these measures as consistent with a 
gradual acceleration over the past few years.   
 After sizable monthly increases  in average hourly earnings in b oth December 
and January, the February reading was modest.  Over the 12 months ending in 
February, average hourly earnings rose 2.6 percent, somewhat st ronger than 
we had projected in the Januar y Tealbook.  We expect the 12-mon th change to 
edge up to 2.7 percent by June—a bout 0.2 percentage point highe r than in the 
comparable periods 12 and 24 months earlier.   
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker poste d a 
reading of 3.0 percent in Januar y, near the bottom of its range  over the past 
couple of years but up from before then.  
 Compensation per hour in the busine ss sector is estimated to have risen 
2.7 percent over the four quarters of 2017—similar to its avera ge pace of 
growth over the preceding five  years and about as anticipated.  Hourly labor 
compensation growth is projecte d to step up to 4 percent by mid -2019 amid a 
tight labor market. 
 The employment cost index (EC I) rose 2.6 percent over the 12 mo nths ending 
in December, modestly weaker than we had anticipated.  Nonethel ess, the ECI 
has accelerated relative to its pace in recent years, and the December reading 
was the largest Q4-ove r-Q4 increase since 2007. 
 In response to the tighter resour ce utilization in this project ion, as well as our 
forecast for nascent supply constraints, we have slightly revis ed up our 
medium-term projections for com pensation per hour and the ECI. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment wil l be 
4.7 percent and that potential  output growth will be 1.7 percen t in the longer 
run. 
 We have maintained our assumption t hat the real equilibrium fed eral funds 
rate will be ½ per cent in the longer run.  However, in response  to the increase

  in the long-run debt-to-GDP ra tio caused by the recent federal spending 
legislation, we have raised the  assumed term premium on 10-year  Treasury 
yields in the longer run by an a dditional 25 basis points in th is Tealbook; this 
adjustment to the term premium is the same size as the term pre mium 
adjustment we made in the prev ious Tealbook because of the tax legislation.  
As a result, the nominal yield on 10 -year Treasury securities i n the longer run 
is now assumed to be 3.4 percent.  
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is projected to have retu rned to a 
normal size by mid-2021.  
 Real GDP growth slows furth er to about 1½ percent in 2021 and s lightly 
below 1 percent in 2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral 
level throughout this period.  The  unemployment rate moves up g radually 
from 3.1 percent in 2020 toward i ts assumed natural rate.  
 PCE price inflation hovers around 2.2 percent from 2021 through  2023 before 
slowly edging back down to the Committee’s long-run objective i n later years. 
 With output materially above its po tential level and inflation slightly above 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to 
roughly 5¼ percent at the e nd of 2021—about 2¾ percentage point s higher 
than its assumed long-run value.  T hereafter, the federal funds rate moves 
gradually back towar d its long-run value.

 International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The foreign economies ended the year on solid footing, and momentum looks 
strong going into 2018.  We now estimate that real GDP abroad rose 2.7 percent at an 
annual rate in the fourth quarter, a bit faster than  in the third.  This pace was slightly 
softer than we had anticipated in January, but the downward surprises appear primarily related to factors that we expect to be transitory.  Indeed, more-recent data point to an 
upbeat start to this  year, and we see foreign growth picking up to 3 percent this quarter.  
Thereafter , growth abroad tapers off a bit to 2¾ percent in 2019 and 2020, about its 
potential pace.    
As in the United States, f inancial markets abroad have been volatile, but we have 
not built much  drag from th is volatility  into our baseline forecast.  So far, asset price 
declines have been concentrated in equity markets, which have limited links to spending 
in many foreign economies, and overall financial conditions continue to be supportive of 
grow th.  Nevertheless, with asset valuations stretched, it is not difficult to imagine a 
broader, deeper, and more sustained selloff.  We explore this possibility in the “Global Market Cor rection” scenario in the Risks and Uncertaint y section as well as in the  box 
“What Are the Macroeconomic Effects of Global Market Corrections?”  News of U.S. 
tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and reactions by foreign authorities highlights 
another risk—that of a trade war —which would likely depress economic activity both 
domestically and abroad.  Not all risks are to the downside, however.  The buoyant foreign activity could generate a bigger impetus to household and business spending than in our baseline, a possibility explored in the “Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker 
Dollar” alternative scenario  in the Risks and Uncertainty s ection . 
In the advanced foreign economies , aggregate headline inflation appears set to 
remain a touch above 2 percent in the first quarter , temporarily boosted by the pass -
through from past increases in oil prices.  However, i n the euro area and , especially , in 
Japan, core inflation is expected to remain  quite subdued and looks to rise only gradually 
over the next few years.  Against this backdrop, we continue to assume  that monetary 
policy in both of these economies  will remain highly accommodative , with the European 
Central Bank (ECB) waiting until next year to raise its interest rates .  By contrast, 
inflation in Canada and the United Kingdom has been noticeably higher, and we expect 
policy rates in  these countries to rise more rapidly than in the euro area and Japan.

 What Are the Macroeconomic Effects of G lobal Market Corrections ?  
Global asset valuation s remain elevated, raising concerns  about the risk s posed by a  broad -
based correction in global financial markets.  We provide an overview of the channels through 
which a decline in asset prices may affect economic activity.  We then present empirical 
estimates of the domestic and foreign effects of a global correction  in equity prices, sovereign 
yields , and corporate borrowing costs . 
One key channel through which market corrections may weigh on  economic activity is the 
familiar “wealth effect” :  Lower stock prices reduce household wealth , which causes 
households to pare back  consumption .  A second channel is through the user cost of capital:  
Lower stock prices make investment in new plant and equipment more expensive  relative to 
the market value of firms, thus depressing  business investment .   
Econometric  studies find relatively modest  and short -lived effects of changes in stock prices on 
consumption and investment.1  For example, in the United States , a $1.00 decline in stock 
market wealth  only causes aggregate consumption  to decline about  $0.03 .  Accordingly, equity 
price declines that do not spill over to other financial markets —including the correction 
observed in early February, w hich was short  lived and concentrated in the stock market —are 
unlikely to produce sizable adverse effects .  
Equity price corrections that are coupled with tighter c redit conditions and higher borrowing 
spreads , however, could exert much more adverse effects through “financial accelerator” 
channels in which falling asset prices tighten borrowers’ collateral constraints, market liquidity 
is eroded, and  highly  leveraged  financial institutions become more vulnerable.  Broad -based 
corrections may also lead to declines in household and business confidence and  to flight -to-
safety  flows that induce an appreciation of the dollar.  These effects can be amplified in a world 
of highly integrated financial markets.2  
Vector autoregressive ( VAR ) models are well suited to capture the channels  through which  
asset price correction s affect the economy, including the interaction of real and financial 
variables .  Accordingly, we quantify  the effects of a broad -based  and persistent  global market 
correction through the estimation of a quarterly VAR model .  The variables include global 
corporate bond spreads, g lobal equity prices, g lobal 10 -year government yields, the OECD  index 
of consumer confidence , global policy rates , the b road real dollar, U.S. GDP, and f oreign GDP .3

We use the VAR to simulate the effects of shock s to global financial variables that  lead to a 
decline in equity prices of 20 percent, a rise in corporate spreads of 50 basis points, and a rise in 10-year government yields of 20 basis points , all within one year.
   Such shock s die out  slowly 
over time and bring asset valuations from currently elevated levels to close to the ir historical 
median, though without  inducing the widespread disruptions in financial markets that occurred 
during the Global Financial Crisis .4 
Panels 1, 2, and 3 present the VAR -based estimates alongside simulations from the “Global 
Market Correction” scenario described in the Risks and Uncertainty  section and based on the 
staff’s multicountry SIGMA model.  The SIGMA scenario embeds similar conditioning 
assumptions for the financial variables.  
In the VAR  (blue lines), U.S. and foreign GDP fall 1 percent  below their baseline values  after one 
year and remain depressed for several years , the dollar appreciates nearly 3 percent , and global 
consumer confidence (not shown) drops substantially .  The SIGMA -based scenario  (red dots)  is 
largely within the 70 percent confidence interval of the estimated VAR.  In SIGMA, th e 
interaction between financial conditions and consumer confidence is captured through 
additional shocks to spending . 
Both SIGMA and  the VAR results support the idea that a global market correction could produce 
sizable macroeconomic effects.  However, the confidence intervals around the VAR estimates  
suggest a  significant degree of uncertainty  about the overall size of the effects .  Of course, it is 
possible that a deeper and more prolonged correction in asset prices  could cause much worse 
macroeconomic outcomes, especially  in economies with limited space for appropriate policy 
responses .

We expect the implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and Bipartisan 
Budget Act  of 2018 for our international outlook, apart from the ir effect s through U.S. 
demand, to be limited , as discussed for the TCJA in the box “International Aspects of the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro area.  T he recovery continued  apace across the region.  R eal GDP rose a solid 
2.4 percent in the fourth quarter, with both domestic and external demand continuing 
to contribute sizably to the expansion.  Given the positive tone of recent economic 
indicators, especially the PMIs, we expect growth to remain at about 2½ percent this  
quarter before decelerating to 1 ¾ percent in 2020, a bit above its potential rate .  
Compared with the January Tealbook, this path is a touch higher  this year , reflecting 
the positive effects of stronger- than-expected  incoming  data.  However,  the 
surprisingly strong performance of antiestablishment parties in the Italian general 
elections  creates uncertainties and may weigh on future growth.  
Earlier increases in energy prices are expected to boost headline inflation to almost 
2 percent this quarter .  With retail energy prices stabilizing, we expect headline 
inflation to fall to 1¼  percent by midyear , in line with the current readings of core 
inflation .  Diminishing resource slack should bring inflation back up to 1¾ percent 
by 2020.  At its March 8 meeting, the ECB dropped its explicit commitment to expand 
its asset purchase program should the economic outlook become less favorable.  
Despite this development, given the subdued inflation outlook, we still expect the 
ECB  to continue its asset purchases until the end of 2018 (including tapering beyond 
the announced September end date) , start increas ing its policy rates in the first quarter 
of 2019, and reinvest the proceeds of its purchases for an extended period.  
• United Kingdom.  Real GDP growth slowed t o 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 
2 percent in the third.  Recent economic indicators, such as PMIs and retail sales , 
suggest that growth will remain at about this  pace in the current quarter.  We see 
growth  settling around 1¾ percent, a notch above potential, over the remainder of the 
forecast period, as monetary policy remains stimulative, an acceleration  in real  wages 
supports household spending, and business confidence continues to hold up despite 
Brexit -related uncertainty.  
We expect h eadline inflation to ed ge up to 3¼ percent this quarter, well above the 
BOE’s 2 percent inflation target, still boosted by past sterling depreciation .  With this 
influence on inflation fading , inflation should fall to 2 percent by the end of the

forecast period  but at a slower pace than project ed in the January Tealbook.  Given the 
stronger inflation outlook and the BOE ’s February statement  that “monetary policy 
would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent ,” we 
now assume a less accommodative monetary policy stanc e.1  The Bank R ate should 
rise from its current ½ percent to 1¾ percent by the end of 2020, ending ½ percentage 
point higher than assumed in the January Tealbook. 
• Canada.  R eal GDP expanded 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, a touch above its 
third -quarter  pace.  Although investment jumped, consumption moderated from its 
blistering pace earlier in the year.  Solid incoming economic indicators and 
expectations for robust U.S. growth support our view that growth picks up to nearly 
2½ percent  in the first half  of this year before moving back down to 2 percent (slightly 
above potential)  by 2019. 
Inflation is expected to remain elevated at 2¾ percent in the current quarter, reflecting a surge in retail energy prices in January.  As this temporary boost fades, we expect 
inflation to fall to 2 percent by next year .  As resource utilization continues to 
increase, the Bank of Canada is expected to gradually raise its policy rate from 1.25 percent to 3 percent by mid-2020. 
• Japan.  Real GDP expanded at  a relatively solid 1.6 percent  pace in the fourth quarter 
but was down from the 2.4 percent pace recorded in the third quarter and ½ percentage 
point below our January estimate.  Investment was a bit weaker than expected , but 
household demand picked up noticeably.  The mixed tone of recent data suggests that growth should continue to fall to 1¼ percent this quarter, a tad  slower than in the 
January Tealbook.  Growth should settle to about 1 percent thereafter, abstracting from the swings in activity driven by the planned consumption tax hike in late 2019.   
We project that inflation will decline to 1¼ percent in the first quarter from about 2 percent in the fourth, as the effects of past surges in food and energy prices begin to wane.  Core inflation is expected to come in much lower at ½ percent.  Overall  
inflation should fall to ½ percent in mid -2018 before inching up to a still- low 
1 percent in 2020.  This forecast is slightly weaker in 2018 in response to a stronger

 International Aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  (TCJA) introduces important changes to the U.S. corporate tax 
code, which not only affect the taxation of profits earned in the United States, but also 
the tax treatment of foreign profits of U.S. multinational enterprises (MNEs) .  We review 
key international aspects of the TCJA and provide our initial assessment of their effect.  In 
general, although changes to the tax code were significant, we anticipate that the 
international provisions will have limited effects on the U.S. economy.  That said, many 
aspects of the tax law are still uncertain, and it will take time to sort out their 
implications.   
Before the TCJA, U.S. corpora
tions operated under the highest statutory tax rate in the 
OECD (35 percent) and under a “worldwide” tax system , where foreign profits of U.S. 
corporations were also subject to U.S. tax (net of taxes paid overseas) but only when 
repatriated.  This system incentivized U.S. firms to book and keep profits abroad.  
Pharmaceutical and hig
h-tech firms were able to do this most easily by transferring 
intellectual property rights to foreign affiliates in low-tax jurisdictions.1  By the end of 
2017, U.S. MNEs had accumulated $1.4 trillion in offshore corporate cash holdings that 
was yet to be taxed in the United States.   
Three aspects of the TCJA affect firms’ incentives to book and keep profits abroad :  
(1) the reduction of the statutory corporate tax rate to 21 percent; (2) the shift to a 
territorial system where profits are taxed where they are earned, subject to a global 
minimum tax; and (3) a one-time tax on corporate profits held abroad.2  The one-time tax 
is estimated to raise ar
ound $300 billion, which firms can pay over 10 years.  Once current 
cash holdings are taxed, companies will likely repatriate some of these funds, but how 
much remains an open question.  If the same percentage of offshore funds is repatriated 
now as under the 2004 tax holiday, up to $560 billion could eventually return to the 
United States.3     
The net effects of the oth
er changes to the tax code —the reduction in the tax rate 
coupled with the shift to a territorial system and the minimum global tax —are difficult to 
assess .  The lower tax rate r
educes the incentive for firms to shift profits abroad.  
However, the adoption of a territorial system may encourage even greater shifting of 
profits abr oad going forward by eliminating the penalty for returning funds to the United 
States .  Some foreign tax jurisdictions, including Ireland, where a number of U.S. 
pharmaceuticals and high-tech corporations have transferred their intellectual property 
rights, still have tax rates lower than the United States.  Indeed, the United Kingdom, 
which moved from a worldwide to a territorial system in 2009 , saw greater relocation of 
profits abroad as a result.4  In any event, firms may be hesitant to change where they  
                                                 
1 Another way to shift profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is through transfer pricing, where companies 
use differential pricing for intercompany transactions. 
2 The tax rate is 15.5 percent on liquid assets and 8 percent on illiquid assets. 
3 The 2004 tax holiday, which temporarily reduced the effective tax rate on repatriated earnings to 
5.25 percent, resulted in repatriation over the following year of $312 billion of an estimated $750 billion 
held abroad.

book their profits because of the still considerable uncertainty about the tax policies , 
including the rules for the implementation of the global minimum tax and the potential 
for litigation surrounding some provisions. 
We have not factored in any effect of repatriation flows on the dollar , a key channel 
through which the tax changes could potentially affect our outlook, for two reasons .  
First, estimates suggest that over 90 percent of these holdings are already invested in 
dollar-denominated assets.  Second, as mentioned earlier , we expect that only a fraction 
of the earnings abroad will be repatriated.5 
Additionally, we do not see the repatriation of funds as providing a significant boost to 
U.S. investment, based on the experience of the 2004 tax holiday when the majority of 
repatriated funds were used for stock repurchases.  Indeed, several U.S. firms have 
recently announced plans to repurchase stock.  Overall, the TCJA should increase after-
tax rates of return on investment in U.S. companies.  However, countries such as the 
Netherlands and Japan have already announced plans to cut their corporate tax rates , so 
any relative advantage for the United States as an investment destination could 
be fleeting.  
An additional consideration is that the current pattern of profit shifting likely distorts U.S. 
trade and payments statistics, such that any change in profit shifting stemming from the 
TCJA could have implications for our measured trade balance and investment flows.  For 
example , when a U.S. MNE shifts the rights to its intellectual property to its foreign 
affiliate, exports from the U.S. MNE no longer embody the value of the intellectual 
property, lowering reported exports.  The foreign affiliate receives the licensing fees and 
royalties associated with the use of the intellectual property, and the U.S. MNE records 
these earnings as investment income.   Thus, this form of profit shifting lowers U.S. 
exports and the tra
de balance but raises investment income from abroad.   Based on the 
share of direct investment income earned from low-tax jurisdictions, we estimate profit 
shifting is around $260 billion (1.4 percent of GDP), about half of the U.S. trade deficit in 
2017.6  Were the TCJA to reduce profit shifting, this outcome could raise reported 
exports, the trade balance, 
and GDP.  As noted earlier, however, the response of profit 
shifting to the TCJA is uncertain and likely to be small for some time.  Moreover, profit 
shifting has no effect on the current account, our broadest measure of U.S. international 
transactions, as it only causes misclassification between its main components, the trade 
balance and investment income.

https://doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2017.1214 . 
5 Additionally, offshore funds are not necessarily held abroad, since “offshore” refers to the 
ownership of the funds rather than their actual location.  This fact leads us to expect no significant 
effect of repatriated flows on funding of foreign institutions. 
6 Estimate includes income from Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Singapore, 
Switzerland, Ireland, and income from holding companies in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom 
that enjoy preferential tax treatment. The estimate is an upper bound and is in line with Fatih Guvenen,

yen and a fall in oil prices.  Given the still-subdued inflation outlook, we continue to 
assume that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative.   
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China.   Revisions to the GDP data suggest somewhat more slowing in growth over 
the course of last year, from 7 percent in the first half to 6½ percent in the second, than 
we assessed in January .  The slowdown reflected both tighter credit conditions and 
temporary curbs on production in heavily polluting industries.  By contrast, service-
sector activity  and exports remained  buoyant.  We expect growth to edge up slightly in 
the first half of this year  as production curbs are lifted and exports remain strong.  But 
with the authorities moving to restrain credit growth and tighten fiscal policy, w e see 
growth resuming its gradual downward trend thereafter, falling to about 6 percent by 
2020, in line with potential.   
During the intermeeting period, the Communist Party moved to abolish presidential 
term limits, paving the way for President Xi to remain in power indefinitely.  We 
expect  Xi to work to improve the financial performance of state- owned enterprises 
(SOEs) and rein in financial excess as part of his reform agenda.  However, we see Xi 
retain ing a central role for SOEs in the economy and do not expect  much progress 
toward a more market -oriented system.  
We estimate that inflation will fall to 1¾ percent in the current quarter from 3 percent 
last quarter, reflecting a decline in food and energy inflation.  As this temporary drag 
on inflation fades, we see inflation moving back up to 2½ perce nt later this year  and 
remaining there over the medium term. 
• Other Emerging Asia.  Real GDP growth  in the fourth quarter was 1 percentage point 
lower than we had anticipated in January, dropping to 3¼ percent from a robust 
5¼ percent pace in the third .  Although domestic demand across the region continued 
to chug along at a robust pace, exports, which had surged in the third quarter as the latest generation of smartphones was  launched, slowed more sharply than expected.  
The downside surprise was especially  large for Korea, where a plunge in exports 
drove a small contraction in real GDP.  Recent indicators point to a rebound in the region’s growth to 4½ percent this quarter.  In particular, exports came in strong in January and PMIs remain solid.  Over the m edium term, we expect growth to decline 
to its potential rate of 3¾ percent.

• Mexico.   After a hurricane and earthquakes disrupted activity in the third quarter, 
Mexico’s economy rebounded in the fourth quarter, growing 3.2 percent.  Oil 
production that had been taken offline during the hurricane resumed , and 
manufacturing exports boomed in line with surging U.S. manufacturing production.  
More recently, data suggest that external demand  moderated, leading us to pencil in 
still-solid 3 percent growth this quarter .  The strong U.S. outlook supports our 
expectation  that Mexican growth will remain at about 3 percent  over the remainder of 
the forecast period .  However, we see considerable downside risks to this outlook, as  
tight monetary policy a s well as  uncertainties surrounding the NAFTA negotiations 
and Mexico’s July 2018 presidential election could weigh on demand more heavily 
than we expect . 
Inflation continued to ease, declining on a 12-month basis to 5.3 percent in February  
from a 17 -year high of 6.8 percent in December.  The Bank of Mexico (BOM), driven 
in part by concerns that still- high inflation could unanchor longer- term inflation 
expectations, raised its policy rate 25  basis points to 7½ percent at its February 
meeting.  Next year, as inflation continues to trend down toward the government’s 
3 percent inflation target, we expect the BOM to begin easing policy.  
• Brazil.   Brazil’s already  slow recovery from its deepest recession on record stalled in 
the fourth quarter, with real GDP inching up a paltry 0. 2 percent at an annual rate.  
Household demand stagnated amid double-digit unemployment.  Although fixed investment continued to climb, its  level is still well below the pre-recession peak , and 
considerable skepticism remains over whether policymakers can tackle the country’s 
fiscal and other economic challenges.  We see Brazil’s recovery gaining traction  only 
slowly , with growth moving up to 3 percent by 2019.  However, downside risks are 
considerable ahead of the October presidential election.  
Amid subst antial  economic slack, inflation in January was only 3 percent on a 12-
month basis, near a record low under the inflation-targeting framework.  With 
inflationary pressures quiescent, the Central Bank of Brazil reduced its policy rate to a record low of 6.75 percent in early February.  
• Venezuela .  Venezuela’s severe economic and humanit arian crisis shows no signs of 
abating.  Amid hyperinflation , a collapse in oil production and in oil- related fiscal 
revenues, and a lack of access to international capital ma rkets, t he government of 
President Maduro devalued the official exchange rate in late January by more than 
99 percent against the dollar .  The sharp devaluation brought the exchange rate closer 
to its black market value .

 Financial Market Developments 
Financial markets experienced t urbulence over the intermeeting period.  Volatility 
surged in early February, as the January labor report appeared to trigger some concerns 
about the extent to which infla tion and thus interest rates mig ht ultimately rise.  
Importantly, the turbulence wa s exacerbated by worries over elevated valuations in the 
equity market and by the unwinding  of investment strategies des igned to profit from 
continued low volatility.  Lat er in the period, increased uncer tainty over U.S. trade policy 
weighed on investor sentiment.  O n net, broad equ ity price inde xes decreased, nominal 
Treasury yields rose, and mark et volatility increased notably.   
 
  
 
  
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes  decreased about 3 percent on net.  The VIX, 
after having spiked considerab ly in early February, ended the p eriod at 
17 percent, almost double the averag e level seen over the three  months 
leading up to the Janua ry FOMC meeting.   
 Spreads on investment- and specu lative-grade corporate bonds ov er 
comparable-maturity Treasury secu rities widened 14 basis points and 23 basis 
points on net, respectively.  
 FOMC communications over the pe riod generally reinforced expect ations for 
further gradual rate increas es.  A straight read of market quot es implies that 
the probability of a rate hike at the March FOMC meeting increased to a level 
of near certainty, and that a total increase of about 70 basis points is priced in 
by the end of this year. This section of the T ealbook reflects data t hat were available through March 8.  On 
the morning of March 9, we received the BLS February Employment  Situation report.  
While the increase in payrolls w as well above market expectatio ns, average hourly 
earnings cam e in weaker than exp ected.  The immediate market re action to the report 
was small.  Nominal Treasury yields and the S&P 500 index incre ased slightly, and 
the dollar was little changed.  These changes are not reflected  in the remainder of this 
section, and they do not m aterially a ffect the characterization  of financial market 
developments over the intermeeting period.

   The nominal Treasury yield c urve shifted up, with 2-, 5-, and 1 0-year 
Treasury yields all rising roughly 15 basis points on net.  The rise in nominal 
yields was driven mostly by incre ases in real yields, as carry- adjusted TIPS-
based measures of inflation compe nsation increased only slightl y on net.  
 Treasury bill yields rose signi ficantly amid an increase in bil l supply 
following the enactment of the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 an d the debt 
ceiling suspension.   
 Foreign equity markets generall y tracked broad U.S. equity indexes.  The 
broad dollar appreciated 2¼ per cent over the period, with about  two-thirds of 
this move owing to a massive deva luation of the Venezuelan boli var.    
ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS  
Domestic Developments  
Since the January FOMC mee ting, the S&P 500 index decreased on net about 
3 percent, leaving equity prices  about 2½ percent higher since the beginning of the year.  
Concerns about inflation and the  associated pace of interest ra te increases following the 
release of the BLS January Emplo yment Situation report appeared  to be the trigger for a 
substantial decline in equity prices in the several days after the report.  However, market 
commentaries at that time als o highlighted concerns about the l evel of stock market 
valuations.  Indeed, while cor relations of stock prices and Tre asury yields turned sharply 
negative on the day of the labor report, they turned positive o ver the following week, 
suggesting that concerns over risi ng interest rates were not th e primary driver of the stock 
market declines.  Subsequently, p rices recovered somewhat, thou gh increased uncertainty 
about U.S. trade policy following the announcement in early March of new U.S. import 
tariffs on steel and aluminum we ighed on investor sentiment.  S tock prices decreased 
moderately on the announcement of  the tariffs, but they largely  recovered in 
subsequent days. 
On February 5, one-month-ahead option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 
index—the VIX—rose to its highes t level since 2015, reportedly driven in part by trading 
dynamics (see the box “Unusual Volatility Dynamics on February 5, 2018”).  The VIX 
then partially retraced and e nded the period at about 17 percent, nearly double its average 
level over the few months leadi ng up to the January FOMC meetin g.

 Unusual Volatility Dynamics on February 5, 2018  
On Monday, February 5, t he S&P 500 index fell 4 percent , and option -implied volatility at the 
one- month horizon —the VIX —closed the trading day at 37 percent, its highest level since mid -
2015.  W hile both moves were very large, the sharp increase in the VIX was extraordinary  
(figure 1) .  Treasury yields  also dropped sharply on the day and were highly positively  correlated 
with equity prices ( figure 2).  
The price action accelerated just after 3 p.m., when equity prices and Treasury yields dropped 
sharply and the VIX spiked.  There was no evidence of market infrastructure problems and 
disruptions to trading were limited , but liquidity conditions in Treasury markets changed 
notably , with volumes reportedly rising significantly and order book depth deteriorating.  After 
persisting  for several days , these eff ects  mostly retraced by the end of the intermeeting period. 
Several factors appear to have contributed to the sharp moves in asset prices, including 
concerns about stretched valuations in equity prices and unusually low levels of volatility  as well 
as inve sting strategies that require same- day portfolio rebalancing .  In particular, managers of  
leveraged and inverse volatility -linked exchange- traded products (ETPs) reportedly were forced 
to quickly purchase large volumes of VIX futures late in the trading day as a result of  the earlier 
rise in the VIX.  In addition, equity ETPs that use leveraged and inverse strategies may have 
compounded  the drop in equity prices late in the day by selling equities and equity derivatives.  
Dealers that accommodated these ETP rebalancing transactions may have exacerbated moves 
in underlying equity markets by selling equity futures to hedge their exposures.  Other 
strategies also may have contributed to the increase in volatility, albeit to a lesser extent  on 
February 5, as they typically respond to volatility spikes with some lag.  For example, insurance 
companies’ “managed volatility” funds as well as some  small risk -parity hedge funds and 
commodity trading advisors probably contributed to downward pressure on equity prices over 
the following days by reducing their portfolio allocations to equities in response to the increase 
in volatility.

  Spreads of yields on triple-B-rate d and speculativ e-grade corpo rate bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury secu rities widened 14 basis points  and 23 basis points on 
net, respectively, but remain near  the lower end of their histo rical ranges. 
FOMC communications over the in termeeting period—including the January 
FOMC statement, the January mi nutes, and the Chairman’s semiann ual testimony to the 
Congress—were generally viewed by market participants as signal ing a somewhat 
stronger economic outlook and reinf orcing expectations for furt her gradual increases in 
the target range for the feder al funds rate.  Following the rel ease of the minutes, investors 
noted that most Committee members viewed recent economic data a s suggesting a 
modestly stronger near-term ou tlook than the Committee had anti cipated at the December 
meeting.  In addition, market partic ipants reportedly interpret ed some of the Chairman’s 
comments during his congression al testimony as implying that th e likelihood had 
increased for the median projec tion for the federal funds rate in the March SEP to show 
four rate hikes in 2018 compared w ith the three hikes shown in the December SEP. 
Overall, domestic data releases  over the intermeeting period we re somewhat 
mixed, though market participant s focused on domestic price dat a that came in stronger 
than they had anticip ated.  Specifically, inv estors appeared to  interpret the January 
Employment Situation report’s av erage hourly earnings print as suggesting a potential 
pickup in price pressures.  This view was subsequently reinforced by the January CPI 
release, in which the top-line and core indexes came in above expectations. 
All told, a straight read of  quotes on federal funds futures co ntracts showed that 
the market-implied probability f or the next rate hike occurring  at the March FOMC 
meeting increased to a level of  near certainty.  Conditional on  a March rate hike, the 
probability of another increase in the federal funds rate at th e June FOMC meeting edged 
up to around 75 percent.  A straig ht read of OIS-implied federa l funds rates suggests that 
a total increase of about 70 basi s points is priced in by the e nd of this year, while a staff 
model that adjusts for term premiums implies close to a 100 bas is point increase over the 
same period.  Meanwhile, implied fed eral funds rates for the en d of 2019 and 2020 
moved up somewhat.  
In this context, nominal Tr easury yields on 2-, 5-, and 10-year  securities moved 
up about 15 basis points, on net, ove r the intermeeting period.   Both FOMC 
communications and the higher-th an-expected domestic price data  contributed to the 
increase in yields, as did expect ations for increases in Treasu ry supply following the

  budget agreement in early Febru ary.  (For a discussion of Treas ury yields over the past 
few months, see the box “The Recent Rise in Longer-Term Treasury Yields.”)  Despite a 
discrete upward move following the  January CPI r elease, carry-a djusted TIPS-based 
measures of inflation compensa tion increased only slightly on n et over the intermeeting 
period.   
The February 7 announcement of t he budget deal and the suspensi on of the debt 
ceiling alleviated investor conc erns about near-term bill matur ities and restored a more 
normal shape to the Treasury bill curve.  Treasury bill supply has since increased notably, 
leading to a significant rise in Treasury bill yields, with bot h three- and six-month bill 
yields rising roughly 20 basis points.   
Measures of option-implied volatility on long-term rates rose notably following 
the jump in equity market volat ility on February 5, but they have since mostly retraced.   
Option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS over Treasury yields widened 
6 basis points on net over the in termeeting period.  Investors continue to see limited 
direct effects on asset prices  from the ongoing balance sheet n ormalization. 
Foreign Developments  
Foreign risky asset price moveme nts over the intermeeting perio d largely 
reflected those in the United Sta tes.  The spillover from U.S. markets was concentrated in 
foreign equity markets, where dec lines were sizable and broad b ased, although some 
additional markets for risky asse ts were also affected, with em erging market sovereign 
bond spreads up moderately.  In contrast, longer-term sovereign  yields in AFEs were 
little changed on net.  The broad dollar index increased 2¼ per cent over the period, 
largely driven by dollar appreciati on against AFE currencies an d a massive devaluation 
of the Venezuelan bolivar.  
Foreign equity prices fell shar ply and volatility measures spiked as the U.S. equity 
market sold off.  Equities then partly retraced and volatility subsided, but markets slumped again as news about U.S . tariffs on steel and aluminum weighed on market 
sentiment.  On balance, European, Japanese, and emerging market  equities are down 4 to 
9 percent since late January, m ore than U.S. equity prices.  
In contrast to rising yields in the United States, longer-term AFE sovereign yields 
were little changed on average.  Weaker-than-expected data in C anada weighed on

 The Recent Rise in Longer -Term  Treasury Yields  
After changing little on net in 2017 , the 10 -year nominal Treasury yield has risen notably in the past 
few months , reaching levels near 3 percent  for the first time in four years  (figure 1) .  Market 
commentary has attributed th is rise to several factors, including an improving global growth 
outlook , expectations for less accommodative monetary policy from major central banks, firming 
inflation data, and some fiscal developments that have likely  increased  the expected future supply  
of Treasury securities . 
Staff models also point  to multiple factors contributing to the recent increase in the 10 -year  yield.  
In particular, all four components  of the 10-year nominal yield —the expected real short -term  rate, 
expected inflation, the real term premium, and the inflation risk premium —are estimated to have  
contributed to its  rise since December.1  The rise in  real term and inflation risk premium s is 
consistent with the fiscal developments as well as some spillover effects from the prospect  of less 
accommodative policies from foreign central banks amid the  improving global outlook.  The 
modest rise in expected inflation is consistent with the recent firming of  inflation data, while the 
rise in the real short rate  reflects  expectations for further increases  in the fed eral funds rate i n the 
face of the strengthening economic outlook and  rising inflationary pressures.  Furthermore, p art of 
the recent rise in the expected real short rate also reflects a modest rise in longer-horizon (5 to 
10 year) real short rate expectations, which could be consistent with the view that r*  (the neutral 
real fed eral funds rate)  is likely to move  up. 
Additional staff analysis provides rough estimates of the effect of the increased future supply of 
Treasury securities —through the passage of tax reform in December and the budget agreement in 
early February —on the 10 -year yield .2  Assuming supply -effect magnitudes similar to previous staff  
studies , the increase in  the expected future supply of Treasury securities  may have raised the 
10-year yield by 5 to 20 basis points.3  Note that spreads between long -term swap rates and 
Treasury yields have not narrowed recently, as one might expect if Treasury yields had been 
boosted by unusual supply effects .  Nonetheless, some market commentary has pointed to 
potential regulatory easing as a factor that may have masked pure supply e ffects  on those spreads .  
                                                 
1 The 51 basis point rise (as of March 6, 2018) in the 10 -year yield since December 1, 2017, can be decomposed as 
a 17 basis point rise in the real short -term rate expectation, an 11 basis point rise in expected inflation, a 16 basis 
point rise in the real term premium, and a 7 basis point rise in the inflation risk premium.  For the underlying model, 
see Stefania D’Amico, Don H. Kim, and Min Wei ( 2018 ), “Tips from TIPS:   The Informational Content  of Treasury 
Inflation -Protected Security Prices,”  Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis , vol. 53 (February ), pp. 395–436.  
2 Although the market reaction to the passage of tax reform on December 19, 2017, was muted, yields rose in 
the preceding week, which may have reflected growing expectation for the passage of the tax reform.  
3 The reported range reflects (1) an assumption that a supply increase of $10o billion in Treasury 10 -year 
equivalents raises the term premium by 5 to 10 basis points; (2) an  estimated $400  billion  to $500 billion increase  in 
supply due to the fiscal developments,  based on changes in primary dealers’  Treasury issuance forecasts; 
(3) conversion of the increased supply expectations into a 10 -year equivalent amount based on maturity 
composition assumptions for future issuance that reflect the Treasury’s most recent refunding statements.

  market-based policy paths and longer-term yields.  Hawkish comm unications from the 
Bank of England boosted expected polic y rates in the United Kingdom, and long-term 
U.K. yields edged up. 
The dollar appreciate d 1¾ percent against AFE currencies, partly driven by the 
modest divergence in po licy expectations in the United States a nd foreign countries over 
the period.  (See the box “Recent Dynamics of the U.S. Dollar E xchange Rate” for a 
longer-term perspective on the dol lar and interest rates.)  Lower oil prices and uncertainty 
over U.S. trade policy also lik ely contributed to an outsized 4 ½ percent depreciation of 
the Canadian dollar.  In contrast , the Japanese yen appreciated  2½ percent against the 
dollar, in part supported by safe-haven demand.  The dollar app reciated 2½ percent 
against EME currencies, largely owing to the roughly 400,000 percent rise in the dollar 
against the Venezuelan bolivar.1  
EME sovereign spreads widened m odestly over the period.  Mutual fund flows 
into EMEs waned and waxed with the  changing sentiment toward ri sky assets over the 
period, declining during the equit y market turmoil early in the  period and resuming in 
subsequent weeks. 
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Conditions in short-term funding ma rkets remained generally sta ble over the 
intermeeting period.  Both the effect ive federal funds rate and  the overnight bank funding 
rate held at 1.42 percent ex cept for month-end.  
Increased Treasury bill supply, however, has led bill yields to  rise above OIS rates 
for the first time in almost a decade.  The rise in bill yields  has contributed to lower ON 
RRP take-up, pushed up money market  rates, and widened spreads relative to OIS rates.  
In particular, interest rates  on negotiable certificates of dep osit (CDs) have increased, and 
the spread between CD and OIS r ates has widened, especially at the three-month tenor, as 
have three-month LIBOR–OIS spread s.  Market commentaries have a lso highlighted 
expected tax repatriation–relate d redemptions from offshore pri me MMFs as supporting 
the rise in some money market rates. 
                                                 
1 This one-time devaluation of the official Venezuelan exchange rate brought the official value of 
the bolivar closer to its black m arket rate, which had been dep reciating over the p ast few years.

 Recent Dynamics  of the U.S. Dollar Exchange  Rate 
Although  the U.S. dollar  strengthened  slightly over the intermeeting  period, the dollar  has 
depreciated  notably against most major currencies  over the past year.  In particular,  the trade‐
weighted  dollar  index for the  advanced  foreign economies  (AFEs) has declined about 10 percent 
since  early 2017 (figure 1).  This decline in the dollar has occurred  despite continued  normalization  
of U.S. monetary  policy and, particularly  since last August, a notable widening  of the gap 
between  U.S. and AFE interest rates at short and long horizons (figure 2).  Here we consider 
potential  explanations  for recent  dollar  weakness.  We  believe some of the depreciation  reflects 
the improved  foreign outlo ok and a reduction  of risks  abroad.  We find less evidence  for 
arguments  that attribute the  dollar  weakness  to U.S. fiscal or trade policy.  
For much  of 2017,  the decline in the dollar seemed well  explained  by the strengthening  economic  
recovery abroad, especially  in the euro area.  External forecasts  of foreign growth were revis ed 
higher, and foreign currencies  also benefited  from improved  sentiment  abroad.  Importantly,  the 
passage of key risk events, including  elections  in France  and Germany,  has resulted in a decline in 
policy uncertainty  and tail risks  in the euro area.1  Until September  2017, the upward growth 
revisions were accompanied  by increases  in foreign interest rates relative to U.S. rates, which 
likely also weighed on the dollar.   
The further depreciation  of the dollar  since  August amid the widening  differential  between  U.S. 
and AFE interest rates, however,  poses a puzzle.  Our best guess is that some of the same factors 
weighing  on the dollar  earlier—improving  economic  prospects  abroad as well  as improved  risk‐
sentiment  that  induced reversals  of earlier  flight‐to‐safety  demand for the  dollar—continued  to 
operate over  this period.  It also bears emphasizing  that between  August and the present, the 
dollar fell only another 1¾ percent  against  AFE currencies.              
  
                                                 
1 In 2017, the euro rose about 15 percent against  the dollar, with a sizable  portion of this appreciation  
occurring  on days with news of positive  macroeconomic  data surprises  or a reduction  in political uncertainty.

 Taking a longer‐term view,  the left panel in figure 3 plots the AFE dollar index against the value 
implied by the historical  relationship  between  yield differentials  and exchange  rates over the 
post‐crisis period.2  Although  the long‐term trend of the AFE dollar  index follows the path implied 
by interest rate  differentials,  deviations  can be notable.  In particular,  from mid‐2014  to early 2016, 
the dollar  appreciated  more than 25 percent, but the path predicted  by interest rate  differentials  
moved up only moderately.   Some of the dollar’s rise over that period has been attributed  to 
increased  downside  risks  as foreign economies  languished  and oil prices plummeted;  the recent 
dollar  weakness could  reflect a retracement  of those risks.  In addition, some of the run‐up in the 
dollar  in 2014  beyond what was captured  in yield differentials  could have been firming  
expectations  of the removal  of quantitative easing  in the United States as prospects  for growth  
improved.  Similarly,  we could now be observing  the same dynamic  abroad, as eventual monetary  
policy normalization  by some foreign central banks is being increasingly  discussed.   It is unclear 
why interest rates are not fully capturing  these shifts in expectations,  which is an issue that 
remains an active area  of research.  
Some recent commentary  has suggested  that the weakness in  the dollar  since  early last year may 
reflect investors  shedding  U.S. assets on concerns  over the effect of fiscal stimulus on U.S.  debt 
levels and rising trade protectionism.   So far, there is less support  in the data  for this argument.   
The dollar’s weakness was  primarily concentrated  in the first part of 2017, before major fiscal and 
trade policies were announced.   In fact, the dollar  has changed little since  the turn  of the year and 
appreciated  more recently, a period when changes  in fiscal and trade policy were more 
prominent.   This strengthening  of the dollar  is, in fact, exactly what economic  theory would 
predict as a consequence  of greater fiscal  stimulus and higher tariffs.3  There is also little evidence  
in the data  of foreign investors  selling U.S. assets.  U.S. equity markets have continued  to 
outperform  their foreign counterparts,  and foreign demand for U.S. assets has remained  strong 
in recent months.4 
                                                 
2 Specifically,  we estimate rolling‐window regressions  of changes in constituent  exchange  rates on 
differentials  of near‐term interest  rates (2‐year yield) and yield curve slopes  (10‐year yield minus  2‐year yield), 
compute  implied weekly changes in exchange  rates, and compound  them over time. 
3 Recent empirical  literature  provides support for currency appreciation  due to fiscal expansion.  See,  for 
example,  Alan J. Auerbach  and Yuriy Gorodnichenko  (2016), “Effects of Fiscal Shocks  in a Globalized  World,” IMF 
Economic  Review, vol. 64 (April), pp. 177–215. 
4 Foreign private purchases  of U.S. securities  was  robust  throughout  2017 and totaled about $600  billion.  
Despite  a slowdown  later in the year, official sector purchases  were about $160 billion.

  Balance sheet normalization has continued as scheduled without a notable effect 
on markets.  Since the start of  balance sheet norm alization in October 2017 through the 
end of February, the Federal Reser ve’s holdings of  Treasury securities have decreased by 
$41 billion, and its holdings of agency securities have decreas ed by $11 billion.2 
                                                 
2 The Federal Reserve reports its  securities holdings in the wee kly H.4.1 statis tical release.  
Because the maturity and reinvestment of Treasury securities oc curs on the same day, Treasury 
redemptions are immediately refl ected in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In contrast, the forward-
settling nature of the agency MBS  market makes it more difficul t to see the effect of the agency 
redemptions in the securities holdings.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Financing conditions for businesses and households continued to  support growth 
in economic activity  over the intermeeting period . 
• The condition of both debt and equity markets remained quite supportive of 
financing for nonfinancial corporations.  The provision of bank- intermediated 
credit  to businesses slowed further in January and February , likely reflecting 
weak loan demand rather than  tight supply.   
• Residential real estate market s remained accommodative for most borrowers, 
although mortgage rates  continued their recent  upward trend.  For borrowers 
with low credit scores, mortgage credit remained  tight overall but continued  to 
ease gradually . 
• Consumers faced financing conditions that  remained supportive of their  
spending , particularly for  borrowers with high credit scores.  F or other 
borrowers, conditions remained tight in the credit card market .  Auto loans 
extended to subprime bor rowers continued to slow amid an  ongoing trend of 
tighter underwriting .  However, from a longer-term perspective, subprime 
auto lending conditions do not appear to be particularly restrictive.   
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations continued to be 
accommodative over the intermeeting period .  Corporate bond spreads remained low by 
historical standards.  While g ross issuance of investment -grade and speculative- grade 
bonds was slightly lower than usual in January a nd February , these low volumes may 
have been related to a reduction in external  funding needs following  the passage of tax 
reform, including the likelihood of repatriating earnings held abroad .  In addition, the 
bout of heightened m arket volatility in early February may have temporarily adversely 
affected financing conditions.  Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans was strong

  in January and February , with refinancing deals again composing the bulk of such  
issuance.1 
Growth in banks’ commercial and industrial (C&I) loans remained relatively 
weak in January and February, a development that seemed more reflective of soft demand 
for credit  rather  than of restrictive supply.  While interest rates on C&I lo ans have 
recently increased, spreads have narrowed and noninterest rate terms have eased.  Th ese 
developments are consistent with the  latest  Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 
Lending Practices  (SLOOS), which, as  reported in the January Tealbook, indicated both a 
net easing of C&I loan standards and terms and weaker demand for C&I loans in the 
fourth quarter. 
Despite elevated leverage ratios, the credit  performance of nonfinanc ial 
corporations remained solid.  T he six-month trailing bond default rate remained quite 
low, and the February Moody’s KMV expected year -ahead default rate edged down to 
just under 1 percent, a bit below the KMV measure’s  historical median.  Earnings of S&P 
500 firms  increased sharply in the fourth quarter, at the ir fastest pace since 2010.  
Forecasts for 2018 have been revised up considerably , largely because of  the legislated 
tax changes .    
Financing to corporations through capital markets was boosted by equity 
issuance.  Both initial public offerings and seasoned offerings picked up in January from 
their already  solid paces in the fourth quarter.  However,  recent market volatility seems to 
have been a drag on equity issuance in February, particularly among seasoned offerings.  
Announced future share repurchases in the fourth quarter reached their  highest level in 
two years, suggesting that corporations plan to distribute some of the ir expected  tax 
savings to shareholders.   
Commercial Real Estate  
Commercial real estate ( CRE ) loan growth at banks stepped down further in 
January  and February .  This slowing was concentrated in the nonfarm nonresidential 
sector; growth of both multifamily and construction loans was little changed  after having 
gradually declined  over the past year .  The general slowing of CRE loan growth at banks 
                                                 
1 In February, the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that exempted 
some types of collateralized loan obligations  (CLO)  from complying with the Dodd- Frank Act’s credit risk 
retention rule.  Rulemaking agencies have not disclosed whether they intend to appeal the ruling.  If the 
ruling stands, the staff anticipate that CLO issuance may increase somewhat in coming quarters and lenders 
may, at the margin, sup ply a bit more credit to riskier firms.

  follows reports in the SLOOS of both tightening standards and weakening loan demand 
across CRE loan categories over the past two quarters.  More recently, the slowing has 
been concentrated at some of the larg est banks, wh ich reported that they had also sold off 
or securitized sizable amounts of nonfarm nonresidential loans since the beginning of the year.    
Financing conditions in commercial mortgage -backed securities  (CMBS ) markets 
remained accommodative, wit h robust issuance (relative to the usual seasonal slowdown) 
in January and February.  Spreads on CMBS held steady during the intermeeting period, near their  lowest levels since the financial crisis.   
Small Businesses     
Small business owners continued to report accommodative credit supply 
conditions but also weak demand for credit.  In the Wells Fargo Small Business Index 
(WFSBI)  survey for the first quarter, 18 percent of respondents reported that credit was 
somewhat or very difficult to obtain over the past 12 months, just slightly above the post-crisis low for this series (but elevated relative to  its level in the few years before the 
financial crisis ).  Indicators of recent loan performance remained strong, and credit 
quality concerns do not appear to be a significant factor affecting the ability of small businesses to obtain credit.  In response to a question about credit demand,  only 
16 percent of  respondents to the WFSBI survey indicated that they plan to apply for a 
new credit product in the next 12 months, unchanged from a year ago.  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit  conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative.  Spreads 
on general obligation bonds over comparable- maturity Treasury securities were little 
changed, on net.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds in January and February  fell notably 
from the very strong pace in December .  In late 2017, bond issuers were uncertain about 
whether  the tax reform package would preserve the tax -exempt status of interest earned 
on private activity bonds, which reportedly contributed to a pull-forward of issuance, although ultimately this tax -exempt status  was retained .

  “The Effect of Fannie Mae’s Relaxation of Debt -Service- to-Income Underwriting 
Constraints on Residential Mortgage Lending”).  However,  credit conditions remained 
tight for potential mortgage borrowers with low credit scores or with hard- to-document 
incomes , even as the trend of gradual easing continued . 
The average interest rate on 30-year conforming mortgages offered to well-
qualified borrowers increased about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period, a little 
more than the increase in 10-year Treasury securities.   Mortgage r ates are about 60 basis 
points above the rates reported  during the December  FOMC , which the staff estimate 
could cause about a 7 percent increase in the monthly payment for a typical home-
purchase mortgage.   
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained supportive of growth 
in consumer spending , with  credit readily available to prime -rated  borrowers .  Overall 
consumer credit grew at a solid  pace in January following a rapid expansion in the fourth 
quarter .   
In January, aggregate c redit card balances were about 6  percent above the ir level a 
year earlier, representing, on balance,  a fairly steady rate of expansion.   Nonetheless, f or 
subprime borrowers, conditions in the credit card market remained tight , with credit card 
limits and balances still low by historical standards.  The shift in credit card lending 
toward prime borrowers in recent years is evident in the relatively low delinquency rate 
on cred it card loans, though delinquencies have risen a bit recently, especially among 
nonprime borrowers . 
Overall, auto lending continued to grow at a moderate pace in  recent months.  
While new auto loan extensions to  prime borrowers continued to expand at a sol id pace, 
extensions to subprime borrowers have been declining for more than a year.  
Underwriting in the subprime segment continued to tighten, and  delinquency rates among 
recently  originated subprime auto loans have flattened out.  However, because subprime 
underwriting was quite loose a couple of years ago, the tightening in recent quarters has not resulted in a particularly restrictive supply of credit.  For example, the Michigan  
survey suggests that tight ening credit  has not yet deterred a signif icant number of car 
buyers.

 The Effect of Fannie Mae’s Relaxation of Debt-S ervice -to-Income       
Underwriting  Constraints on Residential Mortgage Lending  
Fannie Mae recently amended its policies for approving the purchase of mortgage loans with high debt -
service- to-income (DTI) ratios through its automated underwriting system, Desktop Underwriter (DU).1  
In this analysis , we show that this policy change represents a notable relaxation of credit conditions for 
some borrowers .  However, we also find  that the change had little effect on the riskiness of new 
mortgages, as the other underwriting characteristics of high -DTI mortgages tended to be  strong. 
In order to be purchased by Fannie Mae, a mortgage must either be manually underwritten within the 
strictures of Fannie Mae’s eligibility matrix or automatically underwritten through DU.  Because Fannie 
Mae fund s a large fraction of the mortgage market, its policies determine the credit standards that many 
borrowers face.2  Although Fannie Mae has imposed a maximum DTI ratio of 45 percent for manually 
underwritten loans for several years, the maximum DTI ratio for mortgages approved through DU was set 
at 50 percent if a borrower’s mortgage loan -to-value (LTV) ratio was less than or equal to 80 percent and 
the borrower had enough savings to cover 1 2 months of mortgage payments .3  However, on July 29, 2017, 
Fannie Mae lifted the additional LTV ratio and savings  requirements  for DU -approved mortgages.  As a 
result, any loan approved by DU with a DTI ratio less than or equal to 50 percent is now eligible for sale to 
Fannie Mae. 
This change was quickly followed by a marked increase in the overall volume of high -DTI mortgage 
lending.  Figure 1 plots the share of home- purchase loans with a DTI  ratio in excess of 45 percent ( black  
line) by the month in which the mortgage rate was locked  in.  High -DTI loans jumped from about  
                                                 
1 DTI ratios include the borrowers’ required monthly payments to service all of their obligations on both the prop osed 
mortgage as well as all other types of debt (primarily credit card accounts, auto loans, and student loans).  
2 According to Inside Mortgage Finance, about 28 percent by dollar volume of first- lien residential mortgages are 
purchased by Fannie Mae.  
3 The qualified mortgage (QM) rule provides a safe harbor from litigation for loans with DTI ratios less than or equal to 
43 percent.  This safe harbor also extends to mortgages eligible for sale to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or mortgages eligible 
for insuran ce through the Federal Housing Administration.

18 percent of newly originated loans prior to Fannie Mae ’s underwriting change to about 25 percent by 
late 2017.  This expansion translates to approximately 30,000 additional high -DTI loans per month 
(seasonally adjusted).   
Prior to Fannie Mae’s underwriting change, high -DTI mortgages had been available through the Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA) but under more stringent terms (higher effective interest rates and lower 
loan limits).   The increased take- up of high -DTI mortgages may consist, in part, of borrowers who found 
the FHA loans to be too expensive or too small and thus were brought into the market by the changed 
underwriting  standard s.  However, it also appears that some borrowers may have merely adjusted their 
application s under the less stringent underwriting policies.  For example, some borrowers may have 
applied for larger mortgages or declared income more conservatively under the higher DTI limits.  Indeed, 
the share of new loans originated to borrowers with DTI  ratios between 40 and 45 percent (the purple 
line in figure 1 ) decreased over 2 percentage points  from July  2017  to February  2018 , indicating  that  some 
borrowers shifted from  being  just below the previous DTI cap into higher DTI mortgages.  
Given the greater frequency of high -DTI mortgages, b oth Fannie Mae and private investors ( through 
credit risk transfers ) could be exposed to some additional risk.  To estimate how much riskier this lending 
could be, we  exami ned a sample of servicing records of loans originated from 2000  to 2015  and estimated 
delinquenc y rates as a function of borrowers’ DTI ratios , credit score s, and LTV  ratios .  We used the 
estimated model to project delinquency rates for newly  originated mortgages before and after Fannie 
Mae’s underwriting expansion and plotted the result s in figure 2 .4  The estimates indicate essentially no 
discernable increase in the credit risk  of new loans since July  2017 , as the rise in average DTI  ratios has 
been largely offset by increases in  credit scores and decreases in LTV  ratios among borrowers getting 
high -DTI mortgages .  Indeed, our analysis indicates that low credit scores and high LTV  ratios are more 
powerful predictors of mortgage default than are high DTI  ratios.   In all, Fannie Mae has notably 
expanded mortgage credit availability without yet appearing to take on substantially more credit risk.  
                                                 
4 “Delinquency ” is defined as having a payment 60 days or more past due any time within the first two years after 
origination.

 Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF  RISKS  
As in the January Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of 
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark 
used by the FOMC.  Financial market volatility was elevated in early February but has 
subsided since then.  Meanwhile, fiscal policy uncertainty associated with budget 
appropriations to fund government operations and with raising the federal debt limit was 
mostly resolved with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  That said, much uncertainty 
remains about the future direction of federal economic policies.  
We continue to judge the risks around our projections for real GDP growth and 
the unemployment rate as being balanced.  On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes 
could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity th an expected in the baseline.  On 
the downside, given that the economy is already operating above its potential level and 
resource utilization is projected to get even tighter , those fiscal policy changes could 
yield less impetus to the economy than assumed in the baseline.  Consistent with our 
judgmental assessment, estimates of the distribution of risks around our GDP and 
unemployment rate forecasts conditional on available indicators, shown in the exhibit 
“Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly wide or skewed.  Moreover, 
as presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the risk of returning 
to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three years is estimated from 
stochastic simulations around the baseline path in the FRB/US model to be about  
8 percent.  If the ELB risk were computed around the median federal funds rate path from 
the FOMC’s December S EP, the estimated probability would be 19 percent. 
With regard to inflation, we still se e average uncertainty and balanced risks 
around our projection.  To the downside, last year’s soft ness in inflation could prove to 
be more persistent than we have assumed.  Also, there is a risk that the inflation 
expectations relevant for wage and price setting could be lower currently than in the 
baseline or may not edge up in the coming years as we have assumed.  To the upside, 
with the economy projected to be moving further above its long-run potential, inflation 
may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models 
that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.  Our judgmental

assessments of typical uncertainty and balanced risks are consistent with the statistical 
estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the 
baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario describes one set 
of shocks sufficient to generate a historically average recession.  In the second scenario,  
running the economy “hot” for a while leads to persistent positive effects on the 
productive capacity of the economy— a form of “positive hysteresis. ”  In the third 
scenario,  we study a downside risk for inflation in which households and businesses have 
lower inflation expectations than in the baseline because they perceive that monetary 
policy will be too tight to return inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the 
medium term.  In contrast, the fourth scenario examines the upside risk that the response 
of wages and prices to the further tightening of labor market conditions will prove to be 
stronger than we have assumed,  and that inflation expectations will be more responsive to 
a rise in actual inflation.  In the fifth scenario, we present the implications of a substantial 
correction in global asset prices.  The s ixth and last scenario analyzes the effects of 
stronger foreign economic growth and a weaker dollar. 
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of three staff models.1  In all 
except the first scenario, the federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in 
the baseline.  (The first scenario, which features a recession, allows for a more aggressive 
monetary policy response.)  In addition, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio 
are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios. 
Recession [FRB/US]  
Even under the staff’s strong baseline projection for real activity, the probability 
of a recession occurring at some time over the next three years is 30 percent, according to 
FRB/US.  In this scenario, we assume that , starting in 2019, shocks hit the economy 
sufficient to generate a historically average recession.  We generate this outcome by first 
assuming persistently higher risk premiums that cause a curtailment of credit to 
                                                 
1 The three models used are an estimated medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model of the U.S. 
economy based on Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2015), “Inflation in the 
Great Recession and New Keynesian Models,” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics,  vol. 7 
(January), pp. 168–96; FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy; and 
SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model.

households and businesses; we also assume that there are additional negative shocks to 
consumption, investment, and aggregate hours beyond those implied by the tightening of 
financial conditions, which could be interpreted as reflecting changes in sentiment or 
animal spirits.  Stock market prices fall nearly 25 percent by the end of 2019, and the 
triple-B corporate bond spread rises about 100 basis points above the baseline.  The 
simulated downturn results in a cumulative increase in the unemployment rate of around 
2¼ percentage points and thus roughly matches the historical average magnitude of the 
recessions that have occurred in the post– World  War II period excluding the Great 
Recession.   
Real GDP growth slows substantially— on a quarterly basis, output declines 
modestly for two quarters— until rebounding in the middle of 2020.  The unemployment 
rate reaches 5 ¾ percent by mid-2021 and then gradually returns toward the baseline.  
Given the low responsiveness of inflation to changes in slack in the FRB/US model, 
inflation is only slightly below the baseline. 
The federal funds rate is sufficiently elevated at the onset of the recession that it 
does not return to the ELB, even though we assume that it falls faster than would be 
implied by our baseline policy rule, in line with the typical response in past recessions.  
By the end of 2020, the funds rate is 3¾ percentage points below the baseline.  Two and a 
half years after the recession begins, the baseline rule is assumed to once again govern 
the setting of the funds rate; however, the rate itself remains below the baseline for the 
rest of the simulation period.2  
Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]  
In the baseline projection, the unemployment rate remains below its assumed 
natural rate of 4.7 percent for a number of years.  This extended period of labor market 
tightness may have persistent positive effects on the productive capacity of the economy, 
a phenomenon referred to as positive hysteresis.  In this scenario, we assume that 
persistent exposure to a hot economy causes even more workers to remain in the labor 
                                                 
2 Under a different baseline projection, constructed utilizing the median responses reported in the 
December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the recession has worse effects.  Because the SEP’s 
path for the federal funds rate is lower than the staff’s path, the ELB binds from the beginning of 2020 until 
the end of 2021.  The unemployment rate increases a maximum 2¾ percentage points from its value in 
2018 :Q4, compared with an increase of 2 ¼ percentage points when using the staff’s baseline.   Real GDP 
growth, relative to the SEP baseline, drops an additional ¼ percentage point than its counterpart under (and 
relative to) the staff projection by the end of 2020.

force and induces additional entrants, resulting in an increase in the trend labor force 
participation rate that accumulates to about 1 percentage point above the baseline by the 
end of 2023.  Furthermore, we assume that the experience that workers gain through 
greater employment reduces the natural rate of unemployment ½ percentage point below 
the baseline by the end of 2023.  Both of these favorable developments are assumed to be 
recognized in real time by monetary policymakers.3 
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ½ percentage point more 
per year over the projection period than in the baseline.  This additional room to grow 
allows real GDP growth to run at a similar increment above the baseline.  As a result, the 
output gap is about unchanged.  The unemployment rate is close to the baseline until the 
end of 2019 because increases in labor force participation  offset gains in employment.  
After 2019, the unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory than the baseline and is 
slightly more than ¼ percentage point below the baseline by 2023.  With inflation and the 
output gap roughly at the baseline, the federal funds rate is little changed.4 
Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model] 
Headline inflation, as measured by the change in PCE prices, has been below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective for most of the past five years and averaged only about 
1¼ percent during that period.  In the baseline projection, inflation is assumed to rebound 
this year and to reach 2 percent in 2019, in part reflecting further tightening in resource 
utilization and a small gradual rise in inflation expectations.  However, in light of the 
persistently low inflation of the past several years, there is a risk that the public currently 
perceives the stance of monetary policy as being too tight to achieve the 2 percent target 
and as likely to remain so in the future; for that reason, longer-run inflation expectations 
in this scenario are assumed to be ¼ percentage point lower than in the baseline. 
Lower inflation expectations cause actual inflation to run below its baseline path 
and to reach only 1.7 percent by the end of 2019.  Consequently, the federal funds rate 
                                                 
3 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the 
natural rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-
generating compo nents. 
4 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential 
output, the federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching 
5¾ percent by the beginning of 2022.  In that case, real GDP growth would be a bit more than ¼ percentage 
point lower, on average, between 2022 and 2023 than in this scenario , with the unemployment rate slightly 
more than ¼ percentage point above this scenario at the end of 2023.  Inflation would still remain close to 
the baseline.

increases less than in the baseline; even so, individuals and firms in the private sector 
perceive real interest rates as initially slightly higher because inertia in the assumed 
policy rule prevents the federal funds rate from adjusting more rapidly.  As a result, real 
GDP growth is a touch lower in 2018 than in the baseline, and the unemployment rate 
runs slightly higher through 2023.   
Steeper Phillips Curve with More-Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US] 
Alternatively, the further tightening of resource utilization in the baseline could 
cause inflation to rise much faster than projected.  Some research suggests that the wage 
Phillips curve may steepen when the labor market is very tight.5  In FRB/US, faster wage 
growth implies higher price inflation as well.  This scenario captures the risk of that 
nonlinearity by boosting the response of wages to tightening labor utilization and by 
assuming that longer-run inflation expectations become more sensitive to the higher 
realized price inflation that stems from faster wage growth.6 
Inflation reaches 3½ percent by the end of 2022, compared with about 2¼ percent 
in the baseline.  In response to the higher path of inflation, the federal funds rate rises 
more and peaks a bit above 6¼ percent in mid-2022.  As a result, real GDP rises a bit 
more slowly,  and the unemployment rate is about ½ percentage point above the baseline 
by the end of 2023 (though still slightly below the level of the natural rate). 
Global Market Correction [SIGMA]  
Asset valuation pressures in the United States and in many foreign economies 
remain noticeably elevated, with equity price- to-earnings ratios high by historical 
standards, interest rate spreads on corporate debt fairly low, and term premiums on 
sovereign debt still compressed.  Although the broad-based decline in global asset prices 
                                                 
5 For evidence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth and slack, see, for example, 
Richard W. Fisher and Evan F. Koenig (2014), “Are We There Yet?  Assessing Progress toward Full 
Employment and Price Stability,” Dallas Fed Economic Letter, vol. 9 (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas, October), www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/eclett/2014/el1413.pdf ; and Jeremy

Discussion Series 2016- 078 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016078pap.pdf . 
6 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that both the slope of the wage Phillips curve and 
the sensitivity of long-run inflation expectations to realized inflation are four times larger than in the 
current version of the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the se increases reflects a comparison between 
estimates of the recent past and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.  
Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the coefficients used in this scenario are well below those characterizing 
inflation dynamics in the 1970s.

that occurred last month has partially reversed, it may well presage a larger and more 
durable correction.  In this scenario, we assume that the willingness of investors to take 
on risk reverses over the course of 2018.  Specifically, equity prices fall 20 percent and 
corporate borrowing spreads increase about 50 basis points in both the United States and 
abroad.  Term premiums on foreign sovereign bonds increase 30 basis points, while term 
premiums on U.S. Treasury securities rise only about half as much as investors rebalance 
their portfolios toward dollar-denominated assets; these flight- to-safety flows cause the 
broad real dollar to appreciate about 5 percent.  The fall in global asset prices weakens 
household and corporate balance sheets and weighs on confidence.  
Tighter financial conditions, weaker foreign activity, and the appreciation of the 
dollar restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States.  U.S. GDP growth 
moderates to 1½ percent in 2018, about 1½ percentage points less than in the baseline.  
Lower import prices and weaker activity reduce core PCE inflation to 1½  percent in 
2018.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline. 
The relatively modest macroeconomic effects in our scenario reflect our 
assumption that the asset price correction is fairly contained and, in particular, does not 
induce the widespread disruption to the broader functioning of financial markets that 
occurred during the Global Financial Crisis.  (See the box “What Are the Macroeconomic 
Effects of Global Market Corrections?” in the International Economic Developments and 
Outlook section.) 
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar [SIGMA] 
In our baseline forecast, we expect that foreign growth will continue at a solid 
pace before gradually slowing toward potential.  However, as has been the case over the 
past year, the expansion abroad may prove stronger than expected.  In this scenario, we 
assume that foreign GDP growth rises to about 3 ¾ percent in 2018 and 2019  and thus 
averages about ¾ percentage point per year higher than under our baseline projection.  
Increased optimism about the foreign recovery and its implications for monetary policy 
abroad —as well as the perception of diminished tail risks— cause the broad dollar to 
depreciate 10 percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2019, pushing the dollar back 
nearly to the level that prevailed in mid-2014 before the dollar began its sharp ascent.       
U.S. real GDP expands 3¼ percent, on average, in 2018 and 2019, about 
½ percentage point faster than in the baseline, as the weaker dollar and stronger foreign 
growth boost U.S. real net exports.  The unemployment rate falls to 2½ percent by the 
end of 2020.  Higher import prices and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE 
price inflation to reach 2½ percent in 2019.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly 
than in the baseline, increasing to 5½  percent by the end of 2020.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  In the near term, the revisions to the strategies’ 
prescriptions are small in magnitude because the staff’s modest upward revision to 
projected inflation and the slight downward revision of the output gap have opposing 
effects on prescribed policy rates .  Beyond the near te rm, in response to somewhat tighter 
resource utilization  in the staff projection and its accompanying effects on inflation, all 
strategies call for moderately higher policy rates than in the previous Tealbook.  A 
special exhibit reports the changes in pres criptions of simple rules and optimal control 
policies , as well as the changes in their associated macroeconomic outcomes , since the 
December  Tealbook; this comparison reflects the staff’s reaction to incoming data and 
fiscal developments since shortly before the December 2017 Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP).  A s econd special exhibit provides updated estimates of the 
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the “balanced 
approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a nominal income 
targeting (NIT) rule .  These near -term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown by the black lines in the middle 
panels .  The top and middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal 
funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1  
•The near -term prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and the Taylor (1993) rules
are about unchanged from their January Tealbook levels because the effects of
the staff ’s downward revision to the output gap offset those of the staff ’s
upward revision to inflation in coming quarters.
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules  in the appendix to this section.   Except for the 
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that 
are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the December 2017 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baselineprojections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

  • The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules , which do not 
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding 
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.   
• The prescriptions of the first- difference rule are a bit higher than in January 
because the output gap widens somewhat faster over the coming year.  
• Under the NIT rule, the federal funds rate responds to the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP price deflator from the level  it would have attained had it 
increased  at an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011; the shortfall in 
the GDP price deflator in coming quarters is almost 2½ percent.
2  Unlike the 
other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which  call for raising the federal 
funds rate in the near term, the NIT rule, in an effort to eliminate the shortfall 
in the GDP price deflator, prescribes a level for the federal funds rate in the 
second and third quarters that is near the current target range. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL  
FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the December  2017 SEP .3  Both 
estimates use the FRB/US model to conduct the simulations.  This concept , labeled  
“FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained 
over a 12- quarter period  starting in the current quarter , would bring the output gap to zero 
in the final quarter of that period.  This concept of r* is a summary of  the projected 
underlying strength of the real economy; because it is based on a single criterion , it does 
                                                 
2 The text of this section of Tealbook A in Octob er 2017, December 2017, and January 2018 
overstated the size of the current shortfall in the GDP price deflator.  The textual errors had no implications 
for the near -term prescriptions and model simulations of the NIT rule shown in those Tealbooks, which 
used the correct values.  
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the December 2017 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recov er an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

  not take into account other considerations, such as  achieving the inflation objective or 
avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate. 
• At 3.62 percent, t he estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* in this 
quarter is 19 basis  points above the corresponding value in the January  
Tealbook.  Th e modest upward revision reflects the fact that the medium- term 
output gap in the current staff forecast is slightly  wider than in the January  
Tealbook.  
• At 1. 09 percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook-consistent FRB /US r*.  The difference stems from the fact that the 
SEP-consistent projection has  output exceeding  potential by a considerably 
smaller amount over the medium term than does the current  Tealbook 
forecast .  This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the 
median path for the real federal funds rate implied by SEP projections 
averages  almost 1  percent age point less than  the corresponding path in the 
Tealbook. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FR B/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (199 3) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the NIT rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by each of the specified policy 
rules.4  The simulations are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following the prescriptions of each  rule in the future and that financial market 
participants, price setters, and wage setters anticipate  that monetary policy will follow 
through on this commitment and  are aware of the implications for interest rates and the 
macroeconomy of such a policy.5  The exhibit also reports the Tealbook baseline 
projection.   
                                                 
4 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.  
5 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly 
understands the implications of the FOMC adopting a particu lar policy strategy.  In the real world, the 
adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a period during which  the public 
learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications.  We abstract from considerations of this kind.

  • Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate rises 1.5 percentage points 
this year  and increases around 1.2 percentage points per year over the 
subsequent two years, bringing the rate up to 5.0 percent in the fourth quarter 
of 2020. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values exceed the corresponding Tealbook baseline values by about 1½ percentage point s, on average, through 
the end of 2020.  These relatively high values for the federal funds rate are 
followed by sli ghtly lower  values than in the Tealbook baseline beyond 2022.  
The unemployment rate under the Taylor (1999) rule runs somewhat higher 
than the Tealbook baseline through 2021 and  somewhat lower thereafter.   
Inflation runs a bit above the baseline path over the period shown, reflecting 
unemployment rate s below those in the Tealbook baseline for several years 
beyond 2022.  The reason that the sharp increase in the federal funds rate 
under the Taylor (1999) rule is not associated with an appreciably weaker economy is because agents in the model are forward looking and correctly 
anticipate that the federal funds rate beyond the medium term will be lower than under the Tealbook baseline; the result is a path for the 10- year real 
Treasury yield that runs below that in the baseline over the majority of the 
next decade, thereby supporting economic activity and inflation.
6 
• The Taylor (1993) rule al so calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate.  The prescriptions of this  rule are higher than the Tealbook 
baseline over the next two years , though they are lower than  those of the 
Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to projected output exceeding its assumed potential level .  Accordingly, under the Taylor (1993) rule, the unemployment rate falls 
below the path in the Tealbook baseline sooner and inflation runs higher than under the Taylor (1999) rule. 
                                                 
6 In the FRB/US model, near -term inflation tends to respond more strongly than the 
unemployment rate to longer -run developments.  In the case of the Taylor (1999) rule, beyond 2022 the 
rule prescribes a path of the federal funds rate that runs, for a time,  lower than the Tealbook baseline path.  
As a result, there is a long period during which the 10 -year real Treasury yield under the Taylor (1999) rule 
is relatively low.  Because agents in the model anticipate this period of low real 10 -year Treasury rates , 
inflation under the Taylor (1999) rule exceeds inflation in the Tealbook baseline.

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core

  • The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule is 
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through the middle of 2021 
but runs below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter 
divergence occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the 
expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the 
projected  narrowing of the output gap beyond the next three years .  The 
associated lower path of the federal funds rate, in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies lower longer- term real 
interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline and therefore higher levels of 
resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first- difference rule generates 
outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than  the corresponding outcomes in the Tealbook 
baseline projection. 
• The NI T rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as 
measured by the rate of increase in the GDP price deflator) from an annual 
rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.  Compared with the Tealbook baseline 
policy, t he NI T rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate because the cumulative shortfall of inflation from 2 percent 
since th e end of 2011 is currently almost 2½ percent.  Because the simulation 
embeds the assumption that policymakers  can credibly commit to closing this 
gap and that financial market participants , price setters,  and wage setters  
correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates, the 
path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate is lower than under the other policy 
rules and the Tealbook baseline for s everal years .  Accordingly, the path for 
the unemployment rate is substantially lower  than  in the Tealbook baseline 
and all other simulations shown, dropping to  2.6 percent in 2021. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
                                                 
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook

federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

  which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.8   
Three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for the 
federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff proje ction .  High  levels of the real 
federal funds rate are necessary in order to return the unemployment rate to its natural 
rate relatively quickly because, in the FRB/US model, the unemployment rate does not 
respond strongly to changes in real interest rates, a feature that is consistent with recent 
historical experience.  However, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate  
quickly to the high levels prescribed by the first three optimal control policies, 
macroeconomic outcomes may we ll be appreciably different from  the benign outcomes 
predicted by the FRB/US model.9  By contrast, the fourth optimal control policy allows 
the unemployment rate to decline to levels  last experienced during the 1950s; such a 
development might also entail outcomes differ ent from those predicted by the 
simulations.   
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to forestall the projected undershoot by the unemployment rate of its natural rate over the next several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with  the equal 
weights cost function judge to be costly.
10  Projected d eviations of inflation 
                                                 
8 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that will not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  
9 The simulation results  hinge on the assumptions that agents in the model have perfect foresight  
and that the public believes with certainty that policymakers will implement the path for the federal funds 
rate prescribed by the optimal control exercises.  While these assumptions may be a reasonable 
approximation under some circumstances, they may not be valid for historically extreme changes in the 
federal funds rate, particularly those prescribed by the optimal control exercise that places only a minimal penalty on adjust ments in the federal funds rate.  
10 When we use the December 2017 SEP -consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the 
federal funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks below 5 percent, 
compared with about 8½  percent under the Tealbook baseline.

  from 2  percent in the Tealbook baseline have little influence on the optimal 
policy because these deviations entail relatively small losses.  Moreover, a 
relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap has only a limited effect on 
the size of inflation deviations because the inflation response to the level of resource utilization is limited in the FRB/US model.  
• The second  simulation, “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times larger than the specification  with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical to that specification.  The resulting optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even though the losses associated with undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an 
unappealing tradeoff  because inflation responds only weakly to resource 
utilization.  
• The third  simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is o therwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This 
simulation seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even faster than under the equal- weight s specification.  As a result , the federal funds rate 
soars to 12 percent  at the end of 2018 and then settles around 8 percent over 
much of the remainder of the period shown. 
• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate but that is identical 
to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path throughout the period shown.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this initially more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to raise inflation 
to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate 
of unemployment.  T he tighter labor market helps bring inflation to 2  percent 
more quickly than in the case of equal weights.  Starting in the middle of the next decade (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a little above its natural

  rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the inflationary pr essures 
stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization. 
CHANGES IN PRESCRIPTIONS AND OUTCOMES FROM THE  DECEMBER 
TEALBOOK  
Since the December  Tealbook, largely in response to changes in fiscal policy, the 
staff has raised the Tealbook pr ojection for economic activity.   The fourth exhibit 
reports  the cumulative revisions in the f ederal funds rate prescriptions as well as 
in the unemployment and inflation rate outcomes associated with the various 
policy strategies  since then .11  The three panels to the left show these changes 
under the simple policy rules, whereas the panels to the right show these changes 
under the optimal control policies. 
• The simple policy rules now prescribe levels for the federal funds rate that are  
between 1 and 1½ percentage point s higher in the final quarter of 2020 than 
under the simulations based on the December baseline .  Despite the higher 
levels of the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate falls by more than in 
the simulations under the December  baseline because of the greater strength in 
the economic outlook embedded in the current Tealbook baseline .  Because 
the short- run Phillips curve is quite flat in the FRB/US model, inflation 
outcomes are similar between the current simulations and those based on th e 
December Tealbook. 
• With the exception of the policy associated with the asymmetric weight on 
ugap, the optimal control policies prescribe  levels for the federal funds rate in 
the final quarter of 2020 that are between ¾ and 1¾  percentage points higher 
than under the December baseline.  The tighter policy rates under these three 
policies offset most of the additional strength of the economic outlook 
embedded in the staff projection since December  and, consequently, imply 
smaller changes in the path for the unemployment rate and  inflation  than the 
simple policy rules .  By contrast, the optimal control policy associated with an 
asymmetric weight on ugap, which does not attach losses to  unemployment 
                                                 
11 The prescriptions and outcomes reported in the December 2017 Tealbook were based on a 
simulation period that started in 2018:Q1 whereas the prescriptions and outcomes reported in this Tealbook 
are based on a simulation period tha t starts in 2018:Q2.  To facilitate inference about the implications of 
revisions in the staff projection, the exhibit reports changes when we set the start of simulation period 
under both the current Tealbook and December Tealbook to 2018:Q2 .

variables under the December Tealbook baseline. To facilitate inference about the implications of revisions in the staff
projection, we set the start of the simulation period under both the current Tealbook baseline and the December Tealbook
baseline to 2018:Q2.                       Simple Rules Optimal Control

  falling below its natural rate , responds only modestly to the additional strength 
embedded in the staff outlook.  Overall , the change in the policy path under 
the asymmetric loss function is similar to that under the Tealbook baseline 
rule, so the trajectories for the unemployment rate and PCE inflation are  also 
comparable to th ose in the Tealbook  projection. 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit updates selected  estimates of the  equilibrium real federal funds 
rate in the longer run , denoted rLR; this concept is the rate consistent with the economy 
operating at its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated .  
Eight model- based time-series estimates of rLR through 2017:Q2 were presented in the 
October Tealbook.12  The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of values for these 
time-series estimates  through 2017:Q4.  In the final quarter of 2017, these estimates 
range  from 0 to 1¾ percent.  Relative to their values in the October Tealbook, six of the 
measures have remained wi thin 10 basis points of their 2017:Q2 levels  while the 
estimates from Holston, Laubach , and Wi lliams  (2017) and Laubach and Williams  (2003) 
have increased 19 and 25 basis points, respectively , over this period.  As  shown in the 
middle panel, the reported measures have varying degrees of estimation uncertainty.   
The lower panel of the exhibit reports long er-term forecasts of the real federal 
funds rate from  selected sources.  Excluding the Tealbook baseline assumption, the 
values range from 0.75 to 1.10 per cent.  Relative to their values reported in  the October  
Tealbook, the median  longer -run real federal funds rate forecast from  the Blue Chip 
survey forecast edg ed down 10 basis points , whereas  those from other sources we re 
unchanged .  The Tealbook estimate,  at 0.50 percent, is a touch lower than the others.  
The final  four exhibits , which appear after the exhibit “ Estimates of the 
Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the Longer Run,” tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and, because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And, 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial kno wledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES  SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
routinely reported in the  Monetary Policy Strategies  section .  It also reports the expression for the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule ; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a 
small temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseli ne projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  The right -hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter

  core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the 
output gap estimate for the current period ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead 
annual change in the output gap ( ∆4𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation 
objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.    
The nominal income  targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal income, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the log of the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value , denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP.  Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage p oints per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be approximated  as 
the sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level it would ha ve attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.

Simple Rules  
 The first two of the selected rules were studied  by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.
2   
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.3  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule

3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same  360-day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first impleme nted on a fully compounded, 365- day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.  Taylor (1999) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡

NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES 
The “Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projec tions for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quart ers.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines :  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection .4  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s e xogenous variables.  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
                                                 
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts 
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

  rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection , the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market par ticipants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemploym ent gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕=� 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉𝑇𝑇
𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎�𝜆𝜆𝜋𝜋 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃−𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)𝟐𝟐+𝜆𝜆𝑢𝑢,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏)𝟐𝟐+𝜆𝜆𝐿𝐿(𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉−𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉−𝟏𝟏 )𝟐𝟐�. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large 
weigh t to inflation gaps.  The third  specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places 
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.5  The fourth  specification, “ Asymme tric 
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the 
unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the 
                                                 
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

  unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights 
used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on 
the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see s this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits.  
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The t op panel of the exhibit “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch (2017); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, and 
Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); 
Kiley (2015); Laubach and W illiams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez -Grande (2017); and Lubik and 
Matthes (2015).  For comparability, a ll computations use the latest vintage of historical data 
through 2017:Q4.  Moreover, t he estimates are “one-sided” in the sense that, at each point in 
time, they make use of historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical 
movements can differ from the “two -sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.  Loss Functions

  Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each 
model’s point estimate for 2017:Q4.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are 
specific to each study.   
The bottom panel shows the selected estimates of 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 from selected forecasters.  These 
estimates were computed as follows:  
• “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run.  
• “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal funds 
rate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the 
December 2017 SEP.  
• “Median Survey of Primary Dealers ” equals the long -run median dealer forecast for 
the target rate minus the longer -run median dealer forecast of PCE inflation as of the 
January 2018 survey.  
• “Median Blue  Chip  (6-10-year)” equals the consensus five -year average (2024 –28) 
forecast for the federal funds rate minus the consensus five -year average (2024 –28) 
forecast for the annual change in the GDP chained price index as of the December  
2017 Blue Chip Financia l Forecasts survey.  
• “Congressional Budget Office (10- year)” equals the federal funds rate in 2027 minus 
the annual change in the PCE index in 2027 as reported last June in  Congressional 
Budget Office (2017).

    1. Annual values stated on a fiscal year basis. Quarterly values not seasonally adjusted.
    2. Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.    3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum        of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
        household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
        to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
