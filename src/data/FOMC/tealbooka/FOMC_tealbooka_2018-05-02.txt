Domestic  Economic  Developments and Outlook  
The information received since the March Tealbook r emain s consistent with our 
view that the economy continues to expand at an above- trend pace.  Although the March 
employment report was n ot as strong as we had expected, our broad assessment is that 
labor market conditions continued to tighten through the first quarter :  The 
unemployment rate remained  flat, but the labor force participation rate (LFPR) moved up 
and payroll employment gains averaged  well above the pace estimated to be consistent 
with no change in resource utilization.  On the spending side, GDP growth appears to 
have slowed in the first quarter, but we judge that the slowdown is temporary and expect 
that GDP growth will bounce back in the current quarter .  Over  the first half of the year , 
real GDP is projected to increase at an annual rate of 2¼ percent , about ¼ percentage 
point less than we had forecast  in the March Tealboo k but sufficient to further widen the 
gap between actual and potential output. 
Over the medium term, we continue to project an economy with above-trend 
growth and very high  resource utilization , buoyed by expansionary fiscal policy and solid 
foreign growth .  We forecast  that real GDP will increase about 2½ percent this year and 
next before slowing to a 2 percent pace in 2020 as monetary policy continues to tighten.  
By the end of the medium term, the level of real GDP is projected to  be 3¼ percent above  
our estimate of its potential—nearly  ½ percentage point less than in our previous forecast 
but still indicat ive of a very tight economy.  Correspondingly, the unemployment rate is 
expected  to be 3.3 percent at the end of 2020—a little higher than in the M arch Tealbook 
but still 1½ percentage points below our e stimate of its natural rate . 
The latest  monthly readings on prices have come in a touch above our 
expectation s and provide additional support for our view that the factors that held down 
inflation last year were transitory.  With the March CPI and PPI now in hand, we es timate 
that the 12-month change in core PCE prices stepped up to 1.9 percent last month , 
0.1 percentage point above our March Tealbook projection, as the extraordinarily low 
reading from March of last year dropped out of the calculation.  For the year as a whole, 
we expect  core inflation to  be 2.0 percent—also 0.1 percentage point higher than in our 
previous forecast.  Core inflation is then projected to  edge up to 2.1 percent in 2019 and 
2020 as resource utilization tightens further and underlying inflation inches up.  T otal 
PCE prices are expected to increase 2 .1 percent this year , a little more than core prices,

paring the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth is ¼  percentage point lower than the 
projections from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip 
consensus in 2018 and ¼  percentage point higher than the Blue Chip in 2019.  The 
staff’s un employment rate forecast is below  the outside forecasts in both 2018 and 
2019.  The staff’s projection s for total CPI and PCE inflation are a little higher than the 
outside forecasts in 2018 but are about the same in 2019, while the staff forecast for 
core PCE inflation is a touch higher than the SPF in both years.  (Note that the SPF 
projections are more than two months old.)  
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includ es input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

d by an increase in  energy prices  in the first half of the year .  After this year , total 
inflation —at 1.9 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020—is restrained a bit by declining 
energy prices and  runs a little below core inflation .  Relative to the March Tealbook, 
inflation at the end of the projection is  a touch lower , reflecting the higher unemployment 
rate in this forecast .  Finally, as in the March Tealbook, we have not incorporated any 
effects on either real activity or inflation from higher import tariffs.1 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
•We have not changed our fiscal policy assumptions in this projection.  We  s till
estimate that discretionary policy actions across all levels of government will
boost aggregate demand growth ½ percentage point in 2018, ¾ percentage
point in 2019, and ½ percentage point in 2020, exclusive of any multipliereffects and offsets from reactions in interest rates and the dollar .  Roughly
one-half of that medium- term impetus is due to the recent federal tax cuts ,
while  about one- fourth  reflects  the recent federal spending legislation; most of
the remainder is  due to projected increases in real state an d local government
expenditures.
•
The
 federal deficit is projected to rise from 3½ percent of GDP in fiscal year
2017 to 5¼ percent in fiscal 2020—a step -up that  primarily reflects the effects
of the recent tax and spending bills.
oWe continue to assume that, in five years, confronted with an elevated and
rising debt- to-GDP ratio, fiscal policymakers will begin to enact deficit
reducti on measures that gradually bring annual deficits back to sustainable
levels.
Monetary Policy 
•The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use to set the path of
mon
etary policy calls fo r the federal funds rate to increase nearly
1½ percentage poi nts in total this year and to rise  about 1 percentage point per
year, on average, in the next two years , reaching  4.7 percent in the fourth
1 We estimate that the effects of the new steel and aluminum tariffs, in isolation, will be minimal 
for both net exports and prices .  Other potential tariff  changes remain highly uncertain at this point and are 
therefore not included in our projection .

qua
rter of 2020.  This trajectory is a little less steep than in the March 
Tealbook, primarily reflecting the slightly lower level of resource utilization 
in this projection . 
•The S
OMA portfolio continues to shrink as securities are redeemed in a
manner consistent with the Committee’s June  2017 Addendum to the Policy
Normalization Principles and Plans and with the proces s initiated in
October  2017.
Other Interest Rates 
•The 10- ye ar Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly over the medium
term from an average of 2. 9 percent in the current quarter to 4.4 percent by the
end of 2020.  This path has been revised down about 25 basis points on
average relative to the March Tealbook , reflecting the lower -than-expected
readings for the 10 -year Treasury yield over the intermeeting period  along
with the flatter projected trajectory for the federal funds rate.
•The 30- y
ear fixed mortgage rate and the triple -B corporate bond rate are also
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term.  The paths for these two
rates were revised down mostly in line with revisions to the path of the10-year Treasur y yield.
Equity Prices and Home  Prices 
•Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter 1½ percent lower than
was
 projected in the March Tealbook, reflecting the recent declines in broad
equity price indexes.  Beyond the current quarter, we project stock prices to
rise at an average annual rate of ¾ percent, similar to our previous projection.
•We ex
pect annual house price appreciation to slow from 6 percent last ye ar to
an average of about 3¾ percent over the next three years, as interest rates rise.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
•We estimate that real GDP in the foreign economies rose 3 percent at an
annua
l rate in the first quarter, a touch faster than in the second half of last
year.  This  first-quarter  estimate is about the same as in the March Tealbook ,
as softer economic indicators in some advanced foreign economies  were about
offset  by positive surprises in several Asian economies.  Foreign growth is

proje
cted to stay close to this 3 percent pace in 2018 and then edge down 
slightly over the remainder of the forecast period to near its potential rate of 
2¾ percent in 2020. 
•The br
oad nominal dollar has depreciated about ½ percent since the time of
the March Tealbook.  We project the broad real  dollar  to appreciate at an
annual rate of about 1¾ percent through the forecast period, as marketexpectati ons for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast.  This
rate of appreciation is somewhat lower  than in the March projection, reflecting
the downward revision of the staff’s projected path for U.S. policy rates.  Thislower rate of projected appreciation, along with the recent realizeddepreciation, leaves the broad real  dollar about 1¼ percent lower at the end of
the forecast relative to the March Tealbook.
Oil and Commodity Prices  
•The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen $9 per barrel on net since the
Ma
rch Tealbook, closing most recently at $73 per barrel, while the price of
the December 2 020 futures contract rose $4 to $61 per barrel.  The increase in
oil prices , especially in the near term, is primarily attributable to heightened
geopolitical risk following recent events in Syria as well as increased tensionsbetween Saudi Arabia and Iran .  Informed by both the futures market and our
forecast of an appreciating dollar, our forecast for the price of imported oil has
been revised up $7 in the near term to $65 per barrel; thereafter , we expect oil
prices to decline about  $12 over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching
$53 per barrel by the end of 2020, only $2 higher than in our March Tealbook
forecast.
•
Metals
 prices have moved up since the March Tealbook.  The largest
increases were seen for  aluminum , with  prices  up 21 percent since our March
projection, largely in response to U.S. sanctions on Russia that targeted one of
the world’s largest aluminum producers.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
We estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 1¾ pe rcent in the first 
quarter after  rising  3 percent in the fourth quarter; this deceleration is more than

acc
ounted for by a marked slowdown in real PCE growth.2  We see the soft PCE reading 
in the first quarter as mostly  temporary and project real GDP growth to move back up to 
a 3 percent pace this quarter.  GDP growth over the first half of the year is about 
¼ percentage point less  than in the March Tealbook  but still faster than  its trend pace.   
Similarly , the recent lab or market data, on balance, suggest that resource utilization has 
continued to tighten, though by a little less than we had anticipated at the time of the 
March Tealbook.  All told, we project  that output will be  1¾ percent above its potential 
level in the current quarter —about ¼ percentage point lower  than we had  previous ly 
forecast .  For  the second half of the year , real GDP is projected to rise  at an annual rate of 
about 3 percent ; this rate is also a little lower  than in the March Tealbook, largely 
reflecting  a somewhat  slower pace of PCE growth  due to weaker incoming indicators of 
disposable income.3 
•Aft
er increasing at a 4 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, real PCE
appears to have risen only 1¼ pe rcent in the first quarter—about ¼ percentage
point less than we had anticipated in the March Tealbook.4  We continue to
believe that most of the weakness in first -quarte r consumption growth reflects
payback for the exceptionally strong four th-quarter growth and, there fore, see
the slowdown last quarter as mostly  transitory.   Correspondingly, w e
anticipate  that PCE  growth will step up to a 2¼ percent pace in the current
quarter  and then to 2½ percent in the second half, supported by continued job
gains and the boost to disposable income from the recently  implemented
personal income tax cuts and consistent with positive readings on consumer
sentiment.
2 The BEA ’s first estimate of GDP growth for 2018:Q1 will be released on Friday, April 27 , 
before the FOMC meeting . 
3 Incoming data on tax coll ections and transfer payments point to lower disposable income than 
we had previously expected, which restrain s projected PCE growth throughout the year .  (The tax receipts 
in the incoming data were stronger than anticipated, which could instead be interpr eted as a signal of 
stronger income ; however, those receipts often fail to track measured income closely at monthly or 
quarterly frequencies .)  These incoming receipts data are unrelated to the effect of the recently enacted 
tax cuts.  
4 March retail sales  came in weaker than we anticipated.  We were expecting a strong rebound in 
March because we judged that February retail sales had been held down by a timing shift of income tax 
refunds to EITC claimants in that month.  We have interpreted some of the Marc h miss as indicating a 
smaller and more delayed effect on spending from the timing shift of tax refunds than we had originally assumed.  Accordingly, we took a little bit of signal from the negative surprise for the pace of consumer 
spending and nudged down projected PCE growth in the second quarter.

•Busi
ness fixed investment appears on track to rise at a solid annual rate of
about 6 percent in the first quarter, close to last year ’s pace.  We expect
continued robust growth in coming quarters, consistent with rising business
output, supportive financial conditions, elevated business sentiment and profitexpectations, increases in drilling rigs in operation , and a modest boost from
tax legislation.
•
Res
idential investment is projected to edge lower, on net, over the first half of
the year .  Smoothing through the considerable volatility in these expenditures,
we anticipate that housing investment will increase a mode st 1 percent  this
year, held back by rising mortgage rates and a constrained supply of
construction workers and developable lots.
•We ex
pect real government purchases to be flat, on net, over the first half of
this year and then to rise  at a 2½ percent pace over the second half of the year.
The acceleration in these purchases largely reflects the recent federal budgetlegislation .

fourth quarter and are estimated to have increased at an annual rate of5¼ percent in the first quarter.  Recent import growth has been broad based,
leading us to expect the level of imports to remain elevated.  N et exports are
now a nticipated to subtract 0.2 percentage point from  real GDP growth in the
first half of the year, compared with a small positive contribution projected  in
the March Tealbook .
•
Manuf
acturing production increased at a solid  annual rate of about 3 percent
in the first quarter.  Although the national and regional new orders indexes
have moved down a bit in recent months, they remain consistent with
continued expansion in this sector.  Accordingly, we expect that
manufacturin g output will expand  at a moderate pace of about 2½ percent in
the current  quarter.
Over the medium term, we project that real GDP growth will slow from about 
2½ percent this year  and next to 2 percent in 2020, as monetary policy continues to 
tighten .  GDP growth over the next few years is supported by expansionary fiscal policy 
and solid foreign growth.

•Com
pared  with  the March Tealbook, our forecast  for real GDP growth beyond
2018 is unchanged, as r evisions to conditioning assumptions have been
offsetting.  In particular, the negative effects of the lower trajectory of equity
prices and higher oil prices are offs et by the positive effects of the lower
projected path s for interest rates and the dollar .
•Real
 GDP growth is projected to outpace potential growth throughout the
medium term, resulting in a further tightening of resource utilizatio n.  At the
end of 2020, real GDP exceed s its potential level by 3 ¼ percent —nearly
½ pe rcentage point less  than in the March Tealbook but still indicative of  a
very tight economy.
•Give
n the high degree of resource utilization in this projection, we continue to
assume that  supply constraints will begin to attenuate the transmission of
increased  aggregate demand into increased output and will contribute to
slightly higher consumer price inflation and wage growth over the medium
term.  With the small downward revision to agg regate demand in this forecast,
we now project these supply constraints to be a little less binding than in the
March Tealbook.
•Wit
h the federal government expected to run historically large and rising
deficits over the medium term, national saving is  projected to trend downward
as a share of GDP.  Nevertheless, private investment trends upward as a shareof the economy, with the gap between domestic investment and national
saving financed by inflows of foreign capital.

 Tealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 201 7 
Real activity in 2017 was somewhat stronger than anticipated by Tealbook 
forecasts, although the staff’s forecast  errors were generally small by historical 
standards .  Real GDP  grew at a slightly faster pace than the staff forecast one and 
two years ago, and the unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2017 than 
expected.  Despite the unexpected strength of real activity, core PCE price 
inflation last year was a bit lower than anticipated .   
The figure on the next page show s data and Tealbook forecasts for four economic 
variables:  real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total and core PCE price 
inflation.  For example, t he gray bars in the upper- left panel show the currently 
published Q4/Q4 percent changes in real GDP from 201 4 to 201 7.  The blue squares 
show Tealbook forecasts for GDP growth made in the April Tealbook one year 
earlier; green triangles show  the forecast from  the April Tealbook  of the 
contemporaneous year.   The whisker bands demarcate 70 percent forecast  error 
bands, and the top edge of a gray bar falling outside of the whisker band 
represents an unusually large forecast error.1  The red dots are BEA estimates  of 
real GDP growth from mid -April of the subsequent  year , and the red 70 percent 
bands show the magnitude of revisions  to that estimate relative to the BEA ’s 
current estimate.   
Real GDP growth in 2017 is currently estimated to be 2.6 percent , higher than 
Tealbook  forecasts from April 2016 and April 2017  (2.4 percent and 2.0 percent, 
respectively).  These forecast  errors , however, are historically  small, with real GDP 
well within the 70 percent whisker bands.  A possible explanation for faster -than-
expected real GDP growth last year is that f inancial conditions were more 
suppo rtive of economic growth.  For example, the April 2017 Tealbook projected 
the 10 -year Treasury yield to be 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of that year, 
whereas the 10 -year yield averaged only 2.4 percent in 2017:Q4.  Likewise, equity 
prices ended 2017 roughly 10 percent  higher, and investment -grade corporate 
bond spreads were narrower, than projected by the staff  that April. 
Consistent with faster- than -expected real GDP growth  last year, labor market 
conditions improved more than  anticipated .  As seen in the  top-right panel, the 
unemployment rate ended  the year at a lower level than the staff had forecast .  
Because t he April 2017 Tealbook forecast of the labor force participation rate was 
on the mark, the greater- than -expected improvement in the labor market is also 
reflected in the employment -to-population ratio and private- sector job gains, both 
of which were higher in 2017 than was forecast in April (not shown).  
The bottom row of the figure shows staff forecasts for total and core PCE price 
inflation and their confidence intervals, alongside the latest estimates.  Even 
                                                 
1 The whisker bands for real activity variables are calculated using Tealbook forecast errors 
since 1980; whisker bands around the inflation projections use forecast errors since 1998.

though the forecast errors for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate 
suggest that the economy tightened  more than the staff expected  last year, staff 
forecasts of the Q4/Q4 percent change in core PCE prices in 2017 were a little too 
high , as shown in the bottom -right panel.  The error in forecasting core PCE price 
inflation  is entirely explained by  lower- than -expected core goods prices , which  fell 
notably again last year despite a pickup in core goods import price inflation.2  In 
contrast, the staff’s projection of total PCE price inflation in 2017 was accurate, as 
higher- than -expected PCE energy prices in the last few months of the year offset 
lower- than -expected food and core goods prices.  
Finally, the faster- than -expected fall in the unemployment rate occurred at the 
same time that core PCE price inflation was lower than the staff could explain .  In 
response, the staff edged down its estimate of the natural rate of unemployment 
last year, 0. 2 percentage point cumulatively.   
2 The April 2017 Tealbook projection had already incorporated the large downward surprise 
to wireless telephone services prices seen in the March 2017 CPI release.

 monthly pace of about 200,000—somewhat faster  than last year ’s pace and 
well above the range of 85,000 to 115,000 that we judge to be consistent with 
no change in resource utilization.5  For t he current quarter, we now project 
that total payroll employment gains will average 1 95,000 per month—down a 
bit from  our previous projection. 
• The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent for a sixth consecutive month in 
March.  In recent months, the unemployment rate has surprised us a little to 
the upside.  In response, we have raised our near -term projection of the jobless 
rate a bit and now expect the unemployment rate to be 4.0 percent in the 
current quarter and 3.8 percent next quarter ; both rates are 0.1 percentage 
point higher than in our previous forecast.   
• The LFPR  ticked down in March  but has generally surprised us to the upside 
in recent months.  For the past few  years, the participation rate has moved 
essenti ally sideways, on net, indicating some tightening along this margin  
relative to its declining trend . 
We continue to expect the labor market to tighten further over the medium term in 
line with above-trend GDP growth. 
• Total payroll gains are projected  to sl ow gradually from an average monthly 
pace of about 195,000 this year to 160,000 in 2020, as GDP decelerates; this 
trajectory is a touch lower than in our previous forecast. 
• We project the unemployment rate to decline ½ percentag e point this year—
similar to  its decline in 2017—and to reach 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter, 
0.1 percentage point above our previous projection.  The jobless rate moves 
down further in 2019, ending the year at 3.3 percent, and then moves sideways in 2020.  The projected unemploym ent rate at the end of 2020 is 
0.2 percentage point higher than in our March Tealbook projection, consistent with the somewhat  narrower  output gap at the end of the medium term.  
                                                 
5 This range assumes that the LFPR declines in line with the staff’s estimate of its trend.  With an 
unchanged participation rate, the pace of monthly job gains required to keep the unemployment rate 
constant r anges from 130,000 to 160,000.

•The 
LFPR is projected to end this year at 62.7 percent and then move
sideways through 2020, as sustained job gains and rising real wages continue
to draw individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows.  At the
end of 2020, the LFPR is 0.6 percentage point above our estimate of its trendand unchanged from the March Tealbook.
•
We ha
ve continued to assume that, in an extremely tight labor market, a
larger -than-usual amount of the tightening in resource utilization  over the
medium term will manifest in a higher LFPR and workweek rather than in alower unemployment rate.

•We pr
oject that labor productivity in the business sector will increase an
average of about 1 percent per year over the forecast period—a touch faster
than its average pace over the past five years, though somewhat  less than our
estimate of its structur al pace.7
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
The incoming information on prices has been consistent with our view that 
transitory  factors held down inflation last year  and that  inflation is moving up this year .  
On balance, the latest news on prices has been a touc h higher than we anticipated.  
•Wit
h the March CPI and PPI now in hand and with the low March 2017
reading dropping out of the calculation, we estimate that the 12 -month change
in core PCE prices stepped up to 1.9 percent last month, 0.1 percentage pointhigher than we had projected in the March Tealbook.  W e expect the
12-month change to edge up to 2.1 percent  by June, also a little higher than in
the March Tealbook.
•
We n
ow estimate that total PCE prices rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months
ending in Ma rch, and we expect the 12-month change to move up to
2.5 percent by June .  Total PCE price inflation is higher than core inflation,
6 Were we to maintain our usual Okun’s law relationship, the unemployment rate at the end of the 
projection would be ¼  percentage point lower.   
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor  market becomes 
tight, possibly because workers hired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to 
workers hired during a slack labor market.

 reflecting previous large increases in consumer energy prices  and our 
expectation for further increases over the next few  months. 
• We expect core import prices to increase at a 3¼ percent pace in the first half 
of 2018—up from 1¼ percent in the second half of 2017—supported by 
recent declines in the dollar and consistent with the incoming trade price data.  We project core im port price inflation to slow to a 1¼ percent pace in the 
second half and to about ½ percent in 2019 and 2020, in line with moderate foreign inflation, a gradually appreciating dollar, and slowly declining 
commodity prices. 
• Incoming data on longer- term inflation expectations have moved little, on 
balance, since the March Tealbook.  Median expectations over the next 5 to 
10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 
unchanged at 2.5 percent in March and edged down to 2.4 percent in the 
preliminary April reading , close to where they have been over the past couple 
of years.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer 
Expectations reported that the median inflation expectation 3 years ahead was 
unchanged in March at 2.9 percent .  Finally, the TIPS- based measure of 5 -to-
10-year-forward  inflation compensation edged up  since the March meeting  
and stands at 2 .2 percent . 
Core PCE price inflation is on track to rise  to 2.0 percent in 2018, as the transitory 
factors that had been suppressing inflation last year abate and resource utilization 
continues to tighten.  Core inflation then edges  up to 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020, as the 
further tightening of the economy and a gradual increase in our judgmental underlying inflation trend more than offset restraint from the projected deceleration in core import 
prices . 
• With oil prices expected to edge lower over the medium term , we project t otal 
PCE price inflation to run a bit below core inflation  after this year and to be 
2.0 percent in 2020. 
• Relative to the March Tealbook, the medium-term forecasts for both core and 
total P CE price inflation have revised down a touch, reflecting the slightly 
lower degree of resource utilization  in this projection.  Nonetheless, we 
continue to assume  that the supply constraints that attenuate the transmission

 of aggregate demand into output in an extremely tight economy will also 
result in slightly higher inflation  than would otherwise be the cas e. 
We received little data on wages since the March Tealbook.8  Overall, we 
continue to view the information on labor compensation as consistent with a gradual 
acceleration over the past few years.    
• Average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the year ending in March, close 
to our estimate in the Marc h Tealbook.  We expect the 12 -month change in 
average hourly earnings to remain close to this pace through the summer . 
• The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker ticked up to 
3.3 percen t in March, near the middle of its range over the past couple of 
years but up from before then. 
• Over the medium term, growth in compensation per hour (CPH) is projected 
to step up from a pace of 3½ percent this year to around 4 percent in each of 
the next two years, as resource utilization tightens further.  Meanwhile, t he 
ECI, which is notably le ss cyclical than the CPH  measure, steps up from a 
2½ percent pace this year to 2¾  percent in 2019 and 2020.  Compared with 
the March Tealbook, these pro jection s are revised down a little , reflecting the 
slightly lower level of resource utilization in this forecast . 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be 
4.7 percent , and that potential output growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the 
longer run. 
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½  percent.  Yields on 10- year 
Treasury securities i n the longer run are assumed to stand at 3.4 percent.  
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer- term interest rates, though to a diminishing 
                                                 
8 The ECI for March will be released on April 27.  The GDP release on the same day wil l also 
contain information on labor compensation in the first quarter.

ext
ent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a 
normal size by mid -2021.  
•Wit
h these assumptions, real GDP growth slows further to 1½ percent in 2021
and 1 percent in 2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral
level  and the support from fiscal policy starts t o wane.  The unemployment
rate moves up gradually from 3 ¼ percent in 2020 toward  its assumed natural
rate in subsequent years.
•PCE
 price inflation hovers around 2.1 percent in 2022 and  2023 before edging
back down to the Committee’s long-run objective in later years.
•With 
output materially above its potential level and inflation slightly above
the Committee’s 2  percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to
about 5 percent at the end of 2021—2½ percentage points higher than its
assumed long- run value.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate moves gradually
back toward its long- run value.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
The foreign economies appear set for another year of strong gro wth in 2018, with 
growth projected to be close to 3 percent, virtually unchanged from 2017.  In the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs ), we estimate that, after growing a rapid 2½ percent 
last year, GDP rose at a still- solid annual ra te of 2 percent i n the first quarter, and we see 
growth maintaining this pace for the remainder of the year.  In  the emerging market 
economies (EMEs), GDP growth l ooks to have picked up from 3.4 p ercent in the fourth 
quarter to almost 4 percent in t he first quarter and should come in at nearly that pace in 
the next few quarters.  Beyond 2018, w e see aggregate foreign growth edging down a 
touch to settle at around its pot ential rate of 2¾ percent in 2 020.  
Our foreign outlook is little cha nged from the March Tealbook o n balance.  
Although economic indicators in the  AFEs have come in a little weaker than expected, 
we have seen positive surprises in some emerging Asian economie s.  So far this year we 
have not seen the sequence of upward revisions to our outlook that occurred last year.  
Nevertheless, we cannot exclude t he possibility that foreign growth could again exceed 
expectations, leading to a weakening of the dollar and a boost to the U.S. economy.  We explore such a development in t he “Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar” 
alternative scenario in the R isks and Uncertainty section. 
In the AFEs, rising retail e nergy prices helped boost headline inflation to an 
annual rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage po int higher than projected in 
March.  AFE inflation in the cur rent quarter has also been revi sed up to 2 percent on 
account of higher oil prices.  C ore inflation has picked up in Canada over the past few 
quarters but remains subdued in t he euro area and Japan.  With inflation pressures 
remaining contained over the next few years, we continue to ass ume only a gradual 
withdrawal of monetary policy s timulus in the AFEs.  In particu lar, the European Central 
Bank (ECB) is not expected to raise its policy rate until the s econd quarter of 2019.  
Moreover, we do not see the ECB , the Bank of England (BOE), or the Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) starting to reduce the size  of their balance sheets any t ime soon. 
In the EMEs, monetary policies ar e more diverse.  Some Asian central banks, 
after a period of very low polic y rates, are now raising rates with a pickup in growth.  In 
contrast, some central banks in Latin America, such as Brazil’s , have been cutting their

 policy rates in response to weakness in their economies.  The B ank of Mexico (BOM) 
remains in a tightening cycle i n response to significant overshooting of inflation relative 
to target and is expected to low er its policy rate only next ye ar. 
Further monetary policy tighteni ng by the Federal Reserve, as w ell as eventual 
policy normalization by other majo r central banks, will lead to an increase in global 
interest rates.  In our baseline, we expect global financial ma rkets to take this 
normalization in stride, with s overeign, corporate, and househo ld debtors able to adjust to 
higher debt service needs.  Howev er, a more substantial policy tightening by the Federal 
Reserve than in our baseline, per haps prompted by a faster-than -expected rise in inflation, 
could lead to turbulence in global financial markets and create  problems for debtors, 
especially EME corporates.  The consequences of such an outcome  are discussed in our 
“Global Tightening Tantrum” alternative scenario  in the Risks a nd Uncertainty section; 
additionally, the EME corporate debt situation is analyzed in t he box “How Risky Is 
Corporate Debt in Emerging Marke t Economies?”  Finally, we rema in attuned to other 
risks, including an eruption of trade wars or a sharp escalation of the geopolitical tensions 
in the Middle East that have  recently pushed up oil prices. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
Euro area.  Recent indi cators, such as industrial production and exports through
February, suggest that real GDP growth stepped down from 2.7 percent in the fourth
quarter to about 2 percent in the first.  However, with PMIs an d confidence indicators
for March still at levels consistent with solid economic activi ty, we project GDP
growth to edge up to 2¼ percent i n the current quarter.  GDP gr owth should then
gradually slow to 1¾ percent i n 2020, a bit above its potential  rate.  Compared with
the March Tealbook, this forecast is about ½ percentage point l ower in the first
quarter of 2018 and little ch anged thereafter.
Headline inflation increase d to 2.1 percent at an annual rate i n the first quarter,
temporarily boosted by a surge in energy prices.  Core inflatio n rose to 1.4 percent in
the first quarter from an unusually low print of 0.2 percent in  the fourth.  We expect
both headline and core inflati on to decelerate somewhat and the n edge up to
1¾ percent only by 2020, as resource sl ack gradually diminishes  and wage growth
firms.  Given this subdued inf lation outlook, the ECB has conti nued to communicate
the need for ample monetar y policy accommodation.  Accordingly,  we expect the

  ECB to continue its asset purchases until the end of 2018 and i ncrease its policy rate 
only in the second quarter of  2019 by 0.15 percentage point to negative 0.25 percent. 
 United Kingdom.  U.K. indicators also suggest tha t GDP growth has slowed a bit, to 
1¼ percent in the first  quarter from 1.6 percent in the fourth.   This estimate is 
¼ percentage point lower than in the March Tealbook, on weaker- than-expected 
construction and services indica tors, partly reflecting adverse  weather conditions.  
Growth is expected to increase to about 1¾ percent in the curre nt quarter, supported 
by a recent pickup in real wages.   
As we expected, the European Union (EU) and British authorities  agreed last month 
on a 21-month transition period aft er the official U.K. withdrawal from the EU next 
March.  During this transition the United Kingdom will stay in the EU’s customs 
union and single market but will be able to negotiate trade dea ls with other countries.  
As Brexit uncertainty fades, s upporting business confidence, an d with the help of 
accommodative monetary policy, economic activity should continu e to expand at just 
above its potential rate of 1½ per cent throughout the forecast horizon.  This 
projection is a touch weaker than in the March Tealbook, mostly  because of 
appreciation of the pound. Inflation in the first quart er declined to 2.5 percent from 3 p ercent in the fourth, 
mainly because of waning effects  of past currency depreciation.   We continue to 
expect that inflation will gra dually fall to the BOE’s 2 percen t target by the end of 
2020.  We anticipate that the BOE will gradually raise its poli cy rate from its current 
level of 0.5 percent, reaching 1¾ percent by the end of 2020. 
 Canada.  With the auto industry recove ring from earlier strikes and ma intenance 
shutdowns, we estimate that GDP growth edged up to 2 percent in  the first quarter.  
Although this pace is somewhat below our March Tealbook forecas t—partly owing to 
disruptions in the oil industr y—recent indicators, including th e Labour Force Survey 
and manufacturing PMI through Mar ch, point to continued solid m omentum.  We see 
growth staying close to 2 percen t through the forecast horizon.  
Inflation increased to 3.6 percen t in the first quarter, reflecting higher retail energy 
prices and increasing resource ut ilization.  We expect inflatio n to remain elevated at 
2½ percent in the current quarter  before slowing to 2 percent b y next year.  The Bank

How  Risky  Is Corporate  Debt in Emerging  Market Economies?  
Since 2007, nonfinancial  corporate  (NFC) debt in emerging  markets (EMEs) has tripled in dollar 
value, reaching $28  trillion in the third quarter of 2017.  Although  EME corporate debt  as a share 
of GDP has declined  slightly since 2016, it remains elevated at around 110 percent  of GDP (figure 1).  
A large majority of the increase since 2007 is accounted  for by China (the red line), where NFC 
debt has risen to 170 percent of GDP.  But NFC debt in the other EMEs has also risen notably (note 
the different  scale).  The rapid increase in  corporate debt  has raised concerns  about the risks this 
debt might pose  to EMEs and the global economy.  In  particular,  rising global interest rates, in 
part as advanced  economies  tighten monetary  policy, could lead to higher EME debt‐servicing 
burdens, weaker currencies,  capital outflows,  and lower earnings.   Such developments  could 
weigh on EME corporates,  especially  those that  are highly leveraged  or have high levels of dollar‐
denominated  debt, potentially  triggering loan losses,  bond defaults, and  broader financial  stress.   
We evaluate  the overall riskiness  of EME corporate debt  using the interest coverage  ratio (ICR), 
or the ratio  of earnings  to interest expense, which  measures  the capacity of  firms to  meet th eir 
interest payments  out of earnings.   Firms that are more profitable,  are less leveraged,  or have 
lower borrowing  costs will have higher ICRs, indicating  a greater  capacity to service  their debt.  
An ICR of 2 or less is typically associated  with an increased  likelihood  of distress.1  As shown in  
figure 2, since 2008,  the ICR for EME corporates  has declined,  on average,  amid weaker earnings  
and higher leverage.  As  a result, risky debt  of EME corporates—measured  as the debt of firms 
with ICRs  less than 2—has increased  as a share of GDP, with most  of that rise occurring  in China 
(figure 3).  Over the  past two years, the firming of global growth  has improved  earnings,  lowering  
the amount of risky  debt and facilitating  the orderly deleveraging  process currently  under way.   
1 For example,  just before the Asian financial crisis, firms in Korea,  Thailand,  and Indonesia  had an average  ICR 
of 2; see Michael Pomerleano  (1998) “Corporate  Finance Lessons  from the East Asian Crisis,” Viewpoint:   Public 
Policy for the Private  Sector Note 155 (Washington:  World  Bank, October), 
https://openknowledge.world bank.org/handle/10986/11531 .

 Nevertheless,  the share of risky debt  in China remains above what  was observed  in the East Asian 
economies  before the Asian financial crisis.  In other EMEs, debt at risk appears  manageable at 
less than 10 percent  of GDP.  However,  the threshold  at which debt  at risk starts  to be 
problematic  can differ across countries.  For  example,  while a country  may not have as much 
vulnerability  with respect  to its corporate  debt as, say, China,  it may also have relatively  less 
resources  to address problems  that may arise. 
How vulnerable  are EME NFCs to an increase  in borrowing  costs, perhaps  related to monetary  
policy tightening  in the advanced  econo mies?  To gauge these effects,  we use firm‐level data  and 
stress each firm’s  financials  by increasing  the average borrowing  cost 1 percentage point (the  
effects of which are shown  by the solid red portion of  the bars in figure 4).2  Except for China,  
where debt  at risk is estimated  to rise 20 percentage points  of GDP, this increase in  borrowing  
costs by itself would not be problematic.   But higher global interest rates might be  accompanied  
by broader financial  stress and slower EME growth, similar to what  is presented  in our “Global 
Tightening  Tantrum”  alternative  scenario  in the Risks and  Uncertainty  section.  To model these 
effects, we consider  two additional shocks:   reducing  earnings  20 percent (the effects  are shown 
by the red cross‐hatched portion of  the bars)  and imposing  a 20 percent exchange  rate 
devaluation on  the amount of debt that is denominated  in foreign currency  (the red hatched 
portion of  the bars).   Taken together,  the shocks double the share of overall EME risky debt in 
GDP to around  the level observed  for the East  Asian economies  before the Asian financial crisis.  
The increase  mostly reflects China.  But even outside  of China, the shocks more than double the 
amount of risky debt  in many EMEs.  
All told, a gradual  normalization  of monetary  policy in the advanced  economies, driven by  faster 
economic  growth, is not likely to cause significant  financing  problems  for EME corporates.   But a 
sharper rise  in interest rates accompanied  by broade r financial stress could be quite severe for 
EME corporates.   Such problems  could threaten financial  stability if they spill over to banks  and 
create an adverse  feedback  loop that the authorities  have trouble  containing.   
   
                                                 
2 Although  on the face of it this shock does not seem too large, it is applied to the average interest  rate on 
the entire existing debt,  not just on new debt.  Given  that the average interest rate for EME firms is about 
4¾ percent,  a 1 percentage  point rise increases  the interest expense about  one‐fifth.

 of Canada is expected to gradually raise its policy rate from 1 .25 percent to 3 percent 
by mid-2020. 
Japan.  Recent readings o
f industrial production and the manufacturin g PMI point to
a step-down in Japanese GDP gr owth to 1¼ percent in the first q uarter from
1.6 percent in the fourth.  We see GDP growth edging down furth er to just below
1 percent, still slightly above its potential rate, by mid-2019  before temporarily
turning negative as a result of  a long-planned consumption tax hike.  Compared with
the March Tealbook, this projecti on is just a touch down in the  first half of 2018 and
unchanged thereafter.
Inflation picked up further to 2.5 pe rcent in the first quarter, as retail energy and food
prices rose rapidly.  Still, wit h core inflation remaining quit e subdued, we expect
overall inflation to fall back t o ¾ percent over the remainder of the year.  Excluding
the effects of the consumpti on tax hike on inflation in the fou rth quarter of 2019,
inflation is expected to stabilize around 1 percent through 202 0, well short of the
BOJ’s 2 percent target.  We exp ect the BOJ to keep its deposit rate slightly negative
throughout the forecast period and to continue with asset purch ases.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
China.  Real GDP growth picked up to 7.1 percent in the first quarter , ½ percentage
point higher than in the Ma rch Tealbook.  Growth was boosted by  a recovery of
industrial activity, a s temporary curbs on pr oduction in heavily polluting industries
were lifted.  Exports also pi cked up from an already strong fou rth quarter.  We expect
growth to slow to 6¼ percent in t he second half of the year and  to 6 percent by 2020,
as export growth normalizes and as  the authorities’ efforts to reduce financial risks
and rein in local government  spending weigh on domestic demand.
We estimate that the propos ed U.S. section 301 tariffs on impor ts from China would
have a limited effect on the Chine se economy because the target ed goods, valued
roughly at $50 billion, account for a small share of China’s GDP.  (These tariffs
would be on top of the recently lev ied steel and aluminum tarif fs, which should have
even more limited effects.)  However, a substantial extension of tariffs—for example,
to all Chinese imports into the U nited States—would indeed pose  a material risk to
the outlook for China and the eme rging Asian region as a whole.

 Inflation fell to 1.5 percent i n the first quarter, almost one- half the fourth-quarter rate, 
mainly because of a decline in pork prices.  We see inflation m oving back up to its 
longer-term trend of 2½ percent by t he middle of this year.  Al though China’s 
proposed retaliatory tariffs on its imports from the United Sta tes add an upside risk to 
this forecast, we expect the effect of these tariffs on prices to be limited. 
Other Emerging Asia.  After slowing significantly at the end of last year as high-t ech
exports moderated,  
real GDP growth is estimated t o have jumped to 4½ percent in th e
first quarter from 3.2 percent in the fourth, driven by renewed  strength in the region’s
overall exports.  While export  growth and industrial production  have been strong,
recent PMIs point to weaker momentum going into the second quar ter.  We expect
growth to moderate to a tre nd pace of 3¾ percent by next year.
Mexico.  Recent solid indicators, such as construction through February 
as well as
both manufacturing and services P MIs, suggest a continued recov ery from the
hurricanes and earthquakes tha t occurred last year.  We estimat e that GDP expanded
2¾ percent in the first quarter , a small step-down from 3.2 percent in the fourth,
mainly because of a slower expansion of exports through February.  We see growth
picking back up to about 3 perc ent by early 2019, held up by strong external demand,
diminished drag from fiscal cons olidation, and stronger private  consumption as
falling inflation boosts real wages.
Headline inflation declined to 4.1 percent in the first quarter  from over 5 percent in
the second half of last year and nearly 10 percent a year ago.  The decline in inflation
over the past few months reflect s the effects of  monetary policy tightening, peso
appreciation, and the fading effect of previous hikes in food p rices.  Despite falling
inflation, the BOM kept its  policy rate on hold at 7.5 percent in mid-April rather than
cutting rates, citing continued con cerns that adverse developme nts, such as an
unfavorable outcome of NAFTA nego tiations or financial volatili ty associated with
Mexican elections in July, could l ead to renewed peso depreciat ion.
Brazil.   After taking a breather in the  fourth quarter, B razil’s econo my appears to
have resumed its gradual clim b out of the country’s deepest recession on record.  W
e
have penciled in growth of 2¼ percent in the first quarter amid  a surge in exports,
solid PMI readings, and improved c onsumer confidence.  We expect the pace of
activity to pick up graduall y and reach 3 percent by 2019, supp orted by global
demand, particularly for Brazil’ s commodity exports.  Political uncertainty remains

 the major downside risk, especi ally given the urgent need for p olicymakers to tackle 
the country’s fiscal problems amid an unpredictable outcome of the upcoming 
October presidential election.  T he front-runner of this electi on, former President Luiz 
Inácio Lula da Silva, was impris oned earlier this month for cor ruption and i s likely to 
be eliminated from the race. 
Amid considerable economic slac k, inflation remained subdued at  about an annual 
rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter, somewhat below the inflation target.  The 
central bank is expected to cut its policy rate at its next meeting in May to a record low of 6.25 percent.

Financial Market Developments 
Domestic equity markets continue d to experience he ightened volatility over the 
intermeeting period as a result of  developments in U.S.–China t rade policy and the 
technology sector, thoug h they were consider ably less volatile than in early February.  On 
net, however, market participan ts’ outlook for monetary policy and economic growth 
appears to be la rgely unchanged.  
A straight read of m
arket quotes shows that the probability of a rate hike at the
June meeting increased somewhat to 85 percent, with two hikes p riced in
between now and the end of this year.
The nominal Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, driven p rim
arily by an
increase in short-term yields, as longer-term yields were roughly unchanged.
Carry-adjusted TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation in creased over
the period.
Broad U.S. equity price indexes edged down on net.  The VIX has  declined
since the March FOMC m
eeting, though it is high compared with l ast year,
and realized volatility of equity p rices remained elevated rela tive to its
average over the past few years .  Credit spreads on investment-grade
corporate bonds were little changed, while thos e on speculative-grade bonds
narrowed a bit.
Conditions in foreign financial markets were not much changed since 
the last
FOMC meeting.  Foreign equity price s exhibited notable fluctuations and
ended the period modestly higher ou tside of emerging Asia.  Longer-term
foreign sovereign yields moved little, and the broad dollar dep reciated
slightly.
Rates in short-term dollar fundi ng markets remained elevated bu t do not seem
to indicate credit risk concer
ns.  Changes in rates and volumes over quarter-
end were relatively muted.

 POLICY EXPECTATIONS AND ASSET MARKET DEVELOPMENTS  
Domestic Developments  
FOMC communications over the in termeeting period were generally  viewed by 
market participants as refl ecting an overall upbeat outlook for  economic growth and as 
consistent with a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation.  The 
FOMC’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at the 
March meeting was widely anticipated.  Nevertheless, the market  reaction to the March 
FOMC communications was consistent with slightly more accommoda tive policy than 
expected, as the median target rate path in the March SEP implied three rate hikes in 
2018 whereas some investors had a nticipated four rate hikes.  S ome investors pointed to 
the median of participants’ SEP  projections for core PCE inflat ion rising above 2 percent 
in both 2019 and 2020 as an indication of the Committee’s willi ngness to continue along 
a gradual path of incre ases in the target range for the federal funds rate even if inflation 
temporarily moves above target.  M arket reaction to the release of the March FOMC 
minutes later in the intermeeting period was minimal. 
Domestic data releases over th e intermeeting period generally e licited limited 
market reaction.  Total nonfarm payr oll employment in the March  Employment Situation 
report came in notably below reported market expectations, but market commentaries 
attributed the weakness in part to weather-related effects.  Th e average hourly earnings 
component of the March employment report and the March CPI both  printed largely in 
line with expectations.  
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts sh ows that the market-
implied probability for the next  rate hike occu rring at the Jun e FOMC meeting moved up 
to around 85 percent since the Ma rch FOMC meeting.  OIS-implied  federal funds rates 
unadjusted for term premiums sugge st that two rate hikes are priced in between now and 
the end of this year, while a sta ff model that adjusts for term  premiums implies three 
hikes.  Implied rates at the end of 2019 and 2020 were about un changed.  
The nominal Treasury yield curve  flattened a bit further over t he intermeeting 
period, with yields on 2-year Tre asury securities up 11 basis points and yields on 10-year 
Treasury securities higher by 3 basis points.  The spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury securities stands at a bout the 20th percentile of its distribution since 1990.  If 
adjusted for term premiums, the difference between the two rate s is currently at about the

  40th percentile of its distribution since 1990.1  TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation increased on net. 
Measures of option-implied volatility on long-term rates contin ued to decline over 
the intermeeting period after the ir marked increase earlier thi s year, and they are now 
close to the levels se en late last year.  
Following the sharp increase in e arly February, realized volati lity in the equity 
market remained somewhat elevat ed due in large part to news rel ated to trade policy.  
However, the S&P 500 index declin ed only a bit over the period on net.  Equity prices 
deteriorated as trade tensions  between the U.S. and China escalated early in the 
intermeeting period, although prices subsequently improved as t ensions showed signs of 
easing.  Additionally, negative technology sector–related news and concerns about 
increased government oversight of  the sector reportedly weighed  on investor sentiment, 
though the sector ended the peri od only slightly lower than the  broader index.  Bank 
equity prices declined about 4 pe rcent over the intermeeting pe riod and underperformed 
broad equity indexes, on net, lik ely reflecting concerns about trade policy, tepid loan 
growth, and weaker-than-expecte d trading revenues.  One-month-a head option-implied 
volatility on the S&P 500 index—t he VIX—declined but remained a t elevated levels 
relative to the previous year, e nding the period at approximate ly 16 percent.  
Volatility in the equity market did not spill over into the cor porate bond market.  
On days with large negative eq uity returns, spreads on high-yie ld corporate bonds 
changed less than would be expect ed from their historical relat ionship with stock prices.  
On net, spreads on yields of invest ment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury s ecurities increased 3 basis points and declined 13 basis 
points, respectively.

  Foreign Developments  
Global equity markets were volat ile since the March FOMC meetin g, with 
investors in foreign markets also attuned to developments relat ed to trade policies 
between the United States and C hina and to news about the U.S. technology sector.  On 
balance, foreign equity price movements were mixed, long-term f oreign sovereign yields 
were generally little changed, and the broad dollar depreciated  slightly over the period.  
In Russia, although the currency d epreciated sharply and equity  prices fell following the 
introduction of the new round of U .S. sanctions, stresses in Russian markets did not spill 
over to other financial markets.  
Net changes in foreign equity pr ices did not exhibit a strong o verall pattern.  
Japanese and European broad equi ty indexes outperformed their U .S. counterparts, 
ending the period somewhat highe r.  Equity price indexes in Mex ico and other Latin 
American countries were modestl y higher, while those in some em erging Asian 
countries—which may be more directly affected by a potential de terioration in U.S.–
China trade relations—were lowe r.  On balance, capital continue d to flow into emerging 
market mutual funds and emergi ng market bond spreads were littl e changed.  Measures 
of implied volatilities of foreign equities fluctuated since th e previous FOMC meeting 
and ended the period somewhat lower.  
Over the intermeeting period, market-based measures of policy expectations were 
generally little changed in the  advanced foreign economies, with most of their central 
banks still expected to gradually move toward less accommodativ e monetary policy over 
the next couple of years.  Long-te rm sovereign yields in the ad vanced foreign economies 
also showed little movement.     
On net, the broad dollar index de clined about ¾ percent, largely because 
relatively positive news about the current round of NAFTA negot iations led to 
appreciation of the Mexican pes o and Canadian do llar, two curre ncies with large weights 
in the dollar index.   
At the March quarter-end, money market conditions in Europe and  Japan were 
characterized as in line with e xpectations and consistent with previous quarter-end 
dynamics.  Over the intermeeti ng period, three-month currency swap basis spreads, 
which at times have indicate d dollar funding pres sures abroad, narrowed to the lowest 
levels in recent years.  Market p articipants attributed the dec line to continued decreases in

effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate continued to trade in the 
upper third of the t arget range, while r epo and Treasury bill r ates remained elevated.  
Because elevated rates on other short-term investments offered an attractive alternative 
for market participants, take- up at the Federal Reserve’s ON RR P facility remained 
subdued, averaging about $7 billion per day excluding quarter-e nd.   
The Federal Reserve Bank of New  York began publishing three new overnight 
Treasury repo rates on April 3, 2018 (see the box “New Overnigh t Treasury Repo 
Rates”).  
Money market dynamics over quarte r-end were muted relative to p revious 
quarter-ends.  The effective fe deral funds rate dropped only 1 basis point, in contrast to 
the typically observed declin e of around 9 basis points.2  Foreign banks and dealers 
usually reduce their activit y in funding markets on quarter-end  to improve their 
regulatory ratios around reporti ng dates.  Such behavior was mu ted at the end of March, 
which reportedly led to relativel y small movements in rates and  volumes, and contributed 
to the all-time-low quarter -end ON RRP take-up of $33 billion. 
The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet normalization has continued as scheduled.  
Market participants reported no no table effect on money markets , Treasury yields, or 
option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS as a result of the normalization process.  Since the start of balance sh eet normalization through March 20 18, the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of Treasury securitie s have decreased by $40 billion, and its holdings of agency 
securities have decreased by $16 b illion.  Consistent with the Committee’s Policy 
Normalization Principles and Pla ns, the monthly caps on reducti ons of Treasury and 
agency securities increase d in April to $18 billion and $12 bil lion, respectively. 
                                                 
2 The Good Friday market holiday on March 30 coincided with the March quarter-end and could 
have contributed to thes e atypical dynamics.

 Recent Pressures in Money Markets 
The upward pressure on private money market rate s, beyond that driven by expected monetary 
policy , persisted over the intermeeting period .  In unsecured markets, the London interbank 
offered rate ( LIBOR ) and rates on commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit  
(CDs) remained abnormally high  relative to overnight index  swap (OIS) rates of comparable 
maturities , particularly at  tenors exceeding one month .  In secured markets , Treasury repo rates 
remained elevated relative to the effective federal f unds rate, and the spread is  also very  high  by 
historical standards.  Table 1 show s that a variety of private spreads are currently near the top end s 
of their historical ranges .  Since the March FOMC meeting , however, spreads on  Treasury bills  
narrowed some, wide ning  the gap between private money market rates and th ose on  Treasury 
bills, as show n in figure 1.    
Several factors may have contributed to the wide spreads for private instruments, although none 
appears to fully explain the unusually high level of current spreads.  First, the surge in Treasury bill 
supply in the first quarter appears to have pushed Trea sury and unsecured private rates higher, and 
the effects on private rates may be lingering temporarily even as bill issuance has slowed and rates have edged down.  Consistent with such a view, spreads on forward rate agreements, or FRAs, over

 Figure 2  
 
 
OIS, shown in figure 2, suggest that the LIBOR –OIS spread is expected to narrow in coming months.  
Increased Treasury supply also appears to be an important factor in pressuring secured rates 
higher, as dealers had to finance sizable issuance in February and March.  
In unsecured markets, a second  poss ible factor is that anticipated tax -induced repatriation flows 
may have reduced offshore demand for private money market securities with longer tenors, and 
aggregate demand for these securities would fall if repatriated cash is put to other uses.  Anecdotal 
reports from dealers suggest that cash -rich nonfinancial firms have shifted holdings toward very 
short -dated instruments.  In contrast, data  from the offshore money market fund (O MMF) sector 
only weakly support  the repatriation story.  OMMF assets under management have declined in 
recent weeks, but the funds do not appear to be shifting away from longer- dated assets in 
anticipation of further outflows, as weighted average maturities are little changed. 
Other possible explanations are less compelling.  Some market participants have suggested that 
the base erosion anti- abuse tax, or BEAT, which may effectively penalize  foreign banks  that raise 
funds through foreign affiliates —and thus encourage raising short -term funds in U.S. markets —
might eventually boost unsecured rates.   But the effects of the tax are unlikely to have materialized 
yet, and issuance of CP and CDs has not increased in recent months. A nother p ossibility is that 
credit risk has driven  rates  higher.  However, staff analysis of the historical relationship between 
changes in three -month L IBOR –OIS spreads and aggregate credit default swap (CDS) spreads of 
the largest banks  indicates that t he recent  modest widening of these CDS spreads explain s only a 
trivial fraction of the LIBOR –OIS widening.  Moreover, conversations with market participants have 
not suggested  any heightened credit -risk concerns.

 New Overnight  Treasury  Repo  Rates 
On April 3, 2018, the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York began  publishing  three  new overnight  
Treasury repo rates.  The purpose  of the new rates is to increase the transparency  of repo market 
trading by providing  interest rate  and volume measures  that cross the major repo market 
segments.   All of the repo rates exclude transactions  in which the  Federal  Reserve is a 
counterparty,  such  as take‐up at the ON RRP facility. 
The Tri‐Party General Collateral Rate  (TGCR) covers  the “triparty”  segment in which securities  
dealers borrow cash  directly from investors,  including  money market funds,  in trades facilitated  
by a third‐party clearing bank.  The Broad General Collateral  Rate  (BGCR) includes all transactions  
in the TGCR and also includes blind‐brokered  transactions  between  dealers that occur on the 
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s  (FICC) GCF Repo service.  
The Secured Overnight  Financing  Rate  (SOFR)—the  blue line in the chart—measures  the general 
cost of financing  Treasury securities  over night across  all repo market segments  for which data  are 
available,  providing  the broadest  coverage  of the repo market.   A broad Treasury repo rate  was 
previously  not available to the public.  The SOFR is calculated  from all transactions  in the BGCR, as 
well  as bilateral transactions  that are cleared  by the FICC.  The  SOFR excludes bilateral 
transactions  that are executed  at very low rates because  such  trades tend to be motivated  by the 
lender’s  need to obtain  a specific security as collateral  rather than the need to invest cash. 
In June 2017, the Alternative  Reference  Rates Committee  selected the SOFR as its recommended  
alternative  to U.S. dollar  LIBOR, which is currently  referenced  in derivatives  contracts  with  about 
$190 trillion of notional value as well  as $10 trillion of loans and securities.   The transition  from 
LIBOR to SOFR  is expected  to take a number of years, and daily publication  of the rate  is a key 
step in the process.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Data received over the intermeeting period continue to indicate that financing 
conditions for businesses and households remain  supportive of economic activity . 
• Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative.  
Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was strong in March , 
and equity issuance was robust.  The extension of bank credit to busine sses 
increased  following relatively weak growth in January and February.     
• Conditions in the residential mortgage market remained supportive of financing for most borrowers.  For borrowers with low credit scores, conditions remained  
tight but have continued to ease gradually .   
• Growth in consumer loans modera ted early this year from the  more rapid pace 
seen late last year , and banks responding to the April Senior Loan Officer 
Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices  (SLOOS ) reported tighter standards 
for both credit card and auto loans.  Nonetheless , on the whole, f inancing 
conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of growth in 
household spending.   
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative over 
the intermeeting period.  Corporate bond spreads continued to be low by historical 
standards, and following a somewhat subdued start to the year, g ross issuance of  
investme nt-grade corp orate bonds was strong in March.1  Issuance of speculative- grade 
debt was also solid in March, in line with its av erage volume over the past few years.   
Institutional leveraged loan issuance in February and March was strong, largely reflecting 
strength in demand from investors , including considerable funding for M&A activity .  
Spreads on new issues of lower -rated institutional loans were roughly unchanged over the 
intermeeting period , while spreads for higher-rated loans narrowed a li ttle further.   
                                                 
1 In particular, one very large M&A -related issue of $40 billion was reportedly well  received by 
investors, suggesting that substantial market demand remains  for investment -grade corporate debt.

  Growth in banks’ commercial and industrial (C&I ) loans strengthened in March, 
following relatively weak growth in January and February.  Nonetheless, respondents to 
the April SLOOS reported that  C&I loan demand continued to weaken over the f irst 
quarter .  Banks that experienced subdued demand often reported that businesses were 
generating more funds internally or  shift ing their borrowing to other lenders.  (For a 
discussion of the effect of the recent rise in short-term funding rates on financing conditions more generally, see the box “Possible E ffects of the Recent I ncrease in Short-
Term Funding R ates on Financing Conditions for  Businesses and Households.”)  SLOOS 
respondents continued to report easing standards and terms on C&I loans, most often citing  
increased competition from other lenders as the reason for doing so.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations was essentially stable over the 
intermeeting period, although the ratio of aggregate debt to assets remain s near 
multidecade highs.  The six-month trailing bond default rate ticked up in March to a level 
in line with that seen about a year ago, while the KMV expected year -ahead default rate for 
March was roughly unchanged from February and stood just below the median of its historical range.   The outlook for corporate earnings remains very favorable.  Wall Street 
analyst forecasts imply  that earnings for S&P 500 firms are expected to be about 
20 percent higher in 2018 than in 2017, with part of the increase reflecting lower 
corporate taxes .   
The pace of equity issuance through initial and seasoned offerings was robust in the 
first quarter.  Announced stock repurchases over the past two quarters were at their highest levels in two years, suggesting that companies are expect ing to distribute to shareholders at 
least part of the increased cash they anticipate from lower corporate taxes and repatriation  
of earnings held abroad.  
Small Businesses     
Small business credit conditions remained  fairly accommodative over the 
intermeeting period.  Standards for C&I loans to small businesses eased modestly in the 
April SLOOS .  Although credit demand remains weak relative to pre -crisis levels, it has 
shown signs of strengthening, and lending activity has increased in rec ent months.  Loan 
originations —as measured by the three-month moving average of the Thomson 
Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index —rose in February, leaving the series about 
10 percent higher than a year ago.  Loan performance in this sector remains strong.

 Possible Effects of the Recent Increase in Short -Term Funding Rates on 
Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
The elevated level of short -term funding rates  relative to what would normally occur with  
monetary policy  tightening —as  discussed in the box  “Rece nt Pressures in Money Markets”  in 
the Financial Market Developments section —could serve to tighten financing conditions for 
business and household s.  Here w e assess  the channels through which this might occur.  
One potential channel is an increase in  the direct  cost of borrowing  new funds  or servicing 
existing debt.  Borrowers’ financing costs could increase in short -term funding markets, such 
as commercial paper, or on  financing instruments whose costs are tied to short -term rates, 
such as floating -rate loans or lines of credit. 1   Longer- term borrowing rates could also 
increase if lenders  expect short -term rates to remain elevated over a longer period.  To date, 
longer- term borrowing rates have not appeared much affected by recent ly elevated short -
term spreads .  Moreover, forward contracts suggest that investors do not expect the elevated 
spreads to persist for long.   
For households, a relatively modest share of  debt is tied to short -term rates that have 
experienced abnormal upward market pressure.  Fewer than  20 percent  of outstanding 
residential mortgages have adjustable rates , and fewer than 10 percent of new originations 
have adjustable rates.  The majority of adjustable- rate mortgages are indexed to LIBOR, and a 
minority of households with adjustable- rate mortgages could experience higher costs  as their 
loan rates  reset .  In contrast,  floating  interest rates on credit cards and home equity  lines of 
credit are typically indexed to the prime rate—an administered rate that has risen with the 
federal funds rate but has not experienced abnormal upward market pressure.  Most of the 
outstanding auto  and student  loans have  fixed rates and, thus , do not  have rates that would 
directly increase along with recently  elevated short rates.    
For businesses, direct borrowing in commercial paper represents a very small proportion —
around 2  percent —of total borrowing by nonfinancial firms.  However, f loating -rate loans  are 
common for businesses, and costs on such loans have increased with  elevated short rates.  As 
the table on the next page shows, around 80  percent of commercial and industrial (C&I) and 
commercial real estate (CRE) loans outstanding at the larg est banks  have floating rates.  The 
majority of these floating -rate loans are tied to LIBOR —typically , the three-month LIBOR.  
While borrowing through floating -rate debt is more common for businesses, for many firms it 
still represents a relatively small share of their total borrowing.  Over 60  percent of borrowing 
by large firms occurs through corporate bond markets in which interest rates are longer- term 
fixed rates , and a round one -third of CRE borrowing occurs though nonbank loans or CMBS 
with fixed rates.  Smaller firms tend to be more dependent on bank loans for financing.  
                                                 
1 Higher short -term rates could also serve to boost the income of investors in these funding instruments.  
The extent to which this extra investment income serves to offset higher borrowing costs of businesses and 
households depends on the marginal propensi ties of these investors to spend additional investment income 
relative to the marginal propensities of the borrowers to spend.

 Overall, while some businesses have experienced higher financing costs, the recent increase in 
some short rates will not likely  result in a large, direct increase in debt service burdens.  Staff 
analysis on the potential effects of a larger and more persistent rise in short -term rates than 
has actually occurred indicates that debt service burdens  for businesses and households  
would only rise a modest amount .2  Moreover, b orrowers who do rely more heavily on 
floating -rate debt could potentially substitute toward fixed -rate debt or switch to floating -rate 
debt tied to short -term rates not experiencing the same upward pressures, such as the one-
month LIBOR , serving to reduce the effects of elevated short -term spreads on direct 
financing  costs .  
A second, less direct  channel  through which the recent  upward pressure on  short -term rates 
could tighten financing conditions is reduced lending or higher- cost lending by financial 
institutions experien cing higher funding costs .  For example, financial institutions originating 
new loans could set loan rates higher to offset any increase in  their funding costs  or could 
choose to originate less loans .  The extent to which this may occur  depends on how much  of 
an increase in funding costs financial institutions experience.  At present, it does not appear 
that banks’ funding costs have risen appreciably, as most such  funding comes in the form of 
deposits , but b anks and other financial institutions that are more reliant on wholesale funding 
could see an increase in their funding costs.   
Overall, the recent upward pressure on short -term rates does  not appear to have affect ed the 
borrowing costs or capacity of most households and businesses , and staff analysis s uggests 
that elevated short -term rates will not have a long -term effect on financing conditions.  The 
staff will continue to track developments in short -term funding markets an d monitor changes 
in financing conditions.

  Commercial Real Estate  
Conditions for commercial real estate ( CRE ) financing remained  accommodative 
over the intermeeting period .  CRE loan growth at banks ticked up in the first quarter, 
driven mainly by strong growth at small domestic  and foreign banks.  Regarding the 
components of CRE loans, construction and land development loan growth weakened, 
while growth in nonfarm nonresidential loans and in multifamily property loans rose.  
Respondents to the April SLOOS reported easi ng standar ds on multifamily and nonfarm 
nonresidential loans , along with somewhat weaker demand for nonfarm nonresidential 
loans and construction and land development loans . 
Taking a longer-term view, banks responding  to special questions in the April 
SLOOS about changes to CRE lending policies and demand over the past year reported 
having eased  lending terms, including offering lower spread s of loan rates over the cost of 
funds and larger maximum loan size s, across all three major CRE loan categories.  Almost 
all banks  that eased CRE credit policies  cited more aggressive competition from other 
institutions as an important reason.  Banks reporting weaker demand  for CRE loans cited 
shifts in borrowing to other credit sources and rising interest rates  as prominent reasons.   
Spreads on commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) were little changed 
over the intermeeting period and remained  near their post -crisis lows.   CMBS issuance has 
continued to be strong through March, although the low volume of loans maturing in 
coming quarters may reduce demand for refinancing (and hence issuance) going forward.  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on balance , 
over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on general obligation bonds over comparable-
maturity Treasury securities were roughly unchanged .  Gross issuance of municipal bonds 
in March recovered a bit from its low January and February levels but was still somewhat below levels typically seen  in March.  The w eak municipal bond issuance so far this year 
likely is a consequence of  very high December issuance, which was driven by concern that 
pending tax legislation would remove the tax -exempt status of private activity bonds.  (T he 
final legislation did not alter the tax status  of such bonds.)

 HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative 
for most borrowers.  For borrowers with low credit scores, conditions have continued to 
ease.   For example, the maximum debt- service- to-income ratio that low -score mortgage 
borrowers can obtain has risen steadily for the past several years.  However, credit still remains relatively tight for these borrowers , and the volume of mortgage loans ext ended to 
this group remains low.  For  the overall mortgage market, rates on 30- year conforming 
mortgages edged down about 5 basis points since the March FOMC, roughly in line with yields on longer- term Treasur y securities .  However, mortgage rates remained around 
60 basis points higher than in December and more than 100 basis points higher than in the fall of 2016.  Consistent with these higher rates, refinanc ing activity continues to be muted, 
and the growth in mortgages for home purchases  has slowed over the past year.  Banks 
responding to the April SLOOS reported weaker demand across most residential real estate 
(RRE ) loan categories , while standards were reportedly about unchanged for most RRE 
loan types.  
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions for consumer credit have, on balance, remained supportive of 
growth in household spending.  However, some indicators continue to point to a tightening 
trend in the past several quarters.  
Growth in consumer loan balances has moderat ed from the mo re rapid pace seen 
late last year.  In particul ar, credit card loan growth slowed significantly in early 2018 after 
growing brisk ly in the fourth quarter of 2017.  Indeed,  respondents to the April SLOOS 
reported  that standards and terms on credit card loans tighten ed further , and demand for 
these loans weakened  in the first quarter.  In addition, interest rates on credit card accounts 
continued to trend up, reflecting  in part pass -through from tightening monetary policy.  
Nonetheless, on balance, credit card debt remained readily available to prime- rated 
borrowers but tight for subprime borrowers. 
Respondents to the April SLOOS continued to report tighter standards and terms on 
auto loans at banks as well as weaker demand.  That said, acro ss all lenders, growth in auto 
loan balances remained solid over the past few months, al though originations of auto loans 
to consumers with nonprime credit scores appeared to continue to shrink.  In addition, 
evidence from the Michigan survey suggests that only a modest share of consumers cited 
tightening credit conditions or rising interest rates as factors discouraging car purchases.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF  RISKS
As in the March Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of 
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark 
used by the FOMC.  Although financial market volatility remains elevated— reportedly 
reflecting, in part , uncertainty about trade policy—uncertainty about fiscal policy has 
diminished with the enactment of the appropriations bill that funds government 
operations through September.   
We continue to judge the risks around our projection for real GDP growth as 
being balanced.  On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater 
expansion in economic activity than expected in the baseline.  On the downside, given 
that the economy is already operating above its potential level and resource utilization is 
projected to tighten further, those fiscal policy changes could provide less impetus to the 
economy than assumed in the baseline.  Similarly, we see the risks around our 
unemployment rate forecast as balanced.  Although we assume, with the economy 
operating above the level associated with full employment, that the unemployment rate 
will decline a bit less than would be expected given the rise in the output gap, the shift 
toward other margins of resource utilization could be greater than we anticipate.    
Alternatively, it is possible that the unemployment rate will exhibit a more typical 
relationship with the output gap— or decline even more if the high-pressure economy 
leads to a further reduction in the natural rate of unemployment. 
Consistent with our judgmental assessment, estimates of the distribution of risks 
around our GDP and unemployment rate forecasts conditional on available indicators, 
shown in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk,” are not particularly wide or 
skewed.  Indeed, one important source of downside risk to real activity has diminished 
significantly in recent years:  A s presented in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk 
Estimate,” stochastic simulations around the baseline path in the FRB/US model indicate 
that the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) sometime over the next three 
years is only about 9  percent.  If the ELB risk were computed around the median federal 
funds rate path from the FOMC’s March SEP, the estimated probability would be 
17 percent.

With regard to inflation, we still see average uncertainty and balanced risks 
around our projection.  With the estimated 12-month change in core PCE prices having 
moved up to 1.9 percent in March, the risk that last year’s softness in inflation could 
prove to be more persistent than we assumed has abated somewhat.  However, there is 
still a risk that the inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting could 
currently be lower than in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming years as we 
have assumed.  To the upside, with the economy projected to be moving further above its 
long-run potential, inflation may increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with 
the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.  
Our judgmental assessments of typical uncertainty and balanced risks are consistent with 
the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which  judges the overall financial 
vulnerabilities in the United States and overseas to be moderate.  Vulnerabilities from 
leverage in the U.S. financial system, as well as from liquidity and maturity 
transformation, appear low; in particular, banks are highly capitalized and hold 
substantial amounts of high-quality liquid assets.  However, asset valuation pressures in 
the U.S. are elevated despite easing since early February’s period of increased market 
volatility, and they also appear stretched in a number of foreign economies.  In addition, 
there are some potential sources of vulnerability in the U.S. nonfinancial corporate 
business sector.  In particular, corporate debt relative to nominal GDP is at the upper end 
of historical experience and risk pre
miums on corporate bonds are compressed relative to 
their average since the mid-1990s.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the 
baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario illustrates the 
outcomes of a recession in which the effects are amplified by leverage constraints on 
financial intermediaries that curtail the supply of credit.  The second scenario examines 
the negative consequences of supply constraints that could arise when labor markets are 
very tight for an extended period.  In contrast, in the third scenario, running the economy 
“hot” for a while leads to persistent positive ef fects on the productive capacity of the 
economy— a form of “positive hysteresis.”  In the fourth scenario , we illustrate a 
downside risk to inflation associated with the possibility that households and businesses

have lower inflation expectations than in the baseline because they perceive that 
monetary policy will be too tight to sustainably return inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  In the fifth scenario, we consider the possibility that 
faster tightening in U.S. monetary poli cy, prompted by a pickup in inflation, leads to 
financial turbulence in vulnerable emerging market economies and a stronger 
appreciation of the dollar.  The s ixth and last scenario analyzes the effect of stronger 
foreign growth and a weaker dollar. 
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of five staff models that embed 
different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.1  (For a discussion of forecast errors 
over the past year from two staff models, see the box “FRB/US and EDO Forecast 
Errors” at the end of this section.)  In all scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by 
the same policy rule as in the baseline.  In addition, the size and composition of the 
SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios. 
Financial-Based Recession [Gertler, Karadi Model]2 
The last three QS reports have highlight ed that asset valuations are elevated and 
that leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is an area of potential vulnerability, 
although overall financial vulnerabilities are judged to be moderate and commercial 
banks are well capitalized.  In this scenario, we move beyond regulated deposit-taking 
institutions and consider risks to the intermediation sector, including shadow banks.  W e 
assume that there is a correction in asset prices that reduces intermediaries’ capital, which 
tightens leverage constraints and further disrupts the supply of credit.   In addition, this

credit crunch is accompanied by a loss in confidence by businesses that is reflected in the 
model by exogenous shocks to investment.    
Under these circumstances, intermediaries’ net worth falls 2 0 percent and 
corporate bond spreads increase 200 basis points during 2018.  Investment drops 
10 percent and GDP contracts at the end of this year and continues to fall until the end of 
2019 before rebounding.  The
 unemployment rate rises ½ percentage point above the 
baseline at the end of 2018 and peaks at 7 percent in 2019 before slowly returning toward 
the baseline.  Inflation slows only a little relative to the baseline,  because the Phillips 
curve is flat and monetary policy provides substantial accommodation.   Even under the 
inertial Taylor rule assumed here, the federal funds rate decreases 2 percentage points in 
response to the rapid increase in slack and comes within 25 basis points of the ELB.  
Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, Trigari Model] 
In the baseline projection, the unemployment rate declines to 3¼  percent by the 
end of 2019 and remains below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate for a number of 
years.  However, with the e
conomy operating so far above its potential, it is possible that 
supply constraints will begin to emerge and that these constraints are not fully captured in 
the baseline projection.  In particular, when the unemployment rate is unusually low, 
filling a vacancy becomes more difficult, which could imply a reduced pace of hiring and 
a substantially steeper rise in wage growth.  In this scenario, we illustrate these risks 
using simulations from a nonlinear New Keynesian model with costly search and 
matching frictions in the labor market.3  In this model, recruiting costs and wages are 
higher when the unemployment rate is low because firms have to spend more time and 
resources looking for workers and have to raise wages to attract them. 
In such an environment, the unemployment rate stays roughly constant at 
4 percent until the end of 2020, ½ percentage point above the baseline; thereafter, it 
returns to its natural rate.  GDP growth is close to the baseline until the end of 2020 
because, in this model, more-intense utilization of capital compensates for the reduction 
in labor input.  Growth slows after 2020 as the unemployment rate rises toward its natural 
                                                 
3 See also Nicolas Petrosky-Nadeau and Lu Zhang (2017), “Solving the Diamond-Mortensen-
Pissarides Model Accurately,” Quantitative Economics,  vol. 8 (2 ), pp. 611–50, who show that simulations 
from a standard search-and-matching model deliver state-dependent responses to shocks:  The 
unemployment rate responds less to shocks when the initial state of the economy is “hot” compared to an 
initial state with substantial labor market slack.

rate.  Inflation is significantly higher because of stronger wage growth and peaks at 
3¼ percent in 2020.  Monetary policymakers are assumed to infer resource slack from the 
unemployment rate, and consequently the federal funds rate is kept close to the baseline 
as the effects of higher inflation and less tightness in the labor market are largely 
offsetting. 
Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]  
In contrast to the previous scenario, the hot labor market in the baseline projection 
is assumed in this scenario to have persistent positive effects on the productive capacity 
of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as “positive hysteresis.”  Specifically, 
we assume that persistent exposure to a hot economy reduces exits from the labor force 
and generates additional entrants, causing the trend labor force participation rate to rise 
about 1 percentage point above the baseline by the end of 2023.  Furthermore, we assume 
that the experience that workers gain through greater employment lowers the natural rate 
of unemployment ½ percentage point by the end of 2023.   Both of these favorable 
developments are assumed to be recognized in real time by monetary policymakers.4 
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ¼ percentage point more 
per year over the projection period than in the baseline.  This additional room to grow 
allows real GDP growth to run at a similar increment above the baseline.  As a result, the 
output gap is little changed.  The unemployment rate is close to the baseline until the end 
of 2019 because increases in labor force participation  offset gains in employment.  After 
2019, the unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory and is about ¼ percentage point 
below the staff projection by 2023.  With inflation and the output gap roughly at the 
baseline, the federal funds rate is little changed.5 
                                                 
4 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the 
natural rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-
generating compo nents. 
5 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential 
output, the federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching 
5¼ percent by the end of 2021.  In that case, real GDP growth would be ¼ percentage point lower, on 
average, between 2020 and 2023 than in this scenario , with the unemployment rate ¼ percentage point 
higher than in this scenario.  Inflation would still remain close to the baseline.

Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model] 
Headline inflation, as measured by the change in PCE prices, has been below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective for most of the past five years and averaged only about 
1¼ percent during that period.  In the baseline projection, we have assumed a small, 
gradual rise in inflation expectations.  However, in light of the persistently low inflation 
of the past several years, there is a risk that the public perceives the stance of monetary 
policy as being too tight to sustainably achieve the 2 percent objective.  In this scenario, 
we assume that current longer-run inflation expectations are ¼ percentage point lower 
than in the baseline and remain that low for an extended period of time.   
Lower inflation expectations cause actual inflation to run ¼ percentage point 
below its baseline path during the simulation period.  Consequently, the federal funds rate 
increases less than in the baseline; even so, expected real interest rates are initially 
slightly higher because inertia in the assumed policy rule prevents the federal funds rate 
from adjusting more rapidly.  As a result, real GDP growth is a touch lower in 2018 than 
in the baseline, and the unemployment rate runs slightly higher through 2023.    
Global Tightening Tantrum [SIGMA]  
In our baseline, we see the spillovers of ongoing U.S. policy tightening as likely 
to be manageable for most foreign economies.   However, there remains a significant risk 
that faster U.S. policy tightening than investors expect could exert sizable disruptive 
effects on global financial markets and the global economy.  This scenario considers the 
possibility that higher-than-expected U.S. inflation causes investors to quickly revise 
their expectations about the stance of U.S. monetary policy, causing global bond term 
premiums to rise and the prices of risky assets to decline, with pronounced adverse 
spillovers especially to emerging market economies (EMEs).  
Specifically, our scenario assumes that U.S. core PCE inflation runs at around 
2½ percent through 2018 and prompts the FOMC to remove policy accommodation 
somewhat faster than in the baseline.6  These developments boost term premiums on 
longer-term government bonds as well as spreads on corporate bonds in both the United 
States and abroad.  Tighter global financial conditions weigh on foreign economies and 
6 The scenario embeds transient monetary policy shocks, which allow for a somewhat faster initial 
rise in the federal funds rate than implied by the inertial Taylor rule.

progressively turn investor attention to underlying EME vulnerabilities, including 
stretched asset valuations and elevated corporate debt levels in some economies.  EMEs 
experience large capital outflows and sizable depreciations of their currencies later this 
year as declining confidence fuels an ongoing flight from EME assets.  All told, foreign 
GDP growth runs 1½  percentage points below the baseline in 2019, while the broad real 
dollar appreciates by about 7 percent.   
Weaker foreign activity, the appreciation of the dollar, and tighter financial 
conditions restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States.  U.S. GDP 
growth moderates to 1 percent in 2019, about 1½ percentage points less than in the 
baseline.  Core PCE inflation peaks at 2¾  percent in 2019 and then moves down to ward 
the 2 percent target.  Starting in 2020, the federal funds rate edges down, falling below 
the baseline path.  
Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dollar [SIGMA]  
Over the past year, the dollar has fallen despite higher U.S. interest rates and 
prospects for substantial U.S. fiscal stimulus.  In part, th is depreciation reflects solid 
foreign growth and the anticipation of policy normalization abroad.  Going forward, our 
baseline forecast is for the dollar to appreciate, as the federal funds rate rises more steeply 
than markets expect.  However, it is possible that foreign growth will exceed expectations 
and put further downward pressure on the dollar.  In this scenario, we assume that foreign 
GDP growth rises to about 3½ percent in 2018  and 2019 , and thus averages about 
¾ percentage point higher per year than under our baseline projection.  Increased 
optimism about the durability of the foreign expansion— and the perception of 
diminished tail risks—cause the broad dollar to depreciate by 10 percent relative to 
baseline by the end of 2019, reversing most of the rise in the dollar that began in  
mid-2014.  
U.S. real GDP expands around 3 percent in 2019, about ½ percentage point more 
than in the baseline, as the weaker dollar and stronger foreign growth boost U.S. real net 
exports.  The unemployment rate falls to 2¾  percent by the end of 2020.   Higher import 
prices and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE inflation to reach 2½ percent in 
2019.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the baseline, increasing to 
5½ percent by the end of 2020.

FRB/US and EDO  Forecast  Errors 
This discussion reports  real‐time forecast errors for the FRB/US  and EDO models over the 
past four years and compares  them with the errors in the judgmental  Tealbook  
projection.   The forecast errors from the models are then decomposed  into contributions  
from the structural  shocks inferred by the models to identify  the key drivers of  the 
misses.   
The figure reports the point forecasts  and 70 percent confidence  intervals  of the 
Tealbook  projection  and of the FRB/US and EDO model projections  of real GDP growth,  
the unemployment  rate, and total and core PCE inflation for 2014 through  2017, 
computed  using the Tealbook  and model forecasts  as of the April Tealbook  of the

 In the figure, the  gray bars represent  the currently  published  data, the purple squares 
and whisker bands  show the real‐ time forecasts  and 70 percent confidence  intervals  of 
FRB/US, the  blue circles and whisker bands  show the counterparts  for EDO,  and the 
green triangles  and whisker bands show the counterparts  for the Tealbook  forecasts.1 
The FRB/US and  EDO forecast errors are, on average,  somewhat  larger than the Tealbook  
forecast errors, and neither model uniformly  dominates  the other one in forecasting  
performance.   Overall, like  the Tealbook  forecast, both models underpredicted  real GDP 
growth and overpredicted  the unemployment  rate in 2017, with the  largest error for  GDP 
growth found in FRB/US and the largest error for the  unemployment  rate found  in EDO.  
These forecast errors are within the 70 percent real‐ time confidence  intervals  of these 
models as indicated  by the whisker bands.  However,  the realized unemployment  rate is 
located very close  to the lower bounds of the 70 percent confiden ce intervals  of all the 
forecasts, including  the Tealbook  projection.2 
FRB/US did well in  forecasting  both total and core PCE inflation.   From 2014 to 2017, its 
root mean squared  errors are 0.2 percentage point and  0.3 percentage point,  
respectively, which  are smaller than or  equal to those  of the EDO and Tealbook  
projections.   That said, both  models viewed inflation as having been surprisingly  weak in 
2017 and to a  greater exten t than the judgmental  projection,  particularly  in the case of 
core inflation.   It is notable that both  models made forecast errors for core PCE inflation 
outside of  or very close to the lower bounds  of the 70 percent confidence  intervals.3 
The FRB/US model attributes  the higher‐than‐expected  GDP growth in 2017 to stronger‐
than‐expected  private spending  and stronger  foreign factors, such as  a weaker dollar and  
stronger net exports.  The EDO  model largely  attributes  the upward surprise in GDP 
growth last year to a low  risk premium  and a somewhat  stronger  transient  improvement 
in productivity.   Because  the two sources  of stronger  GDP growth have opposite  
implications  for slack, the EDO model attributes  the bulk of the forecast errors in both 
total and core PCE  inflation to “own”  shocks in the non‐energy price  equations;  in other 
words, the surprise could not primarily  be explained  by the forecast errors in other 
conditioning  variables  such as slack.  The FRB/US  model also views the downside  
surprises  in inflation as  originating  directly from the price equations.   
                                                 
1 The confidence  intervals for EDO  and FRB/US are generated  via stochastic  simulations.   For 
FRB/US, the simulations  sample from historical  equation  residuals.   For EDO, they  draw  from the 
distributions  of shocks, model parameters,  and latent state variables.  
2 The improvement  in the forecasting  accuracy for unemployment  in the EDO  model in 2016 relative 
to the two previous years is linked to a revision of the assumed steady‐state level  of unemployment  to 
align it with the Tealbook  assumptions  about  the natural rate of unemployment  at that time. 
3 Note that the staff had seen the very low March CPI by the time of the April Tealbook  in 2017, even 
though the PCE prices  for March were not themselves  published  yet, so that information  was built into 
the Tealbook  projection.   While  the staff took on board the implication  of the weak incoming  data for 
the second quarter  core PCE inflation, the models  did not, which could be one source of the larger 
model forecast errors for core PCE inflation.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  In the near term, the revisions to the strategies’ 
prescriptions are small.  Over the medium term, the Tealbook baseline projection features 
slightly lower levels of resource utilization and inflation  than the projection made in 
March ; consequently, all strategies call for lower  policy rates during coming years than 
their counterparts in the previous Tealbook.  A special exhibit reports the prescriptions of 
several flexible price- level targeting  rules .  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the “balanced 
approach” rule) , the Taylor (19 93) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a nominal income 
targeting (NIT) rule .  These near -term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap and core inflation, shown by the black lines in the middle 
panels .  The top and m iddle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal 
funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.1  
•The near -term prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and the Taylor (1993) rules
are about unchanged from their March  Tealbook levels because the effects of
the staff ’s small downward revision to the output gap offset those of the
staff’s modest upward revision to inflation in coming quarters.
•The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules , which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules  in the appendix to this section.   Except for the 
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that 
are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

    1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection"
report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the March 2018 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baselineprojections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

 •The prescriptions of the first- difference rule are a bit lower  than in March
because the output gap is now pr ojected to  widen at a slower rate over the
coming year.
•Under the NIT rule, the federal funds rate responds to the output gap and the
shortfall of the GDP price deflator from the level  it would have attained had it
increased  at an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011; the shortfall in
the GDP price deflator in coming quarters is about 2¼ percent.   Unlike the
other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which  call for raising the federal
funds rate in the near term, the NIT rule, in an effort to eliminate the shortfall
in the GDP price deflator, prescribes a level for the federal funds rate in the
second and third quarters that remains  within  the current target range.
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL
FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March  2018 Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).2  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used  
to generate an  estimate  of r*.  The r*concept , labeled  “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting in 
the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  
This concept of r* is a summary of  the projected  underlying strength of the real 
economy; because it is based on a single criterion , it does not take into account other 
considerations, such as  achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the 
federal funds rate. 
•At a bi
t under 3½ percen t, the estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* in
this quarter is  almost ½ percentage point below the corresponding value
computed using information from the March Tealbook.  Th e downward
revision reflects the fact that the projected output gap in the current Tealbook
2 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the March 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth 
and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the 
SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 is a bit more than ¼ percentage point lower, on average, through 2021 than in  
the March  Tealbook.  
• At about 1½ percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower 
than the Tealbook-consistent FRB /US r*.  The difference stems from the fact 
that the SEP-consistent projection has  output exceeding  potential by a 
considerably smaller amount over the medium term than does the current  
Tealbook forecast .  This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact 
that the median path for the real federal funds rate implied by SEP projections 
averages  almost 1  percent age point lower than  the corresponding path in the 
Tealbook. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (199 3) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the NIT rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.3  The 
simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following the prescriptions of that rule in the future and that financial market 
participants, price setters, and wage setters anticipate  that monetary policy w ill follow 
through on this commitment and  are aware of the implications for interest rates and the 
macroeconomy.4  The exhibit also reports the extended Tealbook baseline projection.   
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate rises to about 2½ percent 
by the end of this year.  Over the subsequent two years, it increases by about 
1 percentage point per year, bringing the rate close to 4¾ percent in the fourth 
quarter of 2020. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding 
                                                 
3 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic s imulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.  
4 In generating these simulations, we assume that the public immediately and correctly 
understands the implications of the FOMC adopting a particular policy strategy.  In the real world, the 
adoption of a particular policy strategy by the FOMC might well entail a period during which  the public 
learns the new strategy and its macroeconomic implications.  We abstract from considerations of this kind.

 Tealbook baseline values through early  2022.  This higher path is associated 
with only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10 -year Treasury yield than 
in the baseline through the middle of 2020, as the Taylor (1999) rule calls for 
somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate for a sustained period later in 
the simulation period.  Because wage and price setting today is influenced by 
expected future outcomes in FRB/US, current inflation is a touch higher as a 
result of the somewhat more accommodative policy stance later in the 
simulation  relative to the Tealbook baseline projection.  The resulting path for 
the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook baseline path  over the next 
few years, but subsequently takes a bit longer to return to its natural rate. 
•The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the
federal funds rate.  Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to
projected output exceeding its assumed potential level , the prescriptions of
this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown,
though they are higher than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years.Starting in the fourth quarter of 2020, the path for the federal funds rate falls
below the baseline path for a sustained period.  As a result, current inflation is
higher, and the real 10- year Treasury yield is lower , than  their corresponding
values in the Tealbook projection.  The more accommodative conditionsengender a more pronounced undershooting of the unemployment rate below
its natural rate  beyond the medium term.
•The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule is
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baselin e through early  2020 but
runs below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter divergence
occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the expected
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to projected  output
exceeding its assumed potential level by progressively smaller amountsbeyond the next three years.  The associated lower path of the federal fundsrate, in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies
lower longer -term real interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline and
therefore higher levels of resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first-
difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are lower,and outcomes for inflation that are higher, t han the corresponding outcomes in
the Tealbook baseline projection.

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to

 • The NI T rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation (as 
measured by the rate of increase in the GDP price deflator) from an annual 
rate of 2 percent since the end of  2011.  Compared with the Tealbook 
baseline, the NI T rule calls for a markedly slower pace of increases in the 
federal funds rate in order to generate a somewhat higher rate of inflation in 
coming years and thereby gradually undo the 2¼ percent cumulative shortfall 
of inflation from 2 percent since th e end of 2011.  Because the simulation 
embeds the assumptions that policymakers  can credibly commit to closing this 
gap and that financial market participants , price setters,  and wage setters  
correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates, the 
path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate is lower than under the other policy 
rules and the Tealbook baseline for several years .  Accordingly, the path for 
the unemployment rate is  substantially lower  than  in the Tealbook baseline 
and all other simulations shown, dropping to  2¾ percent in 2021. 
• Relative to the March Tealbook, the prescriptions of the simple rules are 
between  ¼ and ½ percentage point lower by the end of 2021 because of the 
lower projected path of the output gap.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.5  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.6   
Three of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for the 
federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection, for two reasons .  First, 
high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up 
to its natural rate , because in the FRB/US model, the unemployment rate does not 
                                                 
5 The box “Optimal Control and t he Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.  
6 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that will not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are  time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 respond strongly to changes in real interest rates, a feature that is consistent with recent 
historical experience.  Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be 
understood and fully credible, the front -loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.  
However, in practice, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as high and as 
quickly as  prescribed by the first three optimal control policies, macroeconomic 
outcomes could be less benign than shown here because of the confusion and financial market disruption that such an abrupt change in policy m ight engender .
7  In contrast, the 
fourth optimal control policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels  last 
experienced during the 1950s; such a development  might also entail outcomes different 
from those predicted by the simulations.  
• The first  simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable 
undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate over the next several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with  
the equal -weights loss function judge to be costly.
8  The small p rojected 
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail 
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.  
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates  only 
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the reaction  of 
inflation to the level of resource utilization is limited.  
• The second  simulation , “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five times larger than the specificatio n with equal weights but is otherwise 
                                                 
7 The simulation results  hinge on the assumptions that agents in the model have perfect foresight  
and are certain that policymakers will implement the prescribed path for the federal funds rate.  While these 
assumptions may be reasonable approximations under some circumstances, they may not be valid for 
historically extreme changes in the federal funds rate, particularly those prescribed by the optimal control exercise that places only a minimal penalty on adjustments in the federal funds rate.  
8 When we use the March 2018 SEP -consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal 
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5 percent, compared 
with about 8  percent under the Tealbook baseline.

 identical to that specification.  The resulting optimal strategy is only 
marginally  more accommodative than in the “Equal weights” case, even 
though the losses associated with undershooting the inflation objective are 
larger  in coming years.  There are two reasons that the prescribed path for the 
federal funds rate is not materially altered even though the weight on inflation losses is substantially higher than in the “Equal weights” case.  First, inflation is already close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, and , second , in the 
FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff  because inflation 
responds only weakly to resource utilization. 
•
The thir
d simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  Thissimulation seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even fasterthan under the equal -weight s specification.  As a result , the federal funds rate
soars to about 11½ percent  at the end of 2018 and then averages  around
7 percent from 2020 through 2023.
•
The f
ourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when theunemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path ofthe federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control
simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path
throughout the period shown.  With the asymmetric loss function,policymak ers choose this initially more accommodative path for the policy
rate because their desire to raise inflation to 2  percent is not tempered by an
aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  The tighter labormarket helps bring inflation to 2 percent more quickly than in the case of
equal weights.  Starting in the middle of the 2020s (not shown), the
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as
policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from theprolonged period of elevated resource utilization.

 ILLUSTRATING FLEXIBLE PRICE-LEVEL TARGETING RULES 
The following pages discuss several monetary policy rules that target the price 
level rather than the inflation rate.   Price- level targeting rules aim to reverse deviations of 
inflation from policymakers’ objective  rather than let ting “bygones be bygones.”  Such 
rules have been studied as a form of commitment to making up shortfalls of policy 
accommodation following an episode w hen the policy rate was constrained by the lower 
bound or, more generally , as a means for increasing the predictability of future price 
levels.  The NIT  rule discussed earlier  is an example of a flexible price -level targeting 
(FPLT) rule  that not only seek s to stabilize a n aggregate price index around a target path 
but also responds to a measure of resource slack .  The nominal income gap can be 
decomposed into the sum of a price gap (the difference between the output price index and a target path) and the output gap; under the NIT rule, by design, equal ly sized 
movements in the se gaps call for  the same adjustments in the federal funds rate.
9  In the 
NIT rule simulation shown in the exhibits, the target path for prices is anchored in 
2011:Q4, just before the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation objective, and 
grows at a 2 percent annual rate thereafter.10 
Because it is derived from nominal GDP, the NIT rule uses a GDP -based price 
measure for its price  gap along with  the output gap as its measure of real activity.   
However, under FPLT rules, the interest rate could respond to other price indices  or 
measures of  resource utilization .  As an illustration, the  fourth exhibit considers three 
FPLT rules that respond to the price gap measured using core PCE prices and to the 
unemployment rate gap.11  The three FPLT rules vary in the ir response coefficients to  the 
price gap and the unemployment rate gap and in  the reference date for their target path 
for the price level.   The first rule, “FPLT, large response to ugap (2011:Q4),” responds 
twice as much to the unemployment rate gap as to the price gap, while the second rule, 
“FPLT, equal responses,” reacts to both gaps in equal measure.  As in the NI T rule, both 
9 Under this implementation of the NIT rule, the target path of nominal GDP is adjusted for 
changes in potential output growth.  Nominal GDP targeting is sometimes understood as targeting a path 
for nominal GDP that grows at a constant rate , in which case variations in potential output would call for 
offsetting adjustments in inflation.   
10 As shown in the appendix to this section, these  assumptions imply that the price gap can be 
expressed as the cumulative miss of output price inflation from 2 percent since the beginning of 2012.  
11 The unemployment rate gap is defined as the unemployment rate minus the natural rate of 
unemployment.  The  FPLT rules respond to this gap with a negative coefficient, so that when the 
unemployment rate is higher (lower) than its natural rate, the FPLT rule prescribes a lower (higher) interest rate.

 of these FPLT rules seek to make up deviations in inflation from  its 2 percent objective 
since the beginning of 2012.12  The third rule, “FPLT, large response to ugap  (2017:Q4),” 
reacts to the unemployment rate and price gap s as in the “FPLT, large response to  ugap 
(2011:Q4) rule,” but seeks to make up deviations in inflation from 2 percent only since 
the beginning of this year.  The panels in the fourth exhibit report results from d ynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model under t he FPL T rules, the NIT rule, and the Tealbook 
baseline rule.  
•The e
conomic outcomes under the “FPLT, large response to ugap (2011:Q4)”
rule are very close to those under the NIT rule because the initial price gapsmeasured using core PCE prices and GDP prices are very similar , at about
2¼ percent , and because these two rules respond roughly equivalently to the
cyclical position of the ec onomy.
13  Both FPLT rules  call for a more gradual
increase in the federal funds rate than the Tealbook baseline projection.Given a more accommodative policy —and because , in these simulations,
policymakers credibly commit to sustaining accommodation until th e price
gap is significantly reduced —inflation increases  immediately and runs higher
than in the Tealbook baseline for a number of years.  Low real interest rates
also spur faster growth of economic activity , and the unemployment rate
undershoots the baseline projection by about ½ percentage point in 2021.
•
Under
 the “FPLT, equal responses  (2011:Q4) ” rule, the path for policy is even
more accommodative than the path under the “FPLT, large response to ugap
(2011:Q4 )” rule  because policymakers lean less strongly against the
unemployment rate undershooting its natural rate.  As a result, inflation rises
and real activity booms, with the unemployment rate dropping to nearly
2¼ percent in 2021, about 1 percent age point below the baseline projection .
The pri ce-level gap is closed notably more rapidly in this instance than under
the “FPLT, large response to ugap (2011:Q4)” rule.
•The 
“FPLT, large  response to  ugap (2017:Q4)” rule prescribes a path for the
federal funds rate that is nearly identical to the Tealb ook baseline path.
12 The appendix to this section details the calibration of the FPLT rules.  
13 In particular, the FRB/US model roughly satisfies the empirical regularity known as Okun’s law 
by generating changes in the unemployment gap that are roughly half as large and of the opposite sign as 
changes in the output gap.  Hence, a coefficient of negative 2 on the unemployment gap has similar 
implications to a coefficient of 1 on the output gap in a FPLT rule.

 Unlike the rules with a 2011:Q4 anchor date for the price level, there is only a 
small initial price gap  to which policymakers would respond.  Moreover, in 
the baseline projection, inflation remains  close to 2  percent , and the 
responsive ness of this FPLT rule to resource slack is about the same as in the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule that is used to construct the baseline projection.  As 
a result , the paths for the unemployment rate and inflation under this FPLT 
rule and the baseline rule are very similar .  Relative to the policy prescriptions 
from the other two FPLT rules, the path of the federal funds rate is 
considerably higher.   
• While the outc omes for the “FPLT rule, large response to  ugap (2017:Q4)” 
and the inertial Taylor (1999) rule under the baseline projection are very similar, the prescriptions from these two rules could diverge markedly in other 
scenarios.  For example, in the face of a large  and negative demand shock, the 
FPLT rule shown here would be considerably more accommodative than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, leading to higher output and lower unemployment 
for some time after the shock.
14 
• Overall, the simulations show that the FPLT rules that respond to a price gap measured using core PCE prices and the unemployment rate gap can give rise 
to a variety of economic outcomes, including outcomes similar to those under the baseline Tealbook projection.  In a downturn with a prolonged period of 
inflation below the 2 percent target, all of the FPLT rules would provide a large amount of accommodation  compared  with rules in which inflation 
bygones are bygones, such as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  Of course, the efficacy of FPLT rules relies heavily on the assumptions that policymakers 
can not only credibly commit to such policies and communicate them clearly 
but also that the public understands and anticipates their effects.  
The final  four exhibits  tabulate the simulation resu lts for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adher e to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict a dherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymake rs and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various tradeoffs policymakers may face when pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES  SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
routinely reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies  section.  It also reports the expression for the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule ; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a 
small temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline projection.  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  The right -hand- side variables include the s taff’s projection of trailing four -quarter 
core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the 
output gap estimate for the current period ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead

 annual change in the output gap ( ∆4𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation 
objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.    
The nominal income  targeting rule responds to a nominal income gap, which is defined 
as the difference between nominal inco me, denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡 and measured as 100 times the log of the 
level of nominal GDP , and a target value , denoted 𝑦𝑦𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡∗ and measured as 100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP.  Target nominal GDP in 2011:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate 
of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage p oints per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the nominal income gap can be approximated  as 
the sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level it would ha ve attained had it grown at a 2 percent annual pace since 2011:Q4.

Simple Rules  
The
 first two of the selected rules were studied  by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rules have been 
featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2   
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.3  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule 
do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003).

where ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑠𝑠 denotes the annualized quarterly rate of growth of the GDP deflator for quarter s.

3 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same  360-day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365- day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.  Taylor (1999) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡

  NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES 
The “Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projec tions for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quart ers.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines :  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .
4  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s e xogenous variables.  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection , the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
                                                 
4 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts 
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (201 6).

 by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market par ticipants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemploym ent gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor , 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large 
weigh t to inflation gaps.  The third  specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places 
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
5  The fourth  specification, “ Asymme tric 
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the 
unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the 
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights 
used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on 
the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
5 The inclusion of a minimal but strictly positive weight on changes in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see s this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits.  
FLEXIBLE PRICE-LEVEL TARGETING RULES 
The table “FPLT Rules” shown below gives expressions for two flexible price- level 
targeting rules reported in the exhibit, “Illustrating Flexible Price -Level Target ing Rules.”  In the 
table, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a rule for quarter t.  The right -hand-
side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four- quarter core PCE price inflation for 
the current quarter, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡, and th e longer-run real interest rate, 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿.  The price gap is computed as 
the difference between the core PCE price level , 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the target path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  For the rules in the 
exhibit with the 2011:Q4 anchor date, the  2011:Q4 value of the target path  is set to  the 2011:Q4 
value of the core PCE price level , and , subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual 
rate.  The target path is set in an analogous fashion for the rule with the 2017:Q4 anchor date.  
The unemployment gap is the differ ence between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s 
estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡∗.

Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum        of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
        household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
        to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
