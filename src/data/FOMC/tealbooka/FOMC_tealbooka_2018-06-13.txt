 Domestic  Economic  Developments and Outlook  
The economy continues to expand at an above- trend pace .  We judge that the 
economy is currently operating somewhat above its sustainable level and will move 
further beyond this level over the medium term; we expect inflation will run close to 
2 percent on a sustained basis over the medium term.   
In the labor market,  payroll employment gains in April and May averaged 
191,000 per month, substanti ally above the pace we estimate to be consistent with no 
change in resource utilization .  During the same period, t he unemployment rate fell to 
3.9 percent in April and then further to 3.8 percent in May after having held steady at 
4.1 percent  over the previous six  months.  Meanwhile, the incoming spending data led us 
to revise up our projection for real GDP growth in the first half of this year by 
½ percentage point to an annual rate of 2¾ percent .   
Our projection that the economy will expand at an  above-trend pace over the 
medium term reflects the influence of expansionary fiscal policy and solid foreign 
growth .  We forecast that real GDP growth will slow from  2¾ percent this year to 
1¾ percent in 2020 as monetary policy continues to tighten.  The projected average pace 
of growth over the next three years is a little less than in the April Tealbook, primarily in response to the higher exchange value of the dollar in this projection; we have also 
assumed that supply constraints will hold back GDP growth a bit more than in the 
previous Tealbook.  Even so , by the end of the medium term, real output is projected to  
be 3 percent  above our estimate of  its potential.  Correspondingly, the unemployment rate 
is expected to be 3. 4 percent at the end of 2020, 0.1 percentage point higher than in our 
previous projection but nonetheless about 1¼ percent age points below our estimate of its 
natural rate.  
Consumer price inflation has moved up from the low readings seen last year.  
Core PCE prices rose 1.8 percent ov er the 12 months ending in April , and we expect the 
12-month change to edge up to 2 percent this summer .  Core inflation is projected to rise
to 2 percent in 2019 and to 2.1 percent by 2020 as resource utilization tightens further
and underlying inflation inches up.  T otal PCE price s are expected to increase 2 .1 percent
this year , a little more than core prices, boosted by an increase in  energy prices .  After
this year , total inflation —at 1.9 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in 2020—is restrained a

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for real GDP growth in 2018 is the same as the projections 
from both the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus 
and a touch higher than the Blue Chip in 2019.  The staff’s unemployment rate forecast 
is 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point below  the outside forecasts in both 2018 and 2019.  The 
staff’s projection s for total CPI inflation in  2018 is a touch higher than the outside 
forecasts  and the same as the outside forecasts for 2019.  T he staff forecast s for total 
and core PCE inflation are the same or lower than the forecasts from the SPF.   
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includ es input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the March  FOMC meeting.  The table below compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the March  Tealbook.  
Incoming data for GDP growth have been a little stronger than  our expectations  in the 
March Tealbook , while data on the labor market have been mixed, with a lower 
unemployment rate but also slower payroll growth on average.  O ur projection  for real 
activity over the medium term has been revised  down , reflecting somewhat weaker financial 
conditions (a stronger dollar and lower equi ty prices) as well as the small rethinks that we 
built into the current Tealbook  regarding both supply constraints  and consumer spending 
from the recent tax cuts.  Thus, resource utilization, as measured by  the unemployment gap  
or the output gap, is  somewh at less tight  in this projection  than in the March  Tealbook . 
Our projection for headline inflation in 2018  is revised up a bit relative to the March  
Tealbook, reflecting the rise in oil prices in recent months.  We continue to expect core 
inflat ion to edge up in coming years but by slightly less than we proj ected  in March , given 
the revision s to resource utilization  and the dollar.  We now project  core inflation to be just 
slightly above 2  percent , and headline inflation to be at 2  percent, by 2020.  
With the projections for both resource utilization and inflation weaker than in the March 
Tealbook, the federal funds rate path from the inertial Taylor (1999) rule that we use in  our 
baseline forecast now rise s less steeply than in March .

  bit by de clining energy prices .  Our forecast for total PCE inflation is the same as in the 
April Tealbook.  Finally, as in recent Tealbooks, we have not incorporated any effects on 
either real activity or inflation from higher import tariffs.1 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Fiscal Policy 
• We estimate that discretionary policy actions across  all levels of government 
will boost aggregate demand growth ½ percentage point in 2018, 
¾ percentage point in 2019, and ½ percentage point in 2020, exclusive of 
multiplier effects a nd offsets from reactions in interest rates and the dollar.  
Roughly one- half of that medium- term impetus is due to the recent federal tax 
cuts, while  about one- fourth  reflects  the recent federal spending legislation; 
most of the remainder is due to projec ted increases in real state an d local 
government expenditures.2 
• The federal defi cit is projected to rise from 3½ percent of GDP in fiscal year 
2017 to 5½ percent in fiscal 2020—well above its sustainable level —with this 
increase primarily reflecting the effects of the recent tax and spending bills.  
o We continue to assume  that in the longer term, policymakers will enact 
deficit reduction measures that gradually stabilize the debt- to-GDP ratio.  
Monetary Policy 
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase 1 ¼ percentage points in total this 
year and to rise about 1 percentage point per year, on average, over the next two years, reaching 4 ½ percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.  This trajectory 
is slightly flatter than in the April Tealbook, reflecting somewhat lower 
                                                 
1 We estimate that the effects of the steel and aluminum tariffs, in isolation, will be minimal for 
both net exports and prices.   Other potential tariff changes remain highly uncertain at this point and are 
therefore not included in our projection.  
2 Under current law, the federal spending caps decline in fiscal year 2020, reverting back to the 
levels set in the Budget Control Act of 2011.   Since fiscal 2012, however, policymakers have consistently 
set actual appropriations above the caps.   Consequently, we assume that federal appropriations will remain 
constant in real terms in fiscal 2020 rather than falling back to the caps.

  projected inflation in the near term and a narrower output gap over the 
medium term. 
• The size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predic table decline as 
securities  are redeemed in a manner consistent with the Committee’s June 
2017 Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and with 
the process initiated in October 2017.  
Other Interest Rates 
• The 10- year Treasury yield is projected to rise significantly  over the medium 
term from an average of  about 3 percent in the current quarter to 4¼ percent 
by the end of 2020.  Relative to the April Tealbook, the projected yield beyond the current quarter is revised down a bit , reflecti ng the slightly flatter 
trajectory for the federal funds rate.  
• The 30- year fixed mortgage rate and the triple -B corporate bond yield are also 
forecast to rise significantly over the medium term.  The mortgage rate path is 
revised  in line with revisions to the path of the 10- year Treasury yield .  Triple -
B corporate bond yields are revised down more than 10- year Treasury yield s 
because we now judge that the strong economic outlook results in a lower path for credit spreads than prev iously assumed. 
Equity Prices and Home  Prices 
• Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter about ½ percent higher 
than in the April Tealbook forecast, reflecting recent increases in broad equity 
price indexes .  Beyond the current quarter, we proj ect stock prices to rise at an 
average annual rate of around ¾ percent, similar to our previous projection. 
• We expect annual house price growth to slow from 6 percent last year to 
5¼ percent this year.  The projected growth in house prices  this year is 
slightly faster than in the April Tealbook, reflecting our response to a strong 
first-quarter reading , which suggests the slowdown in house prices we have 
been expecting has not yet begun to materialize.   Still, we continue to expect 
house price i ncreases to moderate to a 3½ percent pace in 2019 and 2020, 
reflecting both the projected rise in mortgage rates and our assessment that house prices are modestly elevated compared with rents.

  Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
• Real GDP growth in th e foreign economies is estimated to have picked up to 
an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the first quarter.  This reading is a bit faster 
than projected in the April Tealbook, as weaker -than-expected growth in the 
advanced foreign economies was more than offset by unusually strong growth in some emerging Asian economies.  Growth abroad is projected to moderate 
to around 2¾ percent in the second quarter and to remain at roughly that pace 
over the rest of the forecast period .  The rise in financial stresses in I taly due 
to political developments , a tightening of financial conditions in some 
emerging market economies  (EMEs), and —for net oil importers —the increase 
in oil prices led us to revise down our forecast a touch.  Moreover, developments in Europe and EMEs have significantly increased downside risks to our outlook.   
• Since the April Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated about 
4 percent  amid heightened downside risks to foreign growth and increased 
safe-haven demand for dollar assets.  We expect  the broad real  dollar to 
appreciate at an annual rate of about 1¾ percent  through the forecast period as 
market expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff 
forecast.  Reflecting the recent appreciation , the real dollar at the end of the 
forecast horizon is about 3¾ percent higher than in the April Tealbook. 
Oil and Commodity Prices  
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has risen about $4 per barrel on net since the April  Tealbook, closing May 30, around $78 per barrel.   Futures prices for 
December 2020 have increased more, rising $7 to roughly $68 per barrel .  The 
rise in futures prices is consistent with the continued collapse in Venezuelan 
oil production and the Administration’s decision to reinstate U.S. sanctions against Iranian oil exports.  Even after incorporating this upward revision to futures prices, oil prices are expected to decline slowly over the forecast  
period, as geopolitical risks stabiliz e and as supply increases on expected 
loosening of OPEC restrictions and  surging U.S. shale oil production.  (For 
further discussion, including a review of the effect s of oil prices on U.S. 
growth and inflation, see the box “ The Recent Rise in Oil Prices .”)

  • In contrast to the movements in oil prices, price changes for other 
commodities have been muted.  P rices for industrial metals  are essentially 
unchanged from the April Tealbook, outside of a minor correction in 
aluminum prices following the relaxation of  announced U.S. sanctions on a 
large Russian producer.  Aluminum prices were little changed following the 
announcement that temporary exemptions from tariffs would no longer apply 
to major trading partners including the European Union, Canada, and Mexico.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE  SUPPLY 
Real GDP grew at an estimated annual rate of 2 ¼ percent in the first quarter, and 
we project growth to step up to a 3½ percent pace in the current quarter; both figures are up about ½ percentage point relative  to the April Tealbook.  We estimate that output 
stands nearly 2  percent above its potential level in the current quarter, a bit higher than in 
the previous Tealbook.  ( A new exhibit titled “Cyclical Position of the U.S. Economy:  
Near -Term Perspective” shows the judgmental assessment of the output gap as well as an 
estimate from a statistical model. )  Over the second half of the year, real GDP is expected 
to rise at an annual rate of 2¾  percent , a little slower than in the April Tealbook.  
• Real PCE is reported to have increased at an annual rate of only 1 pe rcent in 
the first quarter .  In our assessment, this weakness largely reflected  payback 
from the exceptionally strong growth in the fourth quarter of last year.  PCE  
growth is anticipated to step up to a 3 percent pace in the current quarter.  We 
expect consumer spending to rise at a 2¼  percent pace in the second half of 
the year ; this projection is revised down slightly from the previous Tealbook 
because some of the unexpected second quarter strength  in spending was on 
energy items, which we think will unwind in the second half.  For the year as 
a whole, our projection for PCE growth is little revised from the April Tealbook.  
• Business investment is projected to rise at an annual rate of about 7½ percent 
in the first half of the year.  We expect continued solid gains in coming 
quarters, supported by still-favorable financial conditions, elevated business sentiment and profit expectations, recent tax legislation, and the salutary effects of high oil pri ces on activity in the drilling and mining sector.

 The Recent Rise in Oil Prices  
Oil prices have increased about 50  percent over the past year, with the spot price 
of Brent crude oil rising from about $50 per barrel to about $75 per barrel 
(figure 1) .  For most of the period , further- dated futures prices remained 
relatively stable, in the range of $55 per barrel; however, since the time of the 
April Tealbook , futures prices have moved up appreciably, reaching nearly  
$70 per barrel.   
Both supply and demand factors have contributed to the oil price increase.  In 
particular, the broad -based improvement in the outlook for the global economy 
was a key driver of the price increase in the second half of 2017.  In recent months, supply c oncerns have become more prevalent , affecting both spot and 
further- dated futures prices .  Despite sharply rising U.S. production, m arkets 
have been attuned to escalating conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran as well as the precipitous  decline in  Venezuelan oil production amid the country’s  economic 
and political cris is.  Prices also increased after President Trump announced on 
May 8 that the United States was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal and 
that sanctions against Iranian oil exports would be reinstated.   
We expect oil prices  to decline slowly  through 2020  as ge opolitical risks stabilize 
and as supply, including U.S. shale oil production, grows  to meet demand.  In 
addition , higher prices have put pressure on OPEC’s November 2016  agreement 
with certain non -OPEC countries to restrain production.  A stated aim of th e 
agreement was to reduce the glut in global inventories, and , in recent months, 
inventory levels have fallen rapidly toward long -run averages.  In response to 
both lower inventories and higher prices, OPEC leaders have recently expressed  a 
willingness to discuss relaxin g the production agreement at their upcoming 
meeting  in June, reducing some of the upward pressure on prices.  That said, we 
do think that some of the recent increase in prices is likely to be long  lasting, and , 
in line with futures prices, we have increased our forecast for the price of oil at the end of 2020 by about $ 7 per barrel relative to the April Tealbook.

 What is the expected effect of the recent rise in oil prices on the U.S. economy ?  
To begin with, higher oil prices are likely to depress consumption .  In particular, 
the increase in oil prices since last year is estimated to have translated into a 
roughly $ 250 annual increase in expenditures on gasoline for each household , on 
average, from about $ 1850 to $2 100.  However, a s indicated in figure 2, the share 
of net oil imports in U.S. GDP has  declined  substantially as U.S. oil production has 
grown rapidly over the past decade, so higher oil prices now imply much less of a 
redistribution of purchasing power overseas  than in the pa st.  Accordingly, much  
of the negative effect on GDP  from lower consumer spending  is likely to be 
offset by increased production and investment in the growing oil sector.  In our 
projection, a $10 per barrel increase in the long -run price of oil from curre nt levels 
would lower the level of GDP by only about 5 basis points after three years, as 
the drag on consumption is largely offset by higher oil investment and 
production.  This restraint is about one- fourth  as large as it was a decade ago and 
should get smaller still as U.S. oil production grows, as seen in f igure 3 , and the 
net oil import share shrinks to zero. 
Indeed, as U.S. oil trade moves into balance, the offsetting effects of a change in 
the relative price of oil might be expected to net out within the domestic 
economy.  However, it is also possible that the marginal propensities to consume 
and invest differ sufficiently across U.S. oil consumers and producers such that 
increases in oil prices would still have a negative effect  on ov erall GDP . 
Even with zero net oil imports, changes in oil prices will  still influence consumer 
price inflation.  We currently estimate that a permanent $10 per barrel rise in the 
price of oil from its current level increases core inflation by less than 
0.1 percentage point  after two  years and increases headline inflation by a 
cumulative ¼  percentage point, with most of the effects o ccurring in the 
first  year.

  Note:  The output gap is the percent difference between actual and potential output; a negative number indicates that the economy is operating
below potential. The change in the output gap is equal to real GDP growth less the contribution of measurement error less the growth rate of
potential output. For quarterly figures, the growth rates are at an annual rate, and this calculation needs to be multiplied by 1/4 to obtain
the quarterly change in the output gap.

  • Residential investment has been edging lower so far this year , and we expect 
to see a decline of  about ½ percent  for the  year as a whole, as housing activity 
is held back by rising mortgage rates and a constrained supply of construction 
workers and developable lots.  Our projection is weaker in coming quarters 
than in the April Tealbook, as we now  judge that the rising path of interest 
rates will weigh on residential investment more heavily than we previ ously 
assumed.  
• We estimate that real government purchases will grow 1 percent in the first 
half of this year and then pick up to a 2 percent pace in the second half , as the 
recent federal budget legislation  translates into higher federal government 
purchas es. 
• Net exports added 0.1 percentage point to real GDP growth in the first quarter , 
and we expect it to add almost ¼ percentage point in the second.  Our first -
quarter  estimate is  about ½ percentage point stronger than we expected  in the 
April Tealbook, as  imports came in weaker and exports stronger than we 
projected .  In the second half of the year, net exports are expected to be 
neutral for real GDP growth , about ¼ percentage point weaker than in the 
April Tealbook, as the higher dollar restrains export g rowth .   
• Manufacturing production increased at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the 
first quarter, about half the pace projected  in the April Tealbook.  
Manufacturing output was strong in April, but the data on manufacturing 
hours for May and t he available product data suggest production pulled back 
last month.   Meanwhile, the new orders indexes in the national and  regional 
manufacturing surveys remain  clustered near the high end of their range 
during this expansion, and, accordingly, we expect that manufacturin g output 
growth will return to a solid pace in the coming months. 
Over the medium term, we project real GDP growth to slow from about 
2¾ percent this year  to 2½ percent next year  and then further to 1¾ percent in 2020.  
Although fiscal policy remains expansionary and foreign growth remains solid, monetary 
policy becomes progressively more restrictive. 
• Compared with  the April Tealbook, our forecast  for real GDP growth beyond 
2018 is weaker on net.  As noted previously, the higher path for the dollar is

  one important reason for this adjustment.  Moreover , we have assumed that 
the supply constraints we expect to be associated with the high level of 
resource utilization will attenuate the transmission of increased  aggregate 
demand into increased output by a bit more than we had previously penciled 
in.  In addition, we now judge that the boost to consumer spending from the 
tax cuts will be a little smaller  than we had previously written down.3  Other 
revisions to conditioning assumptions were generally small .4  In all, the level 
of GDP is about ¼ percent lower at the end of 2020 than in our previous projection. 
• Real GDP growth is projected to outpace potential growth through 2019 and 
runs essentially in line with potential in 2020 , resulting  in a further tightening 
of resource utilizatio n over the medium term.  At the end of 2020, real GDP  
exceed s its potential level by 3 percent —¼ percentage point less  than in the 
April  Tealbook but still indicative of a very tight economy.   
• The box “ Alternative View:  A Strong but Precarious P rojection ” highlights 
the difficulty of  engineering a soft landing to the current expansion and argues 
that the risk of a recession over the projection period is substantially elevated.  
• With the federal government expected to run historically large and rising 
deficits over the medium term, national saving is  projected to trend downward 
as a share of GDP.  Nevertheless, private investment trends upward as a share 
of the economy, with the widening gap between domes tic investment and 
national saving financed by increased inflows of foreign capital. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
On balance, the April and May employment report s point to a continued 
tightening in the labor market and by a little more than we had expected . 
                                                 
3 Our assessment that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will provide a bit less impetus to  consumption 
than we had previously assumed reflects our weighing a little more heavily the fact  that the tax cuts are 
tilted towa rd high -income earners who likely have a lower marginal propensity to consume . 
4 The slower population growth forecast by the Census Bureau led us to reduce the levels of both 
actual and potential output by 0.1 percent by the end of the medium term.

 Alternative  View:  A Strong but Precarious  Projection  
Engineering  a soft landing to the current  expansion,  as we have penciled  into the projection,  will 
prove increasingly  precarious.  I  use a simple logit regression framework  to show that while the 
probability  of a recession in  the near future is small, the odds increase substantially  further along 
the staff’s baseline projection.   This analysis is consistent  with the  Federal Reserve’s historical  
difficulty with engineering  a soft landing.  Looking  at real‐time data in staff forecasts  preceding  the 
Great Recession,  I illustrate  how this framework  correctly  warned of an elevated  risk of a recession 
in the near term that the staff did not  fully take into account.   In accordance with  best practices,  the 
staff is not currently forecasting  a recession  directly.  However,  this analysis shows that we are 
forecasting  conditions  that have presaged  previous  recessionary  episodes  and should consider  
either weakening  the forecast or forecasting  a recession in  the early 2020s. 
Specifically,  I estimate a logit on data from 1965:Q1 to 2018:Q1  where the left‐hand side is an 
indicator of “recession  within four  quarters” that is  generated  using NBER recession dating.   The 
right‐ hand side consists of the term spread between the  10‐year Treasury  yield and the federal 
funds rate, the term  premium  on 10‐year Treasury  yields, the  spread of triple‐B‐rated bonds over 
Treasury yields, and the staff’s judgmental  output gap.1  Financial  conditions  and expectations  are 
represented  in the logit by the spreads and premiums,  and the real  side of the economy  is 
represented  by the output gap.  All of the explanatory  variables  are statistically  significant 
predictors  of recessions.2  
Figure 1 shows the recession probability  generated  by the logit using  the June Tealbook  projection.   
From 2020 to 2023, the probability  of a recession beginning  during the following  four quarters  is 
high.  Analysis  of the logit attributes  the high probability  to our projections  of a high output gap, a 
term spread that turns negative  in mid‐ 2020, and  an increasing  triple‐B spread.  The recession  
  
                                                 
Note:   This alternative  view was prepared  by David S. Miller. 
1 The term premium  and triple‐B spread are calculated  based on the FRB/US model’s structure  and the 
specification  of their corresponding  interest  rates. 
2 The specification  is robust to using the 10‐year Treasury premium  to modify the term spread variable rather 
than stand as a separate explanatory  variable and to replacing  the output gap with the unemployment  gap.

 probability  exceeds 0.6 by the end of 2020, a threshold  that foreshadows  almost every recession in  
the post‐1965 period.  
To show that this framework  could have forecast the Great Recession  while the staff did not, I use 
similar logits  to calculate  the near future recession probability  using real‐ time staff projections  from 
three Greenbooks  that precede,  and coincide with, the start  of the Great Recession.   Each logit is  
estimated  on data from 1965:Q1 until the most recent data available  at the time  of the 
corresponding  Greenbook.   The left‐hand side is the indicator  of “recession  within four  quarters” 
but is generated  from NBER recession data  that do not include the  Great Recession.  The right ‐hand 
side includes the same variables  as the original logit.3 
Figure 2 shows an elevated  risk of a recession within the next  four quarters  starting in 2006, which 
is rising with  each Greenbook.   By the end of 2007—corresponding  to when the NBER would  later 
determine the Great Recession  began—the  real‐ time recession probability  is high enough that, 
based on the logit, a recession was  a likely outcome.   While the staff had slightly weakened  its near‐
term projection  by the December  2007 Greenbook,  we did not take into account the high, and 
increasing,  probability  of a recession within four  quarters.4 
The current projection  suffers from dissonance:   It is inconsistent  with the probability  of recession 
it implies.  The  staff projection  is very strong  and does not explicitly  forecast a recession.   However,  
according  to my analysis, the projection  implies a very high and rising probability  of a recession.   
One way to address  this dissonance  would be to modify  the unobserved  components  of the 
projection  by changing  the estimate of potential  output, the natural rate of unemployment,  or r* 
to produce a lower  output gap and steeper term  spread.  However,  if we believe that the current 
medium‐term projection  is our best forecast through 2020, then  the analysis  presented  here 
suggests that we should pencil in an outright  recession in  2021 or 2022 (we currently  project that  
GDP will grow  more slowly than its potential  rate, but not a recession).   
 
                                                 
3 These  vintage Greenbooks  did not contain the triple‐B yield and spread.  I include the triple‐B spread in these 
logits to maintain consistency  with the first logit and make the reported  probabilities  comparable.   The spread 
would have been observable  in real time. 
4 The December  2007 Greenbook  forecast real GDP growth in 2008 at 1½ percent compared  with a forecast of 
2¼ percent in the January  2007 Greenbook.   Forecasts  of real GDP growth in 2009 and later are similar in both 
Greenbooks.

  • Total nonfarm payrolls rose  159,000 in April  and 223,000 in May.  The three-
month moving average ending in May of 179,000 was about 15,000 stronger 
than our April Tealbook expectation  and is well above the range of 80,000 to 
110,000 monthly job gains that we judge to be consistent with no change in 
resource utilization.5  We anticipate that total payroll employment gains will 
average 195,000 per month in the third quarter.   
• An alternative estimate of private employment growth that combines the BLS 
information together with data from the payroll processing firm ADP points to 
private job gains of 166,000 in May.  The moving average of this alternative 
estimate over the three months ending in May stands at 176,000, essentially 
the same as the three-month moving average of the published total payroll gains. 
• The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in April and then further to 
3.8 percent in the May employment report—a downward surprise of 
0.2 percentage point relative to the April Tealb ook projection.  W e now 
project the unemployment rate to be 3.7 percent next quarter , 0.1 percentage 
point lower than in the last Tealbook.  
• The labor force participation rate (LFPR)  ticked down  in April  and then fell 
another 0.1 percentage point to 62.7 percent in May.  For the past few years, 
the participation rate has moved essentially sideways, on net, indicating  some 
tightening along  this margin  relative to its declining trend .   
We continue to expect the labor market will tighten further over the medium term, 
in line with above- trend GDP growth .  We also continue to assume that, in an extremely 
tight labor market, a larger -than-usual amount of the tightening in resource utilization  
will manifest in a higher LFPR and workweek rather than in a lower unemployment rate.

• Total payroll gains are projected  to slow gradually from an average monthly 
pace of about 195,000 this year to 130,000 in 2020 as GDP decelerates .  This 
                                                 
5 This range assumes that the labor force participation rate declines in line with the staff’s estimate 
of its trend.  With an unchanged participation rate, the pace of monthly job gains required to keep the 
unemployment rate constant ranges from 120,000 to  150,000.  
6 Were we to maintain our usual Okun’s law relationship, the unemployment rate at the end of the 
projection would be ¼  percentage point lower.

  trajectory is a touch lower than in our previous forecast , in line with the 
downward revision to real output. 
• We project the unemployment rate to decline ½  percentag e point this year—
similar to its  decline in 2017—and to reach 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter, 
unchanged from our previous projection.  The jobless rate moves down further 
in 2019, ending the year at 3.4 percent, and then moves sideways in 2020, remaining about 1¼ percentage points below our estimate of its natural rate.   
The projected unemployment rate at the end of 2020 is 0.1 percentage point 
higher than in our April  Tealbook projection, consistent with the somewhat  
narrower  output gap at the end of the medium term.  
• The LFPR is projected to end this year at 62.7 percent and then to hold steady 
through 2020, as sustained job gains and rising real wages continue to draw 
individuals into the labor force while also slowing outflows.  When judged against its declining trend, which is driven largely by population aging, the flat profile of the LFPR is consistent with substantial further labor market tightening.   At the end of 2020, the LFPR is projected to be 0.6 percentage 
point above our estimate of its trend  and unchanged from the April  Tealbook. 
• We project that labor productivity in the business sector will increase an 
average of  1 percent per year over the forecast period—a touch faster than its 
average pace over the past five years, though somewhat  less than our estimate 
of its structural pace.

THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Total consumer price inflation is currently close to 2 percent after having been 
depressed by transitory factors last year .   
• The 12-month change in core PCE prices stood at 1.8 percent in April, about 
the same as in March and a little below our expectations in the April 
Tealbook.  The small downside surprise in core inflation was concentrated in the nonmarket component , from which we take little signal for future 
                                                 
7 Productivity tends to grow more slowly than its structural pace when the labor market becomes 
tight, possibly because workers hired in a tight labor market have lower productivity, on average, relative to 
workers hired during a slack labor market.

  inflation .  We project that the 12-month change will edge up to 2 percent  in 
July and August.   (The  Dallas Fed’s  trimmed  mean measure rose 1.7 percent 
over the 12 months ending in April, about the same as over the preceding 
12 months.)  
• Total PCE prices rose 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April , and we 
expect the 12-month change to move up to 2½ percent by July.  The faster 
pace of t otal PCE price inflation relative to  core reflect s both previous large 
increases in consumer energy prices  and our expectation for further increases 
over the next few  months.  
• We expect core import prices to increase at a 2 ¾ percent pace in the first half 
of 2018, ½ percentage point less than in  the April Tealbook projection based 
on recent dollar appreciatio n.  We project core import price s will be roughly 
unchanged in the second half , reflecting the strengthening dollar, slowly 
declining commodity prices, and  moderate foreign inflation.  Our projection 
for import price inflation in the second half is also significantly lower than in 
the April  Tealbook.   
• Measures of l onger- term inflation expectations have moved little, on balance, 
since the April  Tealbook.  Median expectations over the next 5 to 10 years 
from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 2.5 percent in 
May, unchanged from the April reading and close to where they have been 
over the past couple of years.  The Federal Reserve Bank of N ew York’s 
Survey of Consumer Expectations reported that the median inflation expectation 3 years ahead rose 0.1 percentage point in April  to 3.0 percent .  
Finally, the TIPS -based measure of 5 -to-10-year-forward  inflation 
compensation edged down to 2.1 percent . 
• The box “Inflation Perceptions and Inflation Expectations” uses new data 
from the Michigan survey to compare inflation expectations with perceptions of realized inflation .  
Core inflation is projected to edge up from 1.9 percent this year to 2.0 percent in 
2019 and to 2.1 percent in 2020, as the further tightening of the economy and a gradual

 Inflation Perceptions and Inflation Expectations  
Given the presumed role of inflation expectations in influencing actual inflation, it is 
important to un derstand the survey evidence on expectations .  Currently, however, there 
are many  unanswered questions about measures of expected inflation from household 
surveys like the University of Michigan Surveys of  Consumers.  For example, it is not clear 
how to interpret the fact that consumers tend to expect future inflation that is higher 
than official estimates of past  inflation .  Do survey respondents actually expect inflation 
to be higher in the future than it is now, or do they think current inflation has been  higher 
than indicated by the o fficial statistics?  And , does  the downward drift in households’ 
long -term inflation expectations that began in mid -2014  reflect a decrease over time in 
their perceptions of past inflation?  That is, are households’ expectations somewhat 
adaptive?  
Insight  may come from better understanding individuals’ perceptions of recent 
inflation —namely , what consumers think inflation has been in the past .  In 2016, the 
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers began asking the  following  questions on 
inflation perceptions  four times a year.1 
Short -term perceptions:   During the past 12 months, do you think that prices in 
general went up or went down, or stayed where they were a year ago?  By about what percent  do you think prices went (up/down ), on the average, during the 
past 12 months?  
Long -term perceptions:  What about prices over the past 5 to 10 years?  Do you 
think prices now are higher, about the same, or lower than they were 5 to 10 years ago?  By about what percent per year do you think prices went 
(up/down ), on the average, during the past 5 to 10 years?  
Figures 1 and 2  summarize the distribution s of responses on long -term inflation 
perceptions and expectations from the February 2018 survey.  The two  distribution s are  
             
Note:  Weighted using households ’ weight s in the survey.

1 The Federal Reserve Board contracted the University of Michigan Survey Research Center to 
include these questions.  The perceptions questions are worded consistently with the questions on 
inflation expectations and are posed in February, May, August, and  November.

similar, with the bulk of the responses falling between 1  and 5  percent, but the 
distribution of perceptions has slightly more responses in the right tail.  (Note that  
inflation experiences differ across households, and the distribution of perceptions could 
reflect, at least in part, these differences.)    
Figure 3  plots the median  responses for both short - and long -term inflation perceptions 
and expectations.  As illustrated by the black lines, m edian long -term inflation 
expectations  (the solid line)  have been  quite similar to median long -term perception s 
(the dashed line).  These median read ings suggest that households do not expect 
inflation to increase relative to what they perceive to have experienced over the past 5 to 
10 years, even though the median expectation s are higher than official estimates of 
inflation.  Median short -term inflation perception s (red dashed line), on the other hand, 
have run lower than long -term inflation perception s as well as both short - and long -term 
expectations.  One natural interpretation is that households have perceived inflation as 
being relatively low over the past few years, compared with the past 5 to 10 years, and 
that they expect it to move up to the level of the past 5 to 10  years both over the near 
term and the longer term.  Measured official inflation was indeed low in 2015 and 20 16.  
However, headline inflation has moved up more recently, and median short -term  
perceptions show just a hint of that upward drift.   
The University of Michigan Survey Research Center began collecting the data on inflation 
perceptions after the downward drift  in long -term  expectations was largely complete, 
making it impossible to assess whether perceptions have declined in conjunction with 
expectations.  Nevertheless, the cross -sectional aspect of the data provides some 
suggestive evidence on  this issue.  Figure 4 shows a scatterplot of individual responses to 
the two long -term inflation questions and indicates that those who perceive inflation to 
have been higher in the past also expect inflation  to be  higher in the future.2  In addition, 
people who revised up their answer about long -term perceptions between surveys also 
tended  to revise up their long -term expectations (not shown).  These correlations 
sugges t that the downward drift in expectations that began in 2014 could have reflected 
lower perceptions, possibly in response to the recent low inflation.  We hope to learn 
much more from these data in the future.

  increase in our judgmental underlying inflation trend more than offset restraint from the 
projected deceleration in core import prices.8 
• With oil prices expec ted to decline slowly over  the medium term, t otal PCE 
price inflation is projected to run a bit below core inflation  after this year and 
to be 2.0 percent in 2020. 
• Relative to the April  Tealbook, the forecast for core PCE price inflation has 
revised down a touch  in 2018 and 2019, reflecting the incoming data, the 
lower path for core import prices, and the slightly lower degree of resource 
utilization in this projection.    
• We continue to assume  that the supply constraints that attenuate the 
transmission of aggregate demand into output in an extremely tight economy 
will also result in slightly higher inflation  than would otherwise be the case. 
The data we received on wages since the April Tealbook were, on balance, 
slightly stronger than expected .  We continue to project a gradual acceleration in labor 
compensation.   
• The employment cost index (ECI) increased at an annual rate of 4.0 percent in 
the three months ending in March, 1.4 percentage points higher than the 
forecast we wrote down in the April Tealbook.  We expect this compensation measure will increase 2¾ percent this year and next before edging up to 
3 percent in 2020 as resource utilization tightens further . 
• Average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the year ending in May , in line 
with our expectations in the April Tealbook.  We expect the 12 -month change 
in average hourly earnings to remain close to this pace through the near term. 
• Over the medium term, growth in compensation per hour (CPH) is projected 
to step up from last year’s pace of 2¾  percent to 3½ percent this year and to 
4 percent in each of the next two years . 
                                                 
8 In total, the underlying judgmental trend is assumed to increase 10 basis points from  2017 
to 2020.

  • The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s  Wage Growth Tracker remained at  
3.3 percent in  April , near the middle of its range over t he past couple of years. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be 
4.7 percent and that potential output growth  will be 1.7 percent per year in the 
longer run.  
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal  funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½  percent.  The nominal yield on 
10-year Treasury securities in the longer run is  assumed to stand at 
3.4 percent ; thus, after the SOMA portfolio has returned to its normal size and 
composition, the term premium is assumed to be 90 basis points.  
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer- term interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a 
normal size by mid -2021.  
• With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows further to 1½ percent in 2021 
and stays slightly above  1 percent in  2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate 
is above its neutral level and the support from fiscal policy wanes .  The 
unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3 ½ percent in 2021 toward  its 
assumed natural rate in subsequent years.  
• PCE price inflation hovers around 2.1 percent in 2022 and 2023 before edging 
back down to the Committee’s long-run objective in later years. 
• With output materially above its potential level and inflation slightly above 
the Committee’s 2  percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to 
about 4¾ percent at the end of 2021—2¼ percentage points higher than its 
assumed long- run value.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate moves gradually 
back toward its long- run value.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Headlines over the intermeeting period pointed to heightened po litical risks and 
increased financial stress i n several countries.  These negativ e developments have come 
against the backdrop of still-robust foreign economic activity but have increased 
downside risks to our outlook.  Real  GDP in the foreign economi es accelerated to an 
annual pace of 3¼ percent in the first quarter, as a slowdown i n the advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) was more than offset by outsized growth in som e emerging Asian 
economies and Mexico.  We anticipate growth in the current quar ter to move down to 
2¾ percent.  A pickup in the AFEs , as weather-related disruptio ns in Japan and Europe 
subside, should be more than offset by a step-down in the emerg ing market economies 
(EMEs), in part because of the payback from the first-quarter surge.  We expect growth abroad to remain at 2¾ percent , its potential pace, through 2020.   
Balancing a number of factors , we revised down our forecast a b it over the next 
several quarters and left it a bout unchanged thereafter.  Despi te media commentary on a 
weakening momentum of global gr owth, recent data readings have been a mix of positive 
and negative surprises, with no clear-cut implications for the overall outlook.  Oil prices 
have increased some, but this increase has roughly offsetting e ffects on importers and 
exporters.  The dollar has appreciated strongly, which should p rovide some stimulus to 
our trading partners.  However, some EMEs with large macroecono mic imbalances 
registered a tightening of their financial conditions, which sh ould temper their growth a 
bit.  Finally, political developm ents in Italy have increased f inancial stresses and should 
restrain growth in Italy and have some adverse spillovers to ot her euro-area countries.      
Although our baseline outlook is only  little changed, we see in creased prominence 
of two risks.  First, the situ ation in Italy could become more precarious and have 
significantly greater s pillovers to other euro-area countries than in our baseline, a 
possibility explored in our “Hei ghtened Risk of Euro-Area Break up” alternative scenario 
in the Risks and Uncertaint y section.  Second, although the rec ent rise in financial 
stresses and capital outflows has  been mostly limited to relati vely vulnerable EMEs (see 
the box “Recent Financial Pressures in Emerging Market Economie s”), there could be a 
broader and more persistent ratcheting up of EME stress, a poss ibility discussed in the 
“EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario.

Recent Financial  Pressures  in Emerging  Market Economies  
Since the April Tealbook,  financial stresses have risen in emerging  market economies  (EMEs), 
with credit  spreads widening,  bond and equity funds experiencing  outflows,  and currencies  
depreciating  against the dollar.  In  this discussion,  we look more closely at the  potential  
factors contributing  to this turn in sentiment,  including  rising U.S. Treasury yields, spillovers  
from idiosyncratic  developments  in select countries,  and heightened  focus on EME 
vulnerabilities  more broadly.  Among EME asset prices, we concentrate  on exchange  rates, 
where the movements  have been the  most sizable. 
The rise in financial stress has been especially  pronounced  for Turkey  and Argentina,  whose 
currencies  have depreciated  about 11 percent and 19 percent,  respectively, since the  April 
Tealbook  and whose credit  spreads have moved up sharply.  Turkey  and Argentin a are also 
the two EMEs  with the most significant  macroeconomic  vulnerabilities.  In  both countries, 
concerns  have risen  about the laxity of fiscal and monetary  policies, the independence  of the 
central bank, and  the reliance on extern al financing.   These vulnerabilities  likely rendered  the 
countries  susceptible to shifts  in market conditions.  
However, the  recent stresses have not been limited  to Turkey and Argentina,  suggesting  
that a common factor  may have triggered  the selloff in EME assets.  Indeed, the notion  that 
EMEs were hit by a common shock  finds some support in  that EMEs have been af fected 
roughly in proportion  to their vulnerabilities.  As  seen in figure 1, when recent  EME currency  
depreciations  are plotted against our relative vulnerability  rankings,  they line up well.1  
1 Our vulnerability  ranking  is constructed  by first ordering 16 EMEs  according  to six indicators  of 
vulnerability:   (1) current account deficit as a percent of GDP, (2) gross  government  debt as a percent of 
GDP,  (3) average annual inflation over  the past three years, (4) the five‐year change in bank credit to the 
private  sector as a share of GDP, (5) the ratio of external debt to exports, and (6) the ratio of foreign 
exchange  reserves to GDP.  By construction,  the higher the rankings  on each measure,  the higher the 
vulnerability.   We average the rankings  across indicators  for each  EME.  Thus,  the values can theoretically  
range from 1 (least  vulnerable)  to 16 (most  vulnerable).

 Exactly what shock might have led to a shift in investor sentiment  toward EMEs, however,  is 
unclear.  One possibility  is that developments  in Argentina and  Turkey have served as a 
wake‐up call to investors,  leading to a broad repricing of risk in EME assets.  Alternatively, 
some other common shocks, such as the rise in U.S. interest  rates, may have increased  
pressures  on EMEs.  To provide an assessment,  we use an empirical  model relating EME 
currency movements  to key underlying  drivers.  These drivers  are the 2‐year U.S. Treasury 
yield to capture  the general level of U.S. interest rates and near‐term monetary  policy path, 
the slope of the U.S. Treasury yield curve (10‐year minus 2‐year) as a proxy for the 
opportunity  cost of investing  in dollar‐denominated  EME bonds, U.S.  high‐yield corporate  
bond spreads as an indicator of broad credit market conditions  for risky debt,  and the VIX 
index to capture  general risk sentiment.   The model is estimated  on weekly data  separately  
for each EME currency to allow potentially  different  responses  to U.S. variables  depending  
on country‐specific fundamentals  and risk characteristics.2  On average, U.S. interest rates 
and risk sentiment  explain  around 20 percent of the variation in EME currencies  over the 
post‐crisis period, with  the three  interest rate  variables accounting  for most of the 
explanatory  power.3  Additionally,  countries  that are assessed as more vulnerable  tend to 
have larger sensitivities  to changes  in U.S. interest rates and the VIX. 
Regarding  the recent movements  (figure 2), the average EME  currency depreciated  about 
5 percent  against the dollar from mid‐April  through the third week of May,  while the 2‐ and 
10‐year Treasury yields  rose 19 basis points and 24 basis points, respectively.4  During this  
  
                                                 
2 In our analysis, we include  the 16 countries  shown in figure  1.  All right‐ hand‐side variables  are in first‐
difference  form.  
3 A 10 basis point increase in the 2‐year U.S. Treasury yield, the term spread, and the high‐yield spread 
are associated  with 0.5 percent, 0.25 percent, and 0.3 percent depreciation  of the average EME currency,  
respectively.  
4 Since the third week of May, the average EME currency is little changed,  on net, although  increased  
political uncertainty  in Italy weighed on risk sentiment  and put downward  pressure on Treasury yields and 
risky asset prices.  See the Financial Market Developments  section for a detailed discussion.

period, the model‐based path moved down only 1½ percent, suggesting  a material but 
relatively modest  role for the  rise in the Treasury yields.   However,  it is notable  that during 
the period from last October to early February,  EME currencies  appreciated  relative to the 
dollar  even  as 2‐ and 10‐year U.S. Treasur y yields  increased  significantly,  suggesting  that the 
link between  Treasury yields and EME currencies  is relatively loose.   Nonetheless,  it is also 
possible  that the recent sharp depreciation  in EME currencies  reflects some catch‐up 
following  their earlier  failure to respond  to rising interest rates in the United States.   
At this point, concerns  about  EME financial stresses should  not be overstated.   EME 
sovereign  bond spreads and broad measures  of EME financial stress, shown in figure 3, 
remain well  below levels seen  in other recent  stress  episodes such  as that in early 2016 
associated  with  concerns  about China.  The fact that EMEs with  lower  vulnerabilities  have 
not been as affected suggests that investors  have continued  to differentiate  between 
countries  based on economic  fundamentals.   Moreover, incoming  data  for the  EMEs 
continue to point to robust  growth.  As such, the recent  tightening  of financial conditions  
has left little imprint on our overall  EME forecast.  How ever,  this tightening  points to the 
possibility  of more severe financial stresses, as described  in the “EME Turbulence  and 
Stronger Dollar” alternative  scenario in the Risks  and Uncertainty  section.

  Oil prices have put upward pressu re on foreign inflation in the  first half of the 
year, and, with further oil price increases and currency deprec iations since the April 
Tealbook, we revised up our inflation forecast for the second h alf of the year.  In the 
AFEs, we expect inflation to edge down to 1¾ percent by the end  of the year, as oil 
prices decline, and to remain near that pace thereafter.  With underlying inflation 
pressures expected to be contained over the next few years, we continue to assume a 
gradual withdrawal of monetary po licy stimulus in the AFEs.  In deed, we pushed back 
the next policy rate hikes by the  Bank of Canada (BOC), the Ban k of England (BOE), 
and the European Central Bank ( ECB) on weaker-than-expected data and elevated 
uncertainties about the outlook.  In contrast, the increase in oil prices coup led with capital 
outflows and currency depreciati ons have led some EMEs to tighten monetary policy.  
Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Turkey raised their policy rates, and Brazil, 
contrary to expectations , did not cut its rate.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro area.  Real GDP growth slowed from 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter  to 
1.6 percent in the first, partl y owing to temporary factors, su ch as labor strikes and 
severe cold in both France and G ermany.  Key survey indicators (such as PMIs) have 
softened further this quarter bu t remain at levels consistent with solid growth.  
Accordingly, we project grow th to rebound to just above 2 perce nt in the current 
quarter, before decelerating to 1½ percent by 2019.  This forec ast is about 
½ percentage point lower in 2018 and ¼ percentage point lower i n 2019 relative to 
the April Tealbook, primarily ref lecting recent and expected fi nancial tensions and 
uncertainty generated by politic al developments in Italy.   
In Italy, we expect a protrac ted period of political uncertaint y and elevated financial 
stress as antiestablishment par ties push for substantial fiscal  easing and challenge 
European institutions.  That said, our baseline outlook assumes that intern al political 
conflicts and market pressures ultimately prevent the Italian g overnment from 
implementing radical proposals su ch as creating a parallel curr ency.  In addition, 
while we expect some spillovers to other euro-area countries, o ur baseline envisions 
that investors ultimately retain confidence in the integrity of  the euro area and its 
institutions, including its financial backstops.  Accordingly, while Italian growth is 
projected to fall close to zero later this year and in 2019, ov erall euro-area growth 
should moderate to near its poten tial rate and remain there ove r the forecast period.

  However, much uncertainty attends  this projection, and a resurg ence of severe 
financial stresses in the euro a rea is a clear downside risk.    
Higher oil prices should furthe r boost inflation from 2 percent  in the first quarter to 
2¼ percent in the second and thi rd quarters.  However, with cor e inflation projected 
to rise very slowly from ar ound 1 percent this quarter, we expe ct headline inflation to 
fall back to 1½ percent by 2019 as re tail energy prices stabili ze before edging higher 
in 2020 as slack diminishes.  Given i ncreased downside risks an d slightly weaker 
outlooks for growth and inflation, we now expect the ECB to wai t until the fourth 
quarter of 2019 to begin raising its  policy rate, two quarters later than previously 
assumed. 
 United Kingdom.  Real GDP growth plunged unexpect edly from 1.6 percent in the 
fourth quarter to a mere 0.4 percen t in the first, partly owing to a weather-related 
contraction in the constructi on sector.  Growth is expected to rebound to 1½ percent 
in the current quarter.  This fi gure is ¼ percentage point lowe r than in the April 
Tealbook, as most data, such as April PMIs and confidence indicators, suggest a bit 
less momentum than expected.  The reafter, growth should edge up to 1¾ percent, 
supported by accommodative monetary policy. 
Headline inflation is projected  to remain unchanged at 2½ perce nt in the second 
quarter, as the boost from highe r energy prices is offset by we aker-than-expected core 
inflation readings.  Thereafter , we continue to expect inflatio n to fall to the BOE’s 
2 percent target by the end of 2020.  W ith the recent weakness in economic activity, 
we now anticipate that the BOE will delay hiking rates until th e third quarter of 2018, 
one quarter later than assumed i n the April Tealbook.  This path takes the policy rate 
from 0.5 percent to 1½ percent by the end of forecast period, ¼  percentage point 
lower than assumed in April.  
 Japan.  Real GDP contracted 0.6 percent i n the first quarter, well be low the 
1¼ percent expansion forecast in the April Tealbook.  The contr action seems largely 
driven by a big step-down in inve ntory investment and the effects of bad weather on 
private consumption.  Incoming i ndicators have been mixed but, on net, suggest 
growth will rebound to 1¼ percent in the current quarter.  We e xpect that growth will 
move down to a near-potential  pace of ¾ percent by next year.

  Inflation appears set to turn negative in the second quarter, a s data through May 
indicate that food and durable goods  prices declined sharply.  As higher oil prices 
feed through to consumer prices a nd food prices stabilize, infl ation should return to 
positive territory in the third quarter.  We assume that underl ying inflation pressures 
will remain quite subdued despite a very tight labor market, an d we project inflation 
to be just 1 percen t in 2020.  Accordingly, we assume that the Bank of Japan will 
maintain a highly accommodative  policy stance throughout the fo recast period, 
waiting until late 2020 to  lift its target for the 10-year Japa nese government bond 
yield above zero.   
 Canada.  Real GDP growth slowed to 1.3 per cent in the first quarter, f rom 
1.7 percent in the fourth, refl ecting strong imports, a sharp c ontraction in residential 
investment, and a slowdown in private consumption growth.  Alth ough first-quarter 
growth was ¾ percentage point belo w our April estimate, we are taking little signal 
going forward, as monthly indicat ors point to solid underlying momentum late in the 
quarter.  Moreover, recent indicat ors, including the April employment report and 
manufacturing PMI, suggest that growth will step up to almost 2 ½ percent this 
quarter.  Thereafter, we expect growth to continue at around th at pace through early 
2019, before slowing to just below  2 percent in 2020.  Relative to the April Tealbook, 
this projection is somewhat stronger in the seco nd half of 2018 and in 2019 because 
of higher oil prices.  
We have inflation slowing from 3 p ercent in the current quarter  to the BOC’s 
2 percent target by mid-2019.  As re source utilization continue s to increase, the BOC 
is expected to gradually raise its policy rate from the current  1.25 percent to 3 percent 
in 2020.  With data having come in a bit weaker, we now expect the next rate hike to 
be in the third quarter of this  year, a quarter later than assu med in the April Tealbook.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 China.  Growth continues to be solid, rising to 7.2 percent in the fi rst quarter and 
projected to be 6¾ percent this qu arter.  Economic activity has  been boosted by 
strong external demand and a reco very in industrial activity fo llowing the removal of 
production caps on high-polluting industries.  However, fixed i nvestment and retail 
sales have decelerated, suggesting that the tighter regulations  on shadow banking 
activity are starting t o affect the real economy.  We expect growth to moderate further

  to 6¼ percent in the second half of  this year and to edge down to 6 percent by 2020, 
in line with potential.  
The proposed U.S. tariffs on about  $50 billion of Chinese impor ts, if implemented, 
would have a limited direct effect  on the Chinese economy, as t hese goods account 
for a small share of China’s GDP.  However, a substantial broadening of the tariffs to 
additional products could indee d pose a material risk to the ou tlook for China and the 
emerging Asian region as a whole. Inflation has been very subdued, at an estimated 1¼ percent thi s quarter, because of 
falling food prices.  We expect inf lation to rise temporarily t o 3 percent next quarter, 
as food prices normalize and higher oil prices pass through to retail fuel prices, but to 
settle at 2½ percent  by the end of this year. 
 Other Emerging Asia.  Real GDP growth in emerging A sia excluding China jumped 
to 5.7 percent in the first quart er, 1¼ percentage point higher than projected in the 
April Tealbook, owing in large p art to outsized export growth i n Hong Kong and 
strong domestic demand in India and Thailand.  Furthermore, act ivity rebounded in 
Korea, as expected, after a four th-quarter contraction.  Growth  in the region should 
moderate to 3¼ percent in the s econd quarter, as activity in Ho ng Kong and Thailand 
normalizes.  Thereafter, we exp ect growth to settle at around 3¾ percent.  This 
projection is down a touch for t he rest of this year on higher oil prices and about 
unchanged thereafter.  
 Mexico.  Mexican real GDP grew at a robus t 4.6 percent pace in the first  quarter, up 
from 3.6 percent in the fourth and w ell above our April Tealboo k forecast.  Industrial 
output rebounded after a lack luster 2017, boosted by oil produc tion, construction, and 
exports, particularly of autos.  T hese data, together with an u pward revision to the 
projection for U.S. manufacturi ng growth, led us to revise up s econd-quarter growth 
to 3 percent, notwithstanding some tightening in financial cond itions amid the recent 
selloff of EME assets and more Mexico-specific concerns related  to NAFTA and the 
July presidential elections.  We  see growth remaining at around 3 percent over the 
forecast period, supported by strong external demand, diminishe d fiscal drag, and 
higher real incomes. 
Headline inflation is expected  to continue declining to 3 perce nt this quarter, from 
4 percent in the first.  Although this drop partly reflects the fading effect of past food

  price increases, core inflation also continues to fall.  Consistent with this decline, the 
Bank of Mexico kept its policy ra te unchanged at its May meetin g but emphasized 
that it is monitoring the poten tial pass-through from the recen t depreciation of 
the peso. 
 Brazil.   Brazilian GDP grew 1.8 percent in the first quarter, up from 1 percent in the 
fourth, supported by a rebound in exports and a modest pickup i n household demand.  
Nevertheless, growth was signi ficantly weaker than expected, an d falling PMIs and 
confidence indicators in April s uggest that this weakness exten ded into the second 
quarter.  Together with somewhat tighter financial conditions a nd the recent 
widespread strikes by truck driv ers, these data led us to slash  our growth estimate in 
the second quarter 1 percentage point, to just over 1½ percent.   We continue to see 
the pace of activity clim bing gradually to 3 percent by 2019, although political 
uncertainty ahead of this October’s presidential election remai ns a key downside risk.  
Given significant economic slack, w e expect inflation to edge d own to a subdued 
2¾ percent in the second quarter, well below the inflation targ et.  However, noting 
the recent volatility in financial markets, the central bank stood pat in its previous 
meeting, pausing an easing cyc le that had begun in late 2016.  
 Argentina.  In the face of rapidly escalating pressure on the peso, Argen tine 
authorities announced on May 8 that they were seeking an IMF program.  This 
decision followed several unsucces sful attempts by the central bank to shore up 
market confidence, including thr ee intermeeting p olicy rate hik es that raised the 
overnight rate a cumulative  12.75 percentage points to 40 percent.  The deterioration 
in market sentiment is roote d in growing concerns about persist ently high fiscal 
deficits, the independence of the central bank, and the increasing dependence on external financing.  We marked dow n growth considerably this year.  We expect 
confidence will improve and act ivity will pick up again in 2019 .  However, there is a 
material risk that Argentina’s macroeconomic adjustment process  could be costlier 
and more prolonged than predicted.  
 Turkey.  Turkey has also come under substantial market pressure in recent weeks, 
with the lira plungi ng close to 20 percent a nd credit spreads r ising sharply.  The 
central bank responded to the turmo il by significantly tighteni ng its monetary policy, 
reversing some of the currenc y depreciation.  A long with Argentina, Turkey’s 
economy stands out among EMEs for its macroeconomic fragility, including

  widening fiscal and current account deficits and double-digit i nflation amid growing 
concerns about the central bank’ s independence.  Moreover, poli tical uncertainty has 
increased, with snap presidential and parliamentary elections c alled for late June 
reducing the likelihood that the government will take the neces sary policy actions to 
address the country’s economic imbalances in the near term.

Financial Market Developments 
 
 
 
 
 
Domestic financial markets wer e buffeted by increased concerns about the 
outlook for foreign growth and politi cal developments in Italy.   On net, Treasury yields 
moved down some, market-based measures of the expected levels o f the federal funds 
rate at the ends of 2019 and 2020 decr eased moderately, and the  dollar appreciated 
notably as a range of AFE and E ME currencies and sovereign bond s came under 
pressure.  However, broad domestic stock price indexes increased, on net, as generally 
strong corporate earnings re ports helped support prices. 
 Sovereign spreads in peripheral Europe and several vulnerable E MEs widened 
dramatically.  The broad dollar index increased about 1¾ percen t over the 
intermeeting period.  
 Yields on 2- and 10-year Treasury securities both f ell about 10  basis points on 
net.  The decline in 10-year nomin al Treasury yields was due in  roughly equal 
parts to declines in TIPS yiel ds and inflation compensation. 
 Broad domestic equity price indexes increased about 2 percent, while the VIX 
was about flat on net.  Risk spreads on investment- and specula tive-grade 
corporate bonds widened modera tely, by about 10 basis points an d 25 basis 
points, respectively.  
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability o f a rate increase 
at the June meeting inched up fur ther to near certainty, with roughly one 
additional hike priced in for th e period from July through the end of this year.  Outside of this box, the Financial  Market Developments section of the Tealbook is 
based on inform ation that was av ailable by 5:00 p.m. EDT on May  31.  On June 1, at 
8:30 a.m. EDT, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics published its Emp loyment Situation 
Report for May 2018.  While the rel ease was reportedly interpre ted by market 
participants as stronger t han expected, by 9:00 a.m. (30 minute s after the official 
release), long-term  interest r ates were only a few basis points  above their levels at 
5:00 p.m. on May 31, and equity index futures were up by about ½ percent.

  A staff model that adjusts market rates for estimated term prem iums implies 
roughly two hikes over the same period.  
 A straight read of market quotes a lso suggests that the expected levels of the 
federal funds rate for the end of 2019 and the end of 2020 each  fell about 
15 basis points—adjusting for term premiums, they fell an estim ated 8 basis 
points and 5 basis points, respectively. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Political developments that amplified risks and macroeconomic d ata releases that 
signaled a moderation in growt h abroad weighed on prices of for eign risk assets over the 
intermeeting period.  These forei gn developments, together with a still-solid economic 
outlook for the United State s, supported the dollar. 
In Europe, financial markets reacted negatively to the political upheaval in Italy, 
which was viewed as potentiall y undermining the country’s progress on fiscal 
consolidation and rekin dling fears about eur o-area stability.  Markets were also 
concerned by the prospect of sna p elections in Spain.  Peripher al European 10-year 
sovereign spreads jumped—123 ba sis points in Italy, 94 basis po ints in Greece, 52 basis 
points in Portugal, and 44 basis  points in Spain—and Italian so vereign CDS spreads also 
widened dramatically.  The resulting flight-to-safety flows, al ong with weaker-than-
expected euro-area PMI data, dr ove German long-term sovereign y ields 22 basis points 
lower.  In the United Kingdom, t he combination of risk-off sent iment and lower-than-
expected inflation data for Apr il contributed to an 18 basis po int decline in 10-year 
sovereign yields.  Investors re vised down their expected policy  paths in Europe; policy 
rates implied by straight reads  of overnight index swap rates i n the euro area and the 
United Kingdom fell 15 basis poi nts at the 2-year horizon.  On net, the dollar appreciated 
by about 2½ percent against the euro and the pound.    
The value of euro-area bank equities declined sharply, as inves tors were highly 
attentive to political  stresses in Italy and Spain, weakening m acroeconomic data, and 
ongoing restructuring troubles at De utsche Bank.  Euro-area ban k stock indexes declined 
14 percent, with Italian bank equity prices falling 20 percent.   Broader measures of equity 
prices declined much less, on net , as other sectors benefited f rom currency weakness and 
lower interest rates i n the core economies.

  Against the backdrop of the notable increase in U.S. interest rates since late 2017, 
recent political developments in several fragile EMEs have inte nsified concerns about 
emerging economies’ financial  vulnerabilities, leading to a sha rp appreciation of the 
dollar against these currencie s over the intermeeting period.  (For more details, see the 
box “Recent Financial Pressures in Emerging Market Economies” i n the International 
Economic Developments and Outlook section.)  Exchange rates dep reciated against the 
dollar by 22 percent in Argentina, 10 percent in Turkey, and 6 percent in Brazil following 
adverse domestic developments (both economic and political).  T he Mexican peso 
depreciated by about 5 percent am id political uncertainty and an absence of progress in 
NAFTA negotiations.  Equity index es in some EMEs declined by up to 11 percent, while 
broad measures of EME equity prices decreased by up to 4 percen t.  EME mutual funds 
saw slight net outflows, and EME sovereign spreads widened abou t 29 basis points 
on net. 
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
FOMC communications over the in termeeting period—including the May FOMC 
statement and the May FOMC meeting minutes—elicited only minor reactions in asset 
markets.  However, the Committ ee’s characterization of inflatio n in both the statement 
and the minutes garnered substant ial attention.  In particular,  market commentaries noted 
the passages stating that both h eadline and core inflation have  moved “close to 2 percent” 
and the addition of the word “symm etric” to characterize the in flation objective over the 
medium term.  Market participan ts also noted a reference in the FOMC minutes 
suggesting that a temporary peri od with inflation modestly abov e 2 percent would be 
consistent with the Comm ittee’s symmetric objective.  
Quotes on federal funds futures c ontracts suggest that the mark et-implied 
probability for the next rate hike occurring at the June FOMC m eeting inched up further 
to near certainty.  A  straight read of market quotes suggests t hat roughly one additional 
rate hike is priced in for the period from July through the end  of this year, while a staff 
model that adjusts for estimate d term premiums implies that mar ket participants expect 
roughly two hikes over the same  period.  Both of these readings  are little changed from 
the time of the May FOMC meeting. 
At horizons beyond the end of this  year, market-based measures of the expected 
path of the federal funds rate fell somewhat, with most of the declines occurring late in 
the intermeeting period as concer ns regarding political develop ments in Europe

  intensified.  On net, a straight  read of market quotes suggests  that the expe cted path fell 
15 basis points at the end of 2019 and 13 basis points at the e nd of 2020.  However, after 
a staff model is used to adjust for term premiums, those decrea ses in the expected path 
were estimated to be only 8 basis  points and 5 basis points, re spectively.  Regarding the 
level of the path in the medium t erm, a straight read of market quotes suggests that 
market participants expect approx imately two hikes cumulatively  in 2019 and 2020 
(approximately three after adjusting for term premiums).  
Longer-term nominal Treasury yiel ds fell somewhat, on net, sinc e the May 
FOMC meeting, with 10-year yield s decreasing 13 basis points.  The decline was about 
equally split between TIPS yields and inflation compensation.  Yields experienced some 
notable one-day moves, particula rly late in the period.  Follow ing the release of the 
advance estimate of April retail  sales, long-term yields moved up about 7 basis points.  
Subsequently, however, yields decl ined in reaction to weaker-th an-expected European 
PMI prints and, shortly thereafte r, in response to political developments in Italy.  (For 
analysis of the information conten t of the yield curve for the probability of recession, see 
the box “Don’t Fear the Long-Term Spread.”)    
Option-adjusted spreads on current-coupon MBS over Treasury yields remained 
about unchanged over the intermeet ing period.  Overall, we continue to see limited 
effects on MBS prices from the implementation of the balance sheet normalization 
program, although market participan ts reportedly expect that MB S spreads might widen 
as the volume of reinvestments  declines later this year.1 
Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased 2 percent, on net, si nce the May FOMC 
meeting.  Stock prices were buoyed by first-quarter  earnings re ports that generally beat 
expectations, particularly for the technology sector, which out performed the broader 
market.  However, the turbulence abroad and, to a lesser degree , mounting concerns over 
the potential for trade wars wei ghed on equity prices at times.   Option-implied volatility 
on the S&P 500 at the one-month hor izon—the VIX—was about flat,  on net, remaining 
just a couple of percentage point s above the very low levels th at prevailed before early 
February.

Don’t Fear  the Long‐Term  Spread 
Commonly  cited measures  of the term spread, such as the difference  between the  10‐year and  
2‐year nominal  Treasury  yields, have dropped  over the  past several years  (figure 1, blue line).   This 
trend has raised some concerns  because low  term spreads appear to have statistical  power for 
predicting  recessions  over the coming year.1  In this discussion,  we document  that for predicting  
recessions,  a “long‐term spread”—the  spread in yields between a far‐ off maturity  such as 10 years 
and a shorter  maturity such as 1 or 2 years—is  inferior to a more  economically  intuitive alternative,  
a “near‐term  spread.”    
We focus on the difference  between 5‐quarter ‐ahead and 1‐quarter‐ahead forward interest rates  
(figure 1, red line).  This near‐term spread is driven largely by the market’s  expectations  for the path 
of the federal funds rate over the  year ahead.  Indeed, the  near‐term spread co‐varies closely with a 
survey‐based measure of such expectations,  the dotted red line.  Currently,  the near‐term spread is 
not much below  its long‐run average  level.  Looking  ahead, the  staff projection  suggests  that the 
near‐term spread will decline,  on net, as the policy rate trends toward its  neutral level.2  If instead 
the near‐term spread  becomes  decidedly  negative,  that would signal that market participants  expect 
the Fed to significantly  lower rates  in the year ahead, presumably  owing to an economic  slowdown.  
Consistent  with this  reasoning, our  empirical analysis  finds that a relatively  low near‐term spread 
implies a higher  probability  of a recession over the  next four  quarters,  similar to findings  using 
long‐term spreads.   Moreover,  we find that, after conditioning  on a near‐term spread, long‐term 
spreads offer  no additional  predictive  power for past  recessions.

1 The predictive  value of long‐term spreads has not diminished  of late, as confirmed  in Michael D. Bauer and 
Thomas  M. Mertens (2018), “Economic  Forecasts  with the Yield Curve,” FRBSF Economic  Letter 2018‐07 (San 
Francisco:   Federal  Reserve Bank of San Francisco,  March 5); and Peter Johansson  and Andrew Meldrum  (2018), 
“Predicting  Recession  Probabilities  Using the Slope of the Yield Curve,” FEDS Notes  (Washington:  Board  of 
Governors  of the Federal  Reserve System,  March 1).  The latter paper also  finds that when the first  three principal 
components  of the yield curve are included as regressors,  the current probability  of recession  is lower  than is 
implied by conditioning  on the term slope  alone.  
2 Over  the forecast period, constructing  the long‐term spread required interpolation  from the yields included in 
the staff projection;  the near‐term spread is driven largely by the inertial Taylor  rule that the staff uses  to set the 
path of short ‐ term interest  rates.

Our analysis  is based on a probit model, estimated  on data from 1972:Q1 to 2018:Q1, where the  
probability  of transition  to recession in  the four quarters  ahead is a function  of the near‐term and 
long‐term spreads and, in  some specifications,  added controls.   In this model, the  near‐term spread 
is highly significant;  all else being equal, when it falls from its mean level by  one standard  deviation 
(80 basis  points), the probability  of recession increases  by almost 40 percentage points.   In 
contrast,  the coefficient  on the long‐term spread is economically  small and  not statistically  
different from  zero.3  As shown in  figure 2, the fitted conditional  probabilities  of recession from  our 
model (red  line) show  somewhat  sharper spikes  before recessions  than a model using only the 
long‐term spread (blue line).  
While the predicted  recession  probabilities  from the two models generally  track each other  fairly 
closely, a noticeable  divergence  appears in the forecast period.   The model based  on long‐term 
spreads suggests  that the probability  of recession will move  up considerably  as the long‐term 
spread falls well below its long‐run mean  level.  However, the model  based on the near‐term 
spread suggests that  the probability  of recession  will increase much  less, as short‐term  rates in the 
staff’s projection  flatten but do not invert in the medium term. 
The forecast  aside, the main lesson we take away from this exercise is that the current near ‐term 
spread, which  arguably  serves as a proxy for market expectations  of Federal Reserve  policy, 
suggests the market is putting fairly low odds on a recession‐induced  rate cut over the  next four 
quarters.   More generally,  our findings do not support appealing  to the long‐term spread for a 
different signal  about year‐ ahead economic  growth. 
Figure 2:  Estimated  Probabilities  of Recession  
                                                 
3 Controls included the level of the 30‐day Treasury bill rate and the “excess bond premium”  from Simon 
Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajsek  (2012), “Credit Spreads and Business Cycle Fluctuations,”  American  Economic  Review, 
vol. 102 (June), pp. 1692–720.   The controls were included in separate estimations  to test whether our main findings 
are robust to the inclusion of the controls.   Figure  2 shows  results from a specification  without the controls to 
isolate and illustrate  the effect of the near‐term slope.  
In another departure  from the standard  literature,  we drop from the estimation  any observations  in which the 
economy  was already  in recession  in the previous quarter.  This choice enables us to estimate  the probability  of 
transition  into recession,  rather than the probability  of either transitioning  or remaining  in recession,  which most 
studies  estimate.   This change lowers the current recession  probability  estimate based on the far‐term spread from 
about  30 percent to 20 percent.  We also drop observations  during which the effective lower bound was binding, 
following  other recent studies.

  Over the intermeeting period, s preads of yields on nonfinancial  corporate bonds 
over those of comparable-maturit y Treasury securities widened m oderately for both 
investment- and speculative-grade  firms, with speculative-grade  bond spreads up by 
about 25 basis points.  However, t hese spreads remain low by historical standards. 
SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, short -term funding markets remain ed generally 
stable despite still-elevated spr eads of some private money mar ket instruments to rates 
reflecting the expected pat h of the federal funds rate.2  Spreads on both nonfinancial 
commercial paper and certificates  of deposit, particularly at o ne-month and longer tenors, 
have edged down further since the previous FOMC meeting.  Similarly, the three-month 
U.S. dollar LIBOR decreased sli ghtly over the intermeeting period, while OIS rates were 
little changed, leading to a narrowi ng of the LIBOR–OIS spread.   While some of the 
factors contributing to pressure s in short-term funding markets  have eased recently, the 
three-month LIBOR–OIS spread rem ains significantly wider than a t the start of the year. 
Because elevated rates on other short-term investments offered an attractive 
alternative for market particip ants, take-up at the Federal Res erve’s ON RRP facility 
remained low, averaging about $5 billion per day.  
The implied rate on July federal funds futures declined about 3 ½ basis points after 
the release of the May FOMC mi nutes, which noted the possibility of a technical 
adjustment of the administered I OER rate to a level 5 basis poi nts below the top of the 
target range for the federal f unds rate.  Reportedly, market pa rticipants generally expect 
the adjustment, which is intende d to keep the federal funds rat e well within the FOMC’s 
target range, to be announced during the June FOMC meeting. 
                                                 
2 On May 7, the CME began trading one- and three-month futures o n the Secure d Overnight 
Financing Rate (SOFR), one of the Fed’s new overnight Treasury repo rates.  Despite lim ited trading so far, 
the launch was in line with expectations and is an important st ep in the transition from LIBOR to SOFR.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that f inancing conditions for 
businesses and households remain  supportive of economic activity  on balance.  
• Bank lending to businesses and the issuance of institutional leveraged loans 
were strong in April, offsetting seasonal weakness in corporate bond issuance.  
Corporate earnings increased notably in the first quarter in part because of  the 
enactment of the new tax legislation, and spreads on corporate debt and institutional leveraged loans remained low.  
• Mortgage credit has remained widely available for most borrowers; for 
borrowers with low credit scores, conditions remain tight but have continued to ease.   Growth in home-purchase mortgages has slowed a bit and refinancing 
activity has continued to be muted in recent months, with both developments partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year.   
• Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the 
first few months of 2018, on balance, and remained largely supportive of 
growth in household spending.  However, consumer credit grew at a slower pace in the first quarter compared with the rapid pace observed late last year , 
and the supply of consumer credit to borrowers with subprime credit scores continued to tighten.     
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained accommodative over 
the intermeeting period.  Although corporate bond spreads widened, on net , particularly 
for speculative-grade borrowers, they remained low by historical standards .  Gross 
issuanc e of corporate bonds in April was below its average pace over the previous few 
months; however, this step -down likely reflects the typical slowdown that occurs during 
the corporate earnings reporting season.  Preliminary data for May suggests that corporat e 
bond issuance has returned  to a moderate pace.

  Growth of outstanding C&I loans was strong in April at  both large and small 
domestic banks as well as  at foreign banks.  This s tronger C&I loan growth follows a 
period of weaker growth that was attributed in the April SLOOS to weak loan demand, 
stemming in part from the widespread availability of internal funds and financing from other sources of credit .  Preliminary d ata for May suggests some moderation of C&I 
loan growth.  
The market for institutional le veraged loans continued to suggest highly 
accommodative conditions.  Issuance volume remained strong in April, with the proceeds continuing to be mostly targeted toward refinancing.  New money issuance was roughly in line with average levels earlier this y ear, suggesting little change in the demand to raise 
new funds through this market.  Spreads on newly issued institutional leveraged loans were close to their post -crisis lows in April, with preliminary data for May suggesting 
that spreads narrowed further for higher-rated loans and were roughly unchanged for lower -rated  loans.   
All told, n et debt financing for the corporate sector in April continued at a 
moderate pace.  With respect to the composition of net debt financing, strong net issuance 
of C&I and institutional leveraged loans in April was partly offset by a net paydown in 
corporate bonds outstanding.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained stable over the 
intermeeting period .  Although the aggregate leverage  ratio for nonfinancial corporations 
remained high, the ratio of interest expense to cash flow  remained  near multidecade lows, 
reflecting low yields on corporate debt and strong corporate earnings.  The first- quarter 
earnings reporting season, which began in April but continued into the current 
intermeeting period, saw e arnings announcements that significantly and broadly  beat 
Wall Street forecasts.   Wall Street analysts have also slightly revised up their forecasts for 
the remai nder of the year.   
Other me asures also point to stable corporate credit quality.  The volume of 
nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades somewhat outpaced the very small volume of bond downgrades in April.  The six -month trailing bond default rate ticked up in April to about 
the midpoint of its historical range , while  the KMV year -ahead expected  default rate in 
April was similar to that in March and stands just below the median of its historical range.

  The volume of equity issuance through initial offerings in April was about in line 
with its average pace over the past few years , while the volume for seasoned offerings 
decreased a bit from its robust pace in the first quarter , in part because of the earnings 
blackout period that also affected corporate bond issuance.  Completed stock repurchases 
in the first quarter were at their highest levels in two years, partly reflecting  increased 
cash distributions to shareholders following the tax reform .  
Small Businesses     
Credit market conditions for s mall business es remained relatively accommodative 
over the intermeeting period , and data on new commercial loans and leases to small 
businesses from Thomson Reuters/PayNet suggest that  originations have picked up in 
recent months.  Measures of small business sentiment—including those with respe ct to 
plans for expansion and capital expenditure—are little changed  and remain near post-
crisis highs.  Recent indicators of loan performance remain strong, with delinquency rates near historical lows.   
Commercial Real Estate  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) also remained  
accommodative.  Even so, the growth of CRE loans held by banks ticked down in April.  
While growth slowed  across all three major CRE loan types, the slowdown was most 
pronounced for construction and land development loans.  
Spreads on commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) were little changed 
over the intermeeting period , remaining near their post -crisis lows.  CMBS issuance , in 
general,  has been robust this year, although it softened somewhat in April, partly 
reflecting seasonal factors.  Market participants expect issuance to continue to decline in 
the near term because of  competition from alternate lending sources such as direct loans 
from banks and nonbank financial institutions, a reduction in the volume of maturing pre-
crisis -era loans that need to be refinanced, and fewer property acquisitions.  Meanwhile, 
the delinquency rate on mortgages in CMBS pools continued to decline, with borrowers’ ability to refinance maturing lo ans boosted by rising property values and low spreads on 
newly issued securities .   
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, debt financing continued to be readily available to 
municipalities at fairly attractive terms.  Yields on 20-year general obligation (GO) bonds 
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)
June 1, 2018
Page 72 of 132

  decreased  slightly more than yields on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.  In 
addition, gross issuance in April was solid, as issuance continued to recover from the 
slow pace recorded at the start of  the year.  Compared with  the same month  last year,  
issuance for new capital expenditures was up slightly, while issuance earmarked for 
refinancing was essentially the same.   On aggregate, t he credit quality of GO bonds 
remained stable in April, with modest numbers of upgrades and downgrades in 
credit  ratings.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Over the intermeeting period, rates on 30-year conforming mortgages declined , on 
net, about in line with yields on agency MBS and longer- term Treasury securities .  
Growth in home-purchase mortgages has slowed a bit and refinancing activity has 
continued to be muted in recent months, in part reflecting the notable increase in 
mortgage rates earlier this year .  That said,  conditions in the residential mortgage market 
appeared to be healthy on balance.  The delinquency rate on residential mortgages, which had ticked up following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, retreated in February and March .  
In addition, f inancing conditions in the residential mortgage market remain ed 
accommodative for most borrowers.  The maximum allowed debt- service- to-income ratio 
for borrowers with high credit scores edged up in the first quarter, with current levels near but still below the pre -crisis peak.  For  borrowers with low credit scores, conditions 
remain tight but have continued to ease.  
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the first 
few months of 2018 and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending.  Growth in consumer credit slowed a bit in the first quarter, as credit card 
balances edged down slightly after having surged in the fourth quarter of last year.   
Household demand for consumer credit appeared to remain solid in recent months.  
Responses to the Michigan survey suggested that while consumers generally expect 
further interest rate increases, their demand for vehicles or other durable goods 
remains  strong.   
Supply of credit to consumers with subprime credit scores continued to tight en, 
likely contributing to a slowing in new extensions of auto loans to subprime borrowers.

  This tightening of credit supply for subprime borrowers comes against a backdrop of 
some signs of deterioration in the credit perf ormance of loans extended to such borrowers 
over recent years , such as higher delinquency rates on auto and credit card loans.  That 
said, the likelihood of success in opening a new credit account of any kind—a measure 
that is helpful in tracking credit su pply conditions —remained near its pre-crisis peak for 
subprime borrowers.

 Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF  RISKS  
As in the April Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of 
economic activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark 
used by the FOMC.   
We judge the risks around our projection for real GDP growth as being balanced.  
On the upside, the impetus to economic growth could be greater than we expect.  For 
instance, business sentiment and profit expectatio ns have rallied, apparently in response 
to the recent changes to fiscal policy and prospects for deregulation; our models that take 
these indicators into account predict a faster pace of business investment than we have 
built into the projection.  On the downside, the recent tax cuts could produce a smaller 
boost to aggregate demand than we have written down.  For instance,  consumers in the 
upper part of the income distribution, toward whom the tax benefits are skewed, could 
have even lower marginal propensities to consume than we have assumed.  Another 
possibility is that the economic spillovers stemming from political turmoil in Italy could 
be substantial.   
While we have left our assessment of risks unchanged for now, we are grappling 
with staff and outside analysis indicating that some aspects of our forecast are consistent 
with a more substantial slowdown in economic activity than we current ly project.1  For 
instance, the box “ Alternative View: A Strong but Precarious Projection” argues that the 
constellation of paths for the output gap, federal funds rate, 10-year Treasury yield, and 
bond spreads in our projection has, in the past,  been consistent with a recession.  More 
generally, the staff is not very good at forecasting recessions, which historically have 
generated sharp increases in the unemployment rate.  As we analyze these issues further, 
we will continue to reassess the balance of risks. 
With regard to inflation, we still see average uncertainty and balanced risks 
around our projection.  To the downside of our modal outlook, the inflation expectations 
relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower than in the baseline or may 
                                                 
1 Indeed, these analyses motivated our move to temper the strength of real activity in the baseline 
projection over the past two Tealbooks.

not edge up in the coming years as we have assumed.  To the upside, with the economy 
projected to be moving further above its long-run potential, inflation may increase more 
than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize 
nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation.  Our judgmental assessments of typical 
uncertainty and balanced risks are consistent with the statistical estimates of the time-
varying risks for the inflation forecast.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the 
baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario illustrates the 
outcomes associated with a recession triggered by a sharp correction in asset valuations.  
The second scenario examines the consequences of a more severe manifestation of supply 
constraints than is built into the baseline projection.  In contrast, in the third scenario, the 
extended period of very high resource utilization envisioned in the baseline projection 
leads to persistent positive effects on the productive capacity of the economy—a form of 
“positive hysteresis.”  The fourth scenario illustrates the consequences of a lower natural 
rate of unemployment that is initially misperceived by the central bank.  In the fifth 
scenario, we analyze the effects of a heightened risk of a breakup of the euro area that 
reverberates around the global economy.  The sixth scenario considers the possibility that 
financial turbulence in emerging market economies (EMEs) leads to a global economic 
slowdown and a stronger appreciation of the dollar.  
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of three staff models that embed 
different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.2  With one exception, the federal 
funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline; the first scenario, which 
features a recession, allows for a more aggressive monetary policy response in the early 
quarters of the simulation.   In addition, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio 
are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios. 
                                                 
2 The three models used are:  (1) FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the 
U.S. economy; (2) a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the 
labor market similar to that described in Mark L. Gertler, Luca Sala, and Antonella Trigari (2008), “An 
Estimated Monetary DSGE Model with Unemployment and Staggered Nominal Wage Bargaining,” 
Journal of Money, Credit and Banking,  vol. 40 (8), pp. 1713–64; and (3) SIGMA, which is a calibrated 
multicountry DSGE model.

Financial  Correction with Return to E ffective Lower Bound [FRB/US] 
Asset valuations in equity and corporate bond markets are still considered to be at 
an elevated level despite some easing from earlier this year.  In this scenario, we assume 
a correction in asset prices that leads to persistently higher risk premiums and a 
curtailment of credit to households and businesses.  In addition, we assume negative 
shocks to consumption, investment, and aggregate labor hours beyond those implied by 
the initial tightening of financial conditions.  These negative shocks could be interpreted 
as changes in sentiment (or animal spirits) but also possibly as further adverse effects of 
tighter leverage constraints and disruption in the supply of credit that are not captured by 
the standard equations of the FRB/US model.  Finally, consistent with the historical 
tendency of the Committee to cut rates aggressively in downturns, we assume that, at the 
onset of the recession, the federal funds rate is determined by the non-inertial Taylor rule.   
With stock market prices falling about 25 percent by the end of 2018 and the 
triple-B corporate bond spread rising about 200 basis points above the baseline, real GDP 
contracts for several consecutive quarters beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018.  The 
unemployment rate increases 2¾ percentage points— roughly the historical average of the 
increases observed in the recessions that have occurred in the post–World War II 
period— reaching 6½ percent in late 2019.  Core and headline PCE inflation fal l  
½ percentage point below the baseline by early 2020.  With policymakers reacting 
quickly to the downturn, the federal funds rate returns to the effective lower bound in the 
second quarter of 2019 and stays there until the end of 2020; thereafter, it gradually 
increases and reaches about 3 percent by the end of 2023.3 
Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model] 
In the baseline projection, the unemployment rate declines to a little below  
3½ percent by early 2019 and remains below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate for a 
number of years.  However, with the economy operating so far above its potential level, 
supply constraints could bind even more severely than we have assumed in the baseline 
projection.  For instance, when the unemployment rate is unusually low, filling a vacancy 
becomes more difficult, which could imply a reduced pace of hiring and a substantially 
                                                 
3 With the inertial Taylor rule, the Committee would cut rates less aggressively.  As a result, the 
federal funds rate would not reach the effective lower bound and economic outcomes would be worse; the 
unemployment rate would be ½ percentage point higher at its peak, and real GDP growth would be  
¾ percentage point lower at its trough.

steeper rise in wages.  We illustrate these risks using simulations from a nonlinear New 
Keynesian model with costly search and matching frictions in the labor market.  In this 
model, recruiting costs and wages are higher when the unemployment rate is low because 
firms have to spend more time and resources looking for and attracting workers.4 
With greater supply constraints, the unemployment rate continues to decline until 
mid-2019, but only by ¼ percentage point, ¼ percentage point less than in the baseline 
projection, and this gap persists over the forecast horizon.  However, GDP growth is 
close to the baseline throughout the projection horizon as , in this model, more-intense 
utilization of capital compensates for the reduction in labor input.  Because of higher 
recruiting costs and faster wage growth, inflation is significantly higher and  pe aks at  
2¾ percent in early 2020.  Monetary policymakers are assumed to infer resource slack 
from the unemployment rate, and the federal funds rate is slightly above the baseline as 
the effect of higher inflation dominate s the effect of the smaller unemployment gap. 
Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]  
In contrast to the previous scenario, the hot labor market in the baseline projection 
is assumed in this scenario to have persistent positive effects on the productive capacity 
of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as “positive hysteresis.”  Specifically, 
we assume that persistent exposure to a hot economy reduces exits from the labor force 
and generates additional entrants, causing the trend labor force participation rate to rise 
about 1 percentage point above the baseline by the end of 2023.  Furthermore, we assume 
that the experience that workers gain through greater employment lowers the natural rate 
of unemployment ½ percentage point by the end of 2023.   Both of these favorable 
developments are assumed to be recognized in real time by monetary policymakers.5 
In this scenario, potential output rises, on average, about ¼ percentage point more 
per year over the projection period than in the baseline.  This additional room to grow 
allows real GDP growth to run at a similar increment above the baseline.  As a result, the 
                                                 
4 Since the previous round, we have made a few technical refinements in the implementation of 
this scenario, which we believe allow us to more accurately quantify the marginal effects of the model’s 
nonlinearities on the simulated outcomes. The paths of the unemployment rate and inflation in this scenario 
are slightly lower in this round than they would have been under the previous round’s implementation.  
5 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the 
natural rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-
generating compo nents.

output gap is little changed.  The unemployment rate is close to the baseline until the 
middle of 2019 because increases in labor force participation  offset the effect of greater 
gains in employment.  After 2019, the unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory and 
is a little more than ¼ percentage point below the staff projection by 2023.  With inflation 
and the output gap roughly at the baseline, the federal funds rate is little changed.6 
Misperceived Lower Natural Rate of Unemployment [FRB/US] 
Over the past several years, the staff has lowered its estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment.  Today’s lower natural rate could reflect low-frequency changes in 
various demographic factors such as the age and educational distribution of the 
population.  In this scenario, we entertain the possibility that these factors have reduced 
the natural rate of unemployment by a larger amount than is assumed in the baseline.  
Specifically, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been 3¾ percent for 
the past few years and will remain at that level in the future.  Furthermore, policymakers 
and the staff continue, for a time, to misperceive the level of the natural rate; their 
perceptions converge to the true level only gradually,  and that convergence is not 
complete by the end of 2023.   
Given the lower natural rate, the unemployment rate in the scenario declines  
½ percentage point more than in the baseline, reaching about 3 percent in 2020.  Because 
policymakers revise their view of the natural rate downward only gradually, the gap 
between the unemployment rate and the perceived natural rate is larger, albeit by a small 
amount, than in the baseline.  With inflation only a touch lower and the perceived output 
gap not much different from the baseline, the path for the federal funds rate is little 
changed.  Had policymakers fully and immediately recognized the lower natural rate, the 
perceived output gap would have been substantially smaller and the federal funds rate 
would have been about ¼ percentage point lower during the first two years of the 
simulation.  The unemployment rate would have fallen ¾ percentage point below the 
baseline in 2020, ¼ percentage point further than in the case of misperception.  
                                                 
6 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential 
output, the federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching almost 
5¼ percent by the end of 2021 .  In that case, the effect of positive hysteresis on the unemployment rate is 
about half of that under this scenario.

Heightened Risk of Euro -Area Breakup [SIGMA] 
In our baseline, we marked down the outlook for euro-area growth on the 
assumption that ongoing political uncertainty in Italy will generate moderate financial 
stresses in other euro-area countries.  Our scenario considers a substantially worse 
outcome in which a populist government steers Italy on a course that threatens its 
solvency or its continued membership in the euro area.  By weakening investor 
confidence in European institutions and causing anxiety about a possible breakup of the 
euro area, these developments plunge the euro area into a prolonged period of financial 
stress, flagging confidence, and recession.  While we assume that financial markets 
gradually recover after the Italian government reverses course and the EU authorities take 
forceful policy actions, the crisis nonetheless has sizable adverse spillovers to the United 
States and the rest of the world.   
Specifically, our scenario assumes that euro-area GDP falls about 4 percent below 
the baseline by the end of 2019 as both sovereign and private credit conditions tighten 
dramatically, though somewhat less than during the 2011– 12 European debt crisis, and 
household and business confidence declines.  Investment-grade U.S. corporate bond 
spreads rise about 75 basis points, flight- to-safety flows boost the trade-weighted dollar 
10 percent above its baseline path, and the term premium on long-term U.S. Treasur y 
securities declines 30 basis points.  Financial conditions also tighten markedly in 
economies outside Europe and the United States. 
Weaker foreign activity and the stronger dollar cause U.S. real net exports to fall 
relative to the baseline, while lower confidence and tighter financial conditions in the 
United States depress domestic demand.  All told , U.S. real GDP expands only 
1¼  percent in the second half of 2018 and 1½  percent in 2019.  The U.S. unemployment 
rate is about ¾  percentage point higher than in the baseline in late 2019 and remains 
above the baseline through 2022.  Lower resource utilization and falling import prices 
reduce U.S. core PCE inflation to about 1¼ percent by 2019.  The federal funds rate 
follows a shallower path, about 1 percentage point below the baseline on average from 
2019 to 2021.  
EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar [SIGMA] 
In our baseline, we continue to expect solid growth in most EMEs despite some 
increases in financial stresses.  Even so, EMEs face a number of vulnerabilities, including

high sovereign and private debt, that may be exacerbated by ongoing U.S. monetary 
policy normalization, especially if investor confidence is weakened by heightening 
geopolitical risks, rising trade tensions, or political uncertainties.  In this scenario, we 
assume that EME economies experience a broad-based deterioration of financial 
conditions that is accompanied by substantial capital outflows and currency depreciation, 
generating sizable adverse spillovers to the United States and advanced foreign 
economies.   
Specifically, this scenario assumes that declining confidence fuels an ongoing 
flight from EME assets, causing credit spreads to widen substantially and EME 
currencies to depreciate sharply.  Flight- to-safety flows into dollar-denominated assets 
reduce the term premiums on U.S. Treasury securities 30 basis points and cause corporate 
bond spreads to rise 50 basis points both in the United States and in the advanced foreign 
economies.  All told, foreign GDP growth runs ¾ percentage point below the baseline in 
2019, while the broad real dollar appreciates by 10 percent.   
Weaker foreign activity, the appreciation of the dollar, and tighter financial 
conditions restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States.  U.S. GDP 
growth moderates to 1¾ percent in 2019, about ¾ percentage point less than in the 
baseline.  Core PCE inflation is still below 2 percent in 2019, about ¼ percentage point 
lower than the baseline.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in  
the baseline.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  The near -term prescriptions are little changed from 
those in the previous Tealbook.  Over the medium term, the Tealbook baseline projection 
features  somewhat lower levels of resource utilization , on average, than the projection 
completed in April.  Consequently, the prescriptions arising from most of the strategies 
are slightly more accommodative than those in the previous Tealbook.  In the box 
“Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies ,” we explore the economic 
consequences of a change in policy strategy  when the public is uncertain about 
policymakers ’ reaction function and has to learn about the new policy strategy over time. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The t op panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the “balanced 
approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible price -level  
targeting (FPLT ) rule .  These near -term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap and core inflation , shown by the black lines in the middle 
panels, and for the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate o f 
unemployment (not shown).  The top and middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline 
path for the federal funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor 
(1999) rule.1  
Here and in the simple policy rule simulations, we  have replaced the nominal 
income targeting (NIT) rule that has appeared in past Tealbooks with one of the FPLT 
rules discussed in the April Tealbook.2  Like the nominal income targeting rule, th e FPLT  
rule aims to reverse past deviations of inflation from policymakers’ objective rather than 
letting “bygones be bygones.”  However, it differs from the NIT rule by specifying that 
                                                 
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules  in the appendix to this section.   Except for the 
first-difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use intercept terms that 
are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.  
2 In the April Tealbook, this rule was featured i n the special exhibit of the Monetary Policy 
Strategies (MPS) section under the name “FPLT, equal responses (2011:Q4).”  This rule has also been 
analyzed in the research literature (for example, Chung and others, 2015).

report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the
current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the March 2018 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baselineprojections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

 the federal funds rate reacts to the unemployment rate gap  and a price gap defined using 
the core PCE price index, rather than the output gap and a price gap defined using the 
GDP  deflator .3  The FPLT rule we consider  uses equal coefficients on the unemployment 
and price gaps and has the same degree of interest rate inertia as the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule used in the Tealbook baseline.4  Like the NI T rule that preceded it , the FPLT 
rule uses a target path for prices that equals the actual price level in  2011:Q4—which is 
the quarter  just before the Committee announced its 2 percent inflation objective—and 
that rises at a 2 percent annual rate thereafter.   
• The staff forecast for the variables that enter these rules has changed very 
little; consequently, the prescriptions of the policy rules are nearly the same as in the April Tealbook.  
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules , which do not 
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.   
• Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which  call for raising 
the federal funds rate in the near term , the FPLT  rule, in an effort to eliminate 
the shortfall in the core PCE  price index of about 2½ percent, prescribes level s 
for the federal funds rate in the second and third quarters that remain within 
the current target range.  
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL  
FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
                                                 
3 The use of the core PCE price index in the rule is consistent with the other rules in the MPS 
section that respond to core PCE inflation .  If the rule responded to the headline PCE price level, then the 
rule would prescribe more volatile policy rates .  Moreover, in the event of an increase in oil prices, such a 
rule would prescribe higher policy rates in order to offset the effect of this increase on the aggregate price 
level, thereby reducing aggregate demand to put downward pressure on non -oil prices . 
4 The sensitivity of the FPLT rule to  the cyclical position of the economy is similar to the Taylor 
(1993) rule.  The FRB/US model roughly satisfies the empirical regularity known as Okun’s law by generating changes in the unemployment gap that are roughly half as large and of the opposite sign as 
changes in the output gap.  Hence, a coefficient of negative 1 on the unemployment gap (as in the FPLT 
rule) has implications similar to those of  a coefficient of 0.5 on the output gap (as in the Taylor 
(1993) rule).

 baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March  2018 Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).5  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used  
to generate an  estimate  of r*.  Th is r* concept, labeled  “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting in 
the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  
This concept of r* is a summary of  the projected  underlying strength of the real 
economy; because it is based on a single criterion , it does not take into account other 
considerations, such as  achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the 
federal funds rate. 
• At 3.19 percent , the est imate of Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* in this 
quarter is 21 basis points below the corresponding value computed using 
information from the April  Tealbook.  Th e downward revision reflects the fact 
that the projected output gap is slightly smaller  in 2021 than in the April  
Tealbook.  
• At about 1½ percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower 
than the Tealbook-consistent FRB /US r*.  The difference stems from the fact 
that the SEP-consistent projection has  output exceeding  potential by a 
considerably smaller amount over the medium term than does the current  
Tealbook forecast .  This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact 
that the median path for the real federal funds rate implied by SEP projections 
averages  almost 1  percent age point lower than  the corresponding path in the 
Tealbook. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (199 3) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the FPLT  rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
                                                 
5 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the March 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth 
and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the 
SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemp loyment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.6  The 
simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and 
wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this 
commitment and  are aware of the implication s for interest rates and the macroeconomy .  
The exhibit also reports the extended Tealbook baseline projection.   
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate rises to about 2½ percent 
by the end of this year.  Over the subsequent two years, it increases  by about 
1 percentage point per year, bringing the rate to slightly above 4½ percent in 
the fourth quarter of 2020. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain  above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values through early  2022.  This higher path is associated 
with only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10 -year Treasury yield than 
in the baseline through the middle of 2020 and a slightly lower path there after, 
as the Taylor (1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate for a sustained period later in the simulation period.  Because wage and 
price setting today is influenced by expected future outcomes in FRB/US, and 
because the Taylor (1999) rule calls for somewhat more accommodative policy later in the simulation, current inflation is  a touch higher than in the 
baseline projection.  The path for the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook baseline path  over the next few years, but subsequently takes a bit 
longer to return to its natural rate.  In the box “Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies ,” we examine the implications for macroeconomic 
outcomes of departing from the assumption that the public imme diately 
understand the new policy in the context of this simulation. 
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate.  Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to 
projected output exceeding its assumed potential level , the prescriptions of 
this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over the period shown.  
                                                 
6 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from tho se shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.

 Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies  
In the simple policy rule simulations reported in this Tealbook , the Taylor (1999) rule initially 
raises the federal funds rate more than 2 20 basis points above the Tealbook baseline.  
Despite this abrupt tightening , inflation is higher than in the Tealbook baseline, and the 
unemployment rate rises only modestly above the Tealbook baseline.  These counterintuitive 
outcomes arise because financial market participants as well as price and wage setters  are 
assumed to have  model- consistent  expectations  (MCE):  They  immediately recognize how the 
policy rule has changed  and perfectly anticipate the more accommodative policy that the 
Taylor (1999) rule prescribes in later years in the simulation .   
In this discussion , we consider the alternative assumption that the public only gradually 
comes to understand a change in policy strategy .  Specifically, we assume that the public is 
initially uncertain about  the parameters of the new policy rule and that their beliefs about 
likely parameter values  evolve over time through a process of learning from the observed 
values of the federal funds rate and information about the state of the economy .1  In the 
short run there can be misperceptions about the new policy strategy .  The economic 
outcomes associated with changes in the monetary policy rule under learning can be 
considerably different from those under MCE .   
We illustrate how this learning process  can affect economic outcomes  using  a scenario in 
which policymakers initially follow the prescriptions of  the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) 
rule, as in th e Tealbook baseline, and then in the third quarter of 2018 switch to the non -
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  We carry out three sets of simulations  using the 
small FRB /US (sFRB) model .2  In the first simulation, the public has model- consistent  
expectations  and thus immediately understands the properties of the new policy rule.  In the 
second and third simulation s, the public  does not directly observe how the policy rule has 
changed and is uncertain about the smoothing coefficient on the lagged federal funds rate as 
well as the value of the intercept  term in the rule. 3  Beliefs about the intercept capture a 
variety of reasons the public might believe the FOMC to be undertaking  a persistent deviation 
from the policy rule, including changes in policymakers’ assessment of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate or the inflation target .  The two learning simulations differ only in their 
assumptions about the public’s initial or prior beliefs  about the relative likelihood of different 
kinds of policy changes.  
Figure 1  shows the evolution of the economy  in the scenario under MCE  and under learning, 
along with the Tealbook baseline.  The  simulation under MCE  is virtually identical to the one 
for the Taylor (1999) rule shown earlier in the Monetary Policy Strategies section , which uses

variables.   Under MCE, the simulations carried out in FRB/US and sFRB are very similar.   
3 For simplicity, we assume that t he public knows  the true rule parameters with certainty until 201 8:Q2  
and remain s certain throughout the simulation about the response coeffic ients on inflation and the output 
gap.  The values of these two coefficients are the same in both rules considered here.

 the full FRB/US model .  Despite an immediate and sharp tightening in which the federal funds 
rate jumps above 4 percent , inflation runs slightly higher under the Taylor (1999) rule than 
the inertial version of the rule.    
By contrast, in the simulation labeled “Learning ( less informed prior),” switching  to the non -
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule induces a large  fall in inflation; moreover, inflation  
remains below the Committee’s 2 percent objective through 2022 .  At the same time, the 
unemployment rate increases by more than under MCE.  This difference in economic 
outcomes under learning stems from the way in which the public interprets the large and  
unexpected increase in the federal funds rate in 2018 :Q3.4  In the near term, in this simulation, 
the public  attributes the sharp  increase in the federal funds rate partly to a lower value of the 
smoothing coefficient  in the policy rule, but also partly to a higher value of  the intercept .  As a 
result of this  misperception, the public  anticipate s a significant and sustained  tightening of 
policy .  These expectations of tighter policy are  reflected in a large run -up in the real 10 -year 
Treasury yield that persists for several quarters .   
Figure 2 illustrates the  misperception about the future policy path.  The figure shows  paths 
for the real federal funds rate as expected  by the public as of selected dates, as well as the 
realized path of the federal funds rate.  In 2018 :Q3, the public  anticipate s a path for the real 
federal funds rate that is considerably higher than the realized path.  This  divergence of 
anticipated and realized path s occurs because, as noted above, t he public misinterprets the 
removal of policy inertia as an increase in the intercept that leads to persistently tighter 
policy .  In contrast, t he actual path of the federal funds rate realized under the Taylor (1999) 
rule lies below the corresponding path under MCE because the rule reacts to the fall in inflation and resource utilization caused by the public’s misperceptions.  
Over time, the public  revises  its perception of the pol icy rule in light of how policy actions 
respond to economic outcomes  and adjusts  its estimates of the intercept and the smoothing 
coefficient .  The perceived parameters  of the policy rule gradually move toward their true 
values.  In figure 1, the economy gradually converges to its path under MCE .  In figure 2, 
anticipated an d realized pol icy paths converge.   
In a situation in which the federal funds rate is changed by a historically large amount, 
predicting how the public will form its expectations  is ultimately a speculative exercise.  The 
simulation just described represents only one of  many plausible outcomes .  In particular, the 
effects of learning depend on the public’s initial or prior beliefs about the predictability of  
policymakers ’ actions .  To illustrate this point, w e conduct an alternative simulation labeled 
“Learning  (more inf ormed prior),” where the public is assumed to believe  that  changes in the 
intercept term of the rule are  less likely , and changes in the smoothing coefficient are more 
likely , than in the previous simulation .  These  prior beliefs are closer to the actual change in 
the policy strategy, and, in this sense , are more informed.  As a result, misperceptions about 
the future path of policy are smaller, and economic outcomes in figure 1 are more similar to 
those obtained under MCE .   
                                                 
4 The state of the economy at the time of the announcement greatly influences t he extent to which 
learning affects economic outcomes  when  the rule is changed .  In a situation in which  the inertial and the 
non -inertial versions of the Taylor (1999) rule both  prescribed similar values, announcing a change  from the 
former to the latter rule would lead to only minor changes in the observed pa th of the federal funds rate.  
Accordingly , allowing for  learning would have only minor  effect s on economic outcomes.

 The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook 
baseline over the next two years, though, s tarting in the third quarter of 2020, 
the path for the federal funds rate falls  below the baseline path for a sustained 
period.  As a result, current inflation is higher , and the real 10 -year Treasury 
yield is lower , than  their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.  
The more accommodative conditions engender a more pronounced 
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate  beyond the 
medium term. 
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule is 
somewhat above th e path in the Tealbook baselin e through 2020, but runs 
below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter divergence 
occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the expected 
change in the output gap rather than to its level, rea cts to projected  output 
exceeding its assumed potential level by progressively smaller amounts beyond the next three years.  The associated lower path of the federal funds 
rate, in conjunction with expectations of higher inflation in the future, implies 
lower longer -term real interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline.  Thus, the 
first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are 
lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than  the corresponding 
outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection. 
• The FPLT  rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative  shortfall of core PCE 
inflation from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.  T he FPLT  
rule calls for keeping  the federal funds rate below 1¾ percent until the third 
quarter of 2019, and maintaining a markedly slower pace of increases 
thereafter than in the Tealbook baseline.  This prescription generates a higher  
rate of inflation in coming years that eventually undoes  the 2½ percent  
shortfall of the core PCE  price index relative to a path that rises 2 percent per 
year beginning in 2011:Q4 .
7  Because the simulation embeds the assumptions 
that policymakers  can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that 
financial market participants , price setter s, and wage setters  correctly 
anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal funds rates, the path of the 
                                                 
7 Using the headline measure of PCE prices, the 2018 :Q1 price -level gap is about 4  percent , 
1.5 percentage points larger than the gap based on core PCE prices.  Accordingly, a rule that responded  to 
headline PCE prices rather than to core  PCE prices would prescribe an even more accommodat ive policy .

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core

 real 10 -year Treasury rate drops below the Tealbook baseline for the next five 
years .  The unemployment rate is substantially lower  than  in the Tealbook 
baseline and all other simulations shown, dropping below 2½ percent 
in 2021.8 
• Compared with the April  Tealbook, the prescriptions of the simple rules are 
around ¼ percentage point lower by the end of 2021.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.9  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may result in improved economic outcomes.10   
The first t hree of the four  optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for 
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection, for two reasons.  First, 
high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up 
to its natur al rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the 
unemployment rate does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the FRB/US model.  Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the front -loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.  In practice, 
however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as high and as quickly as 
prescribed by the first three optimal control policies , macroeconomic outcomes could be 
less benign than shown here because of the confusion and financial market disruption that 
such an abrupt change in policy might engender .
11  In contrast, the fourth optimal control 
                                                 
8 The unemployment rate subsequently rises to a level near its natural rate in 2031, while core PCE 
inflation falls from a peak of 2.3 percent in 2020 to 2 percent  in 2031.  
9 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.  
10 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that will not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (tha t is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  
11 The simulation results  hinge on the assumptions that agents in the model have perfect fore sight  
and are certain that policymakers will implement the prescribed path for the federal funds rate.  We discuss 
an alternative assumption about expectations using simple policy rules in the box “Learning and 
Misperceptions of Policy Strategies.”

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

 policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels  last experienced during  the 
1950s.  S uch a development might likewise  entail outcomes different from those 
predicted by the simulations.    
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable 
undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate over the next several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with  
the equal -weights loss function judge to be costly.
12  The small p rojected 
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail 
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.  
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates  only 
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response of  
inflation to the level of resource utilization is limited.  
• The second  simulation , “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five 
times larger than the specification  with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical to that specification.  Even though the losses associated with 
undershooting the inflation objective are larger in coming years, the resulting 
optimal strategy is only marginally  more accommodative t han in the “Equal 
weights” case, for two reasons.   First , inflation is already close to the 
Comm ittee’s 2 percent objective.  Second , in the FRB/US model, 
policymakers face an unappealing tradeoff  because inflation responds only 
weakly to resource utilization.  
• The third  simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
                                                 
12 When we use the March 2018 SEP -consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal 
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5 percent, compared 
with about 8  percent under the Tealbook baseline.

 but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This 
simulation seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even faster 
than under the equal- weight s specificatio n.  As a result, the federal funds rate 
soars above 11 percent  at the end of 2018 and then averages  around 7 percent 
from 2020 through 2023. 
• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss 
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path throughout the period shown.  With the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this initially more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by 
an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  T he tighter 
labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent than in the case of equal 
weights.  Starting in the middle of the 2020s (not shown), the unemployment 
rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource u tilization.  
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adher e to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict a dherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymake rs and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymak ers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES  SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  It also reports the expression for the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule ; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a small 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  The right -hand- side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter 
core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the 
output gap estimate for the current period ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead

  annual change in the output gap  (𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run 
inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.    
The flexible price- level  targeting rule responds to a price  gap and an unemployment rate 
gap.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference  between the log of the core PCE price 
level, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price-level path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 2011:Q4 value of the target path is set 
to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price level, and, subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 
2 percent annual rate.   The unemployment gap is defined as the difference between the 
unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡∗. 
Simple Rules  
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas  the 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price  gap like the FPLT rule  
have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1  An FPLT rule similar to the one 
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).   
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and  chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.2  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule 
do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES 
The “Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
                                                 
1 For applications, see, for example , Erceg and others ( 2012).   
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same  360-day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a 360 -day basis.  Taylor (1999) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡

  and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the  Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines :  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection .3  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given eco nomic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection , the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectati ons and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that qu arter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

  COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted  
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment r ate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The fir st specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weigh t to inflation gaps.  The third  specification, “Minimal weight on ra te adjustments,” places 
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
4  The fourth  specification, “ Asymmetric 
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the 
unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the 
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights 
used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.

  For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see s this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon further would not a ffect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits.

Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum        of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
        household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
        to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
