 Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The incomin g data have corroborated our view that the slowdown in economic 
activity in the first quarter of the year would be transitory .  Indeed, real GDP in the 
second quarter now looks to have increased  at an annual rate of 4¾  percent, a 
considerably larger rebound than we had anticipated.1  In the second half of the year, we 
estimate  that real GDP will rise at an annual rate of 2½  percent .  This pace is slower than  
we projected  in June, as some of the second -quarter surprise is expected  to unwind, but it 
is still sufficient to further widen the gap between  actual and potential output.  Labor 
market conditions have continued to tighten, and, on a quarterly basis, the unemployment 
rate declined slightly  to 3.9 percent in the second quarter, ¾ percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate.  With above-trend output growth, the unemployment rate is 
expected to edge down further through year-end. 
After rising almost 3 percent this year,  real GDP is projected  to decelerate in 2019 
and 2020 amid the ongoing tightening in monetary policy  and the emergence of some 
modest supply constraints .  GDP rises faster than potential through 2019 and then moves 
about in line with it in 2020.  At the end of the medium term, the output gap remains in 
excess of 3  percent.  We continue to project that the unemployment rate will have moved 
down to 3½ percent by that time, 1 ¼ percentage point s below our esti mate of its natural 
rate.  The se medium- term projection s are little changed relative to June, reflecting small 
and largely offsetting r evisions to our financial assumptions and other conditioning 
factors.     
The incoming information  on consumer prices has  been broadly consistent with 
our expectations.  T he 12-month change in core PCE prices is estimated to have been  
1.9 percent in June, and this measure of core inflation is expected  to remain near that 
level  through the end of the year.  In the medium term, core PCE price inflation is 
forecast to move up gradually and reach 2.1 percent in 2020, as labor and product 
markets tighten further.   Total PCE price inflation is projected to run a touch below core 
inflation  after this year,  reflecting the declining p ath for consumer energy prices  in the 
1 The BEA will release its advance estimate of 2018:Q2 real GDP growth (along with 
comprehensive revisions to the national accounts) on Friday, July 27.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The July Tealbook projection for real GDP growth is in line with the Blue Chip 
consensus forecast in 2018 and ¼ percentage point higher in 2019.  The staff’s 
unemployment rate forecast is near the Blue Chip consensus in 2018 and 2019.  The 
staff projections for total CPI inflation are below the Blue Chip consensus forecasts in 
both 2018 and 2019.  (Note that projections from the Survey of Professional 
Forecasters are more than two months old.) 
    Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

  medium term.  As before, these projections incorporate our assumption that modest 
supply constraints will result in slightly higher inflation than would otherwise be the case.   
Finally, we estimate that the effects of  recent ly implemented  tariffs —including 
those on steel, aluminum, and certain imports from China—along with our trading 
partners’ responses to those tariffs  will be minimal both for overall net exports and for 
aggregate prices.  Other potential tariff changes remain highly uncertain and are not 
included in our projection, but the ir possible effects are discussed in the Risks and  
Uncertainty section.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy 
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase ¾  percentage point  over the 
remainder of this year and to rise, on average, 1 percentage point per year for 
the following two years, reaching 4 ¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
This trajecto ry is a touch steeper than in the June Tealbook, reflecting the 
slightly  higher output gap over the medium term.  
• The size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predictable decline as 
securities are redeemed in a manner consistent with the Committe e’s June 
2017 Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans and with the process initiated in October 2017.  
Other Interest Rates 
• The 10- year Treasury yield is projected to rise from an average of about 
3 percent in the current quarter to 4¼ percent by the end of 2020.  T he 
projected yield over the next few quarters is revised down somewhat, 
reflecting lower -than-expected market quotes since the June Tealbook ; the 
yield is little revised from the end of 2019 onward.  
• The 30- year fixed mortgage rate and the triple -B corporate bond yield are also 
projected to rise significantly over the medium term.  Over the projection period, both rates are revised in line with revisions to the path of the 10- year 
Treasury yield.

  Equity Prices and Home Prices 
• Equity prices are projected to end the current quarter about 3 percent above 
the June Tealbook forecast, reflecting recent increases in broad equity price indexes.  Beyond the current quarter, we forecast  stock prices to rise at an 
average annual rate of around ½  percent, similar to our previous projection. 
• In response to strong incoming data through May , we pushed up our forecast 
for house price growth through the end of 2019.  However, with house prices running above the level suggested by their historical relationship with rents 
and with interest rates  also rising, we expect some downward pressure on 
house price appreciation  over the medium term.  Specifically, we project  
house price growth will slow from 7 percent this year to 3¼ percent in 2020.  
At the end of 2020, the projected level of house prices is 2½ percent higher 
than in the June Tealbook. 
Fiscal Policy 
• We estimate that discretionary fiscal policy actions across all levels of government will contribute ½  percentage point to GDP growth in 2018, 
exclusive of any multiplier effects and offsets from associated reactions in interest rates and the dollar.  Reflecting the lagged effects of recent legislative 
actions, the impetus to GDP growth from policy actions is projected to remain 
around ½ percentage point in 2019 and 2020.   
o Roughly one-half of the medium- term impetus is due to the recent tax 
cuts, and about one- fourth  of it is due to the recent federal  spending 
increases ; the remainder is attributable to state and local government 
spending. 
• The federal deficit is projected to rise from 3 ½ percent of GDP in fiscal year 
2017 to 5½ percent in fiscal 2020—an increase that primarily reflects the 
effects of the recently  enacted tax and spending legislation.   
o We continue to ass ume that , in the longer run, policymakers will enact 
measures that gradually reduce deficits by an amount sufficient to stabilize 
the debt- to-GDP ratio.  The magnitude of the budget adjustments needed 
to reach a sustainable path for debt are discussed in t he box “Federal Debt 
and Deficits:  The 10 -Year Outlook under Two Fiscal Policy Scenarios.”

  o We also continue to assume that recent fiscal actions will not change the 
longer- run equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate, as the current 
stimulus to ag gregate demand will eventually be offset by contractionary 
policy actions that  stabilize the debt- to-GDP ratio.  However, we judge 
that the debt- to-GDP ratio will stabilize at a level that is 20 percentage 
points higher than it would have been absent those recent policy actions, 
and, in turn, the higher debt- to-GDP ratio will push up the longer- run term 
premium on 10- year Treasury securities by 50 basis points. 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
• Real GDP growth in the foreign economies is estimated to have moderated to an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter, a little lower than in the 
previous Tealbook, as a rebound in growth in some advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) was more than offs et by a broad -based slowing in the 
emerging market economies  (EMEs) .  We continue to foresee GDP growth 
abroad edging up to a near-potential pace of 2¾ percent in the second half of this year and remaining there over the forecast period. 
• The broad nominal dollar index has moved up about 1¾ percent since the June Tealbook.  The dollar appreciation against AFE currencies was broad based.  
The appreciation was also notable against EME currencies, especially the 
Chinese renminbi, which weakened about 6 percent, the largest intermeeting 
move over the past two  decades .  The dollar index would have increased 
substantially more but for a rally of the Mexican peso on easing market concerns about the economic policies of Mexico’s president- elect .  We expect 
the broad real dollar to appreciate at an annual rate of about 2 percent through the forecast horizon, as market expectations for the federal funds rate move up 
toward the staff forecast.  The broad real  dollar at the end of the forecast 
horizon is about 1¾ percent higher than projected in June largely because of 
the recent appreciation.  
Oil and Commodity Prices 
• The spot price of Brent crude oil has fallen about $5 per barrel , on net, since 
the June Tealbook, closing most recently around $73 per barrel.  Oil prices 
moved down in early July in response to a loosening of OPEC supply 
constraints, improved supply conditions in Libya , and market concerns about

 Federal Debt and  Deficits:  The 10-Year Outlook under T wo Fiscal 
Policy Scenarios  
Federal debt held by the public is at its highest level as a percent of GDP in th e past 
70 years and  is projected to rise further.   A high  and rising  debt -to-GDP ratio has  
important consequences for the economy, including a reduction in national savings , 
upward pressure on interest rates , an increase in debt service costs , a reduced  capacity 
to use deficit spending to address unexpected events such as a recession , and an 
increase in the likelihood of a fiscal crisis.  In this discussion, we describe projections of 
deficits and debt under different fiscal policy scenarios using estimates from the 
Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 
The change in the debt -to-GDP ratio over time is affected by the primary deficit  (outlays 
excluding interest payments minus receipts ), the growth rate of nominal  GDP , and  the 
effective nominal interest rate on debt.  Higher primary deficits and  interest rates push 
up the debt -to-GDP ratio, while greater GDP growth  restrains  it.1    
Assuming current law remains largely unchanged, the CBO projects  that  the debt -to-
GDP  ratio will rise from 7 8 percent in fiscal year 2018 to 96  percent  by the end of fiscal 
2028 —red line in the left panel of  the figure—driven by continued primary deficits and 
an increase in the effective  interest rate on the debt.2  As shown by the red line in the 
right panel of the f igure, the primary deficit under current law is expected to be around  
2 percent from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2028.  This deficit is lower than the expected fiscal 
2018 deficit  because, under current law , the higher cap s on appropriations enacted by 
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018  (BBA) expire at the end of fiscal 2019 , when the caps 
revert to the levels  set by the Budget Control Act of 2011 .  In addition, t ax revenues  are 
expected to increase under current law as temporary provisions in the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (TCJA) —including  most of the individual income tax provisions and lower tax 
rates for pass -through businesses —expire at the end of 2025.3   
There is substantial uncertainty about the path of fiscal policy in general and whether 
the temporary tax cuts and spending increases will expire in particular.  The budget  
outlook is substantially different if these provisions remain in place.  Under a n 
                                                 
1 Nominal GDP growth and effective interest rates affect the debt -to-GDP ratio similarly.  As a 
result, their combined effect can be assessed by subtracting nominal GDP growth from the effective 
interest rate.  On average over the past 30 years, the nominal  growth rate of GDP has been roughly 
equal to the effective interest rate on the national debt.  More recently, however, nominal GDP growth has exceeded  the interest rate on debt and offset some of the upward pressure on the debt -
to-GDP ratio from primary deficits.    
2 The CBO projects that the debt- to-GDP  ratio will increase further,  to over  150 percent of GDP in 
fiscal 2048.  Since 1792, federal debt has exceeded 100 percent of GDP only from 1945  to 19 47, near the 
end of WWII.  
3 These temporary tax cuts and spending increases have changed the budget outlook 
considerably.  Cumulatively, between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2028 the TCJA and BBA are expected to add roughly 8 percentage points to the debt -to-GDP ratio.

 alternative current policy  baseline where the BBA and the TCJA are extended 
indefinitely  beginning in fiscal 2020, primary deficits are projected to increase to roughly 
4 percent of GDP by fiscal 2028 (blue line in the right  panel of the figure).4  As a result , 
the federal de bt is projected  to grow to 107 percent of GDP  over the next 10 years  (blue 
line in left panel of the figure) . 
Under either scenario, stabilization of the debt -to-GDP  ratio will require substantial 
deficit reduction that is likely to reduce the growth of aggregate demand .  Consider the 
reductions needed to stabilize the debt -to-GDP  ratio by eliminating the primary deficit 
over 10 years  (starting in fiscal 2019  and assuming that the interest rate on debt is equal 
to the growth rate of nominal GDP ).  Under current law, the required deficit reductions 
would be, on average, 0.2 percent of GDP per year for a cumulative reduction  of 
2 percent.  Under current policy, the comparable reduction s would be, on average,  
0.4 percent of GDP per year , for a cumulativ e reduction  of 4 percent of GDP .  Holding all 
else equal, s uch reductions w ould be expected to restrain aggregate demand growth 
each year by magnitudes roughly equal to the deficit effects.  Assuming monetary 
policy is not constrained (for example, by the effective lower bound on the federal 
funds rate), it could crowd in  some of that lost demand .  However, such action would 
leave a smaller buffer available for the Fed to respond to a recession .

  ongoing trade tensions and global growth prospects.  In contrast, f arther -dated 
futures prices are unchanged, but the futures curve continues to indicate 
declining oil prices going forward.  
• Nonfuel commodities prices have fallen more than  10 percent in recent weeks . 
Notably, prices of soybeans are down 18 percent, corn prices are down 
13 percent, and copper prices are down 11 percent.  As with oil prices, nonfuel commodities prices are lower on  signs of slowing manufacturing 
growth in China and increasing  global trade tensions.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Real GDP in the second quarter appears  to ha ve increased at an annual rate of 
4¾ percent, an even larger rebound than we project ed in the June Tealbook.  That said, 
most of the revision was due to a jump in agricultural exports and a stronger- than-
expected increase in defense spending, both of which we expect to be unwound by the 
end of the year.2  Meanwhile, o ur second -quarter estimate of the contribution to GDP 
growth from  private domestic final purchases (PDFP) —the portion of GDP we think 
provides a better signal of the underlying pace of  aggregate demand —was  around 
3 percent age points, ¼ percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook.   
In light of the sources of revisions to second-quarter real GDP growth, and given 
that recent labor market data have been  broadly consistent with our expectations, our 
assessment of the overall cyclical position of the economy is little revised .  Accordingly, 
we continue to estimate that the level of output was  2 percent above its potential in the 
second quarter, and that  the output gap will move u p further over the next two quarters, 
ending the year at 2½ percent .  
• Recent  monthly spending data have confirmed  our expectation  that the first-
quarter weakness in PCE was transitor y, and our estimate of its  growth in the 
second quarter now stands at an annual rate of 3½ percent.  Retail sales 
registered  sizable  gains over the three months ending in June, and motor 
vehicle sales  stabilized after having fallen in the first quarter .  Given signs of 
                                                 
2 In principle , with the relevant soybean production estimates little revised since the June 
Tealbook, the positive effect on U.S. GDP growth from the surge in soybean  export s should be offset by a 
large drawdown of soybean inventories.  However, based on the experience of the third quarter of 2016, 
which also featured an extreme spike in soybean exports, we expect that the BEA may not report such a 
large inventory offset.

  momentum in the recent spending  data, along with our expectation that 
spending will continue to be supported by solid fundamentals and upbeat 
sentiment, we raised  our forecast for PCE growth in the second half of this 
year ¼ percentage point, to 2¾ percent.   
• After increasing  at a rapid  clip in the first quarter, business fixed investment 
appears to have moderated to a still- solid  pace of 6 percent in the second 
quarter.   Capital spending has likely continued to be supported by favorable 
financial conditions and the recent tax legislatio n.  Moreover, despite a 
number of anecdotal reports that firms are concerned about trade issues, readings on business sentiment and profit expectations have stayed upbeat.  We therefore still project that nonresidential private fixed investment will rise 
at an annual rate of around 6 percent in the second half of the year.  
• Activity in the housing sector appears to have ticked down again in the second 
quarter, likely reflecting the drag from  rising mortgage rates.   A variety of 
forward -looking indicators —including single -family construction permits, 
pending home sales, and the Michigan survey index of homebuying 
conditions—point to a further softening in housing activity in the second half 
of the year.  In all, residential investment is expected  to edge down about 
1¼ percent over  2018 as a whole.  
• In the government sector, an anomalously large increase in defense outlays in 
June pushed up our estimate of the growth in real government purchases in the 
second quarter.  These outlays are volatile, and thus we did not alter our 
projection for the level of defense purchases in coming quarters.  
Consequently, government purchases in the latter half of the year are 
projected to rise more slowly than in the first half of the year and by less  than 
we projected in the June Tealbook. 
• Net exports are estimated to have added about 1¼ percentage points to U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter.  This estimate is about 1 percentage point larger  than in the June Tealbook, as exports were much stronger and imports 
were weaker than expected.  Much of the strength in exports reflected a surge 
in soybean exports, which , on a seasonally adjusted basis, doubled in volume 
between April and  May.  Although China announced in early April potential 
tariffs on soybeans that we re implemented only in early July, the surge in

  exports was mostly to other countries.  Available weekly data suggest that 
soybean exports likely stepped down from May’s peak but remain elevated.  
We expect much of the recent strength in overall exports an d weakness in 
imports to be transitory ; as such, we project that net exports will subtract 
nearly ½  percentage point from U.S. GDP growth in the second half of 2018.   
• Manufacturing  production increased at a relatively modest annual rate of 
1¾ percent  in the first half of the year .  With automakers’ assembly plans 
calling for a sizable increase in the third quarter and readings on new orders 
from manufacturing surveys still elevated, we expect the pace of manufacturing output growth  to improve to 2¾ pe rcent  in the second half of 
the year. 
For the medium term, we  continue to project that real GDP growth will move 
down from about 3 percent this year  to 2½ percent in 2019 and  then to 1¾ percent in 
2020.  The gradual deceleration  reflects the ongoing tightening  of monetary policy and 
the emergence of some modest supply constraints.    
• The effects of changes in financial markets were largely offsetting  for the 
projection.  Upward surprises in equity and house prices, coupled with downward surprises in long- term interest rates, were mostly  counterbalanced 
by the appreciation of the dollar since the June Tealbook.  
• Real GDP growth is projected to outpace potential growth through 2019 and 
then to run essentially in line with potential in 2020 , resulting  in a further 
tightening of resource utilizatio n over the medium term.  At the end of 2020, 
real GDP exceed s its potential level by more than 3 percent —a touch more 
than in the June Tealbook.  
• With the federal government expected to run historically large and rising 
deficits over the medium term, national saving is  projected to trend downward 
as a share of GDP.  Nevertheless, private investment trends upward as a share of the economy, with the widening gap between domestic investment and 
national saving finance d by increased inflows of foreign capital.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The June employment report indicated that labor market conditions have 
continued to strengthen.  Payroll gains were a little higher than expected and remained 
well above the range we associate with unchanged resource utilization.  The l abor force 
participation rate (LFPR) and the unemployment rate were both higher than expected, but 
the employment- to-population ratio was in line with the June Tealbook.   
• According to the B LS, t otal nonfarm payrolls increased 213,000 in June and 
the estimated gains  for April and May were  revised up.3  After making a small 
upward adjustment to our payroll employment forecast in the near term , we 
now expect  total nonfarm payroll gains to average 200,000 per month in the 
second half of the year, a touch slower than the average monthly increases of 
215,000 in the first half of the year.  
• The unemployment rate moved up to 4 percent in June, whereas we had 
expected it to decline to 3.7 percent.  T he jump in the unemployment rate was 
due to an unusually large number of net  entrants into the labor force ; 
accordingly, the LFPR moved up 0.2 percentage point, to 62.9 percent.  Meanwhile, the employment -to-population ratio held steady in June at 
60.4 per cent, the same as our June Tealbook forecast.  In response , we nudg ed 
up our unemployment rate and LFPR  forecasts in the near term, leaving the  
projected updrift in the employment -to-population ratio unrevised.  
With our medium- term forecast for real activ ity little changed, the outlook for the 
labor market is similar to our June Tealbook projection.  We still expect the labor market 
to tighten further over the medium term, in line with above-trend GDP growth.  We also 
continue to assume that, in an extremely tight labor market, a larger -than-usual amount of 
the tightening in resource utilization will manifest in a higher LFPR and a smaller -than-
usual amount in a lower unemployment rate.   
• Average monthly total payroll gains slow gradually in the projection, from about 200,000 in the second half of this year to about 130,000 in 2020.   
                                                 
3 The staff’s alternative measure of private payroll changes  that combines  BLS information with 
data from the payroll processing firm ADP paints a s imilar picture of recent job g ains:  The three -month 
moving average of the staff estimate stood at 212,000 in June, compared with the average increase of 
205,000 in BLS estimates of private payrolls.

  • The unemployment rate is projected to move down to 3.4 percent by the 
middle of next year and to remain at that level  through 2020.   
• The LFPR  is expected  to remain flat through the end of the medium term, a 
pattern that implies a widening of the gap between this variable and its 
declining trend.  We expect t his gap will widen to nearly ¾  percentage point 
by the end of 2020. 
• The box “Alternative View:  Supply Constraints Will Prevent the 
Unemployment Rate from Falling Much Further” argues that constraints on 
aggregate supply will be more severe than assumed in the baseline, and therefore that the boost to aggregate demand from fiscal stimulus and other 
factors will have smaller effects on the unemployment rate.  
• We project that productivity will increase about 1 percent per year, on 
average, over the forecast period, a bit  below our estimate of its 
structural  pace. 
o The box “Innovation and Productivity Growth in the Manufacturing Sector” provides an analysis of factors contributing to the productivity slowdown in the manufacturing sector, which has been disproportionately important in influencing overall productivity trends. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
The incoming price data have been largely in line with our expectations.  W e 
estimate the 12-month change in core PCE prices to  have be en 1.9 percent in June; we 
continue to expect core inflation will maintain a similar pace through the end of the year.  
Total PCE prices are estimated to have increased 2.3  percent over the 12 months ending 
in June, slightly lower than in the previous Tealbook, as consumer energy prices were a 
little softer than expected.  Given  the projected path for energy prices, we forecast the 
12-month change in total PCE prices to move down to 1.9 percent in September and to 
remain there through year-end. 
• The May reading o n core PCE price inflation was close to  our expectations in 
the June Tealbook.  Upward revisions to the estimates for previous months were due to nonmarket price categories , from which we typically  draw little 
signal for the forecast.  The translation of t he June CPI release implied a

  modest downward revision to our estimate of core PCE goods prices.  
Monthly readings on core inflation through year- end are projected to be a 
touch lower than the average in the first six months , reflecting a projected  
declin e in import prices and the tendency for residual seasonality to push 
down measured price inflation  in the second half of the year.    
• Core import prices are estimated to have increased at a 2 percent pace in the 
first half of 2018, ¾ percentage point less than in the June Tealbook.  For the 
second half of 2018, core import prices are expected to fall at an annual rate of 
1 percent, reflecting  lower commodity prices and dollar appreciation.  In 
2019, i mport price inflation is expected to recover  to a still-modest  ½ percent 
pace, consistent with moderate foreign inflation and a gradually appreciating dollar.  
• PCE energy prices appear to have leveled off in the second quarter following sizable increases in the previous two quarters.  With oil prices having moved down since the June Tealbook, we reduced the projected rise in PCE energy prices  in the second half of the year, from a n annual  rate of 4½ percent in the 
previous projection to a rate of around 1 percent in the current projection.  In 
2019 and 2020, consum er energy prices are expected to decline modestly.  
• PCE food prices were about flat  in the first quarter , but we estimate that they 
increased at an annual rate of 1¼ percent  in the second quarter.  Since the 
June Tealbook, reductions in spot and futures prices for agricultural commodities have led us to revise down our forecast for PCE food prices in 
the second half.  That said, we expect food price inflation to move up to 
2 percent by the end of this year and to run at 2½ percent over the nex t 
two years . 
• In the preliminary July report from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years moved down to 2.4 percent, at the low end of the range of values for this series over the past year.   That said, a number of other recent readings on longer -term 
inflation expectations have held steady, and, on balance, the available information continues to suggest that these expectations remain reasonably 
stable.

 Alternative  View:  Supply  Constraints  Will Prevent the  
Unemployment  Rate from Falling Much Further  
Here we argue that  the staff projection  for the unemployment  rate  is too strong because the  
labor market is already tight and hence unlikely to improve much further.  With the  
unemployment  rate (4.0 percent) well below  our estimate  of its natural rate (4.7  percent),  the 
typical transmission  of an increase in  aggregate demand—including  that from the recent fiscal 
policy changes—no  longer applies.  In  particular, we  think that the boost to aggregate  demand 
from fiscal stimulus  and other factors will have  much  smaller effects  on the unemployment  rate 
than in the staff baseline  because of constraints  on aggregate supply. 
Supply constraints  are currently  most noticeable  in the labor  market.  Firms are increasingly  
reporting  that it is difficult  to find workers.   The number  of job openings  relative to the number of 
unemployed  persons is at an all‐ time high, and the fraction of small businesses  reporting  at least 
one hard‐to‐fill job opening is close to its all‐time high.  Anecdotal  information  on the difficulty  of 
finding workers appears  frequently  in the news and in the Beige Book.   
In search‐and‐matching  models of the labor market, aggregate output  is substantially  less 
responsive  to expansionary  shocks in a booming  economy  with a very  tight labor  market than in 
an economy  with average  macroeconomic  conditions.1  We demonstrate  the quantitative  effects 
of supply constraints  in a model similar  to one developed  in Gertler, Sala, and  Trigari (2008).2  In 
this model, the  scarcity of workers relative  to vacant  jobs in a tight economy  leads to increasingly  
higher wages and marginal  costs.  As  a consequence,  stark nonlinearities  in macroeconomic  
behavior take hold when the pool  of available unemployed  workers is close to being exhausted.

 In figure 1, we compare impulse responses  from a similar increase in  aggregate demand  in both a 
“normal”  economy  and a “tight”  economy.   The solid  blue lines show the responses  for a normal  
economy, such as  the first quarter of 2016 when the  unemployment  rate was  5 percent.  This 
increase in  demand lowers the unemployment  rate 30  basis points and raises the inflation rate 
25 basis points.  The dashed  lines show the responses  for a tight economy, such as  the first 
quarter of 2018 when the  unemployment  rate was  4.1 percent.   The unemployment  rate decrease  
in the tighter labor market is considerably  smaller while  the inflation response is  significantly  
larger.   
In the Tealbook  projection,  supply constraints  play a small role.   In the absence of  supply 
constraints,  the unemployment  rate would  bottom out at almost  1½ percentage points  below the 
staff estimate  of the natural rate.  Supply constraints  push up on the unemployment  rate by only 
0.1 percentage point.   We think that this adjustment  is too small and  should be, instead, around  
0.5 percentage point.   As figure 2 shows, an increase in  demand would lower the  unemployment  
rate 1 percentage  point, instead of 1½ percentage points,  when supply  constraints  are taken  into 
account.3  
Several papers are consistent  with our  view.  Auerbach and  Gorodnichenko (2012)  find that 
government  spending  multipliers  are much smaller in  booms than in recessions.4  Also, Baum, 
Poplawski ‐Ribeiro, and Weber (2012) find  that government  revenue multipliers  are smaller when 
the output gap is positive.5  In sum, we argue that  the staff  projection  has taken too  much signal  
from the fiscal stimulus and other impetuses  to aggregate  demand and has not accounted  
enough for the effects  of supply constraints.

imposes  no limits to the decline in the unemployment  rate.  The dashed line is the nonlinear  impulse  response  
function to the same shock, assuming  that the economy  is initially in a situation like it was in 2016:Q1.

Innovation and Productivity Growth in the Manufacturing Sector  
 
Labor productivity growth in the U.S. private business sector slowed substantially around 2004 
and again around 2010, shown by the red dots in figure 1 on the next page, with particularly sharp 
declines in the manufacturing sector, shown by the light blue bars.1  This slowdown is partly 
attributable to weaker contributions from capital services and labor quality , but another 
important contributor was slower total factor productivity (TFP) growth (dark blue bars), the 
gains in output produced from a given quantity of inputs.2  Although manufacturing makes up 
only 15 percent of private b
usiness value added, it was responsible for over half of the slowdown 
in TFP growth in the overall business sector .  Because of this outsized importance, as well as the 
advantages from greater data availability, this discussion analyzes the sources of the TFP 
slowdown in the manufacturing sector.  It is instructive to think of gains in TFP as arising in three 
steps:  innovation, adoption, and reallocation.    
1. Innovation.   In the first step, businesses engage in research and development (R&D) to 
expand the technical front
ier.  Measured as a fraction of output, R&D by U.S. 
manufacturing firms has actually been somewhat higher during the productivity 
slowdown than before it (table 1, row 1 on the next page) .  Nevertheless, the issuance of 
manufacturing patents to U.S. entities —an indicator of R&D output —slowed in the years 
2004 to 20 09 (row
 2).3  In light of o ft-cited delays between patent issuances and 
technological adoption, the decline in patent issuance from 2004 to 2009 suggests that a 
decline in innovation could provide one explanation for the more recent decline in TFP.  
Patent issuance accelerated more recently, which , if sustained, may bode well for future 
productivity gains. 
2. Adoption.   In the second step, firms adopt innovations that enhance productivity and 
expand the production fro
ntier.   These adopted innovations include new product designs 
that raise product perfor
mance and process improvements that drive down production 
costs.  Although tracking the general rate of improvement in products and processes is 
                                                           
1 In this discussion, we take the productivity data at face value.  Although mismeasurement of productivity is 
a concern, research generally supports the broad conclusion that actual productivity growth has slowed.   Another 
concern is that the timing of the slowdown in TFP growth may be affected by cyclical changes in factor utilization 
(both hours per employee and the workweek of capital), which dropped during the Great Recession and 
rebounded afterward.  Removing this cyclical effect would raise productivity growth from 2004 to 2009 and 
temper growth from 2010 to 2016.  Consequently, the slowdown from 2004 to 2009 is likely to be overstated  and 
the further slowdown after 2010 to be understated.   See Susanto Basu, John Fernald, and Miles Kimball (2006), 
“Are Technology Improvements Contractionary?” American Economic Review , vol. 96 (December), pp. 1418 –48. 
2 Given its common interpretation as a measure of the stock of applied knowledge, outright declines in TFP 
such as those for manufacturing from 2010 to 2016 are often difficult to rationalize.  Most explanations point to 
mismeasurement of prices, output, utilization of inputs, or profit margins.  In addition, a change in the mix of 
industrial activities within manufacturing could increase the value-added share of low-TFP plants, lowering 
average TFP. 
3 For other research citing a slowdown in innovation, see Nicholas Bloom, Charles I. Jones, John Van Reenen, 
and Michael Webb (2017), “Are Ideas Getting Harder to Find?” NBER Working Paper Series 23782 (Cambridge,

 difficult, indicators of improvement for two portions of the manufacturing sector 
softened from 2010 to 2016.  Gains in computational speed for leading-edge computing 
equipment —a barometer for electronics manufacturing more broadly —have slowed 
markedly (row 3).  In addition, output per unit of energy input for key energy-intensive 
manufacturing industries stalled from 2010 to 2016 (row 4 ).4   
3. Reallocation.   In th
e final step , labor and capital are reallocated both within and across 
firms toward the expanded production frontier.   Differences in output per worker across 
firms tend to be narrow when innovations diffuse rapidly and outmoded production 
processes are eliminated.  Yet recent evidence from Census microdata shows that 
dispersion of productivity across manufacturing firms has risen in the United States , 
suggesting that innovations may be spreading more slowly and that less-efficient 
producers are not being winnowed as quickly as previously (row 5).5   
All told, softening manufact
uring productivity growth since 2003 appears to reflect weaker 
innovation, slower adoption, and less robust reallocation of resources.  Because TFP-driven 
improvements to manufactured equipment and materials spur capital deepening that raises 
productivity throughout the economy, the importance of productivity growth in manufacturing is 
much greater than the sector’s small size would indicate.  Looking ahead, a recent increase in 
manufacturing patents may herald a TFP pickup in the future .   If a rebound in manufacturing TFP 
were to occur, it would lend credence to our projection of a modest pickup in overall business-
sector productivity.

  Our medium- term outlook for total and core PCE price inflation is little revised.  
We still project that core inflation will move up  to 2 percent in 2019 and 2.1 percent in 
2020, reflecting an upward drift in trend inflation and the upward pressure on prices from 
elevated rates of resource utilization .  Total PCE price inflation is projected to run 
slightly below core inflation after this year, reflecting the declining path for consumer energy prices in the medium term.  As before, these projections are predicated on our 
assumption that the emergence of some modest supply constraints will result in slightly 
higher inflation than would otherwise be the case.   
We continue to forecast that strong labor market  conditions will bring about a 
further step -up in the growth of compensation per hour, from 3 percent this year to a 
4 percent pace in 2019 and 2020.  Given its relatively muted cyclical properties, the ECI 
is projected to accelerate less  than the compensation per hour measure in the 
medium term.   
• In line with  our expectation in the June Tealbook, average hourly earnings of 
all employees  increased  2¾ percent over the 12 months ending in June, up 
from the 2 percent rates of increase seen a few years ago . 
• The June reading from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 3. 2 percent, below its recent highs but well above the pace 
observed a few years ago.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be 4.7 percent and that potential output growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the longer run.  
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½  percent.  The nominal yield on 
10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent  in the longer run.  
Thus, after the SOMA portfolio has returned to its normal size and composition, the term premium is assumed to be 90 basis points , lifted by the 
elevated level of federal debt assumed over the longer run.  
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will  continue to 
put downward pressure on longer- term interest rates, though to a diminishing

  extent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is projected to have returned to a 
normal size by mid -2021.  
• With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows further to 1½ percent in 2021 
and to slightly above 1 percent in 2022 and 2023, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level and the support from fiscal policy wanes.  The unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3½ percent in 2020 toward its assumed natural rate in s ubsequent years , and the supply constraints assumed 
in the medium- term projection diminish .  
• PCE price inflation is 2.1 percent in 2022 and 2023 before edging back down 
to the Committee’s long -run objective in later years. 
• With output materially above its potential level and inflation slightly above the Committee’s 2  percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate rises to 
about 5 percent at the end of 2021—2½ percentage points higher than its assumed long- run value.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate moves gradually 
back toward its long- run value.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
The pace of economic expansion abroad appears to have moderated  in the second 
quarter, but it remains solid.  As we had expected, growth in t he emerging market 
economies (EMEs) slowed from an unusually strong start of the year, and growth in the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rebounded from a temporary di p in the first quarter.  
With the slowdown in the EMEs more than offsetting the rebound in the AFEs, we 
estimate that total foreign gr owth slowed to 2½ percent at an a nnual rate in the second 
quarter from a robust 3¼ percent pace in the first.  This moder ation is a bit more 
pronounced than projected in the J une Tealbook, as weaker-than- expected data led to 
downward revisions in Brazil, the euro area, and Mexico, which more than offset upward 
revisions in some emerging Asian economies.   
Although we have repeatedly marked down the current year’s forecast in recent 
Tealbooks, the revisions have been fairly small and our outlook  remains cautiously 
upbeat.  Accommodative monetary po licy in the AFEs, relatively strong performance of 
the Chinese economy despite som e moderation, and robust U.S. de mand should continue 
to support the expansion of the f oreign economies.  Some of the  recent data––such as a 
pickup of Asian exports and still-e levated levels of PMIs in th e AFEs––buttress our 
conviction around the forecast.  In addition, as discussed in the box “Yield Curve 
Inversions and Economic Recessions Abroad,” we take little sign al from the flattening of 
yield curves in several major A FEs.  All told, we expect growth abroad to edge up to 
2¾ percent, near its potential pace, in the second half of this  year and to stay there 
through 2020.   
Our baseline outlook calls for s olid foreign growth in the year s ahead, but 
downside risks remain prominent .  First, heightened market focu s on existing EME 
vulnerabilities amid rising global interest rates and mounting concerns about trade policy 
could lead to a sharp deteriorat ion of financial conditions and  economic activity in many 
emerging economies.  Second, as high lighted in July’s QS (quant itative surveillance) 
assessment of financial stability, adverse developments in Chin a could—given the 
economy’s financial vulnerabilitie s—snowball into a substantial slowdown in Chinese 
growth and have sizable internati onal spillovers.  We explore such a possibility in the 
“Financial Stress in China” alternative scenario in the Risks a nd Uncertainty section.  
Third, ongoing trade tensions could lead to much more widespread and sustained

 Yield Curve Inversions  and Economic  Recessions  Abroad 
As in the United States, long ‐term spreads have been trending  down in several major advanced  
foreign economies  (AFEs).  Indeed, long ‐term spreads in Canada and the United Kingdom, in  a 
range of 20 to 50 basis  points, are similar to those in  the United States (figure 1).  The box  “Don’t 
Fear the Long‐Term Spread” in the Financial  Market Developments  section of  the June 2018 
Tealbook  investigated  how well near ‐ and long‐term spreads predicted  recessions  in the United 
States.  Are  yield curve inversions  as consistent  a predictor of  recessions  in AFEs as they are in the 
United States?  The  evidence  is mixed. 
On the one hand, the evidence  for AFEs in general is less convincing,  especially  in recent decades.   
The AFEs have had  many episodes  of inverted  yield curves over the  past six decades  (table 1).  But 
the association  between inversion  episodes  (defined  as negative  spreads between 10‐ year and 
3‐month rates lasting  at least six months)  and economic  recessions  is much weaker for AFEs  than 
for the United  States.1  While all U.S.  inversion  episodes  except one were followed  by a recession,  
most AFE episodes  were not.  Moreover,  the association  of inversions  and recessions  for AFEs, 
unlike for the  United States, has  weakened  in recent decades.   In the AFEs, recessions  followed  
about one‐half of the inversion  episodes  before 1990  but only one‐fifth of episodes  since.

   Note:  The long‐term spread is a spread of 10‐year 
over  2‐year yields.  Final values are for July 10, 2018.  
Vertical lines roughly indicate recession  starts.

1 In earlier decades, inflation expectations  in most AFEs were poorly anchored,  and attempts  by foreign 
central banks  to subdue inflation often resulted in recession.   By contrast,  in recent decades,  inflation 
expectations  have been much better anchored,  obviating  drastic  monetary  policy tightenings.

 On the other hand, while the evidence  for AFEs as a group is limited, the relationship  between 
inversion  episodes  and recessions  is stronger  for some  major AFEs.  The left‐hand side of table 2 
reports results of regressions  of the probability  of transitioning  into a recession  over the next 
12 months conditional  on a 12‐month lag of a long‐term spread (a spread of 10‐year over 2‐ year 
yields).  For the AFEs in total, long‐term spreads are very weak predictors  of recession,  especially  
in recent decades,  but the  results for Canada,  Germany, and  the United Kingdom  show a 
statistical  relationship  slightly weaker than  that for the United States.  The right ‐hand side looks 
at the same  analysis for a 2 ‐year spread  (a spread of 2‐year over 3‐ month yields).  (Note that 
because of  data limitations,  we cannot look at the same  near‐term spreads as in the June

Although  the predictive  power of  inversions  is stronger  in major AFEs than for AFEs more 
generally,  based on our 1980–2018  estimates,  the probability  of recession  in the three AFEs  
implied by long‐term spreads has risen but remains  very low  (figure 2).  Moreover,  with monetary  
policy likely to remain accommodative  for longer  in these economies  than in the United  States, 
the likelihood  of an inversion  is lower.

  increases in trade barriers th an in our baseline, which incorpo rates only measures already 
implemented.  The consequences of t his possibility are discussed in the “Higher Trade 
Barriers” alternative scenario. 
Recent data on foreign inflation have generally been lower than  expected, and 
inflation pressures in many for eign economies have remained rel atively subdued.  Of 
note, second-quarter core inflation ticked down to 1.2 percent in the euro area and 
declined to negative  0.9 percent in Japan.  With inflation expe cted to remain well below 
target over the next few years, t he European Central Bank (ECB)  and the Bank of Japan 
(BOJ) are assumed to maintain a highly accommodative monetary s tance, with the first 
policy rate hikes coming onl y in the fourth quarter of 2019 for  the ECB and late 2020 for 
the BOJ.  By contrast, with infla tion above targe t in their eco nomies, the Bank of Canada 
(BOC) raised its policy rate in July and the Bank of England (BOE) is expected to follow 
suit in August.  Even so, future  policy tightenings by these tw o central banks are 
expected to be relatively gra dual, especially for the BOE. 
Several EME central banks––inclu ding those of India, Indonesia, Mexico, and the 
Philippines––recently increased their policy rates in response to rising inflationary 
pressures, capital outflows, a nd currency depreciation.  We expect more EME central 
banks to tighten monetary policy;  in some cases––such as the Ba nk of Korea––this 
tightening is to normalize still-accommodative stances.  By con trast, the People’s Bank of 
China (PBOC) eased its policy s tance amid some slowdown in dome stic demand, and we 
assume further eas ing before year-end.   
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Canada.  Recent indicators, such as monthly GDP for April and manufact uring PMI 
through June, suggest that real  GDP growth rebounded to 2½ percent in the second 
quarter from 1.3 percent in the  first.  With underlying momentu m relatively strong, 
we expect growth to average  2¼ percent thr ough early 2019 before edging down to 
1¾ percent (our estimate of  potential growth) in 2020. 
Despite a substantial rise in gasoline prices, inflation slowed  to 1 percent in the 
second quarter from 3.6 percent in the first, mainly reflecting  falling prices in a few 
core components, such as tele phone services and computers.  Ami d reports of rising 
input costs and solid wage grow th, we expect inflation to bounc e back to 2¾ percent 
this quarter before slowi ng to 2 percent by mid-2019.  Citing i ts solid outlook for both

  economic growth and inflation, the  BOC raised its policy rate 2 5 basis points to 
1.5 percent on July 11.  As resource utilization continues to i ncrease, the BOC is 
expected to raise its policy r ate further, to 3 percent by mid-2020. 
 Japan.  Following a weather-related 0.6 pe rcent contrac tion in the fi rst quarter, recent 
indicators—such as PMIs, machin ery orders, and real private con sumption—suggest 
a rebound in real GDP growth t o 1½ percent in the second quarter.  Growth should 
edge down to 1 percent in the s econd half of 2018, supported by continued highly 
accommodative monetary policy.  After that, growth should settl e near its potential 
rate of ¾ percent except for large swings in the second half of  2019 induced by the 
consumption tax hike planned f or October of that year. 
Inflation plummeted from 2.5 percen t in the first quarter to negative 2.3 percent in the 
second, as food prices retraced the ir previous weather-related gains and core 
consumer prices fell following an appreciation of the yen earli er this year.  As these 
factors wane, inflation should turn positive in the second half  of 2018 and settle near 
1 percent though 2020, as persistently tight resource utilizati on eventually pushes up 
inflation expectations.  With inflation remaining well below ta rget, we expect the 
BOJ to maintain a highly accommodative stance, keeping the depo sit rate at negative 
0.1 percent throughout the forecast period and raising the 10-y ear yield target above 
zero only late in 2020.   
 United Kingdom.  We estimate that real GDP gr owth picked up to 1½ percent (its  
potential pace) in the second quarter after a lackluster 0.9 pe rcent rate in the first.  
The pickup in growth was mainl y due to a rebound in constructio n and retail sales, 
two categories that were affect ed by cold weather at the start of the year.  Going 
forward, growth should edge up further to 1¾ percent.  This out look is conditional on 
the assumption that the United Kingdom will reach a “soft” Brex it agreement with the 
European Union (EU).  This scenar io appears more likely after the recent proposal of 
the U.K. government to set up a f ree trade area and to continue  harmonization with 
EU regulations for goods.  However , risks of a “harder” Brexit remain.  The new 
proposal led to fierce political debate within the U.K. parliam ent, and many elements 
in the U.K. proposal, especially t he U.K. solution to the Irish  border problem, do not 
meet key EU demands.  
Inflation fell from 2.5 percent in the first quarter to 1.8 per cent in the second, 
½ percentage point lower than for ecast in the June Tealbook, as  a result of lower

  retail energy prices and unexpect ed sharp declines of certain c ore prices.  As these 
temporary factors abate, we proj ect inflation to bounce back la ter this year before 
falling to the BOE’s 2 percen t target by t he end of 2020.  In l ine with the pickup in 
economic activity and recent BOE communication, we expect the B OE to increase 
the Bank Rate from 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent at its August me eting.  Thereafter, our 
projected policy path envisages g radual rate hikes to 1.5 perce nt by the end of the 
forecast period.  Given that the BOE announced in its June poli cy statement that it 
“intends not to reduce the stock of purchased assets until Bank  Rate reaches around 
1.5 percent,” we continue to assume that the BOE will not begin  reducing the size of 
its balance sheet until after 2020.   
 Euro area.  In contrast to the other AFEs, i ncoming data for the euro are a, such as 
industrial production through May, s uggest that the region’s slowdown in the first 
quarter was not transitory.  Accordingly, we estimate that GDP growth will remain 
around 1½ percent in the second quarter, ½ percentage point low er than projected in 
June.  Growth should remain near 1½ percent through 2020, as ac commodative 
monetary policy roughly offsets the drag from the projected fin ancial turmoil 
emanating out of Italy.  Admittedly, market sentiment toward It aly has improved a 
bit, in part after the country’ s finance mini ster vowed to not widen, at least in the near 
term, the budget deficit.  But we continue to believe that tens ions with euro-area 
partners and institutions will eventually escalate. 
A surge in retail energy prices boosted headline inflation to 2 .2 percent in the second 
quarter, just as expected in the  June Tealbook, even as core in flation inched down to 
1.2 percent.  We expect headline inflation to decline to 1½ percent later this year, as 
energy prices stabilize, and to slo wly edge up thereafter, as resource slack is 
gradually eliminated.  In line wit h recent communications, we c ontinue to assume that 
the ECB will cease net asset  purchases by year-end.  We also ex pect the ECB to 
increase its deposit rate from negative 0.4 percent to negative 0.25 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2019 and to 0 percent by mid-2020.  However, with inflation 
projected to rise only to 1¾ pe rcent by end-2020, the ECB could  end up pursuing a 
more accommodative monetary policy. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 China.  Real GDP growth slowed to a st ill-solid 6.6 percent in the second quarter 
from 7.2 percent in the first, j ust a touch lower than our June Tealbook forecast.

  Although export growth remained robust, the drag on domestic demand from tighter 
credit conditions intensified.  I nfrastructure investment and r etail sales slowed 
sharply, and the housing market s howed signs of cooling.  In an  indication that 
authorities are concerned about  the growth outlook, the PBOC an nounced a cut to the 
reserve requirement ratio for  most banks by 50 basis points in June, which follows an 
earlier cut in April.  Despite t hese moves, we expect credit co nditions to remain 
relatively tight in the near ter m, and we see growth falling further to 6¼ percent in the 
second half of the year.  Thereafter, we expect growth to edge down to 6 percent by 2020, in line with its potential pace.   
We estimate that the 25 per cent tariff on $34 billion of U.S. i mports from China, 
which went into effect in Jul y, will have only a negligible eff ect on Chinese growth.  
However, our baseline does not inc lude the more widespread tari ff hikes that have 
been recently proposed on Chine se goods and, if enacted, would exert a more 
material drag on economic activity.  
 Other Emerging Asia.  We estimate that real GDP grow th in the region moderated to 
3¾ percent in the second quarter, do wn from 5½ percent in the first.  The step-down 
reflects some payback from  unusually strong growth in Hong Kong  and Thailand in 
the first quarter.  Nevertheless, recent indicators of producti on and exports, on the 
whole, expanded at a faster pace th an anticipated, and we revised up growth in the 
second quarter almost ½ percentage  point since the June Tealboo k.  We expect 
growth to hover around 3¾ percent over the forecast period.   
 Mexico.  We penciled in real GDP growth of 2½ percent for the second quarter, a 
sharp deceleration from the outsized 4.6 percent pace in the fi rst quarter.  Data 
through May suggest that, in the second quarter, exports weaken ed and construction 
activity dropped sharply, the la tter likely reflecting the end of reconstruction efforts 
that followed last year’s eart hquake.  Relative to the June Tealbook, we marked down 
second-quarter growth, as the payb ack from the first-quarter su rge has been bigger 
than anticipated and export data have disappointed.  We continu e to expect growth to 
pick up to 3 percent by earl y 2019, boosted by past currency depreciation and 
diminishing fiscal drag.  The el ection to the presidency of And rés Manuel López 
Obrador (known as AMLO) on J uly 1 did not alter our outlook, as the electoral 
outcome was widely expected.  In addition, AMLO and his cabinet appointees 
promised to maintain fiscal disc ipline and respect the autonomy  of the central bank,

  although the possibility remains that the new administration co uld backtrack on these 
promises and reverse past reforms.      
After falling sharply in the beginning of the year, 12-month he adline inflation has 
hovered around 4½ percent in recent months, pressured most rece ntly by hikes in 
administered fuel prices.  We e xpect these pressures to wane and inflation to decline 
toward the 3 percent target.  The Bank of Mex ico raised its policy rate 25 basis points 
to 7.75 percent, citing concerns abo ut inflationary pressures f rom past peso 
depreciation and tight labor markets. 
 Brazil.   The May national truckers’ st rike paralyzed economic activity , throwing yet 
another wrench into the country ’s painfully slow recovery from its deepest recession 
on record.  Of note, industrial pr oduction plunged more than 10  percent in May.  
Although preliminary data for June  suggest that activity is rec overing, we see real 
GDP contracting 1½ percent in the second quarter, 3 percentage points below the 
June Tealbook forecast, before bouncing back in the third.  The reafter, we expect a 
slow recovery as policymakers st ruggle to address the country’s  serious fiscal 
imbalances and other economic problems. 
Inflation jumped in June, booste d by soaring food prices during  the truckers’ strike.  
As a result, we expect quarter ly inflation to reach 5½ percent in the third quarter.  As 
this temporary boost wanes, inf lation should decline to 4¼ perc ent amid considerable 
resource slack.  In late June, the  authorities announced their intention to lower 
inflation to 3.75 percent by 2021 f rom a target of 4.5 percent for this year.  
 Argentina.  In June, the government reached an agreement with the Interna tional 
Monetary Fund for a 36-month Stand-By Arrangement, which will p rovide up to 
$50 billion in financing.  Under the agreement, Argentina will pursue aggressive 
fiscal consolidation and grant more autonomy to the central ban k.  We expect 
economic activity to be very wea k, with real GDP contracting 1¼ percent in 2018.  
Thereafter, the pace of economic activity should pick up in lin e with the projected 
improvement in financial conditi ons, but Argentina’s macroecono mic adjustment 
process could be far more prolonged and costly.  
 Turkey.  President Erdogan won general elec tions in late June, consolida ting his 
power and clearing the way for a m ore autocratic rule.  Erdogan  also gained the 
power to appoint the governor a nd other key officials of the country’s central bank,

  raising concerns over the independence of the institution.  Ind eed, Erdogan’s recent 
call for a policy rate cut was followed by sharp falls in equit y prices and the value of 
the lira as well as by increases  in bond yields.  Investors hav e also focused on 
Turkey’s struggles to fund its current account deficit and its maturing foreign 
currency debt.

 Financial Market Developments 
Concerns regarding internati onal trade policy weighed on market sentiment over 
the intermeeting period, prompti ng notable declines in some for eign equity markets but 
leaving only a modest imprint on domestic asset prices on net.  Meanwhile, FOMC 
communications were viewed by market participants  as slightly less accommodative than 
had been expected, and domestic economic data releases were see n as mixed.  On 
balance, market-based measures of  the expected path of the fede ral funds rate through the 
end of 2019 were little changed, and expectations only edged do wn at more distant 
horizons.  Yields on medium- and long-term nominal Treasury sec urities also declined a 
bit.  The broad dollar index moved up.  
 The following are according to market quotes: 
o An increase in the t arget range for the f ederal funds rate is n ot expected at 
the August FOMC meeting.   
o The next likely incr ease is at the Septem ber meeting, with a pr obability of 
close to 80 percent. 
o Based on a straight read of mark et quotes, either one or two 25  basis point 
increases in the target range are expected between now and the end of the 
year; however, adjusting for estimated term premiums using a st aff model 
suggests that expectations are m ore firmly centered on two incr eases.  
 Yields on 2-year nominal Treasur y securities increased 4 basis points, while 
5- and 10-year yields declined 7 ba sis points and 12 basis points, respectively.  
Real yields decreased in line wi th their nominal counterparts, leaving market-
based measures of inflation com pensation little changed.  
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes and option-implied equity marke t volatility as 
measured by the VIX were about unchanged on net.   
 Driven in part by trade policy deve lopments, the broad dollar i ndex increased 
1.5 percent during the intermee ting period.  Most notably, the Chinese 
renminbi depreciated almost 6 percent against the dollar as weak Chinese 
economic data along with trade  policy concerns weighed on the c urrency.  
AFE equity indexes generally dec lined modestly, while EME equit y indexes 
are notably lower, led by decrease s in Chinese and other Asian equity 
markets.

  DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Although the reactions of asset pr ices to FOMC communications during the 
period were generally modest, marke t participants reportedly in terpreted the June FOMC 
statement and SEP as somewhat less accommodative than had been expected.  In arriving 
at this interpretation, market pa rticipants pointed to the removal of the passages in the 
statement that “market-based m easures of inflation compensation  remain low” and that 
the Committee “will carefully monitor actual and expected infla tion developments 
relative to its symmetric infla tion goal,” as well as to the removal of the guidance that the 
federal funds rate would remai n below its longer-run level “for  some time.”  The upward 
revisions to the Committee’s median projections for the federal  funds rate at the end of 
2018 and 2019 were also interpreted by some observers as indica ting less accommodation 
going forward than had been previously expected.  Market partic ipants reportedly 
interpreted the Monetary Policy Report  and the Chairman’s testimony as generally in line 
with recent FOMC comm unications; asset pri ces were little chang ed following the 
release of the testimony and thr oughout the Q&A sessions.  Late  in the period, Treasury 
yields moved a little lower follo wing comments by President Tru mp expressing concerns 
about the firming in the stan ce of monetary po licy over recent months. 
Macroeconomic developments led to slight downward pressure on m easures of 
monetary policy expectations a nd Treasury yields, on balance, d uring the intermeeting 
period.  Concerns about the effect s of trade tensions on macroeconomic activity appeared 
to push rates down at times.  Interest rates also f ell slightly , on net, in response to 
domestic economic data release s over the inte rmeeting period.    
A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts im plies that market 
participants place very littl e probability on a 25 basis point rate increase at the August 
meeting and put the probability tha t the next rate hike will oc cur in September at around 
80 percent.  The path of the fed eral funds rate implied by OIS contracts and unadjusted 
for term premiums suggests that  investors expect about 35 basis  points of further 
tightening between now and the end of this year.  A staff model  that adjusts for term 
premiums implies that two furth er 25 basis point increases are expected over the same 
period.  Both the adjusted and unadj usted expected paths of the  federal funds rate beyond 
the end of 2019 edged down, on net, over the intermeeting perio d.  
The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened slightly, on net, si nce the June FOMC 
meeting, with 2-year yields in creasing 4 basis points and 10-ye ar yields decreasing

  12 basis points.  Staff term structure models attributed about three-fourths of the declines 
in longer-term Treasury yields t o lower term premiums, with the  remainder 
corresponding to a lower expecte d path for short-term interest rates.  TIPS yields declined 
in line with their nominal count erparts, so TIPS-based measures of inflation 
compensation were little changed on net.       
With the most recent flatteni ng of the yield curve, the spread between the 10- and 
2-year Treasury yields—a much di scussed leading indicator of re cessions—now stands 
near the 25th percentile of its distribution since 1971.  In co ntrast, the near-term forward 
spread, an alternative measure introduced in a recent Tealbook box, was little changed 
over the intermeeting period and sta nds near the 40th percentil e of its distribution since 
1971.1   
Regarding the prices of corporate assets, concerns about intern ational trade 
disputes led to a slight decline in sentiment toward some domes tic risky assets early in 
the period but had a limited marke twide effect, on net, since t he June FOMC meeting.  
While broad U.S. equity price inde xes were little changed, stock prices in the sectors that 
are more sensitive to international trade, such as autos and industrials, decreased 
moderately.  In contrast, stock prices for sectors that benefit  from a decline in interest 
rates, such as utilities, ros e some.  Option-implied volatility  on the S&P 500 index at the 
one-month horizon (the VIX) was  little changed, on net, and rem ained only a bit above 
the very low levels that prevailed before early February.  
Over the intermeeting period, spr eads between yields of nonfinancial corporate 
bonds and those of comparable-matur ity Treasury securities were  little changed, on net, 
for investment-grade firms and i ncreased moderately for specula tive-grade firms.  These 
spreads remained low compared w ith their historical distributions.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
The continued escalation of trade tensions and, to a lesser extent, incoming 
foreign macroeconomic data that surprised to the downside weighed on investor 
                                                 
1 The near-term forward spread is defined as the five-quarter-ahead forward rate for the 90-day 
Treasury bill minus the one-quart er-ahead forward rate.  For an alysis of the informa tion content of the 
long-term yield spread and the n ear-term forward spreads for the probability of recessions, see the box 
“Don’t Fear the Long-Term Spread” in Tealbook A for June 2018.

  sentiment during the interm eeting period.  Foreign equity index es and long-term 
sovereign yields generally declin ed, while the broad dollar ind ex moved up.  
Broad equity price indexes in a dvanced foreign economies (AFEs)  were down 
modestly, while emerging market  economy (EME) equity prices wer e lower by about 
5¼  percent, led largely by an almost 10 percent decline in Chinese equity prices.  
Additionally, outflows from EME-f ocused mutual funds accelerate d in June, posting a 
second monthly decline following a  year of strong inflows.  How ever, there are some 
indications that the upswing in E ME financial stresses observed  in recent months may be 
stabilizing:  The pace of outfl ows has slowed so far in July, a nd EME sovereign bond 
spreads narrowed slightl y in the intermeeting period.  
The dollar appreciated broadly a gainst AFE and EME currencies, with the notable 
exception of the Mexican peso.  Trade developments were associa ted with an unusually 
sharp depreciation of the Chinese  renminbi, which declined almo st 6 percent against the 
dollar, the largest intermeeting move in decades.  Weak data in  Europe, dovish 
communications by the European C entral Bank (ECB), and continued uncertainty over 
Brexit weighed on European curre ncies.  Conversely, the electio ns in Mexico marked the 
passage of a risk event, and subsequent remarks by the president-elect seemed to ease 
concerns around fiscal discipline  and central bank independence in Mexico; these 
developments contributed to an 8 percent appreciation of the Mexican peso against the 
dollar.  Late in the period, comments by President Trump expres sing concerns about the 
firming in the stance of monetar y policy led the dollar to weak en slightly.  
AFE bond yields declined noticeably over the period.  In June, the ECB 
announced its intention to wind down its asset purchase program  by the end of the year, 
consistent with market expecta tions.  However, the ECB also ind icated that policy rates 
would remain unchanged through at least the summer of 2019.  Th is guidance was 
viewed as more accommodative than expected and led to a moderat e decline in the 
market-based policy path and Germa n sovereign yields.  The Bank of England held its 
policy rate steady, but interes t rates declined amid ongoing Brexit-related concerns and 
lower-than-expected inflation data.

  typical levels.  After the June F OMC meeting, the effective fed eral funds rate rose 
20 basis points, in line with the increase in the interest on e xcess reserves (IOER) rate, 
and traded well within the targe t range throughout the period.  (For a discussion of the 
mid-June movements, see the FOMC memo “Developments in the Fede ral Funds Market 
Following the Technical Adjustment to IOER.”)    
Because elevated rates on other short-term investments offered an attractive 
alternative for market particip ants, take-up at the Federal Res erve’s ON RRP facility 
remained low, averaging about $6 billion per day excluding quarter-end.2       
On the June quarter-end, rates and volumes in overnight fed fun ds and Eurodollar 
markets were little changed, sim ilar to the March quarter-end, while changes in rates and 
volumes in repo markets were more pronounced.  In particular, r epo rates rose noticeably 
and ON RRP take-up increased sharply, albeit to levels far belo w those seen before 2018. 
These effects retraced within a few days, as is typical.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Accommodative credit supply conditions coupled with optimism about the 
economic outlook—particularly in the business sector—spurred strong funding flows for 
businesses and more moderate flows for households in the second quarter despite rising 
financing costs.   Consistent with the upbeat outlook in the business sector, M&A activity 
has been elevated in recent months.  Meanwhile, the re patriation of cash  held at foreign 
subsidiaries in the aftermath of  recent tax reforms led completed  corporate share 
repurchases to reach a record high in the first quarter, with announced repurchases in the 
second quarter forecasting a potential new high.  Recent increases in trade tensions 
appear to have left little to no imprint to date on indicators of financing conditions. 
• Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans, a s well as  bank s’ 
extensions of C&I loans, remained strong in the second qua rter amid rising 
interest rate spreads.   Much of the new debt financing was reportedly 
earmarked for M&A activity.   Responses to the July 2018 SLOOS indicated a 
net easing  of standards on C&I loans by banks. 
• Small business lending activity  has picked up in recent months.  High levels 
of optimism among small business owners suggest  a co ntinued strengthening 
of credit demand.  
• Mortgage credit has remained widely available to most borrowers.  F or 
borrowers with low credit scores, lending conditions have continued to ease in recent months, although conditions remained relatively tight overall .  Growth 
of home-purchase mortgages has slowed and refinancing activity has 
remain ed quite light, reflecting the rise in mortgage rates and , for purchase 
loans, a limited supply of houses for sale.  
• Consumer credit  activity  picked up in May after expanding at a more 
moderate rate earlier in the year, with surveys suggesting that households 
think that financing conditions overall will remain  favorable for spending on 
durable goods.  Respondents to the July SLOOS indicated  that banks had 
recently eased lending standards for auto loans but continued to tighten them 
for credit card accounts, particularly for subprime borrowers.

  BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations remained favorable over the 
intermeeting period.  Despite increases in spreads  on corporate bonds and institutional 
leveraged loans , gross issuance across both sectors picked up in May and remained strong 
in June, with t he rise in  corporate bond issuance concentrated i n the investment- grade 
segment of the market .  Similarly, growth of C&I loans held by banks was strong on 
average.  Market participants in all three sectors reported  that a la rge portion of the 
proceeds was  used to  finance M&A activity, with several large deals completed recently . 
Responses to the July 2018 SLOOS indicated that , on net, banks had eased  
standards and terms on C&I loans in the second quarter, with many citing  increased 
competition from other lenders and increased ease of transacting  in the secondary market  
for these loans as reasons for doing so.  The current level of  banks’ standards on large 
C&I loans was reported to be easier than  the midpoint of the range of standards that 
prevailed between 2005 and the present, with nearly 20 percent of banks on a weighted 
basis  reporting that standards for syndicated non-investment- grade loans are the easiest 
that they have been since 2005.  Bor rower d emand for  C&I loan s in the second quarter 
was reportedly  little changed on balance; however, of the banks in the July survey 
reporting  stronger demand , financing needs for M&A activity  was one of the most cited 
factor s behind the increase . 
The volum es of equity issuance through initial public and seasoned offerings were 
both robust in June and higher than their paces over the past few months.  Meanwhile, 
completed stock repurchases in the first quarter totaled their highest dollar value on record.  Announced stock repurchases were also robust in the first quarter and hit a record high in the second quarter.  As described in the box “U.S. Corporations’ Repatriation of Offshore Profits,”  this increase in share repurchases was partly driven by firms 
responding to  last year’s changes to the tax  law by repatriating  cash  held at foreign 
subsidiaries. 
Although some signs of deterioration emerged over the intermeeting period , the 
credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid overall.  The six -month trailing 
default rate increased in June to its highest point over the past two years, and  the volume 
of nonfinancial corporate bond rating downgrades significantly outpaced that of upgrades 
in June, primarily driven by the downgrade of AT&T following its leverage- increasing

 U.S. Corporations’ Repatriation of Offshore Profits 
Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), foreign profits of U.S. multinational enterprises 
(MNEs) were subject to U.S. tax es, but on ly when repatriated .  This system incentivized firms  to 
keep profits abroad , and , by the end of 2017, U.S. MNEs had accumulated approximately 
$1 trillion in offshore profits, held mostly in U.S. fixed -income securities.1  The TCJA imposed a 
one- time tax ( payable over eight years) on the existing stock of offshore holdings regardless of 
whether the funds are repatriated, thus eliminating the tax incentive to keep cash abroad.  
Balance of payments data show that U.S. firms repatriated over $300  billion in 2018:Q1, roughly 
30 percent of the estimated stock of offshore cash holdings .2  
The quantit y of cash  repatriated  might  have  a notable effect  on firm financing patterns and 
investment decisions  in the near term —a topic that has garnered considerable investor 
attention .3  The analysis detailed  here shows  that funds  repatriated in 2018:Q1 have  mostly been 
used for share buybacks, while it is likely  too early to detect any effect on investment.  
Our analysis  investigates  how U.S. nonfinancial firms with large holdings of cash abroad —
specifically the top 15 holders —have deployed these funds, comparing their financing and 
investment behavior with that of  all other nonfinancial S&P 500 firms.4  Figure 1 shows that , 
following the passage of the TCJA, share buybacks sp iked dramatically for the top 15, with the 
ratio of buybacks  to assets more than doubling in 2018:Q1.  In dollar terms, buybacks  increased 
from $23  billion in 2017:Q4 to $55 billion in 2018:Q1.5  Among the top 15, the largest holders 
account for the bulk of the share repurchases:  I n 2018:Q1, the top 5 firms account for 
66 percent, and the top holder accounts for 41  percent.  
In contrast, the evidence of an analogous increase in investment is limited at this early stage 
(figure 2).  While there is a seasonal pattern in capital expenditures and R&D —with spikes in the 
fourth quarter— the top 15 have been on a slight upward trajectory relative to other firms for a 
few years, and there does not appear to be an obvious additional boost following the TCJA.  The 
upward trend is consistent with the notion that , because the top 15 are large firms , they  are 
                                                 
1 Cash held abroad is calculated by Board staff based on Bloomberg data for nonfinancial S&P 500 firms .  
Estimates suggest that most of the cash held abroad is invested in dollar -denominated fixed -income assets (see 
Zoltan Pozsar (2018), “Repatriation, the Echo -Taper and the €/$ Basis,” Global Money Notes #11 (New 
York:   Credit Suisse, January)).  
2 Repatriation reflects the transfer of funds to the U nited States  in purely accounting terms:   The funds 
previously held by a foreign affiliate are now held by  the U.S. parent.  For reference, t he 2004 tax holiday, which 
provided a temporary one-year reduction in the repatriation tax rate , resulted in $312  billion  repatriated,  of an 
estimated $750  billion held abroad.  
3 Under the pre-TCJA regime, using offshore funds for domestic investment or shareholder payouts would 
have been deemed a repatriation and thus subject to U.S. taxes.  
4 The top 15 firms account for roughly 80 percent of total offshore cash holdings, and roughly 80 percent of 
their total cash (domestic plus foreign) is held abroad . 
5 Firms can also pay out cash to shareholders through dividends; however, unlike buybacks, dividends were 
little changed for the top 15 relative to the same period last year.  Similarly, the evidence suggests that most of 
the repatriated funds during the 2004 tax holiday were used to fund share buybacks (see Dhammika 
Dharmapala, C. Fritz Foley, and Kristin J. Forbes (2011), “Watch What I Do, Not What I Say:  The Unintended 
Consequences of the Homeland Investment Act,” Journa l of Finance , vol. 66 (June), pp. 753 –87.).  
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

 unlikely to have faced notable constraints or costs to accessing capital markets to fund 
investment before the TCJA.  Any  boost to investment due to tax reform may also take time to 
materialize.  
How have the top 15 funded their increase in share buybacks?  Given that most of the offshore 
funds are invested in U.S. fixed -income securities, one might expect some of these to have been 
sold to pay for the buybacks.  The evidence supports this conclusion:  Figure 3 plots the net 
purchase of securities (scaled by assets), and indeed the top 15 were net sellers in 2018:Q1, with 
their total securities holdings falling by about 3  percent of their total assets (or $66  billion).6  
The sale of securities following repatriation may  also have been used to pay down debt ; 
however, the aggregate debt of the top 15 declined only about $15 billion , or 2 percent of their 
total debt outstanding, suggesting limited paydowns so far.  Consequently , figure 4 shows that 
the debt -to-assets ratio of the top 15 was little changed in 2018:Q1 (remain ing at 32  percent).7    
 
                                                 
6 Net purchase of securities is defined as the purchase of securities minus the proceeds from the sale and 
maturity of securities.  
7 The large drop in the debt -to-assets ratio in 2015:Q4 reflects GE’s exit from GE Capital.

  merger with Time Warner .  However, l everage ratios  for the sector as a whole, although 
near multidecade highs, were little changed , and the outlook for corpora te earnings 
remained  highly favorable, with  Wall Street analysts maintaining their projections for 
strong growth in earnings per share for S&P 500 firms for the rest of the year . 
Small Businesse s     
Financing conditions for small businesses remained solid  over the intermeeting 
period.  Indicators of recent loan performance remained strong, and credit quality 
concerns are not expected to be a significant factor limiting the ability of small businesses to obtain credit in the near term.  
Smal l business lending activity continued to pick up in recent months.  Loan 
originations, as measured by the three-month moving average of the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index , have shown solid gains.  Although the 
demand for credit by small businesses is still weak relative to pre -crisis levels, small 
business owners appear optimistic about the economy:  T he National Federation of 
Independent Business (NFIB) optimism index has trended up in recent months and now 
stands above its pre- crisis level.  In addition, both the share of NFIB respondents who 
feel that the next three months are a good time to expand and the share who are planning 
a capital expenditure in the next three to six  months are at post- crisis highs.   These facts 
suggest a further strengthening of small business credit demand in coming months. 
Commercial Real Estate  
Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained  accommodative.  
CRE loans at banks maintained solid growth over the past several months and quarters, 
with growth balanced  across all three major CRE loan categories.  On a weighted bas is 
across all major CRE loan categories, banks reported that standards and demand for CRE loans remained unchanged on the whole over the second  quarter .  However, demand 
reportedly weakened further for construction and land development loans, while 
standar ds for th ese type s of loans were tighter than the midpoint of the range that 
prevailed between 2005 and the present.  Interest rate spreads on commercial mortgage -
backed securities ( CMBS ) were little changed over the intermeeting period and remain ed 
near their post- crisis lows , while i ssuances of non-agency and agency CMBS maintained 
a solid level in the second quarter.

  MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative, on 
balance, over the interme eting period.  Gross issuance of bonds by state and local 
governments in June was robust, continuing to increase from its  slow start to the year.  In 
particular, new capital issuance was at its highest pace in  the past two years.  Since the 
previous FOMC m eeting, yields on general obligation bonds remained unchanged on net, 
while comparable- matu rity Treasury yields declined, resulting in slightly increased 
yield  spreads.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the resi dential mortgage market remained  accommodative 
for most borrowers.  For borrowers with low credit scores, credit  conditions continued to 
ease but remained tight overall .  The maximum ratio of debt payments to income for 
some low credit  score borrowers has increased notably over the past year , consistent with 
industry anecdotes that lenders are increasingly comfortable expanding their underwriting 
parameters.   Nonetheless, the volume of mortgages extended to borrowers with low credit  
scores has remained subd ued in the latest available data . 
Interest r ates on 30-year conforming mortgages have declined slightly  since the 
June FOMC meeting , roughly in line with yields on agency MBS, although rates 
remained  near their highest level s since 2011.  As a result, mort gage refinancing activity 
continued to be muted and growth of purchase mortgage originations has slowed over the 
past year.  The tight inventory of homes for sale also appeared  to be weighing on the 
volume of purchase originations.  
Consumer Credit 
Financi ng conditions in consumer credit markets remained  largely supportive of 
growth in spending.  Growth of c onsumer credit picked up in May from the more 
moderate pace seen earlier this year.  Despite rising interest rates, recent household 
surveys have indicate d that consumers’ assessments of buying conditions for autos and 
other expensive durable goods were generally positive, in part because financing rates 
remained low co mpared with historical levels.

  Credit supply conditions have also remained lar gely supportive.  A moderate net 
fraction of July SLOOS respondents reported easing stand ards on auto loans over the 
previous three months after several quarters of banks report ing tightening standards.  
However,  a significant net fraction of banks reportedly  continued to tighten  standards for 
credit card  accounts.  O n net , banks reported that the current level s of standards for both 
prime auto and credit card loan s were broadly the same as the midpoint of the range of 
standards that prevailed between 2005 and the present .  Banks’ reports of tight 
standards—relative to this benchmark —were primarily  confined to subprime- rated 
borrowers , who have typically  account ed for less than 20 percent of new credit 
extensions in the auto and credit card loan markets  in recent years .

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF R ISKS  
As in the June Tealbook, we view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic 
activity as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by the 
FOMC.  We also judge the risks around our projections for real GDP growth and the 
unemployment rate as being balanced.  These assessments are consistent with the estimates 
presented in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk.”  On the upside, the underlying 
fundamentals for household spen ding and business investment remain strong— bolstered in part 
by the tax cuts enacted last year— and readings on household and business sentiment generally 
continue to be upbeat.  Against this economic backdrop, spending and investment could expand 
faster than in the staff projection.  On the downside, trade policies could move in a direction that 
ultimately has significant negative effects on economic growth.  Another possibility is that the 
recent fiscal policy actions could produce less of a boost to aggregate demand than assumed in 
the baseline projection, as the current tightness of resource utilization may result in smaller 
multiplier effects than would be typical at other points in the business cycle.   
Although we have left our assessment of risks around economic activity unchanged, we 
continue to wrestle with some aspects of that  assessment.  For instance, the box “Alternative 
View:  Supply Constraints Will Prevent the Unemployment Rate from Falling Much Further ” 
suggests that risks may be skewed to the upside for the unemployment rate forecast.  More 
generally, the staff is not good at forecasting recessions, which historically have generated sharp 
increases in the unemployment rate and declines in real GDP.   
With regard to inflation, we still see average uncertainty and balanced risks around our 
projection.  To the downside, longer-run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price 
setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may not edge up in the coming 
years.  To the upside, with economic activity projected to move further above its potential, 
inflation could increase more than in the staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models 
that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation.  These assessments are 
consistent with the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast.   
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly 
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which judges the overall financial vulnerabilities in

the U.S. financial system appear low, as banks look to be well capitalized and hold substantial 
amounts of high-quality liquid assets,  while liquidity risk associated with money market funds 
remains much reduced owing to the SEC reforms implemented a couple of years ago.  In the 
nonfinancial sector, household borrowing has increased only moderately and primarily among 
prime-rated borrowers, but borrowing by highly levered and lower rated firms is elevated, 
suggesting that a weakening in economic activity could be amplified by strains within the 
corporate sector.  Asset valuation pressures remain broad based, with prices relative to 
fundamentals in the upper portion of their historical range across markets for equities, corporate 
bonds, leveraged loans, and commercial real estate.  Moreover, house prices have accelerated 
this year, and a variety of measures now point to somewhat elevated valuation pressures in this 
market, with particularly pronounced pressures evident in some regions.  Existing domestic 
financial vulnerabilities could amplify shocks from a marked jump in U.S. Treasury yields 
caused by an increase in concerns about the current high level and unsustainable trajectory for 
U.S. federal government debt, or from abroad, including from financial turbulence in China. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario,  the central bank misinterprets 
the persistently high level of labor utilization shown in the baseline as indicating a lower natural 
rate of unemployment than is actually the case, and this misperception exacerbat es the 
undershooting of the unemployment rate.  By contrast, in the second scenario, the strong level of 
economic activity in the baseline raises the level of potential labor inputs and lowers the true 
natural rate, a development recognized by policymakers.  The third scenario posits that increases 
in interest rates restrain household and business spending by more than assumed in the staff 
projection.  The fourth scenario considers a downside risk from developments related to fiscal 
policy— in particular, a faster increase in term premiums over the next few years, which leads to 
higher borrowing rates for households and businesses, and a drop in federal spending beginning 
in 2020.   The fifth scenario traces out the consequences of a sizable increase in financial market 
stress in China.  Finally, the sixth scenario illustrates the effects of widespread increases in trade 
barriers that significantly reduce world trade and output.

The first four scenarios are simulated in the FRB/US model, while the fifth scenario uses 
the SIGMA model,  and the last scenario uses the GEMUS model.1  In all cases, the federal funds 
rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline.   In addition, the size and composition 
of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios. 
Misperceived Natural Rate [FRB/US]  
The Tealbook projection shows further declines in the unemployment rate to historically 
low levels with a protracted period of tight labor utilization and only modest increases in 
inflation.  In this scenario, we assume that the central bank initially believes the natural rate of 
unemployment to be 4.2 percent, 5 0 basis points below its actual level in the simulation, and that 
the persistence of very low unemployment leads the central bank to gradually revise down its 
view of the natural rate of unemployment to 3 percent in 2023.  Because the central bank 
underestimates the intensity of resource utilization, monetary policy is more accommodative than 
it would have been , given an accurate reading of the natural rate of unemployment and hence the 
output gap.  Eventually, however, the central bank recognizes that it is unable to stabilize the 
economy at these high levels of activity without persistently exceeding its inflation target and, 
over the course of the next decade, corrects its misperception. 
As a result of the misperception, the federal funds rate is ¾  percentage point below the 
baseline on average from 2020 to 2023.  With the resulting additional monetary accommodation, 
real GDP grows more quickly than in the baseline forecast and the unemployment rate falls 
further, reaching about 2½ percent at the end of 2020 and remaining close to that level for 
several years.  Inflation rises slowly,  but steadily, and reaches 2½ percent by the end of 2023.2   
Positive Hysteresis [FRB/US]  
In this scenario, the very tight labor market in the baseline has persistent positive effects 
on the productive capacity of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as “positive 
hysteresis.”  Specifically, we assume that persistent exposure to a hot economy reduces exits 
from the labor force and generates additional entrants, causing the trend labor force participation 
                                                           
1 GEMUS is a two-country open economy DSGE model with relatively standard N ew Keynesian features 
such as sticky prices and financial frictions.  The model is a simplified version of SIGMA that is better suited to 
analyze trade po
licy issues.   
2 We also considered a version of this model with a Phillips curve slope that is four times steeper than the 
baseline specification.  In that case, inflation would be 3 percent in 2021; the unemployment rate would bottom out 
at around 3¼ percent, and the natural rate would be perceived to have fallen to about 4 percent.

rate to rise about 1 percentage point above the baseline by the end of 2023.  Furthermore, we 
assume that the experience that workers gain through greater employment lowers the natural rate 
of unemployment ½ percentage point by the end of 2023.  By contrast to the previous scenario, 
both of these favorable developments are assumed to be fully recognized by monetary 
policymakers.3 
Over the projection period, potential output rises, on average, about ¼ percentage point 
more per year than in the baseline.  This additional room to grow allows real GDP growth to run 
at a similar increment above the baseline.  As a result, the output gap is little changed.  The 
unemployment rate is slightly above the baseline until the first quarter of 2020 because increases 
in labor force participation  offset the effect of greater gains in employment.  After 2020, the 
unemployment rate follows a lower trajectory and is about ¼ percentage point below the staff 
projection in 2023.  With inflation and the output gap close to the baseline, the federal funds rate 
is little changed.4 
Greater Interest Rate Sensitivity [FRB/US] 
The Tealbook baseline forecast shows a large positive output gap for a number of years 
despite a rise in the federal funds rate that takes it to about 2½ percentage points above its long-
run value.  That  outcome is part ly attributable to a relatively low interest sensitivity of economic 
activity assumed in the staff forecast.  In this scenario, we explore the possibility that spending 
by both households and firms is more sensitive to interest rates than we have assumed.5    
With household spending and business investment more responsive to the path of real 
interest rates and the real federal funds rate above its long-run value at the beginning of 2019, 
real GDP growth falls below the baseline until the first quarter of 202 1.  The unemployment rate 
declines only a little from its current level and then begins to edge up, reaching 4 percent in 
2020, while inflation is close to the baseline, reflecting the very flat Phillips curve in the FRB/US 
                                                           
3 We modeled this alternative scenario by augmenting the usual specifications in FRB/US for the natural 
rate of unemployment and the trend labor force participation rate with endogenous hysteresis-generating 
compo nents. 
4 If we instead assumed that policymakers learn only slowly about the improvement in potential output, the 
federal funds rate would follow a steeper trajectory than shown in this scenario, reaching almost 5¼ percent by the 
end of 2021.  In that case, the effect of positive hysteresis on the unemployment rate is about half of that shown in 
this scenario.  
5 The magnitude of the peak output response to a monetary policy shock of 1 percentage point on the 
federal funds rate rises from 0.2 percentage point under the baseline to 0.6 percentage point under the higher interest 
rate sensitivity calibration, a value similar to the response shown in some DSGE models.

model.  The lower resource utilization, together with the muted inflation response, results in the 
federal funds rate being notably below the baseline, reaching 4 percent by the end of 2020.  
Unexpected Fiscal Restraint [FRB/US] 
The recent federal budget agreement increased discretionary spending caps by a total of 
$300  billion for this fiscal year and the next,  above the levels set in the Budget Control Act of 
2011  (BCA).  The baseline projection assumes that spending appropriations will rise with 
inflation from that higher level in 2020 and later years.  However, this scenario looks at the risk 
that appropriations return in 2020 to the much lower levels in the BCA, eventually reducing 
federal spending relative to the baseline by about ½ percent of nominal GDP.  This event in 
isolation would have modest macroeconomic effects, with GDP growth about ¼ percentage point 
lower in 2020 and the unemployment rate rising around ¼ percentage point above the baseline 
level of 3¾ percent in 2022; inflation is little changed.6  
However, macroeconomic outcomes could be worse if the move to a lower path for federal 
discretionary spending takes place amid intensifying concerns about the current high level of 
federal debt and its unsustainable long-run trajectory.7  Thus,  in this scenario, we also assume 
that financial market participants begin to demand increasingly higher term premiums on 
Treasury securities beginning this year.  We further assume that those higher premiums also 
show through to higher borrowing rates for both households and businesses, restraining their 
spending and investment.  
Given both the reduced government expenditures and the higher borrowing costs, real GDP 
growth falls ¼ percentage point per year below the baseline, on average,  from the second half of 
this year through 2022, by which time the unemployment rate has risen ½ percentage point 
above the baseline.  Inflation remains close to baseline levels, and consequently the federal funds 
rate is about 10  basis points lower, on average, over the medium term.8 
                                                           
6 The numbers cited here are not the ones shown in the alternative scenario table or exhibit. 
7 The unsustainable trajectory for federal government debt would be little changed by the lower path for 
discretionary spending assumed in this scenario. 
8 Some research suggests that the multiplier effects of fiscal stimulus might be larger in recessions than 
during economic expansions.  To illustrate the effect of this possibility, we also ran a model simulation with the 
multipliers associated with recent fiscal policy changes reduced by half.  Under this specification, GDP growth is 
lower than the baseline by about ¼ percentage point per year on average through the end of 2021, at which time the 
unemployment rate is just under ½ percentage point higher.  With inflation little changed, the federal funds rate is 
½ percentage point lower at the end of that year.

Financial Stress in China  [SIGMA] 
Although we expect that activity in China will decelerate only modestly over the forecast 
period, China’s vulnerabilities have increased in recent years amid rising corporate and 
household debt levels and a still heavily leveraged shadow banking sector.  Against this 
backdrop, any number of adverse shocks— including a property price bust, run on a shadow 
bank, or failure of a major corporation— could cause financial conditions to deteriorate and lead 
to a substantial slowdown in Chinese GDP growth.  Such developments would likely put 
downward pressure on the renminbi and lead to sharply lower commodity prices and sizable 
negative spillovers to other emerging market economies (EMEs ).   
This scenario assumes that such a risk materializes.  GDP growth in China and other 
EMEs falls to only 4½ percent and 2½ percent, respectively, in 2020  as EME corporate 
borrowing spreads increase 175 basis points and confidence declines.  The financial turbulence 
in EMEs and worries about future growth in global demand trigger a moderate  rise in borrowing 
spreads in the United States and in the advanced foreign economies.  Flight- to-safety flows cause 
the dollar to appreciate 5 percent and depress term premiums on U.S. government bonds.  
Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central banks are assumed to tighten 
monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on inflation arising from the depreciation of their 
currencies.   
The appreciation of the dollar, weaker foreign activity, and adverse financial spillovers 
cause U.S. GDP growth to moderate to about 1½ percent in 2019 and the unemployment rate to 
rise to 4 percent in 2020.  Lower resource utilization and falling import prices reduce core PCE 
inflation to about 1½ percent in 2019.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the 
baseline, rising to 4 percent by the end of 2020. 
This scenario assumes that the response of the Chinese authorities to the emergence of 
financial stresses keeps the fallout relatively contained.  The staff’s QS assessment considers an 
alternative in which a full-blown crisis in China and the other EMEs ensues that has considerably 
more adverse consequences for the United States and the global economy.  
Higher Trade Barriers [GEMUS]  
The current process of widespread trade negotiations is unprecedented in the post– World 
War II period, and it is difficult to predict the outcome.  Accordingly, beyond the measures

already implemented, which should have a relatively limited effect on aggregate economic 
activity, we have not built any additional trade policy actions into our baseline outlook.  If the 
process ultimately leads to lower trade barriers around the world, there could be significant 
positive effects on the United States and foreign economies.  Conversely, an outcome of 
widespread and sustained increases in trade barriers would likely entail profoundly  
adverse effects.   
This scenario considers the latter possibility.  In particular, we assume that the United 
States increases tariffs on all imported goods by 15  percentage points and that foreign economies 
impose a similar sized increase in tariffs on U.S. exports.  Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce 
imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies have little effect on the 
trade balance.  However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods depresses household 
spending while business spending declines,  both as a result of the higher cost of imported capital 
goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing spreads to rise.  In addition, we 
assume that productivity growth slows as a result of a shift in production to less efficient 
domestic firms and industries as well as a reduction in international competition that diminishes 
incentives to innovate.   
All told, these developments push the U.S. economy into a mild recession lasting until 
the end of 2019, and the unemployment rate rises to 4½ percent.  Higher import prices boost core 
PCE inflation to 4¼ percent in the second half of 2018.  Given the jump in inflation, the inertial 
Taylor rule initially prescribes a steeper rise in the federal funds rate than in the baseline, rising 
above 4 percent in early 2019.  The federal funds rate moves below the baseline starting in 2020, 
as inflation returns close to baseline and output remains well below potential.  
We have limited experience with the large and broad-based increases in trade barriers 
contemplated in this scenario, and, accordingly, there is unusually large uncertainty around our 
estimates.   The declines in productivity associated with higher trade barriers could show through 
to aggregate output either more slowly or more rapidly than indicated in the simulation.  Effects 
on confidence or market sentiment could be smaller or larger.  And, notably, the simulation does 
not take into account hard- to-model features— including disruptions to global supply chains or 
the effects of policy uncertainty on business investment— which might have an especially large 
effect on economic activity here and abroad.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  The near -term prescri ptions are little ch anged from 
those in the June Tealbook.  Over the medium term, the Tealbook baseline projection features  modestly high er levels of  resource utilization , on average, than the June 
projection.  Consequently , the prescriptions arising from most of the strategies are 
slightly less accommodative than those in the previous Tealbook.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four polic y rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the “balanced 
approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible price -level  
targeting (FPLT ) rule .1  These near -term prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap and core inflation , shown by the black lines in the middle 
panels ; the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural 
rate of unemployment (not shown) instead of the output gap.  The top and middle panel s 
also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is constructed using 
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2  
The staff forecast for the variables that enter these rules has changed very little; 
consequently, the prescriptions of each of the policy rules are nearly the same as in the 
June Tealbook.  
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules , which do not 
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.  The near -term prescriptions of the first-
                                                 
1 We provide details on each of these simple rules  in the appendix to this section.   Starting  with 
this Tealbook, the equation s for the Tealbook baseline policy rule and for all simple rules considered herein 
express policy rates on the same  360-day uncompounded basis as the published federal funds rate .  In 
previous Tealbooks, the rule equation s expressed policy rates on a 365- day fully compounded basis.  This 
technical adjustment has only minor effects on the rules’ prescriptions.  For comp arability, all previous  
Tealbook prescriptions reported herein are adjusted to reflect the new methodology.  
2 Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here 
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

 difference rule, for which adjustments are gradual , essentially coincide with 
those of the Tealbook baseline. 
• Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which  call for raising 
the federal funds rate in the near term , the FPLT  rule, in an effort to eliminate 
the cumulative shortfall in the core PCE  price index of about 2½ percent, 
prescribes level s for the federal funds rate in the third and fourth quarters that 
remain below  the current target range.  
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL  
FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2018 Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).3  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used  
to generate an  estimate  of r*.4  This r* concept, labeled  “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the 
level of th e real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting in 
the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  
This concept of r* is a summary of  the projected underlying strength of the rea l 
economy; it does not take into account considerations such as  achieving the inflation 
objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate. 
• At 3.44 percent , the estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* in this 
quarter is 18 basis points above the corresponding value computed using the 
June Tealbook projection.  Th e upward revision reflects the fact that , in the 
                                                 
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the June 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth and 
monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.  
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of 
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer- run value.  
4 The staff has implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model since the 
previous Tealbook.  With the exception of the SEP -consistent FRB /US r*, all model simulations referenced 
herein use the latest version of the model, including simulations based on the previous Tealbook projection.  The elasticities in the new version of the m odel, such as those governing the response of inflation to 
resource utilization and the response of aggregate demand to interest rates,  are sufficiently similar to those 
in the previous version that the rule prescriptions are largely unaffected by the change of version.  The SEP-consistent  FRB /US r* continues to use the previous version of the model because of data 
compatibility limitations.

 current Tealbook projection, the output gap is slightly more positive by the 
end of the 12- quarter period than in the June Tealbook.  
• At 1.80 percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook-consistent FRB /US r*.  The difference stems from the fact that the 
SEP-consistent projection has  output exceeding  potential by a considerably 
smaller amount over the medium term than does the current  Tealbook 
forecast .  This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the 
median path for the real federal funds rate implied by SEP projections 
averages  almost 1  percent age point less  than  the corresponding path in the 
Tealbook. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (199 3) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the FPLT  rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.5  The 
simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following that rule in the fut ure and that financial market  participants, price setters, and 
wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this 
commitment and  are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy . 
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases ¾  percentage 
point over the remainder of this year and rises, on average, 1 percentage point 
per year for the following two years, reaching 4 ¾ percent in the fourth quarter 
of 2020. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial  increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values through 2022.  This higher path is associated with 
only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10 -year Treasury yield than in 
the baseline until 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter , as the Taylor 
(1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate beyond the period shown.  Because wage and price setting today is influenced by 
                                                 
5 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.

 expected future outcomes in the FRB/US  model, and because the Taylor 
(1999) rule calls for somewhat more accommodative policy later in the 
simulation, current inflation is  somewhat  higher than in the baseline 
projection.  The path for the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook baseline path  over the next few years but subsequently takes a bit longer to 
return to its natural rate.
6 
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate.  Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to 
output exceeding its assumed potential level  over the projection period, t he 
prescriptions of this  rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over 
the period shown.  The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years , but, s tarting in the fourth 
quarter of 2020, t he path for the federal funds rate falls below the baseline 
path for a sustained period.  As a result, current inflation is higher , and the real  
10-year Treasury yield is low er, than  their corresponding values in the 
Tealbook projection.  The more accommodative conditions engender a more 
pronounced undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate  
during and beyond the medium term. 
• The path for the federal funds ra te prescribed by the first -difference rule is 
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through 2020, but runs 
below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter divergence 
occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the expected 
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the decline in the 
output gap that is projected beyond 2020.  The associated lower path of the federal funds rate and  the expectation of higher inflation in the future imply 
lower longer -term real interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline.  Thus, the 
first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are 
                                                 
6 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this and the Taylor (1993) rule 
simulations, despite higher levels o f the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption that 
price and wage setters perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond 
the next several years and factor these future monetary policy conditions int o today’s price and wage 
setting decisions.  The box “Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results under a scenario in which price and wage 
setters lack such a per fect understanding.  In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non -inertial 
policy rule led to a significant decline in inflation and rise in unemployment at the start of the simulation in response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to

 lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than  the corresponding 
outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection. 
• The FPLT  rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative  shortfall of core PCE 
inflation from an annual rate of 2 percent since the end of 2011.  T he FPLT  
rule calls for keeping  the federal funds rate below the current target range 
until the first  quar ter of 2020 and maintaining a markedly slower pace of 
increases thereafter than in the Tealbook baseline.  This prescription generates 
a high er rate of inflation in coming years that eventually undoes  the 
2½ percent age point cumulative shortfall of the core PCE price index relative 
to a path that rises 2 percent per year beginning in 2012:Q 1.  Because the 
simulation embeds the assumption s that policymakers can credibly commit to 
closing this gap over time and that financial market participants , price  setter s, 
and wage setters  correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of low federal 
funds rates, the path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate drops below the 
Tealbook baseline for the next five years .  The unemployment rate is 
substantially lower  than  in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations 
shown, dropping below  2½ percent in  2020.7 
• Compared with the June Tealbook, the prescriptions of the simple rules are at 
most a couple of tenths of a percentage point higher over the period shown.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.8  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may improve economic outcomes.9   
                                                 
7 The unemployment rate subsequently rises to a level near its natural rate in 2031, while headline 
PCE inflation falls from a peak of 2.4 percent in 2023 to 2 percent in 2032.  
8 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strate gies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.  
9 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that will not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

 The first t hree of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for 
the federal f unds rate than the path in the baseline staff projection, for two reasons.  First, 
high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up 
to its natural rate , because, consistent with recent historical experience, the 
unemployment rate does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the 
FRB/US model.  Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the front -loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.  In practice, 
however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as high and as quickly as 
prescribed by the first three optimal control policies , macroeconomic outcomes could be 
less benign than shown here because of the confusion and financial market disruption that 
such an abrupt change in policy might engender .  In contrast, the fourth optimal control 
policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels  last experienced during the 
1950s.  S uch a development might likewise  entail outcomes different f rom those 
predicted by the simulations.    
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping t he 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly 
higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable 
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate over the next 
several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with  
the equal -weights loss function judge to be costly.
10  The small p rojected 
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail 
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.  
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates  only 
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response of  
inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.  
• The second  simulation , “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five 
times larger than the specification  with equal weights but is otherwise 
                                                 
10 When we use the June  2018 SEP-consistent baseline as the underlying projection, the federal 
funds rate under the optimal control simulation with equal weights peaks at around 5½ percent, compared 
with about 7½  percent under the Tealbook baseline.

 identical to that specification.  Even though policymakers attach larger losses 
to deviations of inflation from 2 percent, they nonetheless choose a federal 
funds rate path that results in inflation undershooting the inflation objective by 
more than under the baseline policy over the period shown, for two reasons.  
First, policymakers seek to undo the modest but persistent overshoot of the 
inflation objective over the next decade, which they see as costly.  Second, policymakers continue to attach  significant losses  to the unemployment rate 
undershooting its  natural rate.  On net, the federal funds rate path is only 
modestly less  restrictive than under the equal-weights sp ecification.  
• The third  simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This 
simulation  seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even faster 
than under the equal- weight s specification.  As a result , the federal funds rate 
soars to 10 percent  at the beginning of next year and then averages  around 
7 percent from 2020 through 2023. 
• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss 
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of 
the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control 
simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path 
throughout the period shown.  With the asymmetric loss function, 
policymakers choose this more accommodative path for the policy rate 
because their desire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by an 
aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  The tighter labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent than in the case of equal weights.  
Starting in the middle of the 2020s (not shown), the unemployment rate runs a 
little above its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the 
inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated 
resource utilization.  
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations describ ed previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adher e to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict a dherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymake rs and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymak ers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES  SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  It also reports the expression for the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule ; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a small 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic

  projection.1  The right -hand- side variables of the first four rules include the staff’s projection of 
trailing four -quarter core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 
and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current perio d (𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three-
quarter- ahead an nual change in the output ga p (𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of 
policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.   In the case of t he flexible 
price -level  targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables include an unemployment rate gap and  a 
price  gap.  The unemployment gap is defined as the difference between the unemployment rate, 
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡∗.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the 
difference  between the log of the core PCE price level,  𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level 
path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price level, and, 
subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.  
Simple Rules  
 
The first two rules in the table  were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price  gap like the FPLT rule  have 
been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.2  An FPLT rule similar to the one above is 
also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).   
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES 
The “Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
                                                 
1 Starting with this Tealbook, the equations for the Tealbook baseline policy rule and for all simple 
rules considered herein express policy rates on the same 360 -day uncompounded basis as  the published 
federal funds rate.  In previous Tealbooks, the rule equations expressed policy rates on a 365 -day fully 
compounded basis.

  next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on th eir simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines :  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .
3  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of whi ch take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.4  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of fut ure 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.

consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate u nder the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection , the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
                                                 
3 The staff has implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model since the 
previous Tealbook.  All model simulations referenced herein use the latest version of the model with the 
exception of the SEP -consistent FRB /US r*, which continues t o use the previous version of the model 
because of data compatibility limitations.

  price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbo ok projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quart er, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the diffe rence between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), an d squared changes in the federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.   The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the four 
specificati ons. 
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large weigh t to inflation gaps.  The third  specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places 
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
5  The fourth  specification, “Asymmetric 
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the

ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.  Loss Functions

  unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the 
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these four specifications of the loss fu nction, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wag e and price setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policyma kers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public see s this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits .

    1. Annual values stated on a fiscal year basis. Quarterly values not seasonally adjusted.    2. Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.    3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of real GDP (excluding multiplier effects).  It equals the sum        of the direct contributions to real GDP growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus the estimated contribution to real
        household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus) is the portion of FE attributable
        to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
