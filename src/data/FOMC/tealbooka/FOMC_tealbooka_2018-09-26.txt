Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The economy has continued to expan d at a brisk pace.  Real GDP is estimated to 
have increased 3½ percent at an an nual rate in the first half o f the year and is expected to 
rise at a 2¾ percent rate in t he second half.  GDP grows at a m odestly faster pace in 2018 
than we had written down in the July Tealbook, with slightly higher contributions from 
PCE and business investment.  Labor market conditions have cont inued to strengthen:  
Payroll employment has continue d to increase su bstantially, and  the unemployment rate 
was 3.9 percent in July and August, unchanged from the second quarter and nearly ¾ percentage point below our estim ate of its natural rate.  Wit h above-trend output 
growth, the unemployment ra te is expected to move down to 3.7 p ercent by year-end.   
Real GDP growth is projected t o slow steadily from 3 percent th is year to 
1½ percent in 2021.  A gradual tight ening in monetary policy ex plains the bulk of the 
slowdown in GDP growth, but the emergence of some modest supply  constraints and a 
reduction in fiscal impetus i n 2021 also contribute.  We now estimate the output gap to 
have been 1¾ percent in the sec ond quarter of this year; with o utput expected to outpace 
its potential through mid-2020, the o utput gap increases steadily and reaches 3¼ percent 
in mid-2020 before edging down t o 2¾ percent by the end of 2021 , the same as in the 
July Tealbook.  We project that the unemployment rate will fall to 3¼ percent in 2020 
and then edge up to nearly 3½ percent by the end of the medium term.  The 
unemployment rate at the e nd of 2021 is ¼ percentage point lowe r than we forecast in 
July, partly because we nudged down our estimate of the natural  rate of unemployment 
by 0.1 percentage point, to 4.6 percent. 
The 12-month change in core PCE  prices is estimated to have bee n 1.9 percent in 
August, and it is expected to remain near that level through the end of this year.  Core 
PCE price inflation is forecast to edge up to 2.1 percent by 20 20—as labor and product 
markets tighten further—and t hen remain there in 2021.  Total P CE price inflation is 
projected to run a little above c ore inflation through the end of this year and then to run a 
touch below it thereafte r, reflecting the decl ining path for consumer energy prices in the 
medium term.  As before, these p rojections incorporate our assu mption that modest 
supply constraints will result in slightly higher inflation than would otherwise be the case.  
The forecast for the path of consumer prices is little differen t than in the July Tealbook.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The September Tealbook projection for real GDP growth lies close to both the Blue 
Chip consensus forecast and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) median 
forecast for 2018; all three forecasts step down in 2019 and are within a narrow range .  
The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is in line with the others in 2018 and a touch 
below the Blue Chip consensus in 2019. The staff projection for total CPI inflation is 
close to the Blue Chip consensus and SPF median forecasts in both 2018 and 2019. 
Note: SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures. Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation. The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40. Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the June  FOMC meeting.  The table below compares the staff’s current economic projection 
with the one we presented in the June Tealbook.  
Incoming data for real GDP growth have been a bit  stronger than  we expected  in the June 
Tealbook , although  the unemployment rate has come in  a touch higher.  O ur projection  for 
real GDP  over the medium term has been revised  up slightly , reflecting somewhat more 
favorable trajectories for both overall financial conditions  (primarily , higher equity prices)  
and personal income.  The medium -term forecast for the unemplo yment rate is revised 
down a little, partly reflecting our updated assumption that the natural rate of 
unemployment  is 4.6 percent —0.1 percentage point  lower than in the June forecast .  All 
told , resource utilization, as measured by  the output gap o r the  unemployment  rate  gap, is 
slightly  tight er in our medium -term projection  than in the June  Tealbook . 
Our forecast s for both total and  core inflation in 2018  and over the medium term are little 
changed relative to the June  Tealbook .  We continue to expect core inflat ion to be close to 
2 percent  over the next several years ; total inflation is forecast to run  a bit below core 
inflation  after this year, reflecting a small projected decline in energy prices.    
The path  for the federal funds rate derived  from the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule 
used in our baseline forecast is quite similar to its trajectory in June, although it is a bit  
steeper in the medium term  with the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current 
projection .

Finally, we estimate that the  tariffs on steel, aluminum, and c ertain imports from 
China that were implemented thi s year, along with our trading p artners’ responses to 
those tariffs, will have only ver y small effects on net exports , overall spending, and 
aggregate consumer prices.  Other tariff changes reportedly und er review remain 
uncertain and are not included i n our projection, but we estima te their effects would be 
more material.  The possible eff ects of a broad-based increase in trade barriers are more 
consequential still and are disc ussed in the Risks and Uncertai nty section. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS 
Monetary Policy   
 The inertial version of the Taylo r (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase ½ percentage point  over the 
remainder of this year, to increase 1¼ percentage points next y ear, and to rise, 
on average, ½ percentage point per year in the remainder of the  medium term, 
reaching 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.  This traject ory is very 
similar to the one in the July Tealbook.  
 The size of the SOMA portfolio c ontinues a grad ual and predicta ble decline in 
a manner consistent with the Com mittee’s public declarations. 
Other Interest Rates 
 The 10-year Treasury yield is pr ojected to rise from an average  of about 
3 percent in the current qua rter to 4¼ percent by the end of 20 21, a path that is 
similar to the one in the July Tealbook.  
o The funds rate is anticipated to rise above the 10-year rate in 
mid-2020, the same as in the July Tealbook. 
 The 30-year fixed mortgage rate  and the triple-B corporate bond  yield have 
risen about as expected and are projected to rise significantly  further over the 
medium term, in line with the t rajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Equity prices are projected to e nd the current quarter about 2½ percent above 
the July Tealbook forecast, reflecting recent increases in broa d equity price 
indexes.  Beyond the current quart er, we forecast stock prices to rise at an

average annual rate of around ½ pe rcent, similar to our previou s projection.  
Projected future appreciation is held down by the fact that equ ity valuations 
are already moderately stretched. 
 We expect house price growth t o slow from 6 percent in 2017 to 5 percent this 
year.  Weaker-than-expected house price data for June and July caused us to 
mark down the increase we project this year.  We continue to expect house 
price increases to moderate to a n average pace  of 3½ percent ov er the next 
three years, reflecting both the  continuing rise in mortgage ra tes and our 
assessment that house prices are  elevated relative to rents. 
Fiscal Policy 
 We assume that the expansionar y fiscal policies enacted over th e past year 
will continue through the medium term.1  Taking these assumptions on board, 
we estimate that discretionary f iscal policy actions across all  levels of 
government will contribute ½ percentage point to the rate of growth in 
aggregate demand in each year through 2020 (exclusive of any mu ltiplier 
effects and financial offsets) ; this contrib ution eases to ¼ pe rcentage point in 
2021.  
 We expect the federal budget defi cit to widen from 3½ percent o f GDP in 
fiscal year 2017 to 5½ percent i n fiscal 2021 as a result of ex pansionary fiscal 
policy and the effects of higher interest rates on debt service  costs. 
o We continue to assume that, i n the longer run, policymakers 
gradually reduce deficits by an a mount sufficient to stabilize the 
debt-to-GDP ratio. 
o We expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to stabilize at a level 20 percentage points higher than would have occurred absent 
recent and projected policy actions.  We anticipate that the hi gher 
debt-to-GDP ratio will push up the longer-run term premium on 
10-year Treasury securities by 50 basis points.  
1 Our forecast assumes that the c urrent level of discretionary s pending will be maintained in real 
terms in fiscal years 2020 and 20 21; realization of that foreca st will require lifting the discretionary 
spending caps for those years.

o Appropriations for fiscal 2019 have not yet been enacted, although 
there are reports of progress on a  compromise agreement.  The 
baseline projection continues to assume that there will be no 
meaningful disruption of gove rnment operations due to a 
shutdown.2 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
 Real GDP growth in the foreign economies stepped down in the second quarter to an annual rate of 2 per cent, as a broad-based slowin g in the 
emerging market economies (EM Es) was only partly offset by a re bound in 
growth in some advanced foreign e conomies (AFEs).  This estimat e is 
noticeably lower than in the previous Tealbook.  We foresee GDP  growth 
abroad rising in the second half of this y ear to a little below  its potential pace 
of around 2¾ percent and remaining there over the forecast peri od.  The 
projection for the second half is somewhat weaker than in the p revious 
Tealbook, reflecting softer data a s well as increased financial stresses abroad 
(especially for some EMEs).  Heightened financial pressures and  recent trade 
policy developments have increased  downside risks to our foreig n outlook. 
 Since the July Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated 
1¾ percent.
3  We expect the broad real dolla r to appreciate at an annual ra te of 
1¾ percent through the forecast period as market expectations f or the federal 
funds rate move up toward the sta ff forecast.  Because this rate of appreciation 
is slightly less than in the July Tealbook, our projection for the real dollar at 
the end of the forecast horizon is little changed. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil has risen about $7 per barrel , on net, since 
the July Tealbook, closing most recently around $80 per barrel.  The increase 
in prices is due partly to signals of greater foreign compliance with U.S. 
2 A lapse in appropriations that resulted in a short-term shutdo wn of the federal government would 
have only minor implications for the outlook. We estimate that  each week of a government shutdown 
would directly reduce GDP growth in the current quarter by 0.1 percentage point (annual rate).  Assuming 
government appropriations return to baseline levels in the next quarter, GDP growth would increase by the 
same magnitude. 
3 Excluding the 96 percent devaluation of the bolivar announced last month by the Venezuelan 
government, the broad nominal dollar has appreciated only 1¼ pe rcent.

sanctions on Iranian oil, set t o come into effect in early Nove mber.  In 
addition, oil prices moved higher i n response to surprisingly l arge declines in 
U.S. oil inventories and a downwar d revision to the U.S. Depart ment of 
Energy’s forecast for U.S. oil production.  Farther-dated futur es prices are up 
about $5 per barrel, with the futures price for delivery in Dec ember 2021 at 
$69 per barrel. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY 
Real GDP is now estimated to have  increased at an annual rate o f 4¾ percent in 
the second quarter.  The strong s howing reflected a rebound in consumer spending from 
an inexplicably weak first quart er as well as a temporary jump in agricultural exports and 
government expenditures.  Smoothing through these movements, GD P growth rose at a 
brisk 3½ percent pace in the first half.  The incoming spending data have continued to be 
strong, on net, so far this quarter , and we project that real G DP in the second half will rise 
at a 2¾ percent pace, a little above our July Tealbook projecti on.4 
 PCE rose at a 2¼ percent pace in the first half of the year, an d we expect 
growth to step up in the second half.  Combining the strong rec ent gains in 
retail sales and lackluster purchas es of new vehicles, we see P CE goods 
spending rising at a solid pace in the third quarter.  The late st data on 
household spending on services ha ve also been quite strong.  Al though rising 
interest rates may have started  to curb durables spending, the combination of 
the recent spending data and the s olid fundamental s—rising inco me boosted 
by tax changes, wealth gains f rom rising equity prices and home  values, and 
favorable sentiment—point to P CE growth of about 2¾ percent in the second 
half of this year.   
 Business fixed investment rose at a 10 percent pace in the first half of 2018, which was in part due to an unusua lly swift pace of intangibles  investment 
and a spike in drilling invest ment spurred by rising oil prices .  We expect that 
growth in intangibles investment will moderate and that drillin g investment 
will flatten out in the second half of this year, but that business fixed 
4 The numerical forecast that acco mpanies this document was clos ed before the Augu st retail sales 
report was available; that repor t was noticeably stronger than we had factored in and would boost our third-
quarter GDP growth estimate by a little less than ½ percentage point.  Our forecast u pdate next Friday will 
incorporate these data as well as our preliminary assessment of  the economic effects of Hurricane Florence.

investment will rise at a still-solid pace of 5¾ percent.  More broadly, 
business investment is being supported by solid business output  growth, 
ample access to financing, continued upbeat readings on business sentiment, 
buoyant profit expectations, and the  effects of the Tax Cuts an d Jobs Act. 
 Residential investment decline d at an annual rate of 2½ percent  in the first 
half of this year, ref lecting the drag from rising mortgage rat es and supply 
constraints in the construc tion sector.  Forward-looking indica tors—including 
construction permits for singl e-family homes, pending home sale s, and the 
Michigan survey index of homebuying conditions—have generally s oftened in 
recent months, on net, and we expe ct investment to continue to decline 
through the remainder of 2018. 
 After making a sizable positive contribution to real GDP growth  in the second 
quarter, net exports are expected  to subtract about ½ percentag e point from 
growth in the second half of this  year.  The net export contrib ution in the 
second half is ¼ percentage point m ore negative relative to the  July Tealbook, 
reflecting stronger-than-expected t hird-quarter imports, which do not appear 
to be in anticipation of prosp ective tariffs.  Our projection f or foreign trade in 
coming quarters includes the effects of the already implemented trade policy 
actions, including the aluminum and steel tariffs, tariffs on $ 50 billion worth 
of imports from China, and reciprocal actions by our trading pa rtners.  
Because the negative effects on export and import growth are of fsetting, the 
trade policy measures are projec ted to have little effect on th e overall 
contribution of net exports to real GDP growth. 
 Manufacturing production picked up in July and August to a 3 pe rcent annual 
rate after rising 2¼ percent at an annual rate in the first half of the year.  
Readings on new orders from manufacturing surveys remain upbeat .  
Although we estimate that light vehicle assemblies moved up, on net, in July and August, automakers’ production schedules suggest production  in the 
second half of the year will move sideways from the first half of the year at 
10.8 million units.  All told, manufacturing production is expe cted to pick up 
to a 2¾ percent pace in the second half. 
For the medium term, we project that real GDP growth will slow roughly 
½ percentage point per year, fro m about 3 percent this year to 1½ percent in 2021.  The

gradual deceleration reflects the ongoing tightening of monetar y policy, the emergence of 
some modest supply constraints, and waning fiscal impetus.   
 Our forecast for real GDP is a little stronger than in the July Tealbook, 
primarily reflecting the effect s of incoming data on business investment and a 
higher path for household income.  Meanwhile, changes in financial market 
conditions and oil prices had littl e effect on the projection. 
 In the comprehensive revision t o the national accounts, the BEA  revised up 
the level of disposable persona l income substantially over hist ory, with 
particularly large revis ions in 2016 and 2017.  We took some si gnal from the 
recent income revisions and nudged up our PCE forecast.  Nevert heless, the 
revisions to income result in a  markedly higher level of the sa ving rate over 
history that carries i nto the projection period.  
 In the wake of the BEA’s compr ehensive update to the national i ncome and 
product accounts (NIPA), we re-e valuated our aggregate supply assumptions.  
Specifically, we lowered our natura l rate estimate one-tenth to  4.6 percent, 
and we raised our estimate of the trend labor force participation rate by a little 
over 0.1 percentage point.  Combined with some other housekeepi ng changes, 
these adjustments resulted i n an output gap that was still siza ble but 
¼ percentage point smaller at mi dyear than we had previously sh own.   
o Near the most recent two business cycle peaks, we had become to o 
optimistic about our supply-side assumptions and later reversed some of that optimism.  To take out some insurance against a repetition of that mistake, we  have moved cautiously in this cycle 
in adjusting downward our assumpti on for the natural rate despite 
the low-inflation, low-unempl oyment environment.  However, 
with the benefit of the compreh ensive revision, we assessed tha t a 
small further adjustment was warranted. 
o At the same time, the particip ation rate has surprised us 
persistently on the upside over the past year, and the adjustment to 
the LFPR trend is an attempt t o address this regularity.

 With the federal government exp ected to run historically large and rising 
deficits over the medium term , national saving is projected to trend downward 
as a share of GDP.  Nevertheless , private investment trends upw ard as a share 
of the economy, with the wideni ng gap between domestic investment and 
national saving financed by incre ased inflows of foreign capita l. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET 
The July and August employment re ports indicated that labor market conditions 
have continued to strengthen about as we had expected.  The une mployment rate was 
3.9 percent in both July and A ugust, down 0.2 percentage point from the end of 2017, 
while the labor force particip ation rate (LFPR) averaged 62.8 p ercent during the past two 
months and has been little cha nged, on balance, over the past f our years.  
 According to the BLS, private nonf arm payrolls increased 204,00 0 in August 
and about 180,000 per month over the most recent three months—a  slightly 
smaller three-month change than we had expected, owing to downw ard 
revisions to earlier months .  In response, we nudged down our n ear-term 
projection for private nonfarm payroll gains 10,000 per month t o an average 
of 180,000, still well above the pa ce we estimate to be require d to maintain 
unchanged resource utilization. 
 Data that we analyze from the pa yroll processing firm ADP (see the figure 
“Labor Market Developments and O utlook”) point to an average in crease in 
private payrolls over the three months ending in August of abou t 260,000.  A 
model-based estimate that combines the information from the BLS  and ADP 
data currently shows the number  of private jobs as having incre ased 220,000 
per month over the past three months.   
 We continue to project that the unemployment rate will move dow n further to 
3.7 percent by the end of this year , a little less than 1 perce ntage point below 
our estimate of its  natural rate.   
 The LFPR fell to 62.7 percent i n August, 0.1 percentage point b elow our 
previous forecast.  Because the dip was concentrated in 16-to-2 4-year-olds’ 
LFPRs (which are especially volat ile near the start of the scho ol year), we are 
inclined to discount the August reading.  Thus, we project the aggregate LFPR

will edge b ack up to 62.8 percent in September and remain at th at level 
through the end of the year, unchang ed from the July Tealbook.  The LFPR is 
now ¼ percentage point above the trend estimated by the staff.  The 
employment-to-population rati o averaged 60.4 percent over the p ast two 
months, in line with our July Tealbook forecast, and is ¾ perce ntage point 
above our estim ate of its trend. 
 The BLS Job Openings and Labor T urnover Survey for July also points to an 
extremely tight labor market—fo r example, the job openings rate  for private-
sector employment was reported to be 4.7 percent, a 0.3 percent age point 
increase from a year earlier a nd the highest rate recorded in t he 18-year 
history of the series. 
We continue to expect the labor market to tighten further over the medium term, 
consistent with above-trend GDP growth.  We also continue to assume that, in an 
extremely tight labor market, a  larger-than-usual amount of the tightening in resource 
utilization will manifest in a higher LFPR and a smaller-than-u sual amount in a lower 
unemployment rate.  
 Average monthly total payroll ga ins slow gradually in the proje ction, from 
about 180,000 in the second half of this year to about 90,000 in 2021.  The 
box “Sources of Strong Employment Growth in the Staff Forecast”  considers 
how the staff’s payroll forecast can be achieved given the curr ent very tight 
labor market. 
 The unemployment rate is projected to move down to 3.3 percent by the 
middle of next year and slip a t ouch further to 3.2 percent in 2020.  We 
anticipate some softening in the  labor market in 2021 and expec t the 
unemployment rate to edge up t o 3.4 percent by t he end of that year—still 
1¼ percentage points belo w its natural rate.  
 The LFPR is expected to in crease to 62.9 percent in 2019 and then decline 
gradually in 2020 and 2021.  With the  trend participation rate expected to 
continue to decline, we project that the LFPR gap will widen from 
0.3 percentage point at the end of 2018 to 0.6 percentage point  at the end of 
2020 before narrowing to 0.5 percentage point by the end of 202 1.

 Sources of Strong Employment Growth in the Staff Forecast  
The staff projects that the labor market will tighten further through the end of 
2020, with payroll employment rising by nearly 5 million from 2018:Q2  to 
2020:Q4 —about 2 million more than our estimate of its  neutral pace (the pace of 
job gains needed to maintain labor utilization at its current level).1  With the labor 
market already quite tight, how might  the stro ng job growth in the staff forecast  
be achieved ? 
The staff expects that a bout half  of these job gains will come from further 
increases in the labor force.  In particular, the labor force participation rate (LFPR) is projected to be about flat , on net , thro ugh the end of 2020 even as the 
staff’s estimate of its trend declines almost 0.2  percentage point per year.  The 
remainder of the above- trend job growth is manifest in  a further 0.6  percentage 
point decline in the unemployment rate, to 3.2  percent by 2020 :Q4.  The 
important role played by the LFPR relative to the unemployment rate in the staff 
forecast contrasts with the typical pattern in which a greater portion of job gains 
are met by reductions in the unemployment rate and reflects the staff’s 
judgment that unusually abundant job openings and rising wages will draw new 
workers into the labor force and discourage others from leaving.  
 
 
                                                 
1 The staff estimates that the neutral pace of payroll job gains through the medium term is 
roughly 95,000 per month.  This estimate assumes that the unemployment rate remains at its 
2018:Q2  value of 3.9  percent, that the L FPR declines in parallel with its trend (about 
0.2 percentage point per year), and that the gains in employment as measured in the 
establishment survey exceed the gains in employment as measured in the h ousehold survey by 
about 15,000 per month (similar to the differential of the past few years and in the staff 
forecast through 2020).

How might these further increases in the labor force occur? Over the projection 
period, the staff estimates that population aging will continue to exert 
downward pressure on the LFPR.  For the LFPR to remain about flat despite a 
larger share of the population moving into age groups with lower LFPRs , there 
must be offsetting increases in the LFPRs for some age groups.  The staff does 
not explicitly forecast demographic -specific LFPRs, but it is useful to consider 
whether there is a reasonable combination of improvements in age-specific 
LFPRs that is consistent with the staff’s projection for the aggregate LFPR.  The 
dashe d lines in figure 1 show one possible such combination of assumptions for 
the 16–24, 25 –54, 55 –64, and 65+ age groups , with the LFPR for each group 
increasing a little more than ½ percentage point from 2018:Q2 to 2020:Q4 — 
roughly a continuation of their increases since 2014. 
Is this scenario reasonable?  It leaves the LFPRs for the 16-to-24-year- old group 
and the 25-to-54-year- old group below pre- recession levels and the LFPRs for 
older individuals above pre- recession levels; for all of these groups, these 
outcomes are broadly consistent with multidecade trends before the recession.  
The secular decline in the LFPR for 16 -to-24-year- olds before the recession 
reflected primarily a rise in school enrollment and a decline in labor force 
participation among stud ents, while the decline for 25- to-54-year- olds partly 
reflected reduced demand for lower- skilled workers (due to, for example, 
globalization and automation) and rising disability rates .2 A return to pre-
recession levels for these groups seems unlikely because many of these factors 
have continued to exert some downward influence over the past decade and 
probably will continue to do so even in a tight labor market .3 Meanwhile, rising 
longevity and better health outcomes in the older age groups have helped p ush 
up their LFPRs for many decades before the recession, and some continuation of 
this trend seems likely. 
As for the unemployment rate, how might the labor market achieve an additional 
0.6 percentage point decline, as in the staff forecast? The dashed lines in figure 2 
show one possible combination of improvements to the job-finding rate out of 
unemployment and the job-separation rate into unemployment (modified to take 
into account flows into and out of the labor force; see the note in figure 2) that 
2 For the decline in labor force participation among 16-to-24-year -olds, see Teresa L. Morisi 
(2017), “Teen Labor Force Participation in the Great Recession and Beyond,” Monthly Labor 
Review , February , https://doi.org/10.21916/mlr.2017.5 ; for the decline among 25-to-54-year -olds,

http://www.nber.org/papers/w24333. 
3 If, instead, all of the improvement in the aggregate LFPR were to come from an increase 
in the LFPR for t he 25-to-54-year -old group, then the LFPR for this age group would have to rise 
another ½ percentage point, putting it close to its pre-recession level.

 together lead to a 3.2 percent unemployment rate in 2020:Q4.  In this scenario, 
we assume that the recent pace of improvement in  the job-finding and job -
separation rates roughly continues through 2020.  
Are these improvements in the job -finding and job -separation rates plausible?  
Because the job -finding rate is currently below the level seen during the late 
1990s, it seems likely that at least some of the adjustment will come from the job -
finding margin, as firms attempt to fill vacancies by relaxing job requirements 
and hiring standards , or offering training opportunities to less -qualified hires.  
Although the job -separation rate is already at a historic al low, this low level may 
reflect  structural as well cyclical factors .4  Moreover, in previous tight labor 
markets such as the late 1990s, falling separation rates contributed importantly 
to declines in unemployment.  We conclude that these improvements in job -
finding and job -separation rates are indeed plausible.  
 
          
                                                 
4 The declining labor force share of 16 -to-24-year -olds (who have a higher -than -average 
job-separation rate) and the rising labor force share of college- educated workers (who have a 
lower -than -average job -separation rate) have exerted downward pressure on sep aration rates 
over the past few decades and will likely continue doing so.

 We project that labor productivit y will increase a little more than 1 percent per 
year, on average, over the forecast period, a touch below our e stimate of its 
structural pace.  One possible constraint on productivity growth is the slow 
pace of business formation discussed in the box “Aggregate Impl ications of 
the Decline in Business Formation.” 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION 
With the CPI and PPI for August now in hand, we estimate that core PCE prices 
increased 1.9 percent over the  12 months ending in August, in line with our July 
Tealbook forecast and up substantia lly from 1.4 percent one yea r ago.  We expect core 
inflation will remain around 1.9 pe rcent through the end of the  year.  Total PCE prices 
are estimated to have increase d 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, boosted 
by increases in consumer energy p rices in August and earlier in  the year.  We expect the 
12-month change in total PCE pr ices to move down to 2.0 percent  in September and to 
remain there through the end of the year. 
 Our near-term projection for co re price inflation is little rev ised.  The PCE 
price data for July were a li ttle higher than expected, but the  CPI data for 
August were lower.  However, we ma de some small upward adjustme nts in 
response to tariff policy devel opments and the latest annual announcement of 
Medicare payment ra tes for hospitals.5 
 Core import prices increased at an average annual rate of 1½ percent in the 
first half of the year  but are expected to reverse that increas e over the second 
half as recent dollar appreciation and lower commodity prices r educe import 
prices.6  Thereafter, import price infl ation is expected to turn positi ve again, 
averaging ¾ percent from 2019 to 2021, consistent with moderate  foreign 
inflation and an only gradually appreciating dollar.   
5 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have proposed a  large increase in Medicare 
inpatient hospital payments for the fiscal year beginning in Oc tober that would result in a one-time increase 
in the level of prices and hence no lasting effect on the rate of inflation.  With regar d to import prices, U.S. 
tariffs have been implemented thi s year on a set of goods accounting for approximately $100 billion in 
imports in 2017.  Additional tariff  increases are currently und er consideration. 
6 Although the effective prices paid by purchasers of imported g oods will include the effects of 
tariffs, import price indexes are measured excluding tariffs. The contribution of the tariffs implemented so 
far this year to the rate of change in these effective prices o ver 2018:H2 is estimated to be at most 
1 percentage point at an annual rate.

 Crude oil and retail gasoline pric es have moved up somewhat faster than we 
projected in the July Tealbook, a nd we raised our PCE energy price forecast in 
the second half of the year in res ponse.  We anticipate consume r energy prices 
will rise 6.5 percent this year and then decline modestly over the next three 
years.  With regard to food prices , the incoming data have been  a bit weaker 
than expected.  We partially offs et the downward misses in ligh t of 
announcements of selected packag ed food and beverage price incr eases in 
response to increased tariffs  on steel and aluminum; overall, these effects are 
modest, and our food price inflati on forecast is little revised  in the medium 
term.7 
 Readings on longer-term  inflation expectations have changed lit tle since the 
July Tealbook and, on balance, sugges t that expectations remain  well 
anchored.  In the preliminary Sep tember report from the Univers ity of 
Michigan Surveys of Consumers, t he median of inflation expectations over 
the next 5 to 10 years was 2.4 percen t, within the narrow range occupied in 
recent years. 
We still project that core inflation will move up gradually to 2.1 percent in 2020 
and 2021, reflecting the upward pres sure on prices from elevated rates of resource 
utilization and an upward drift in  trend inflation.  Total PCE price inflation is projected to 
run slightly below core inflati on after this year, reflecting the declining path for consumer 
energy prices in the medium term.  As before, these projections  are predicated on our 
assumption that modest supply cons traints will give a slight bo ost to inflation over the 
next few years.  Our medium-te rm outlook for total and core PCE  price inflation is 
unchanged relative to the July Tealbook.   
We continue to forecast that str ong labor market conditions wil l bring about a 
further step-up in the gro wth of hourly compensation.  
 Average hourly earnings of all employees increased 2.9 percent over the 
12 months ending in August, above our July Tealbook expectation s, and the 
highest 12-month increase since 2009. 
7 Soda and beer producers, in particular, have announced price i ncreases in response to the rising 
cost of aluminum cans attributed to higher tariffs on aluminum imports.

 Aggregate Implications of the Decline in Business Formation  
The start-up rate of new businesses (the share of firms less than one year old) fell from about 
13 percent in the early 1980s to about 8 percent in 2015, according to the Business Dynamics 
Statistics (B
DS) data shown in figure 1.  In part, the decline appears to reflect a longer-run 
downward trend in business formations that can be partially attributed to demographic change.1  
Moreover, there was also a steep decline in start-ups during the financial crisis that has yet to be 
reversed:  The start- up rate declined more than 25 percent from 2006 to 2010, resulting in a 
“missing generation” of firms .2    
 
While start-ups i
n any given year account for only about 3 percent of aggregate employment, 
research suggests that changes in new business formation have had important consequences for 
employment, real GDP, and productivity growth over time.3  For example, state-level data from 
1980 to 2013 indicate that a 1 percent increase in the start-up rate is associated with a 
contemporaneous increase in real GDP per capita of about 0.1 percent that persists over time.   A 
25 percent declin
e in start-ups would thus lead to a 2.5 percent decline in real GDP per capita.4 
Similarly, metropolitan areas with larger declines in business formation during the recession had 
more gradual recoveries in employment, output, and wages from 2010 to 2014 (figure 2).5 
                                                 
1 See Fatih Karahan, Benjamin Pugsley, and Aysegul Sahin (2018), “Demographic Origins of the Startup 
Deficit, ” working paper, May. 
2 Start-ups, as well as young and small firms, were adversely affected by both the decline in aggregate 
demand and by a steep reduction in the supply of credit during the financial crisis.  See, for example, Michael 
Siemer (forthcoming), “ Employment Effects of Financial Constraints during the Great Recession ,” Review of 
Economics and Statistics.  
3 See, for example, Titan Alon, David Berger, Robert Dent, and Benjamin Pugsley (2018), “Older and Slower:  
The Startup Deficit’s Lasting Effects on Aggregate Productivity Growth,” Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 93 
(September), pp. 68 –85. 
4 See François Gourio, Todd Messer, and Michael Siemer (2016),  “Firm Entry and Macroeconomic Dynamics:  A 
State- Level Analysis,”  American Economic Review , vol. 106 (May), pp. 214 –18. 
5 The decline in business formation during the financial crisis predicts local employment per capita growth 
after the financial crisis even after controlling for a large number of other potential explanatory factors, such as 
the depth of the recession, the declines in house prices and small business lending during the recession, the

With respect to the aggregate implications of the decline in business formation, a preliminary 
estimate suggests that if business formation had remained at its 2007 level, then more than 
2 million additional jobs may have been created from 2010 to 2014.6  The intuition behind this 
finding is that start-ups tend to grow faster than older firms and thus contribute significantly to 
both gross and net job creation. 7  Therefore, a “missing generation” of start -ups can have a 
persistent negative effect on the economy.  Moreover, a new data set associated with recent 
research linking applications for employer identification numbers to future business formations 
suggests that business formation remained low through mid-2018.8 
Economic research regarding the importance of business formation for economic growth is 
relatively new and rapidly evolving.  Moreover, the above findings suggest that the lack of a 
substantial recovery in business formation may restrain future economic and productivity growth.  
What are the implications of the decline in business dynamism for monetary policymakers?  The 
trend decline in business formation may point to ongoing slow growth in potential output that, in 
turn, will be associated with a low longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate.  Whether 
business formation indeed remains low is therefore one key point of uncertainty regarding the 
future performance of the economy. 
                                                 
growth of the gig economy, and the size of new start-ups.  Data on business formation at the metropolitan area 
level from the BDS are only available until 2014.  
6 This partial-equilibrium estimate takes into account that other aforementioned factors may have affected 
the economic recovery.  The estimate does not take into account that, in the absence of the decline in business 
formation, other factors, such as wages and prices, would likely have adjusted.

 Compensation per hour (CPH) in the  business sector increased 3.3 percent 
over the year ending in the sec ond quarter, about three-tenths higher than we 
expected in the July Tealbook.  We  project that CPH will accele rate to a 
roughly 4 percent pace for 2019 through 2021.  (CPH was revised  appreciably 
higher from 2016 forward, reflecting the BEA’s comprehensive re vision in 
July.) 
 Over the four quarters ending in June, the ECI for private-sect or workers 
increased 2.9 percent.  Given its r elatively muted cyclical sen sitivity, the ECI 
is projected to accelerate less than the compensation per hour measure and to 
reach only 3.0 percent in  the medium term.  
 The July reading from the Federa l Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wag e Growth 
Tracker was 3.3 percent, within the  range seen in the past year . 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK 
 We have revised down our assumption about the natural rate of 
unemployment in the longer r un to 4.6 percent, in line with the revision to the 
natural rate in the medium term .  We continue to assume that po tential output 
growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the longer run. 
 We have maintained our assumption t hat the real equilibrium fed eral funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent.  Th e nominal yield on 
10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent in the  longer run.  
The term premium gradually ris es toward 90 basis points in the longer run, 
lifted in part by the elevate d level of federal debt. 
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is expected to be at a no rmal size and 
composition by mid-2021. 
 With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows to slightly above 1 percent from 2022 to 2024, as the federal funds rate is above its neutr al level and the 
boost to growth from fiscal policy fades.  The unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3½ percent at t he end of 2021 toward its assumed  natural rate

in subsequent years.  PCE price inflation remains close to 2.0 percent 
throughout. 
 With resource utilization cooli ng only slowly and inflation rem aining close to 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate moves 
down only gradually from the elev ated level of 5 percent at the  end of the 
medium term toward its l ong-run value of 2½ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
The outlook for the U.S. and foreign economies appears to be diverging following 
the more buoyant, synchronized global expansion that characterized the turn of the year.  
In the United States, a sizable and growing positive output gap is projected for most of 
the forecast period.  In contrast, the foreign output gap is proje cted to remain near zero 
over the forecast period, as foreign economic growth is projected to remain solid but only 
a bit above potential.  Moreover, since the start of this year, we have been revising down 
our outlook for growth abroad even as the U.S. outlook has strengthened.  Finally, in the 
face of a ratcheting up of financial stresses in emerging market economies (EMEs) and 
political uncertainties in Europe, downside risks to the foreign outlook have increased. 
We estimate that real GDP growth in th e EMEs will step up from a downwardly 
revised 1.6 percent in the second quarter to 3¼ percent in the third as export growth 
across the EMEs recover s from a temporary dip and as other temporary headwinds 
(including a nationwide truckers’ strike in Brazil) d issipate.  In the advanced foreign 
economies  (AFEs ), we estimate that growth will slow from 2.4 percent to 1¾ percent as 
Canadian and Japanese growth moderate from an unusually rapid pace.  All told, foreign 
GDP growth is projected to step up from 2.0 percent in the second quarter to 2½ percent 
in the third quarter, close to its potential rate. 
Continuing the trend of downward revisions to our foreign outlook, r ecent 
indicators suggest that t he third -quarter pickup will be somewhat weaker than anticipated 
in the July Tealbook, and we also marked down somewhat the foreign growth outlook 
over the next few quarters.  The revision reflects weaker -than-expected data in the EMEs 
as well as our view that heightened financial stresses will weigh on EME growth, 
especially in the more vulnerable economies where central banks are tighte ning monetary 
policy in response to capital flight or inflationary pressures .  The recent weak ening of 
EME currencies has bolstered AFE currencies on a trade -weighted basis, which led us to 
revise down AFE growth a touch in the near term . 
As discussed in the box “Financial Stresses  in Turkey and Argentina,” financial 
stresses have so far been concentrated in a few highly vulnerable EMEs; spillovers to less 
vulnerable EMEs have been relatively modest .  Accordingly, the effect of these stresses 
on our baseline projection of overall foreign growth has been small.  However, the recent

Financial Stresses in Turkey and Argentina

conditions in Europe, prospects for EMEs are coming under increasing investor scrutiny.  In particular, 
given already high domestic vulnerabilities, Turkey and Argentina experienced intense financial pressure 
over the intermeeting period.  In Turkey , credit spreads widen ed sharply , and the Turkish lira depreciated 
19 percent against the dollar from the time of the July FOMC meeting (panel 1 of the figure). In Argentina, 
despite an IMF program initiated in June , the Argentine peso f ell 31 percent against the dollar, and 
sovereign spreads widened (panel 2).  Th ough developments in the se countries were accompanied by 
some deterioration of financial conditions in other EMEs , they have been driven largely by homegrown 
problems , and our baseline view is that spillovers to other markets and to the U.S. economy will likely be 
limited. That said , downside risks of more widespread problems in the EMEs have decidedly increased . 
In Turkey, althoug h the proximate trigger was escalating tensions with the United States over Turkish 
prosecution of a U.S. pastor, recent market pressures reflect pronounced macroeconomic vulnerabilities.  
Overly stimulative monetary and lend ing policies have led to a credit -fueled overheating of the economy 
and have pushed up inflation to 18 percent, well above the central bank’s 5 percent target.  As of 2017 , the 
current account deficit had widened to about 6 percent of GDP , and short -term external debt had 
surpassed 20 percent of GDP .  Much of this external debt is owed by Turkish banks , which have relied on 
wholesale foreign -currency funding from abroad. Despite having off-balance- sheet currency hedges , 
banks are nonetheless exposed to default risk o n foreign -currency loans they extended to Turkish 
corporates.1 These loans, together with debt issued in international markets , have swollen foreign -
currency -denominated liabilities of Turkish nonfinancial corporations to nearly 40 percent of GDP . 
Against the background of President Erdoğ an’s stated preference for keeping interest rates low, t he 
central bank’s failure until very recently to tighten monetary policy appreciably in the face of rising 
inflation and financial turmoil intensified concerns about the economy . 
On September 13, 2018, the Turkish central bank acted more forcefully, raising its benchmark policy rate 
650 basis points, and the Turkish lira appreciated significantly following this move.  These developments 
could presage a more persistent improvement in investor sentiment.  However, Turkey’s problems run 
deep , and President Erdoğan adamantly opposes seeking IMF support.  As such, we see protracted 
financial stresses and recession in Turkey as likely .  
Argentina’s economy has also faltered , as a severe drought has exacerbated rising domestic 
macroeconomic imbalances . Despite the installment of President Macri’s market -friendly government in 
2015 , a high fiscal deficit partly monetized by the central bank , growing public external debt, a large 
current account deficit , and only gradual fiscal tightening in the face of very high inflation have led to a 
loss of investor confidence and capital outflows.  Unlike Turkish authorities, the Argentine government 
sought support from the I MF and is attempting to implement orthodox policies under th e program 
(including fiscal tightening).  Moreover, in light of the further slide in financial conditions since the 
program was agreed to, the Macri government has further tightened its fiscal target for the primary 
deficit to zero next year, and the central bank has sharply raised the policy rate. Nevertheless, the 
pressure on Argentine assets has abated only a little, given high sovereign indebtedness and Argentina’s 
1Default risk of domestic- currency loans, which are funded via swaps of external funds, pressures banks’ balance sheets. 
Rollover risk of short- term foreign -currency hedges adds to pressures on banks.

 bitter history with global financial markets.  As with Turkey, we see Argentina continuing to struggle, its 
situation complicated by the prospect of popular opposition to austerity ahead of next year’s elections.   
 
Financial conditions  in other vulnerable economies have also come under pressure.  For example, the 
currencies of Brazil, Ind ia, and South Africa have depreciated significantly in recent weeks.  However, 
investors still appear to be differentiating across EMEs in line with th eir relative macroeconomic 
vulnerabilities ( panel 3 ).  
Despite the grave outlook  for Turkey and Argentina, we see limited spillovers to the United States .  Direct 
exposures of U.S. financial institutions to the se countries are small, and the real- economy links are 
limited.  Combined, T urkey and Argentina account for about  1 percent of U.S. total exports ; U.S. banks’ 
exposures  to Turkey represent only 1½ percent of tier 1 capital, and their exposure to Argentina is 
negligible.  Some European banks have larger credit exposures  to Turkey ( panel 4 ), and European bank 
stocks have suffered as a consequence, but these exposures appear to be manageable.  
That said , there is some risk that in the context of global policy normalization, further deterioration in 
these two economies  or elsewhere could cause more widespread stress in  EMEs.  Were these 
developments to transpire, there could be significant adverse repercussions for the U.S. economy, as 
discussed in the “EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative s cenario.  Moreover, the instability  in 
Turkey  poses geopolitical risks.  A further worsening  in its relations with the West could damage the 
cooperation between the E uropean Union  and Turkey on  the more than 3  million Syrian refugee s Turkey 
has been hosting.  A potential flow of refugees to Europe could , in turn , intensify political divisions there.

financial market volatility could presage more dire outcomes, and downside risks have 
become more prominent .  First, rising global interest rates and heightened market focus 
on vulnerabilities in some EMEs (including sizable corporate debt burdens ) could trigger 
a sharper and more widespread deterioration of financial conditions.  This possibility is 
explored in our “EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section. Second, populist fiscal policies in Italy could further intensify 
concerns about Italian public debt sustainability, exerting greater drag on euro- area 
growth than anticipated in our baseline.  Third, with Brexit scheduled to occur in March 
2019, if British and European Union (EU) authorities fail to reach a deal, significant 
disruptions of European economic and financial market activity could result.  Finally, 
ongoing trade tensions could lead to much more widespread and sustained increases in 
trade barriers than  in our baseline, which incorporates only the relatively modest 
measures already implemented.  This possibility is discussed in the “Higher Trade Barriers” alternative scenario s. 
Although headline inflation is estimated to have risen in the third quarter across 
all major AFEs because of higher energy prices , underlying inflation remains quite 
subdued in the euro area and Japan .  With inflation expected to be noticeably  below 
target over the next few years, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of 
Japan (BOJ) are assumed to wait until late 2019 and late 2020, respectively, to begin 
raising policy rates. Even with core inflation projected to run slightly above 2 percent in 
their economies for some time , the Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Canada 
(BOC) are expected to normalize policy only slowly . 
In the EMEs, headline inflation is estimated to have stepped up to 4½ percent in 
the third quarter, reflecting higher energy prices in several countries and higher food 
prices in China and Mexico .  In response to rising i nflationary pressures, capital outflows, 
and currency depreciation, central banks in some vulnerable EMEs––including India, 
Indonesia, and the Philippi nes––tightened monetary policy , with central banks in crisis -
ravaged Argentina and Turkey raising their policy rates more sharply .  In contrast, in 
more resilient EMEs  such as South Korea and Taiwan, central banks have maintained 
highly accommodative policies , and we see them normalizing policy gradually. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Euro area.  Real GDP growth edged down from 1.6 percent in the first quarter to 
1.5 percent in the second.  Recent indicators, such as PMIs through August, suggest

that growth should remain around this pace in the third quarter.  We also see  growth 
continuing through 2021 at around 1½ percent, a touch faster than potential, as 
monetary policy remains highly accommodative.  This projection is slightly weaker 
than in the July Tealbook, largely reflecting the recent appreciation of the euro (on a 
trade- weighted basis) and higher oil prices.  We assume that periodic bouts of 
financial stress in Italy will continue to weigh on activity in that country and, to a 
lesser extent, other euro-area countries.  In August , inconsistent statements by senior 
Italian officials intensified concerns that the government will flout EU rules calling 
for fiscal consolidation.  In response, Italian government bond yield s rose sharply, 
prompting senior Italian officials to pledge to contain fiscal deficits .  The situation 
remains unsettled. 
We estimate that a surge in retail energy prices will boost headline inflation to 
2½ percent in the third quarter, while core inflation remains around 1¼ percent.  
Headline inflation should fall below 1½ percent next year, as energy prices stabilize, 
and then slowly edge up as resource slack is gradually eliminated. We continue to 
assume that the ECB will cease net asset purchases by year-end, wait until late 2019 
to begin raising its deposi t rate , and then increase it to ¼ percent by late 2021.   
• United Kingdom. Real GDP growth picked up to 1.5 percent in the second quarter 
from 0.9 percent in the first, driven by stronger domestic demand.  Incoming data–– 
such as July industrial output––suggest that growth should edge up to 1¾ percent  in 
the third quarter.  Brexit negotiations have yet to resolve several critical issues, 
intensifying fears that the United Kingdom will exit the EU in March 2019 with no 
deal in place.  Even so, we continue to assume that the United Kingdom and the EU 
will eventually reach an agreement  that will avoid major economic and financial 
disruptions.  With interest rates remaining low , U.K. growth  should stay slightly 
above its potential rate of 1½ percent over the forecast period .  
We project inflation to rise from 1.9 percent in the second quarter to 2½ percent in the 
third , reflecting  higher oil prices , and then to gradually edge down to 2 percent. With 
the unemployment rate down to a 43- year low , the BOE raised its policy rate 
¼ percentage point to ¾ percent in August.  We anticipate that the BOE will 
gradually raise its Bank R ate to 1¾  percent by the end of 2021, ¼ percentage point 
lower than assumed in July, owing to greater Brexit -related uncertainty.

• Canada. Supported by private consumption and especially exports, r eal GDP growth 
rebounded from 1.4 percent in the first quarter to 2.9 percent in the second.  That said, 
data through July indicate that exports have slowed even more sharply  than expected , 
suggesting that economic growth will moderate to 1¾ percent in the third quarter , 
½ percentage point lower than estimated in the July Tealbook.  Nevertheless, 
underlying gr owth momentum remains solid.  We see growth pick ing up to 
2¼ percent  in 2019 before declining  to 1¾ percent (our estimate of potential growth) 
in 2020 and 2021.  Of course, ongoing negotiations over NAFTA pose some 
uncertainty to this outlook. 
Inflation  should pick up to 3 percent this quarter from 1.1 percent in the second, 
reflecting idiosyncratic increases in some core prices as well as elevated retail energy 
inflation .  With oil prices projected to decline, inflation  should moderate to the 
BOC ’s target of 2 percent by late 2020.  Against this  background, the BOC is 
expected to raise its policy rate from 1½  percent to 1¾ percent in the fourth quarter , 
gradually increase it to 3 percent by mid -2020, and keep it there through 2021. 
• Japan.  Following a weather- related contraction at the start of the year, real GDP 
rebounded 3 percent in the second quarter, 1½ percentage point s higher than 
estimated in the July Tealbook, reflecting surprisingly strong private domestic 
demand.  However , more- recent data h ave been somewhat weak; for example, 
industrial production declined in July .  Accordingly, we see growth moderating to a 
range of ½ to 1 percent over the remainder of the forecast period , abstracting from 
substantial fluctuations in the second half of 2019 due to the consumption tax hike 
planned for October 2019. 
Inflation is expected to swing  from negative 2.3 percent in the second quarter to 
positive 1¼ percent in the third, partly reflecting fluctuations in food prices.  Core 
inflation is also projected to rise, but only to ¼ percent.  Going forward, we see 
headl ine inflation remaining near 1 percent  through 2021, as higher oil prices provide 
some boost in the near term and a tight economy slowly pushes up core inflation.  
With inflation well below target, we expect the BOJ to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance.  Although the BOJ signaled that it would allow the 10- year 
Japanese government bond yield to fluctuate a bit more around zero, we expect it to wait until the end of 2020 to lift that target range.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• China. We estimate that growth slowed from 6½ percent in the second quarter to 
about 6 percent in the third, as tighter credit conditions weighed on domestic demand.  
Recent data suggest that both retail sales and investment growth have slowed notably, with the latter reflecting a sharp deceleration of infrastructure investment amid 
increased scrutiny of off -balance -sheet local government spending.  In contrast, 
exports have so far remained relatively strong despite rising trade tensions with the 
United States.  G oing forward, we expect weakening external demand to be offset by 
more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, with real GDP growth remaining 
around 6 percent in 2019 and 2020.  With tariffs looming on a further $200 billion (and perhaps even more) of U.S. imports from China, and with China poised to 
retaliate with tariffs on $60 billion of imports from the United States, the threat of an 
escalation of trade hostilities remains a downside risk to our forecast.   
Inflation has been subdued, part ly because of past declines in food prices.  With food 
prices rebounding a nd higher oil prices passing through to gasoline prices, inflation 
should rise to 3¾ percent in the third quarter and then settle at 2½ percent by the end 
of the year. 
• Other Emerging Asia.  Growth slowed to a mere 2½ percent in the second quarter , 
primarily because of  payback from an unusually strong pace of 5½ percent in the first 
quarter .  The second -quarter outcome was well below our July Tealbook estimate, in 
part reflecting weak exports. This weakness, along with a smaller -than-anticipated 
pickup in the tech sector, suggests that third- quarter growth will recover a little less 
than we expected, to 3½ percent.  We expect growth to edg e up to 3¾ percent in 2019 
and 2020.  This projection is down slightly due to s omewhat tighter financial 
conditions—more so in India and Indonesia, where persistent current account deficits 
and other vulnerabilities have led to significant currency depreciation .  Although 
U.S.–China trade barr iers implemented to date should have a negligible effect on 
growth in other emerging Asian economies, an escalation of trade tensions is a clear 
downside risk. 
• Mexico. Mexican real GDP contracted 0.6 percent at an annual rate in the second 
quarter after g rowing at a 4 percent pace in the first quarter. Monthly indicators 
suggest that investment (especially residential investment) was particularly weak, and 
manufacturing e xports were surprisingly flat despite strong U.S. demand.  However,

more -recent data, including resilient manufacturing PMIs and surging c onsumer 
confidence, have been more upbeat .  Accordingly, we see growth moving up to nearly 
3 percent by mid -2019, supported by robust U.S. demand.  That said, because of the 
weak second -quarter data and  the recent tightening in financial conditions, we have 
marked down growth about ½ percentage point in the current quarter and by a touch 
over the medium term. 
Headline inflation moved up to nearly 5 percent on a 12 -month basis in August, 
boosted by rising food and energy prices .  Concerned that inflation has been 
persistently well above the 3 percent target, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) decided in 
August to maintain its policy rate at 7 ¾ percent , notwithstanding the weak second 
quarter .  As inflation returns to its target and concerns about capital flight moderate, 
the BOM is projected to begin easing monetary policy in mid -2019. 
• Brazil. Partly because of  the disruptions f rom the nationwide truckers’ strike  in May, 
the Brazilian economy grew at a tepid ¾ percent pace in the second quarter. 
Household demand was weak, investment dropped, and exports plummeted.  Recent 
data on industrial production and exports suggest that activity has since recovered 
from the strike .  Accordingly, we see growth rebounding in the third quarter and 
averaging nearly 2¾ percent in 2019.  Relative to the July Tealbook, we marked 
down growth over the next year in response to tighter financial conditions and greater 
political uncertainty related to the October presidential election. Uncertainty about 
prospects for Brazil is unusually high due to the pressing need for pension reform and 
grave doubts about the ability of any of the leading presidential candidat es to 
achieve it. 
We estimate that h eadline inflation jumped from 4.3 percent in the second quarter to 
6¼ percent in the third, reflecting currency depreciation and the lagged effects of 
disruptions from the truckers’ strike.  As th e transitory effects of the strike dissipate, 
we expect inflation to fall in the fourth quarter before settling a t 4¼ percent, the 
government’s inflation target, by early next year.  Despite elevated inflation, the 
central bank kept rates unchanged at 6½ percent at its August meeting, citing the 
weak economy and anchored inflation expectations.

 Financial Market Developments 
Nominal Treasury yields were li ttle changed, on net, over the i ntermeeting period, 
amid ongoing concerns about trade p olicy, negative developments  in some emerging 
market economies (EMEs), and domestic economic data releases th at were, on balance, 
slightly stronger than expecte d.  FOMC communications over the period were largely in 
line with expectations and appear to have had little effect on asset prices.  U.S. stock 
prices rose, buoyed in part by pos itive news about corporate ea rnings, while global equity 
indexes declined and the broad dollar index moved up.   
 A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability o f a 25 basis 
point rate hike at the Septembe r FOMC meeting inched up further  to near 
certainty, and the likelihood of an additional hike at the Dece mber meeting 
rose to about 75 percent.  
 Nominal Treasury yields were li ttle changed on net.  Changes in  inflation 
compensation were modest and mix ed, with carry-adjusted TIPS-im plied 
inflation compensation over th e next 5 years ticking up and 5-t o-10-year 
inflation compensation inching down.   
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 3 percent, whil e the VIX 
moved down a bit.  Credit spreads on both investment- and specu lative-grade 
corporate bonds were little changed, on net, and remained low. 
 The broad dollar index increased 1.5 percent, driven by appreci ation against 
EME currencies.  Broad measures  of EME equity prices declined a bout 
6 percent, led by significant str ess in some countries and cont inued 
uncertainty about trade polic y.  Concerns about Italy and Brexi t also weighed 
on major advanced foreign economy (AFE) equity price indexes, w hich 
declined 2 to 6 percent.   
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

investors are currently pricing in a 98 percent probability tha t the FOMC will raise the 
target range for the federal f unds rate 25 basis points at its September meeting and about 
a 75 percent probability of an additional hike at the December meeting.  The OIS-implied 
path of the federal funds rate, a djusted for term premiums usin g a staff model, continues 
to imply that an increase to taling roughly 50 basis points is e xpected between now and 
the end of the year. 
Evolving trade-related risks and other international developmen ts reportedly 
weighed somewhat on market sentim ent, especially in the early p art of the intermeeting 
period.  However, domestic economic  data releases came in a bit  above market 
expectations, on net, with the str onger-than-expected average h ourly earnings in the 
August employment report notab ly boosting nominal Treasury yiel ds.  On balance, the 
nominal Treasury yield curve was  little changed, with 2- and 10 -year yields increasing 8 
basis points and 1 basis point, respectively (see also the rela ted box “Will Pension Fund 
Demand for Long-Dated U.S. Treasury Securities Shift in Mid-Sep tember?”).  The 
spread between 10- and 2-year T reasury yields, a popular leadin g indicator of recessions, 
now stands a bit above the 20th pe rcentile of its distribution since 1971, while the near-
term forward spread—an arguably more precise gauge of the inter mediate-term 
outlook—stands near its 50th percentile.1  Uncertainty about short-  and long-term interest 
rates implied by interest rate derivatives remained close to th e lower end of its range over 
recent years. 
Changes in inflation compensati on over the intermeeting period were modest.  
TIPS-implied inflation compensa tion over the next 5 years ticked up, while 5-to-10-year 
inflation compensation fell a little on net. 
Broad U.S. equity price indexes  have risen about 3 percent, on net, since the 
August FOMC meeting, as positive news about corporate earnings and the domestic 
1 The near-term forward spread in this context is defined as the difference between the current 
implied forward rate on three-month Treasury bills six quarters from now and the current yield on a 
three-month Treasury bill.  For analysis of the information content of these spreads , see Eric Engstrom and 
Steven Sharpe (2018), “ (Don’t Fear) The Yiel d Curve,” FEDS Note s (Washington:  Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System, June 28), www.federalreserve.gov/econres/no tes/feds-notes/dont-fear-the-
yield-curve-20180628.htm .  
In a special question in the Sep tember Blue Chip Economic Indic ators survey, respondents were 
asked to assess whether they envision the yield curve inverting, defined as the spread between 10- and 
2-year Treasury yields falling be low zero.  Only 4 percent of r espondents reported that they expect an 
inversion during the remainder of this year, while 33 percent reported expecting such an outcome in 2019.

 Will Pension Fund Demand for Long‐Dated U.S. Treasury  
Securities  Shift  in Mid‐ September?   
Some recent financial market commentaries  have suggested  that, since the 
beginning  of this year, domestic pension funds  have increased  their holdings  of long‐
dated Treasury  securities,  putting downward  pressure  on long‐dated yields.  
Commentaries  have highlighted,  in particular,  U.S. corporations’  incentive  to 
increase contributions  to their pension  plans to take advantage  of deductions  based 
on last year’s 35 percent corporate tax  rate instead  of the 21 percent rate for 201 8 
under the new tax legislation.   Private pension funds can take  advantage of  this 
deduction until  8½ months after the end of their pension plan’s  fiscal year, which  
will be mid‐ September  for firms that follow a calendar ‐year plan.   Some 
commentaries  have further speculated  that when th e mid‐September  deadline 
passes, the flow effect from the increased  demand for Treasury  securities  may 
dissipate,  putting upward pressure  on long‐dated yields.  The  discussion  below 
argues that a material shift in pension fund  demand for longer‐dated Treasury  
securities  after mid‐ Septe mber seems unlikely to occur.  
First, available  indicators  do not suggest that demand for U.S. Treasury  securities  by 
pension funds  is presently  elevated.  Given a lack  of comprehensive and  timely data 
on pension fund  activity, financial market commentaries  frequently  use STRIPS 
(Separate  Trading of Regist ered Interest  and Principal  of Securities)  activity as a 
proxy to gauge pension fund  demand for U.S. Treasury  securities.1  The figure  shows 
that STRIPS activity did rise in the first half of the year, with  the total amount of 
STRIPS outstanding  increasing  in the first and second quarters.   However,  the figure 
                                                 
1 STRIPS are Treasury securities  where the coupon and principal payments  have been 
separated.   Pension  funds typically prefer  principal STRIPS because  they have no coupon payments  
and so are longer‐duration securities,  allowing  pension funds to better match their long‐duration 
liabilities.   STRIPS data are typically used when looking at pension fund dynamics  given the longer 
time lag for other available data on pension funds.

also shows that this activity has already decelerated in the third quarter, with 
monthly data (not shown) indicating a steady decline in activity since June. 
Consequently, this pattern does not suggest a current runup in pension fund 
demand for Treasury securities in the months leading up to the midSeptember 
deadline. 
Second, survey based estimates of pension fund contributions also indicate that 
corporate contributions thus far have not increased significantly in 2018, with some 
estimating that total contributions will be smaller than in 2017.2 Other long dated 
fixed income markets where pension funds are active have also not shown signs of 
increased demand. For example, while the Treasury yield curve has flattened, the 
curve for investment grade credit spreads has actually steepened this year. 
Even if the change in tax policy lowers demand for Treasury securities by pension 
funds after midSeptember, other important factors driving pension fund demand 
are likely to persist beyond midSeptember. First, outperformance of equities 
relative to fixed income typically leads pension funds to derisk and increasingly 
rebalance their portfolios into fixed income. This factor behind pension fund 
demand for Treasury securities is unlikely to change after September. Second, the 
variable premium that pension funds pay based on their level of underfunding has 
been increasing and is expected to increase further in the coming year.3 This factor 
is expected to continue to drive pension funds’ need to improve their funded status 
and demand high quality fixed income securities such as Treasury securities. 
In sum, it seems unlikely that any material shift in pension fund demand for Treasury 
securities will occur in midSeptember. Market pricing currently also does not show 
evidence of concerns of a potential increase in interest rate volatility in mid
September. More broadly, the factors highlighted in previous staff work as driving 
long dated yields—including changes in the estimated longer run neutral rate and 
the effect of central bank balance sheets on term premiums—are expected to 
persist.4 Nonetheless, the staff will continue to monitor pension fund demand and 
the potential effect on the Treasury yield curve. 
2 Estimates from a Pensions & Investments survey indicated total contributions for 2018 will be 
around $30 billion. Assuming effects similar to previous staff studies, demand for Treasury 
securities of this magnitude would imply a decline in term premiums of just a few basis points. 
3 Corporate pension funds are required to pay premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation (PBGC). The variable component of the premium is determined as a given percentage 
of a pension’s unfunded liabilities. This rate has increased from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent since 
2015 and is expected to increase further to 4.0 percent in 2019. For additional information on 
these factors, see Pooja Gupta, Monica Scheid, and Jason Warner (2018), “Pension Fund Demand 
for Fixed Income Products,” MarketSource (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 
May 8).

Causes and Potential Policy Implications,” by the staff at the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York, dated July 14, 2017.

economy outweighed negativ e international de velopments.  Stock prices increased for 
most sectors in the S&P 500 index, as the final group of second -quarter earnings reports 
came in strong and analysts’ earni ngs expectations for the rest  of the year, which 
typically weaken after a repor ting season, stayed firm.  Howeve r, concerns about 
prospects in EMEs—particularl y with respect to trade policy and  China—appeared to 
weigh on stocks in the energy sec tor, which fell notably, and t hose in the basic materials 
sector, which also declined.  T he VIX moved down a bit, on net,  and remains somewhat 
above the extremely low levels seen in late 2017. 
Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and specula tive-grade 
corporate bonds were little c hanged on net.  As a result, sprea ds of corporate bond yields 
over comparable-maturity Treasur y yields also were about unchan ged.  Overall, yields 
and spreads on corporate bonds remained at the low ends of thei r respective historical 
distributions.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS 
Since the August FOMC meeting, r isk sentiment in global financial markets 
deteriorated amid significant st ress in some EMEs, increased focus on the course of fiscal 
policy in Italy, and continued trade tensions.  Foreign economic data releases were 
generally in line with market ex pectations and did not material ly move foreign 
asset prices. 
The U.S. dollar appreciated 2.6 percent against EME currencies and was flat 
against AFE currencies, as trad e tensions and severe financial pressures on several EMEs 
weighed on broader risk sentiment.  Some of the largest contrib utors to the strengthening 
of the dollar were Latin American currencies.2  The Mexican peso depreciated 1 percent 
against the dollar despite a pr eliminary trade agreement betwee n the United States and 
Mexico.  Political developments a head of the Brazilian presiden tial election this fall 
weighed on Brazilian assets, and the real depreciated 12 percent agai nst the dollar.  The 
Chinese RMB was little changed as the authorities took measures  to contain depreciation.           
Turkey and Argentina experienced significant market pressure ov er the 
intermeeting period (see the box “Fi nancial Stresses in Turkey and Argentina” in the 
International Economic Developm ents and Outlook section).  Othe r EMEs with 
2 The 97 percent devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar against t he dollar accounted for nearly 
1 percentage point of the 2.6 percent appreciation of the dolla r against EME currencies.

macroeconomic vulnerabilities a nd reliance on external financing, such as South Africa,

Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly over the interme eting period.  
The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) ticked up from 1.91 per cent to 1.92 percent, 
narrowing its spread relative t o IOER to 3 basis points.  In th e triparty Treasury repo 
market, rates averaged 1.91 percen t, 16 basis points above the ON RRP rate and about 
unchanged from the previous int ermeeting period.  An elevated l evel of Treasury bills 
outstanding, following heavy issuan ce this summer, reportedly h as continued to put 
upward pressure on money market ra tes and reduced the attractiv eness of the Federal 
Reserve’s ON RRP facility.  Take-up at the facility averaged on ly $1.4 billion per day 
over the intermeeting period. 
Funding spreads in markets for unsecured short-term instruments  continued to 
retrace from their elevated level s seen earlier this year.  The  spread of overnight 
nonfinancial A2/P2 commercial paper (CP) to the EFFR, as well as spreads of one-month 
nonfinancial A2/P2 CP and three - and six-month negotiable certi ficates of deposit to OIS, 
edged down over the intermeeti ng period.  Assets under manageme nt at prime money 
market funds (MMFs) continued to move up but remained well belo w the levels that 
prevailed prior to the implementation of MMF reforms in 2016.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that financing conditions for 
businesses and households remained  supportive of economic activity.  Financing flows to 
business and households have been solid but moderated a bit in recent months.  C redit 
quality remained strong , on balance, although some signs of deterioration emerged. 
• Gross issuance of corporate bonds and banks’ extensions of C&I loans 
moderated in July and August.  In contrast, new -money leveraged loan 
issuance was robust.  
• Financing conditions for small businesses remained favorable, and credit 
demand among small business owners show ed signs of strengthening, albeit 
from a low base. 
• Mortgage credit remained widely available to most borrowers in recent 
months.  For borrowers with low credit scores, lending conditions continued 
to ease but remain somewhat tight.  G rowth of home- purchase m ortgages 
slowed , likely reflecting the run -up in mortgage rates earlier this year. 
• Consumer credit  continued to expand at a solid pace in recent months even as 
interest rates for credit cards and auto loans have continued to rise. 
• In this Tealbook, we also provide the staff’s assessment of changes  in 
financing conditions over the past year (see the box “How Have Business and 
Household Borrowing Conditions Changed over the P ast Year?”) .1 In sum, 
nonprice terms and standards appear to have eased  over the past year , at least 
partially offsetting the rise in interest rates during that time . 
1 Moreover, the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” discusses several publicly available financial 
conditions indexes, plus a new staff index that focuses specifically on nonfinancial firms, that all point 
toward an overall easing of financial conditions over the past two years.

How Have Business and Household Borrowing Conditions 
Changed over the Past Year? 
Since September 2017 , key interest rates for business and household borrowers 
have continued to increase, broadly in line with increases in the federal funds 
rate (table 1) . Borrowing conditions overall, however, have not tightened as 
much as these increases might suggest, in part because nonprice credit terms 
and standards across several categories of credit have eased. 
In the business sector, investor appetite for corporate debt has been supported 
by lower corporate tax rates and strong corporate earnings over the past year as 
well as generally strong corporate credit quality.  In addition, a rising short -term 
interest rate environment has particularly increased investor demand for 
floating -rate corporate debt.  This dynamic has contributed to an easing of 
corporate loan standards and terms, especially in the leveraged loan market, 
where “covenan t lite” loans are common and other terms have continued to 
ease (figure 1 ).  Partly in response to the increased competition from capital 
markets and other lenders, banks have eased terms and standards on C&I loans 
(figure 2 ).  
Indications of credit conditions easing over the past year are also apparent for 
small businesses.  The share of small business owners reporting that it is “easy” 
or “somewhat easy” to obtain credit over the past 12 months has been steadily 
trending upward ( figure 3). 
Nonprice terms and standards in commercial real estate (CRE) markets have also 
eased a bit.  A moderate net share of banks reported in the SLOOS that they have 
eased standards and terms on nonfarm nonresidential and multifamily CRE loans 
over the past year.  Banks cited increased competition from bank and nonbank 
lenders and an improved outlook for the sector as reasons for the easing.  In the

 CMBS market, the share of interest -only loans has increased ( figure 4), although 
underwriting on other dimensions has remained stable.   
Terms and standards have also eased in residential mortgage lending.  The 
maximum debt -service- to-income ratio available on mortgage loans for subprime 
borrowers, for example, has been easing steadily for the past several years 
(figure 5).  One factor contributing to the easing is that mortgage lenders face 
strong incentives to keep up the volume of originations in order to cover their high fixed costs.  The rise in interest rates has depressed  mortgage refinancing 
originations, so lenders have an incentive to ease terms so that more borrowers 
qualify.  Meanwhile, extremely low delinquency rates on mortgage loans may 
have also contributed to lender willingness  to ease mortgage standards 
and terms. 
In con trast, in credit card and auto lending markets, lender risk appetite for 
extending credit to subprime consumers appears to have diminished a bit, perhaps because of rising (though still low) delinquency rates among these 
consumers.  A significant net share of b anks reported in July 2018 that their 
standards on both subprime credit cards ( figure 6) and subprime auto loans were 
at the tighter end of the range of standards on such loans since 2005.  However, 
standards for prime borrowers in both markets appear broadly unchanged over 
the past year.

 Taken together, these indicators suggest that the effects of the rise in interest 
rates on broad financing conditions have been offset to some degree by an 
easing of terms and standards in many markets.1  While there is no definitive 
summary statistic  to characterize the aggregate net effect of rising rates and 
easing availability, the net effect of these developments on a given borrower 
may depend on that borrower’s characteristics.  A stylized fact in the academi c 
literature is that the borrowing decisions of those with easy access to credit are primarily governed by interest rates, whereas terms and standards have a larger 
effect on credit -constrained borrowers.  If so, given that interest rates are still 
low by historical standards, the increasing availability of credit in several markets may imply that credit conditions have eased, on net, for many credit -constrained 
borrowers.  
 
 
                                                 
1 This discussion assumes that an increase in interest rates represent s a tightening of 
financing conditions.   To the extent that interest rates have risen because firms’ expected 
returns on investment have increased, financing conditions are not necessarily tighter relativ e 
to productive opportunities.

BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Nonfinancial Corporations 
On balance, financing c onditions for large nonfinancial firms remained 
accommodative in recent months.  Demand for corporate borrowing appears to have 
declined, in part due to strong e arnings, rising rates, and seasonal factors.  In July and 
August, g ross issuance of corporate bonds was relatively weak, while C&I loan growth 
moderated.  An abundance of M&A activity drove new -money leveraged loan issuance 
higher, while  the run-up in spreads earlier this year reportedly led to significantly weaker 
refinancing issuance. 
Meanwhile, the pace of equity issuance through both initial and seasoned 
offerings was solid  in July but fell, due to seasonal factors, in August.  The volumes of 
announced and completed M&A deals in recent months continued their upward trend since the beginning of the year, with the value of completed deals reaching its highest 
level in three ye ars. Volumes of announced and completed share repurchases stayed near 
their respective all -time highs. 
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained strong over 
the intermeeting period, though some signs of deterioration emerged.  The aggregate 
KMV expected year-ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms rose in September because 
of an increase in firm liabilities and now stands near its historical median. Despite 
dipping slightly in August, t he six -month trailing bond default rate remained near its 
highest level in two years  and stayed above the median of its historical distribution . 
The reporting season for second -quarter corporate earnings drew to a close during 
the intermeeting period , with earnings per share for nearly all secto rs of the S&P 500 
showing strong gains .  Wall Street analysts project  robust growth in earnings for S&P 
500 companies over the next year . 
Small Businesses 
Financing conditions for small businesses remained favorable.  The supply of 
credit show ed signs of continued easing, as the share of respondents to the Wells Fargo 
Small Business Index reporting that it was “easy” or “somewhat easy” to obtain credit in 
the previous 12 months increased again in the latest data, although it remain ed below pre-
crisis levels. Loan originations, as measured by the three -month moving average of the 
Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index , were flat in July and remained

 Financial Conditions Indexes  
Over the past decade, market participants, academics, and policy institutions  have created an 
increasing number of financial conditions indexes (FCIs).1  These indexes  were developed for three 
main purposes :  to summarize overall financial market developments , to assess how monetary 
policy is transmitted to financial conditions , and  to gauge what financial conditions presage for 
future economic activity.  
 
The blue shaded region in f igure 1 displays the range of values over time across five publicly 
available FCIs , developed by Goldman Sachs ; Bloomberg ; and the Federal Reserve Banks of 
Chicago, Kansas City , and St. Louis .  The mean  of these indexes is plotted as the black line.2   
 Although they are based on different  number s and type s of financial variables, these indexes share 
broadly similar variation s, especially during periods of widespread financial market stress such as 
the financial crisis of 2007 –09.
3  They all point to a broad easing of financial conditions since 
December 2015, even as the FOMC  has gradually raised the federal funds rate from its lower bound.  
 The existing FCIs  are typically constructed by aggregating financial variables into one summary 
series using methods such as principal component analysis, weighted averages, and  dynamic factor 
models .
4  While these composite indexes  provide a useful summary of broad financial market 
movements, they share two main drawbacks when used to assess the link between financial  
 
                                                 
1 A partial list of widely used FCIs includes those developed by Goldman Sachs; Deutsche Bank ; Citi; Bloomberg ; 
IMF; OECD; and the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis.  
2 To facilitate the comparison, each index is normalized by subtracting its mean and then dividing by its 
standard deviation.  Values of the indexes above (below) zero indicate tighter  (looser) financial conditions  than on 
average.   An index value of 1.0 denotes financial conditions that are tighter than average by one standard deviation.  
3 The number of variables included in the FCIs ranges from 5 in the Goldman Sachs index to more th an 100 in 
the Chicago Fed index.  
4 For example, the highly watched GS -FCI is a weighted average of five financial variables (the federal funds 
rate, the 10 -year Treasury yield, the corporate BBB– Treasury yields spread, the S&P price-to- earnings ratio , and the 
broad value of the U .S. dollar), with weights chosen based on the effects of these variables on real GDP growth 
using a VAR model .

 markets, the real economy , and monetary policy.  First, the weights used to aggregate financial 
variables are typically determined by statistical methods  rather than justified by how these 
variables affect economic activity .  Second, these indexes do not differentiate between the various 
channels —such as the wealth channel, the credit condition channel, and the terms -of-trade 
channel —through which financial variables affect the real economy.  
 
In an attempt t o overcome these shortcomings , the staff recently developed an alternative index 
that is designed to measure financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations .  This index uses 
only information from firms’ stock returns and credit ratings.  Roughly speaking, it is constructed as 
the difference in equity returns between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings  above and just 
below investment grade.5  Due to credit market imperfections, speculative- grade firms are more 
sensitive to changes in overall financing conditions than comparable investment -grade firms .  To  
the extent that financing condition  risks are priced in the equity market, investment -grade firms 
can be expected to outp erform speculative- grade firms when financing conditions tighten, leading 
to a wider returns differential.   This alternative staff index has three main properties.  First, by focusing on the cost and availability 
of funding to nonfinancial corporations, this index captures a well- defined channel through which 
financial conditions affect the economy.  Second, it provides a clean measure of changes in 
financing conditions by comparing two groups of firms that mainly differ in their access to capital markets .  Third, it has better in -sample forecasting power for economic activity  than other available 
financial conditions indexes (not shown).
6 
 
As shown by the red line in figure 2, th e staff’s index exhibits countercyclical variations  and 
effectively captures several episodes of stress in the U.S. financial system.  I t co-moves  with the 
range of other FCIs , and, like the other FCIs, indicates that financing  conditions have eased 
since liftoff.   
 
                                                 
5 Technically, this index is calculated as the deviation from the long -run relation  between the systematic 
components of the cumulative log returns of the two portfolios.  The systematic components are derived from the 
Fama -French five -factor asset pricing model, augmented with the momentum and quality/junk factors.  
6 One important limitation  of this index is that it does not capture changes in financing conditions for private 
nonfinancial firms , financial institutions, or households .  Another limitation of this index is that firms in both groups 
are assumed to have similar exposure to nonfinancing conditions shocks.

well above year-earlier level s.  Although the demand for credit by small busines ses still 
appears weak relative to pre- crisis levels, the National Federation of Independent 
Business optimism index has moved higher in recent months, suggesting a further 
strengthening of small business credit demand in coming months.  While indicators o f 
recent small business loan performance remained strong, delinquency rates  on such loans 
have been rising slowly over the past several months.  
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate also remained  accommodative.  
Although CRE loan growth at banks moderated in July and August, issuance of CMBS 
was robust.  Market participants expect CMBS issuance to slow in the near term because 
of declines in both the volume of maturing pre- crisis -era loans that need to be refinanced 
and the volume of property acquisitions that require purchase loans.  CMBS spreads were 
little changed and remained near their post -crisis lows. 
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Over the intermeeting period, financing continued to be readily availabl e to 
municipalities.  Yields on 20-year municipal bonds increased slightly over the 
intermeeting period, as did their ratios over comparable- maturit y Treasury yields. Gross 
issuance of municipal bonds remained solid.  The credit quality of state and local governments improved in recent months, as the number of credit rating upgrades outpaced the number of downgrades.  T he recent agreement between Puerto Rico GO and 
COFINA bondholders over the division of future sales tax revenues resulted in a marked 
increase in the price of Puerto Rico’s benchmark GO bonds. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS 
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remain ed accommodative 
on balance.  F or borrowers with low credit scores, however, conditions remained 
somewhat tight despite continued easing , as the maximum debt- service- to-income ratio 
for residential mortgages for these borrowers continued to climb but remained well below 
pre-crisis levels .  Rates on 30 -year fixed -rate conforming mortgages rose a bit , on net, 
roughly in line with movements in yields on agency MBS.  Refinancing activity 
continued to be muted in recent months, and  the growth in purchase mortgage

originations slowed a bit relative to year-earlier levels , in part reflecting the notable 
increase in mortgage rates earlier this year. 
Consumer Credit 
On balance, financing c onditions were little changed in recent months and 
remained largely supportive of growth in household spending.  However, the supply of 
credit to consumers with subprime credit scores remained tight.  More broadly, although interest rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise, consumer credit expanded 
at a solid pace.
2  Conditions in the consumer ABS market remained favorable, with 
issuance remaining robust and spreads  holding at very low levels .

 Recent Auto Loan Growth at U.S. Credit Unions 
Auto lending has recovered strongly, on balance, since 2012.  Nominal 
outstanding loan balances rebounded from the ir post-crisis nadir of $700 billion 
to over $1.1 trillion in 2018:Q2.  This discussion highlights that auto loan growth at 
credit unions was particularly strong and persistent over this period, resulting in a 
notable expansion in credit unions’ share of the U.S. auto loan market .  The 
expansion of credit unions’ auto lending appears to be concentrated among 
borrowers with better credit scores and so does not appear to represent a 
loosening of lending standards. 
Over the past five years, the average annual growth of auto loans from credit 
unions was about 13 percent, more than that from depository institutions (about 
7 percent) and finance companies (about 3 percent).1  Moreover, although auto 
lending at ban
ks and finance companies has moderated over the past two years 
as interest rates gradually rose, growth at credit unions has remained strong 
(figure 1).   Indeed, had auto lending growth at credit unions been the same as 
that for oth
er types of lenders, total auto loans outstanding would currently be 
10 percent (about $120 billion) lower.    
Growth in auto lending within the credit union sector has been highly 
concentrated among the large st credit unions.  As shown in figure 2, median five-
year cumulative auto loan growth was merely 3 percent for credit unions in the 
bottom size quintile of the total assets distribution but was 80 percent for credit 
unions in the top size quintile.    
 
   
 
 
                                                 
1 As of July 2018, auto loan balances at depository institutions, credit unions, and finance 
companies were about $450 billion, $370 billion, and $300 billion, respectively.

 The number of auto loans originated by credit unions grew much faster than that 
of other types of lenders.  Loans originated to finance new car purchases rose 
80 percent over the past five years at credit unions but stayed about flat, on net, 
at banks and finance companies (figure 3).2  Over the same period, the average 
size of credit union
 auto loans rose 17 percent, about in line with other lenders.3   
As shown in fi
gure 4, the average credit score of new originations from credit 
unions increased appreciably while staying roughly flat at other lenders.4  Partly 
due to the h
igher average credit quality of their borrowers, credit union loans, on 
average, have lower interest rates than those from banks and finance companies .  
Moreover, even with borrower credit scores held constant, loans extended by 
credit unions tend to have a lower average interest rate (figure 5), potentially 
due, in part, to credit unions ’ stable deposit bases and their nonprofit status .  As 
a result, despite the larger amounts financed, the monthly payments of credit 
union auto loans are about the same as those of other lenders.5  Finally, despite 
the rapid expansion, delinquency rates o n credit union auto loans have remained 
low and stable in recent years (figure 6 ). 
 
                                                 
2 The analysis presented focuses on new-car loans, but the pattern is qualitatively similar 
for used car loans.   
3 As of 2018:Q2, the average size of credit union new-car loans was $33,000, higher than 
$31,000 for banks and $30,000 for finance companies.   
4 The lower percentiles of the distribution of credit scores of auto loans originated by 
credit unions also trended up, and the share of subprime loans at credit unions remained low. 
5 Credit union loans have longer average maturities, further lowering monthly payments.

Risks and Uncertainty 
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS 
We view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity over the next year 
or so as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used by the FOMC.  
In addition, we see the upside and downside risks around the projections for real GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate over that period a s being balanced.  On the upside, the underlying 
fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain strong bolst ered in part 
by the tax cuts enacted last year and readings on household and business sentiment generally 
continue to be upbeat.  Against this economic backdrop, spending and investment could expand 
faster than in the staff projection.  On the downside, foreign economic developments and trade 
policies could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S economic growth. 
Those overall assessments are consistent with the four-quarter-ahead estimates for GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate presented in the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk.” 
We are more concerned about recession risks during the period beyond the next year or 
so. In our baseline outlook, the economy is currently operating above potential and is projected 
to move further beyond its potential over the next two years.  If this assessment is correct, then 
we anticipate that a significant slowing in the pace of economic activity, along with a gradual 
increase in the unemployment rate, will be required in order to return the economy to a 
sustainable position in the longer run.  During the period of subpar growth, the economy will be 
more susceptible to negative shocks that could push it into recession.  Neither we nor anyone 
else will have clear insight as to the precise timing of when a recession will occur, but the period 
of adjustment back to sustainability will be a time of heightened risk.  
With regard to inflation, the staff still sees average uncertainty and balanced risks around 
the projection over the next year or so.  To the downside, longer-run inflation expectations 
relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may 
not edge up in the coming years. Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more 
than expected and put do wnward pressure on inflation. To the upside, with economic activity 
projected to move further above its potential, inflation could increase more than in the staff 
forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource 
utilization on inflation. In addition, a n unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade 
barriers could lead to higher inflation. These assessments are consistent with the statistical

estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast over the next year.  Of course, if the 
risks to the forecast for economic activity beyond a year or so are tilted to the downside, then the 
risks to the inflation projection would a lso tend to have a downward skew at that time. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario describes the macroeconomic 
consequences of an average recession assumed to start in 2021. In the second scenario, higher 
realized inflation destabilizes inflation expectations, whic h leads to persistently higher inflation 
and also slower output growth.  The third and fourth scenarios provide a comparison of two 
different possible causes for faster wage growth: labor supply constraints or faster productivity 
growth.  In the fifth scenario, we consider the possibility that financial turbulence in emerging 
market economies (EMEs) leads to sizable capital outflows and a stronger appreciation of the 
dollar.  Finally, the last two scenarios illustrate the effects of a widespread increase in trade 
barriers. In the sixth scenario, the central bank reacts to total inflation inclusive of the direct 
effect of the tariffs on import prices. In the seventh scenario, the central bank “sees through” the 
temporary effect of the tariffs on inflation. 
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of four staff models that embed different 
macroeconomic structures and dynamics. The first two scenarios are simulated with the FRB/US 
model; the third and fourth scenarios use a DSGE model developed by Gertler, Sala, and Tr igari; 
the fifth scenario uses the SIGMA model; and the last two scenario s use the GEMUS model.1 In 
all of the scenarios except the first one, the federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule 
as in the baseline. (The first scenario, which features a recession, allows for a more aggressive 
monetary policy response than would be prescribed by the baseline inertial Taylor rule.)  In 
addition, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline 
paths in all of the scenarios. 
1 The four models used are (1) FRB/US, which is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S. 
economy; (2) a calibrated New Keynesian DSGE model with search and matching frictions in the labor market 
similar to that described in Mark L. Gertler, Luca Sala, and Antonella Trigari (2008), An Estimated Monetary 
DSGE Model with Unemployment and Staggered Nominal Wage Bargaining,” Journal of Money, Credit and 
Banking, vol. 40 (8), pp. 1713 64; (3) SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicountry DSGE model; and (4) GEMUS , 
which is a simplified version of SIGMA that is better suited to analyze trade policy issues.

Recession [FRB/US] 
While the probability of a recession in the near future is small, the odds increase further 
out in the medium-term forecast, as the projected pace of economic activity moderates and the 
distribution of outcomes around the baseline becomes more dispersed. As reported in the box 
“Alternative View: A Strong but Precarious Expansion” from the June 2018 Tealbook, one 
empirical framework consulted by the staff suggests that the probability of a recession in the 
medium term is greater than 75 pe rcent by the end of 2020.2 This scenario assumes that adverse 
shocks to financial market spreads and household and business confidence materialize starting in 
mid-2021 and that these shocks are sufficient to generate a downturn similar in magnitude to the 
median recession over the past 50 years.  We also assume that monetary policymakers respond to 
sustained increases in the unemployment rate more aggressively than prescribed by the baseline 
rule, in line with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions. 
In this scenario, real GDP declines at the end of 2021 and begins to recover at the start of 
2023.  The unemployment rate peaks at 6 pe rcent by the beginning of 2023, an increase of 
2½ pe rcentage points from the start of the recession, similar to the median increase in the 
unemployment rate in recessions over the past five decades. With the lower level of resource 
utilization, inflation runs about ¼ percentage point below baseline, on a verage, b etween 2022 
and 2024.  Despite the sharp deterioration in economic conditions, the federal funds rate is 
sufficiently elevated at the onset of the recession that it does not quite reach its effective lower 
bound, although it does fall as low as ½ pe rcent in mid-2023. A similar deterioration in 
economic activity and inflation occurring two years earlier would result in the federal funds rate 
briefly reaching its effective lower bound. 
Inflation Fears [FRB/US] 
In recent years, private-sector expectations of future inflation have been formed in an 
environment mainly characterized by low and stable inflation, generally at or below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Considerable uncertainty surrounds how these expectations 
might revise if inflation were to run persistently and significantly above that objective.  In 
particular, an e xtended period of high inflation may cause long er-run inflation expectations to 
2 The model is a logistic regression estimating the probability of being in a recession, as defined by the 
NBER, at any time over the next four quarters. The explanatory variables in the regression include the term spread 
between the 10-year Treasury yield and the federal funds rate, the term premium on 10-year Treasury yields, the 
spread of triple-B-rated bonds over Treasury yields, and the staff’s judgmental output gap.

drift upward and also raise the perceived riskiness of no minal assets, thus increasing term 
premiums. 
In this scenario, we assume a steeper Phillips curve such that the tig ht economy leads to 
higher inflation than in the baseline projection, possibly as a result of nonlinearities in the 
relation between resource utilization and inflation. Moreover, we assume that, in forming their 
inflation expectations, households and businesses put more weight on recent inflation experience 
than in the baseline.  Additionally, in this environment of heightened inflation risk, Treasury 
term premiums rise persistently to a level about 1 percentage point above their baseline values. 
All told, inflation runs substantially above the Tealbook forecast for several years.  
Yields on Treasury securities and corporate bonds rise in response to the assumed increase in inflation risk premiums, causing GDP growth to be 1 percentage point slower than in the 
baseline by the end of 2019.  The unemployment rate increases slowly but steadily throughout 
the simulation, ending almost 1 percentage point above the baseline (though still only a little 
above its assumed sustainable level by the end of the simulation period). Because the baseline 
policy rule depends on the lagging four-quarter change in inflation, the monetary policy response 
to the shocks in this scenario is initially dominated by the lower level of economic activity rather 
than by the higher path of inflation so that the federal funds rate is slightly below baseline until 
mid-2022.  Beginning at the end of 2022, how ever, the higher inflation rate dominates, a nd the 
federal funds rate stays persistently 25 basis points above the baseline for the remainder of the 
simulation period as inflation is slowly brought back to the Committee’s objective. 
Faster Wage Growth, Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model] 
Recent data suggest that wages have been rising moderately.  While the pa ce of wage 
growth steps up in the medium-term forecast, wages could possibly accelerate more rapidly than 
we anticipate. In this scenario and the following one, we analyze two scenarios that feature 
significantly faster wage growth than in the baseline.  The path for wages in both scenarios is the 
same, but, because the underlying sources of the faster wage growth differ, economic outcomes 
and the monetary policy response also differ.3 In this scenario, the acceleration in wages is 
caused by tighter supply constraints in the labor market, while, in the ne xt scenario, the 
3 Both scenarios use the Gertler, Sala, and Trigari model. However, “Faster Wage Growth, Supply 
Constraints” uses a nonlinear version of the model in order to emphasize the nonlinear supply constraint, while the 
scenario “Faster Wage Growth, Higher Productivity” uses a linear version of the model.

acceleration in wages is caused by faster productivity growth and somewhat stronger 
aggregate demand. 
In the baseline, although the unemployment rate is persistently below the natural rate of 
unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consistent with the modest response of prices to 
economic activity seen in recent years.  However, the effects of supply constraints may not have 
been full y captured in the baseline projection.  In particular, when the unemployment rate is 
unusually low, filling a vacancy becomes increasingly difficult, which could imply a reduced 
pace of hiring and a substantially steeper rise in wages as the value to firms of a filled vacancy 
increases.  In this scenario, we illustrate these risks using simulations from a nonlinear New Keynesian model with costly search and matching frictions in the labor market.

With greater supply constraints, the unemployment rate continues to decline until the 
beginning of 2020 but by ¼ percentage point less than in the baseline projection, and this gap 
persists over the forecast horizon.  Wage growth is nearly 1 percentage point higher than in the 
baseline for the next two years before slowing such that the level of wages converges to the 
baseline by the end of the projection period.  However, GDP growth is close to the baseline throughout the projection as, in this model, more intense utilization of capital partially 
compensates for the reduction in labor input.  Because of higher recruiting costs and real wage 
growth well in excess of productivity growth, inflation is significantly higher and peaks at 
3 percent at the end of 2019.  Monetary policymakers are assumed to infer resource slack from 
the unemployment rate.  Nonetheless, the federal funds rate is slightly above the baseline, as the 
effect of higher inflation dominates the effect of the smaller unemployment rate gap. 
Faster Wage Growth, Higher Productivi ty [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model] 
In contrast to the previous scenario, in this scenario, we generate the same faster wage 
growth through sizable increases in multifactor productivity along with somewhat greater 
aggregate demand; as a result, the level of labor productivity is, on average, 1 percentage point 
higher than baseline for four years before returning slowly to the baseline. 
The boom in productivity growth unleashes a surge in economic activity. Real GDP 
growth rises sharply, cresting above 4 percent at the start of 2019, and the unemployment rate 
falls well below the baseline.  Because labor productivity growth exceeds real wage growth,

inflation is subdued, falling to 1½ percent by mid-2019.  With the decline in the unemployment 
rate, the federal funds rate exceeds the baseline for some time but converges back to the baseline 
by the end of the simulation period. 
EME Turbulence and Stronger Dollar [SIGMA] 
In our baseline, we continue to expect solid growth in most EMEs despite some recent 
increases in financial stresses.  Although Argentina and Turkey are in crisis, their weight in 
global finance and trade is very small; we do not expect their problems to affect the U.S. 
economy directly, a nd they are not likely to spill over materially to other EMEs.  Even so, other 
EMEs also harbor vulnerabilities, including high sovereign and private debt, which may be 
exacerbated by ongoing U.S. monetary policy normalization, especially if investor confidence is 
weakened by heightening geopolitical risks, rising trade tensions, or political uncertainties.  In 
this scenario, we assume that EMEs experience a broad-based deterioration of financial 
conditions that is accompanied by substantial capital outflows and currency depreciation, 
generating sizable adverse spillovers to the United States and advanced foreign economies.  
Specifically, this scenario assumes that declining confidence fuels an ongoing flight from 
EME assets, causing credit spreads to widen 125 basis points and EME currencies to depreciate 
sharply.  Flight- to-safety flows into dollar-denominated assets reduce the term premiums on U.S. 
Treasury securities 30 basis points and cause corporate bond spreads to rise 50 basis points both 
in the United States and in the advanced foreign economies, while the  broad real dollar 
appreciates 10 percent.  
Weaker foreign activity, the appreciation of the dollar, and tighter financial conditions 
restrain the pace of economic expansion in the United States.  U.S. GDP growth moderates to 
2 percent in 2019, about ½ percentage point less than in the baseline, and core PCE inflation runs 
only a little above 1½ percent.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the 
baseline. 
Higher Trade Barriers [GEMUS] 
The current process of widespread trade negotiations is unprecedented in the post World 
War II period, and it is difficult to predict the outcome.  Accordingly, beyond the measures 
already implemented, which should have a relatively limited effect on aggregate economic 
activity, we have not built any additional trade policy actions into our baseline outlook.  If the

process ultimately leads to lower trade barriers around the world, there could be significant 
positive effects on the United States and foreign economies.  Conversely, an outcome of 
widespread and sustained increases in trade barriers would likely entail sizable adverse effects.  
This scenario considers the latter possibility.  In particular, we assume that the United 
States increases tariffs on all non-oil imported goods 15 percentage points and that foreign 
economies impose a similar-sized increase in tariffs on U.S. exports.  Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies have little effect 
on the trade balance.  However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods depresses 
household spending while business spending declines, both as a result of the higher cost of 
imported capital goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing spreads to rise.  
In addition, we assume that productivity growth slows as a result of a shift in production to less 
efficient domestic firms and industries as well as a reduction in international competition that 
diminishes incentives to innovate. 
The tariff-driven rise in import prices causes core PCE inflation to surge temporarily to 
3¼ pe rcent in the first half of 2019.  Monetary policy initially reacts to the temporary run-up in 
inflation by tightening faster than in the baseline, with the federal funds rate rising to almost 
4 percent in early 2019. All told, these developments push the U.S. economy into a mild 
recession lasting until the end of 2019, and the unemployment rate rises to 4¼ percent. The 
federal funds rate moves below the baseline starting in 2020, as inflation returns close to baseline 
and the unemployment rate remains well above the baseline. 
We have limited experience with the large and broad-based increases in trade barriers 
contemplated in this scenario, and, accordingly, there is unusually large uncertainty around our 
estimates. The declines in productivity associated with higher trade barriers could show through 
to aggregate output either more slowly or more rapidly than indicated in the simulation. It is also 
possible that a prolonged period of trade tensions cause s declines in consumer and business 
confidence as well as further deterioration in financial market conditions. And, notably, the 
simulation does not take into account hard- to-model features including disruptions to global 
supply chains or the effects of policy uncertainty on business investment whic h might have an 
especially large effect on economic activity here and abroad.

Higher Trade Barriers with See-Through Monetary Policy [GEMUS] 
In the previous scenario, we assumed that monetary policy responds to the temporary 
surge in inflation caused by the higher tariffs by raising the federal funds rate.  This scenario 
considers the same hikes in U.S. and foreign tariffs as in the previous scenario but assumes 
instead that monetary policy “sees through” this short-lived rise in inflation and lowers the policy 
rate.  Specifically, we assume here that the policy rule responds to a different measure of 
inflation that nets out the direct effects of tariffs. 
In this case, the federal funds rate runs persistently below baseline in response to weaker 
economic activity and remains below 4 percent at the end of 2020. The more accommodative 
monetary policy response cushions the output decline enough to avoid a recession, with output 
growth bottoming out at about ½ percent in mid-2019, about ¾ percentage point above the 
previous scenario in which polic y does not see through the spike in inflation. Inflation jumps 
above 3¼ percent in mid-2019, just a little higher than in the previous scenario, and then falls just as sharply. 
The more accommodative policy response considered here attenuates the output decline 
considerably relative to the previous scenario without much effect on inflation.  Accordingly, 
the see-through policy would seem an appropriate response to a tariff hike.  However, the desirability of this strategy depends on firmly anchored inflation expectations and the pass-
through of cost shocks into inflation being relatively short lived.  If those conditions do not hold, 
then the alternative approach assumed in the previous scenario could be more attractive. In 
particular, inflation and inflation expectations might run persistently higher if the tariff hike leads 
workers to raise their wage demands or firms to raise their markups.  These effects might be 
intensified in a very tight labor market.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the 
change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy Strategies 
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  R esource utilization is projected to be a bit less tight 
in the near term , and inflation  is projected to be a touch highe r. Overall , these revisions 
imply that the prescriptions arising from most of the strategies are little changed from 
those in the previous Tealbook.  A special exhibit illustrates how policy prescriptions and 
macroeconomic outcomes under flexible price- level targeting (FPLT) depend on the 
reference date for the target path for the price level .  A second special exhibit provides 
updated estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run.  The revised 
historical NIPA data  and data over the first half of the year imply small upward revisions 
for most estimates  and somewha t larger ones in a couple of cases . 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES 
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule (also known as the 
“balanced approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993 ) rule, a first -difference rule, and  an FPLT 
rule.  These near -term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation , shown in the middle panels.1 The top and middle 
panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is 
constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2 
Relative to the July Tealbook, the staff projects resource utilization to be a bit less 
tight over the next 18 months and inflation to be a touch highe r. Because t he effects of 
these changes to the forecast mostly offset each other,  the prescriptions of all of the 
policy rules are little changed from the previous Tealbook. 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not 
feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding 
1 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of 
the output gap. 
2 Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here 
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.  The near -term prescriptions of the first -
difference rule, for which adjustments are gradual, essentially coincide with 
those of the Tealbook baseline. 
• Unlike the other rules and the Tealbook baseline policy, which call for raising 
the federal funds rate in the near term , the FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate 
the cumulative shortfall in the core PCE price index of about 2¼ percent since 
the end of 2011, prescribes setting the federal funds rate near the bottom of 
the current target range. 
A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL 
FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimate s of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines: the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2018 Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).3 In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used 
to generate an estimate of r*.4 This concept of r*, labeled  “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to 
the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting 
in the current quarter , would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that 
period.  This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real 
economy and does not take into account considerations such as  achieving the inflation 
objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate. 
• At 3.29 percent , the estimate of Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* in this 
quarter is 15 basis points below the corresponding va lue computed using the 
July Tealbook projection .  The downward revision reflects the fact that the 
staff has revised downward its projection for the output gap at the end of the 
12-quarter period . 
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a qua rterly frequency and assumed that, beyond 2020 (the 
final year reported in the June 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth and 
monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP. 
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap fro m the deviation of 
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer- run value. 
4 The staff implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model in preparing the 
July Tealbook. The SEP -consistent FRB /US r* continues to use the previous version of the model because 
of data compatibility limitations.

• At 1.80 percent, the SEP- consistent FRB/US r* is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook-consistent FRB /US r*.  The difference stems from the fact that the 
SEP-consistent projection has  output exceeding potential by a considerably 
smaller amount o ver the medium term than does the current  Tealbook 
forecast .  This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the 
median path for the real federal funds rate implied by the SEP projections 
averages almost 1 percent age point less than the corresponding path in the 
Tealbook. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS 
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the FPLT  rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.5 The 
simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and 
wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow  through on this 
commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy . 
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases ½ percentage 
point over the remainder of this year and rises, on average, 1 percentage point 
per year for the following t hree years, reaching  5 percent in the fourth quarter 
of 2021. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values through mid -2022.  This higher path is associated 
with only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10 -year Treasury yield than 
in the baseline until 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter , because t he 
Taylor (1 999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate 
beyond the period shown.  Because wage and price setting today is influenced 
by expected future outcomes in the FRB/US model , and because the Taylor 
(1999) rule calls for somewhat more accommodative policy later in the 
5 Because of the endogenous responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.

simulation, starting in the fourth quarter inflation is somewhat higher  than in 
the baseline projection.  The path for the unemployment rate lies above the 
Tealboo k baseline path over the next few years , but it subsequently lies below 
and takes a bit longer to return to its natural rate.6 
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate. Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to 
output exceeding its assumed potential level  over the projection period, t he 
prescriptions of this rule are lower than those of the Taylor (1999) rule over 
the period shown.  The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher 
than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years, but, s tarting in 2021, t he 
path for the federal funds rate falls below the baseline path for a sustained 
period.  As a result, inflation is higher, and the real 10- year Treasury yield is 
lower , than  their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.  The more 
accommodative conditions engender a more pronounced undershooting of the 
unemployment rate below its natural rate  beyond the medium term. 
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the fi rst-difference rule is 
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through 2020, but runs 
below the baseline path for some years thereafter.  The latter divergence 
occurs because the first -difference rule, which responds to the expected 
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the decline in the 
output gap that is projected beyond 2020.  The associated lower path of the federal funds rate an d the expectation of higher inflation in the future imply 
lower longer -term real interest rates  than in the Tealbook baseline.  Thus, the 
first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate that are 
lower, and outcomes for inflation that are higher, than  the corresponding 
outcomes in the Tealbook baseline projection. 
6 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this and the Taylor (1993) rule 
simulations, despite higher levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on t he assumption that 
price and wage setters perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond 
the next several years and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage 
setting decisions.  The box “L earning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results under a scenario in which price and wage 
setters lack such a perfect understanding.  In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non-inertial 
policy rule led to a significant decline in inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate at the start of the 
simulation in response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

• The FPLT  rule seeks to compensate for the cumulative shortfall , since the end 
of 2011, of core PCE inflation from an annual rate of 2 percent.   The FPLT 
rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate slightly below its third -quarter 
value in the Tealbook baseline projection until the first quarter of 2020 and 
maintaining a markedly slower pace of increases thereafter than in the 
Tealbook baseline.  This prescription generates a high er rate of inflation in 
coming years that eventually undoes  the 2¼ percent age point shortfall of the 
core PCE price index relative to a path that rises 2 percent per year since the 
end of 2011.  Because the simulation embeds the assumption s that 
policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that 
financial market participants , price setters, and wage setters correctly 
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the 
real 10 -year Treasury rate drops below the Tealbook baseline for the next six 
years .  The unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook 
baseline and all other simulations shown, dropping below 2½ percent in  2020. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT 
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specifications of the loss function.7 
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices ; such a 
constraint may improve economic outcomes.8 
The first t hree of the four optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for 
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline projection, for two reasons.  First, h igh 
levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up to its 
natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the unemployment rate 
does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the FRB/US model.  Second, 
because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the 
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Func tion” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations. 
8 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions that will not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

front -loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.  In practice, however , if the FOMC 
were to raise the real federal funds rate abruptly, wage and price setters and financial 
market participants could misinterpret p olicymakers’ intentions and may anticipate 
tighter monetary policy than policymakers envision, leadi ng to less benign 
macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.9 By contrast, the fourth optimal control 
policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels  not experienced since the 1950s.  
Such a development might likewise  entail outcomes different from those predicted by the 
simulations. 
• The first simulation, labeled “Equal wei ghts,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal  weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2  percent objective, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly 
higher than the Tealbook baseline path in order to temper the projected sizable 
undershooting of the unemployment rate below its natural rate over the next 
several years in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with 
the equal -weights loss function judge to be costly.10 The small p rojected 
deviations of inflation from 2 percent in the Tealbook baseline entail 
relatively small losses and so have little influence on optimal policy.  
Moreover, a relatively rapid closing of the unemployment gap generates only 
slightly lower inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the response of 
inflation to the level of resource utilization is small. 
• The second simulation , “Large weight on inflation gap,” is based on a loss 
function that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent that is five 
times larger than the specification  with equal weights but is otherwise 
identical to that specification. Even though policymakers attach larger losses 
to deviations of inflation from 2 percent, they nonetheless choose a federal 
funds rate path that results in inflation undershooting the inflation objective by 
more than under the baseline policy over the period shown, for two reasons.  
9 See note 6 for a related discussion in the case of simple policy rules. 
10 When we use the June 2018 SEP-consiste nt baseline as the underlying projection, the federal 
funds rate under the optimal control simulation w ith equal weights peaks at around 5½ percent, compared 
with about 8 percent under the Tealbook baseline.

First, policymakers seek to undo the modest but persistent overshoot of the 
inflation objective over the next decade, which they see as costly.  Second, 
policymakers continue to attach significant losses to the unemployment rate 
undershooting its natural rate.  On net, the federal funds rate path is only 
modestly less restrictive than under the equal-weights s pecification. 
• The third simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This simulated  policy seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even 
faster than under the equal -weight s specification. The federal funds rate soars 
to 11 percent by mid -2019 and then averages around 7½ percent from 2020 
through 2023. 
• The fourth simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss 
function is identical to the specification with equal weights when the 
unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path of 
the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path in the 
medium term; later in the 2020s it exceeds the policy paths implied by all 
other optimal control strategies and the Tealbook baseline (not shown).  With 
the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this more accommodative 
path for the policy rate because their desire to keep inflation close to 2 percent 
is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  T he tighter labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent 
than in the case of equal weights. Beyond the period shown, t he 
unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as 
policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization.

influences the policy rates prescriptions of FPLT rules and their associated economic 
outcomes.  We compare the results from simulations of two FPLT rules with those from 
an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule—the same rule used to construct the 
Tealbook baseline path for the federal funds rate—under both the Tealbook baseli ne 
projection and a demand- driven recession scenario. The first rule, “FPLT  (2011:Q4),” 
sets the reference date for the target path for the price level  to 2011:Q4, resulting in an 
initial price -level gap in 2018:Q4 of 2¼ percent.  The second rule, “FPLT (2017:Q4) ,” 
sets the reference date to 2017:Q4, implying a n initial price- level gap in 2018:Q4 of 
roughly zero.  For both FPLT rules, the coefficient on the unemployment gap is chosen to 
deliver the same marginal response to resource utilization as the inertial Taylor  (1999) 
rule and is almost double the size of the coefficient used in the “Flexible price- level 
targeting rule” shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations.” 
The simulations conditional on the Tealbook baseline projection are shown in the 
panels on the left. 
• Given the large initial price -level gap, the “FPLT  (2011:Q4)” rule prescribes a 
lower path of the federal funds rate than under the Tealbook baseline, leading 
to markedly lower unemployment and modestly higher inflation over the 
period shown.  Consequently, the price -level gap closes gradually; at the end 
of 2024 the price level is still 1 percent below the target path .11 
• The “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule leads to policy prescriptions and macroeconomic 
outcomes si milar to those associated with the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.12 In 
part, this result reflects the fact that this FPLT rule has the same marginal 
response to resource utilization as the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule.  Moreover, 
the price-level gaps in this FPLT rule and the deviations of inflation from 
2 percent in the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are very small over the period 
11 The “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule is less accommodative in these circumstances than the “Flexible 
price -level targeting rule” shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations .”  Both rules use the same 
reference date to define the price- level gap and have the same coefficient on that gap; however, under the 
“FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule, policymakers respond more strongly to an unemployment rate that is below the 
natural rate. 
12 The path of the federal funds rate under the “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule is below the Tealbook 
baseline projections in the near term but is higher further in the future.  The same is true for the real 10- year 
Treasury yield.  Because inflation is forward looking in the FRB/US model, the inflation rate under the 
“FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule is lower than und er the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.

shown.  Accordingly, the different price objectives in the two rules do not 
result in materially different policy prescriptions. 
The price -level gap inherited under the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule similarly affects 
the path of policy and macroeconomic outcomes under a moderate demand -driven 
recession scenario , as illustrated in the panels  on the right.13 
• Given the large inherited price- level gap, the “FPLT  (2011:Q4)” rule 
prescribes a much lower path for the federal funds rate than the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule in the recession scenario , as was the case in the previous 
scenario .14 The much lower path for the federal funds rate helps combat the 
recession by curbing the rise in the unemployment rate relative to the inertial 
Taylor  (1999) rule.  Inflation stays above 2 percent , causing the price -level 
gap to narrow , even during the recession . 
• By comparison, policymakers provide only slightly more stimulus to the 
economy under the “FPLT  (2017:Q4)”  rule than under the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule.  The path of the federal funds rate is initially higher under this 
FPLT rule but falls below the path under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule in the 
medi um term, reflecting policymakers’ promise to undo the shortfalls in 
inflation from 2  percent during the recession.  Price and wage setters 
anticipate this relatively accommodative period , and, as a result, inflation 
stays closer to 2  percent under the “FPL T (2017:Q4)”  rule than under the 
inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and the path of th e unemployment rate is 
slightly lower. 
• As our simulations illustrate, whether FPLT rules provide substantially more 
accommodation  in demand-driven recessions than rules such as the inertial 
Taylor  (1999) rule in which deviations from the inflation objective are 
“bygones” hinges  on the magnitude of the initial price -level gap.15 In 
13 The demand -driven recession scenario in the FRB/US model is constructed by subjecting the 
Tealbook baseline to a sequence of negative spending shocks starting in 2018:Q4 that raise the 
unemployment rate by close to th e median increase of past recessions.  In constructing this scenario, we 
assume that the federal funds rate is determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) rule. 
14 The federal funds rate remains positive under the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule throughout the 
simulati on. 
15 In a supply- driven recession, the price level would be higher than otherwise. Accordingly, the 
“FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule might prescribe tighter monetary policy than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule because 
the FPLT rule would promise to undo the positiv e price- level gap stemming from a period of above 
2 percent inflation caused by the negative supply shocks.

addition, the efficacy of an FPLT rule crucially depends on the public’s 
understanding of this polic y and the public’s belief s about policymakers’ 
commitment to this rule and , in particular, to the reference date. If the public 
does not expect  policymakers to eliminate  the price- level gap specified in the 
FPLT rule, the public will anticipate future policy to be tighter than 
otherwise.  Consequently, long- term interest rates would be higher , inhibiting 
policymakers’ ability to stabilize the economy. 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit, “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run,” updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the 
longer run, denoted rLR; this concept is the rate consistent with the economy operating at 
its potential once the trans itory effects of economic shocks have abated.  The top panel of 
the exhibit shows the range of historical values through 2018:Q2 for several model -based 
time-series estimates of rLR . 16  The estimates for 2018:Q2 range from ½ to 1¾ percent. 
Relative to the ir respective 2017:Q4 values reported in the March Tealbook , five of the 
measures increased by less than 20 basis points from  their 2017:Q4 levels.  The estimates 
from Laubach and Williams (2003) and Lubik and Matthes (2015) have risen by more 
than 50 basis points.  In the case of Laubach and Williams (2003), the increase is due to 
revisions in the historical NIPA data that have caused the current and past estimates of 
rLR to be higher, primarily because trend growth in real GDP, one of the factors 
determin ing rLR, is now estimated to be more variable.  In the case of Lubik and Matthes 
(2015), the increase reflects  the effect of including data through the first half of th is year. 
The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer- term forecasts of the real federal funds rate 
from selected sources. The Tealbook baseline assumption, at ½ percent , is below t he 
other measures , which range from 0.75 to 1.15 percent. That said , the Tealbook baseline 
assumption remains well within the uncertainty bands of most time-series estimates. 
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously. 
16 For a discussion of time -series estimates of rLR over history, see the Monetary Policy Strategies 
section of the October 2017 Tealbook.  See the appendix to this section f or sources.

Appendix 
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adher e to the policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doing so.  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies. 
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict a dherence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymake rs and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymak ers may face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION 
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section .  It also reports the expression for the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule ; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a small 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construct ion of the Tealbook baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t; for quarters prior to 
the projection pe riod under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic

policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent. In the case of t he flexible 
price -level targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables include an unemployment rate gap and a 
price gap.  The unemployment gap is defined as the difference between the unemployment rate, 
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 ∗ . The price gap is defined as 100 times the 
difference between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level 
path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ∗ .  The 2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index , and, 
subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡 ∗ is assumed to grow at a 2 percent annual rate. 
Simple Rules 
The first two rules in the table  were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price gap like the flexible price -level 
targeting ( FPLT ) rule have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1 An FPLT rule 
similar to the one above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014 ). 
Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES 
The “Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy R ules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the l ines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions that are

A MEDIUM-TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy R ules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines : 
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections ( SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-
consistent economic projection .2 This measure depends on a b road array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.3 The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations—that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP-
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US r* simulation, the r eal federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection , the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyo nd the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits. The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations an d are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, whi ch includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in t hat quarter; when the Tealbook i s published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
2 The staff implemented a number of technical adjustments to the FRB/US model ahead of the July 
2018 Tealbook. The SEP -consistent FRB/US r* continues to use the previous version of the model 
because of data compatibility limitations. 
3 For a discussion of the equilibrium real federal funds rates in the longer run and other concepts 
of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 , and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps 
(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  In the following e quation, the 
resulting loss function embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future using a 
quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽 0.9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕 � 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉 𝑇𝑇 
𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎 �𝜆𝜆𝜋𝜋 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 − 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)𝟐𝟐 + 𝜆𝜆𝑢𝑢,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏)𝟐𝟐 + 𝜆𝜆𝐿𝐿(𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉 − 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉−𝟏𝟏 )𝟐𝟐�. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the four 
specifications. 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a relatively large 
weigh t to inflation gaps. The third specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places 
almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4 The fourth specification, “Asymmetric 
weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the 
unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the 
unemployment rate falling below the natural rate. The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights. 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to

ensure a well -behaved numerical solution. Loss Functions

the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption that market 
participants and wage and pric e setters employ model-consistent expectations and conditional on 
the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken 
as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is 
assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as a binding commitment on 
policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a horizon that ends sufficiently far 
in the future so that extending the horizon further would not affect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits. 
FLEXIBLE PRICE-LEVEL TARGETING WITH ALTERNATIVE PRICE-LEVEL GAPS 
The FPLT rules  underlying the simulations shown in the special exhibit “Flexible Price-
Level Targeting with Alternative Price -Level Gaps” are of the form 
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 0.85𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1 + 0. 15(𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + (𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 − 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ∗) − 1.85(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 − 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡 ∗)). 
Under the “FPLT (2011:Q4)” rule, the 2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the 
core PCE price index , and, subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡 ∗ is assumed to grow at a 2 percent annual rate. Under 
the “FPLT (2017:Q4)” rule, the 2017:Q4 val ue of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 ∗ is set to the 2017:Q4 value of the core PCE 
price index, and, subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡 ∗ is assumed to grow at a 2 percent annual rate. We set the 
coefficient on the unemployment gap to -1.85, which would imply a coefficient of 1 on the output 
gap under the Okun’s law relationship assumed by the staff in constructing the projection . 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the exhibit “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch (2017); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, and 
Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); 
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2017); and Lubik and 
Matthes (2015).  For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data 
through 2018: Q2. Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they 
make use o f historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical movements 
can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies. 
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each 
model’s point estimate for 2018:Q2.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are 
specific to each study.  
The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 values from selected forecasters.  These values were 
obtained as follows:

    1. Annual values stated on a fiscal year basis. Quarterly values not seasonally adjusted.    2. Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.    3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial         offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
        the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)
        is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
