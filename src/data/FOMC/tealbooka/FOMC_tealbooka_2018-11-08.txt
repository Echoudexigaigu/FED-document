 Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data on economic activity that we have received in the past several weeks  
indicate that the economy is expanding solidly.  Real GDP appears on track to rise  
3 percent  for the year as a whole, bolstered by expansionary fiscal policy and financial 
conditions that remain generally supportive despite recent substantial declines in equity 
prices .  Meanwhile, the labor market tightened furth er in September , and we continue to 
expect robust job gains in coming months, with the unemployment rate edging  down to 
3.6 percent by the end of this year .  Overall, our assessment of the tightness of resource 
utilization  in the current quarter is not materially different from that in the September 
Tealbook.1 
Our medium- term forecast for GDP growth is somewhat lower than in the 
September Tealbook, primarily reflecting the recent declines in equity prices.  W e now 
expect the output gap to widen from 2½ percent currently to 3 percent in 2020 before dropping back—about ¼ percentage point narrower throughout the medium term than in 
the September Tealbook f orecast .  The path for the unemployment rate has 
correspondingly revised up slightly, bottoming out at 3.3 percent in 2020.  Apart from 
equity prices, other influences on the contour of real GDP are mostly similar to our 
previous projection.  In particular, while rising interest rates appear to be exerting a 
modest drag on economic activity to date —largely showing through in declining 
residential  investment—w e expect a more noticeable drag  on economic activity over the 
next few years as monetary policy tightens  further.  In addition, we expect the boost from 
fiscal policy to wane and recent trade polic y actions to restrain growth a little.  All told,  
real GDP growth is projected to slow steadily from 3 percent  this year  to 1½ percent 
in 2021.   
The 12-month change in core PCE prices is estimated to have been  1.9 percent  in 
September , and we forecast  it to remain around that level  through the end of this  year.  
Core PCE price inflation edges up to  2.0 percent  over the medium term, as labor and 
product markets tighten further.  Total PCE price inflation is projected to run slightly  
above core inflation through the end of this year and then to run a touch below it thereafter, as consumer energy prices  are forecast to  decline in the medium term.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts 
The October Tealbook projection for real GDP growth lies close to both the Blue 
Chip consensus forecast and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) median 
forecast for 2018; all three forecasts step down in 2019 and are within a narrow range.  
The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is in line with the others in 2018 and a touch 
below the Blue Chip consensus in 2019.  The staff projection for measures of price 
inflation are close to the Blue Chip consensus and SPF median forecasts in both 2018 
and 2019. 
    Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

  Compared with the September Tealbook projection, inflation is a little lower in the 
medium term,  as resource utilization is a bit less tight .   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
• The inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate t o step up about ¼ percentage point over the 
rest of this year, to increase 1½ percent age points next year, and to rise, on 
average, ½ perc entage point per year in 2020 and 2021, reaching nearly 
5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.  This trajectory is a little lower than the one in the September Teal book because of  the narrower  projected  
output gap .  
• The size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predictable decline in a manner consistent with the Committee’s public declarations. 
Other Interest Rates 
• The 10- year Treasury yield is projected to rise from an average of about 
3¼ percent in the current quarter to 4¼ perc ent by the end of 2021.  This  
projected path is similar to the one in the September Tealbook .  
o The federal funds rate rise s above the 10- year rate in the third quarter of 
2020, similar to the September Tealbook. 
• The path of the triple -B corporate bond yield is also similar to the one in the 
previous Tealbook, while t he 30- year fixed mortgage rate  has been revised up 
a bit over the next few quarters in response to recent market quotes.  Both interest rates are projected to rise significantly over the medium term.  
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
• Equity prices declined substantially  in recent weeks amid concerns about 
international trade policies , global growth, and potential interest rate 
increases.  Equity prices are now projected to end the year about 9 percent 
below the September Tealbook forecast .2  Beyond the current quarter, we 
                                                 
2 As we were finalizing the staff projection, stock market prices were quite volatile.  The quotes in 
this paragraph are based on the market close on Wednesday, October 24.

  expect  stock prices to edge up about ½ percent  per year , similar to our 
previous forecast .  Over the medium term, stock price appreciation is held 
down, because we judge equity valuations to be elevated  even after 
considering the recent price declines .  
• The latest housing market data have been softer than expected, and in 
response, we have marked down our house price projection.  We now expect house price increases to slow from 6 percent in 2017 to 4 percent this year , a 
larger deceleration than in the September Tealbook .  We also nudged down 
our forecast for house prices over the next three years  and expect the rise in 
house prices to moderate further, to a n average pace of  3 percent ; the 
slowdown reflects both the ongoing rise in mortgage rates and our assessment 
that house prices are modestly elevated relative to rents.  
Fiscal Policy 
• We assume that the expansionary fiscal policies enacted over the past year 
will continue through the medium term.3  Given  these policy assumptions , we 
still estimate that discretionary fiscal policy actions across all levels  of 
government will contr ibute a bit more than ½ perc entage point to the rate of 
growth in aggregate demand in both 2019 and 2020, exclusive of any 
multiplier e ffects and financial offsets .  This contribution eases to 
¼ percentage point in 2021.  
• We expect the federal budget deficit , which stood at 3½ percent  of GDP in 
fiscal year 2017 , to widen to 5¾ percent by  fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting 
recent  fiscal policy  actions and the effects of higher interest rates on debt 
service costs.   The box “Fiscal Policy and the State of  the Economy” provides 
some historical perspective on the size of recent and projected  deficits relative 
to the state of the b usiness cycle.  
o We continue to assume that, in the longer run, policymakers will gradually 
reduce deficits by an amount sufficient to stabilize the debt- to-GDP ratio .  
We expect this ratio to stabilize at around 105 percent  of GDP , 
                                                 
3 In particular, our forecast assumes that the current level of discretionary spendi ng will be 
maintained in real terms in fiscal years 2020 and 2021; realization of that forecast will require lifting the 
discretionary spending caps for those years, which would be consistent with fiscal policymaker actions in 
the recent past.

  20 percentage points higher than would have occurred in the absence of  
recent and projected policy actions.  We anticipate that this  increment to 
the debt- to-GDP ratio will push up the term premium on 10- year Treasury 
yields 50 basis points in the longer run.  
o In the near term , legislation to fund roughly one-fourth of federal 
discretionary spending for fiscal 2019 remains unresolved, and without 
furthe r action, current funding would expire in the first week of 
December.  The baseline projection continues to assume that  funding 
legislation will be enacted and  there will be no meaningful disruption of 
government operations.4 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar  
• Real GDP in the foreign economies is expected to grow 2½ percent in the 
second half of this year , similar to its first- half pace.  The projection for the 
second half is little changed relative to the September Tealbook, as weaker -
than-expected  third -quarter GDP growth in the emerging market economies  
was offset by stronger -than-expected growth in the advanced foreign 
economies.  For the remainder of the forecast period, we continue to project 
GDP growth abroad to be close to its potential pace of around 2¾ percent.   
• Since the September  Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has  appreciated 
¾ percent .  Over the forecast period, w e expect the broad real dollar to 
appreciate at an annual rate of about 1½ percent as market expectations for the 
federal f unds rate move up toward the staff ’s assumed path .  The downward 
revision to the staff’s federal funds path implies a little less dollar appreciation than in the September Tealbook, leaving our projection for the broad real dollar at the end of the forecas t horizon only a touch higher .  
Oil Prices 
• The spot price of Brent crude oil is down about $3 per barrel , on net, since the 
September Tealbook, closing most recently at $76 per barrel.  Brent prices 
rose to $86 per barrel on October 3, their highest level in four years, reflecting concerns about the effects of impending U.S. sanctions on Iranian exports.  
                                                 
4 A lapse in  appropriations that resulted in a short- term partial shutdown of the federal government 
would have only minor implications for the outlook.

 Fiscal  Policy and the State of the Economy  
The federal fiscal polic y assumptions  in the staff’s baseline forecast yield primary budget deficits 
that average just under 3 percent of GDP between fiscal year ( FY) 2018 and FY202 1.  Here we put  
these budget policies in historical perspective using  two different measures —the  cyclically 
adjusted primary  (CAP)  budget deficit and  the staff’s measure of  fiscal impetus.  During the 
FY2018 to FY2021 period, w e expect that fiscal policy will result in relatively large deficits and will 
provide a modest boost to aggregate demand, both of which —especially the former—are 
atypical relative to the state of the business cycle.  
The CAP deficit is often used to assess  the sustainability of budget polic ies.  The CAP deficit makes 
two adjustments  to the total federal deficit.  First, by focusing on the primary deficit , the CAP 
deficit excludes net interest payments  associated with servicing existing government debt.1  
Second, the CAP deficit removes the transitory effects of the business cycle by estimating what 
the primary deficit would be if output were at its potential level.2   
Figure 1 shows the historical relationship between the CAP deficit on the vertical axis and the 
output gap on the horizontal axis.  The  expected CAP deficit s for FY2018  to FY202 1 (red triangles) 
are outliers .  Historically, when the output gap has been as large as staff projections for FY2 018 to 
FY202 1, the CAP deficit has been considerably smaller (as in FY1966  to FY1968) or the government 
has run a CAP surplus  (as in FY1998 to FY2001).  The last time the CAP deficit was roughly as large 
as staff projections for FY2018  to FY202 1 was during the Great Recession, when the output gap 
was large and negative.   
 
Figure 1:  Cyclically Adjusted Primary Deficits and the Output Gap

1 Persistently b alancing  the primary deficit implies a stable debt -to-GDP ratio if the pace of nominal GDP 
growth is equal to the average nominal rate of interest on the debt.   
2 The cyclically adjusted measure removes the deficit effects of automatic  stabilizers (for example, lower 
taxes in response to reduced income s or higher income -support  payments triggered by a rise in unemployment) 
that operate when the economy is not at its potential level.  This measure does not remove the effects of 
discretionary fiscal policy actions that are in response to the business cycle, such as a reduction in tax rates during 
a recession.

Further, the staff project s that the CAP deficit will increase  while the output gap increases  
between FY2018 and FY2021 .  This pattern contrasts with the historical relationship, which , on 
average, implies t hat the CAP deficit decreases  when the output gap increases .3 
Growth in the CAP deficit beginning in FY2018 largely results from discretionary  fiscal policy 
actions , specifically tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and spending increases from 
the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA  2018) .  The staff forecast assumes that elevated spending levels 
from the BBA 2018  remain in place beyond FY2019, growing with inflation each year (even 
though, under current law, appropriations are set to return to lower levels at the end of FY2019 ).  
Figure 2 illustrates how these policies affect aggregate demand.  This figure shows fiscal impetus 
(FI), the first -round direct effect of discretionary fiscal policy actions on the growth of aggregate 
demand, on the vertical axis and  the output gap  on the horizontal axis .  The FI projections imply 
that discretionary fiscal policy  at the federal level will boost aggregate demand growth by 
roughly ½ percentage point  per year through FY2020  and then taper off in FY2021 when the tax 
and spending policies are fully phased in.   
Because FI is measured in terms of aggregate demand  growth , it is associated with changes in , 
rather than the level of, the CAP  deficit.  The magnitude of  FI depends in part on the type of fiscal 
policy  that drives the CAP deficit changes.  The increase in projected CAP deficits for FY2018  to 
FY2021  result s largely from the TCJA  tax cuts .  By comparison, historical CAP deficits in  years with 
a comparable output gap, such as FY1966 and FY1967 , resulted mainly from defense spending 
increases and growth in government transfers, which provide a relatively larger boost to 
aggregate demand  compared to tax decreases .4

      Source:  Staff estimates.  
                                                 
3 Excluding FY2009  to FY2011 (which, if included, would ma ke the relationship even more negative), a 
1 percentage point increase in the output gap is associated with a 0.15 percentage point reduction  in the CAP 
deficit .    
4 Although a  1 percentage point increase in defense purchases (as a percent of GDP) increases 
aggregate demand by 1  percentage point, we estimate that a similarly  sized tax cut will boost demand by only 
two -thirds that amount.

  More recently, prices retreated on reports of increasing production in Saudi 
Arabia, Russia, and the United States.  Farther -dated futures prices are about 
unchanged, with the Brent futures price for delivery in December 2021 at 
$68 per barrel.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
Our Tealbook projection has real GDP growth slowing from a n annual rate of 
3¼ percent in the first half of this  year to a still-solid 2¾ percent pace in the second half.  
The BEA’s advance estimate of GDP growth in the third quarter, which was released 
after the close of th is forecast, wa s 3.5 percent , 0.6 percentage point above our Tealbook 
estimate .  Consumer spending was  stronger than we had anticipated  while business fixed 
investment was weaker, leaving private domestic final purchases, or PDFP , close to our 
expectations.  However, government purchases and inventory investment were above our expectations .  Our preliminary assessment is that some of th e third -quarter GDP surprise 
will be reversed in the fourth quarter, leaving GDP growth in the second half just a little 
stronger than our Tealbook projection.
5  (The accompanying exhibits present  the 
Tealbook forecast  and do not reflect the third- quarter GDP data.)   
• We expect that Hurricanes Florence and Michael will leave essentially no 
imprint on GDP growth for the second half overall .  Daily retail sales data 
from First Data  suggest that  Hurricane Florence had a very small negative 
effect  (less than 5 basis points) on PCE growth in the third quarter ; the effect 
from Hurricane Michael appears even smaller.  The e ffects  of the hurricanes  
on industrial production are also likely to be small:  W e estimate that total IP 
growth for the second half will be held down by about 0.1 percent age point 
because of  the hurricanes, with some small manufacturing disruptions from 
Hurricane Florence and noticeable but short -lived disruptions to oil and 
natural gas production from Hurricane Michael.   
• Recent data on consumer spending continue to point to stronger PCE growth 
in the second half of this year than  in the first half .  Spen ding continues to be 
supported by the recent tax cuts, wealth gains from earlier increases in equity prices and home values, solid gains in labor income, and favorable consumer

next week.

  sentiment.   The box “Household Wealth and the Personal Saving Rate” 
discusses h ow the composition of household wealth may be  affect ing 
aggregate consumption.  
• The third- quarter data on business fixed investment were disappointing.  
Investment in equipment and intangibles slowed from its first- half pace, while  
investment in nonresidential structures—especially drilling  structures —
declined .  Nonetheless , we expect investment growth to pick back up in the 
fourth quarter, as we see investment continuing to be supported by solid 
business output growth, ample access to financing, still-upbeat readings on 
business sentiment, buoyant profit expectations, and the effects of last year’s tax cuts . 
• With rising mortgage interest rates weighing on the affordability of housing, residential investment appears on track to continue to decline modestly in the second half of the year.  Relative to the September Tealbook, we weakened our residential investment forecast for the rest of th is year and most of next 
year, because recent indicators of housing demand have been weaker than 
expected and mortgage rates over the next few quarters have revised up.  That 
said, we expect residential investment to flatten out next year, with the drag from mortgage interest rates roughly offset by demand for new construction driven by population growth, demographic changes, and a strong labor market . 
• Net exports are projected to subtract about 1 percentage point from GDP growth for the second half of this year after adding ½ percentage point in the 
first half .  The swing is  partly attributable to soy bean exports .  In addition, 
appreciation of the dollar this year has removed  some support to net exports.  
Compared with the September Tealbook, t he contribution from net exports to 
real GDP growth in the second half is about ½ percentage point more negative.  
• Manufacturing  production, which rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the 
third quarter, is expected to ease somewhat through the remainder of this year and early next year .  This deceleration mainly reflect s a step -down in motor 
vehicle production ( and the upstream effects on other manufacturers ).

 Household Wealth and the Personal Saving Rate  
The NIPA personal saving rate (left panel of figure 1) is now reported to have remained elevated 
over the past few years rather than falling back toward pre-recession levels, as was estimated 
prior to the recent BEA comprehensive revision .  The right panel of figure 1 shows why this 
persistently high saving rate may be a puzzle :  Growth of household wealth relative to incom e 
should be pushing the saving rate down.1  Here we explore whether trends in the composition 
and distribution of household wealth might currently be holding down aggregate consumption 
and raising the saving rate .  We focus on differences in borrowing and spending behavior across 
age and wealth groups as well as the extent to which net saving (or more importantly, net 
dissaving) in particular balance sheet categories has led to movements in the overall saving rate.  
The four net worth components we focus on are consumer credit, owner-occupied housing, 
retirement accounts, and the residual, labeled “other assets. ”  Consumer credit includes 
nonhousing liabilities such as credit card, vehicle, and student loans.  Owner-occupied housing 
wealth (or net housing) is the market value of housing less mortgage debt outstanding.  
Retirement accounts include traditional defined benefit pensions and account-type 401(k), 
403(b), and IRA plans.  The residual other assets are mostly closely held business es and financial 
assets like stocks and bonds that are held outside of retirement accounts.  
The evolving composition of wealth in the right panel of figure 1 is associated with a shifting 
distribution of wealth across types of households .  The Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances 
(SCF) finds that the share of wealth held by households with a head aged 55 or older increased 
from 53 percent in 1989 to 71 percent by 2016.  In addition, the share of wealth held by the top 
wealth quartile increased from 80 percent to 85 percent for both the young and old.2

 In order to shed light on movements in the saving rate over time , figure 2 presents annual 
changes in the different components of wealth from figure 1 after stripping out the relevant 
capital gains from each balance sheet category .   
Figure 2 shows that net saving in retirement accounts has fallen in the past decade, from about 
10 percent of disposable income in the 1980s and ’90s to less than 5 percent in recent years.  The 
downward trend in net retirement account saving is attributable to aging, as benefit payments 
and withdrawals are rising as a share of income, while new contributions relative to income are 
little changed.3  However, in recent years, the decline in net retirement saving has been mostly 
offset by increased saving in business and financial assets outside of retirement accounts, which 
are held even more disproportionately at the top of the wealth distribution.  If older and 
wealthier households are less likely to spend out of their wealth than the younger and less 
wealthy, this tendency may help explain why the saving rate has remained elevated despite 
overall rising wealth relative to income.  
Figure 2 also highlights the important role of housing in accounting for movements in the saving 
rate over the past two decades.  In the lead up to the financial crisis, NIPA saving dipped as 
households increased mortgage debt much more than they invested in new housing.  More 
recently, net saving in owner-occupied housing has moved up and hovered near zero, as net 
mortgage borrowing and net residential investment have both remained low.   
The pre-recession housing-related dissaving is generally associated with younger and less wealthy 
households.  Those families borrowed extensively against housing to finance consumption or to 
invest in more housing, and those behaviors have fundamentally changed in the past decade . 
Younger and less wealthy households now carry more consumer debt and are less likely to have 
enter ed into owning homes and stocks, and one downstream effect is that they have not benefited 
from the rebound in asset prices.4  Regardless of whether mortgage demand or supply has shifted, it 
is unlikely that we will return to the rates of housing dissaving observed in the pre-recession period.

3 The continued rise in retirement assets relative to income shown in figure 1 is increasingly due to capital 
gains and not retirement account saving in the conventional NIPA sense.

  Indicators of factory activity from the national and regional manufacturing 
surveys remain consistent with further gains in production.  
Over  the medium term, we  project that real GDP gr owth will slow roughly 
½ percentage point per year , from  3 percent this year to 1½ perc ent in 2021.  The gradual 
deceleration  primarily reflects the ongoing tightening of monetary policy and  waning 
fiscal impetus .   
• Real GDP growth in this forecast is revised down relative to the September 
Tealbook, mainly reflecting the effects of the lower paths of equity prices and 
house prices.  Partially offsetting these factors , net exports subtract less from 
real GDP relative to the September Tealbook projection.6  In addition, with 
the output gap topping out about ¼ percentage point below our previous 
projection, we now judge that supply constraints will not materially restrain output growth.
7   
• In this forecast, we  also incorporated the implications of the lates t round of 
tariffs on Chinese imports, which were put in place after the September Tealbook closed and were not included in our previous projection.
8  We 
expect that the cumulative effect of tariffs imposed this year will be to lower the level of real GDP by about 0.2 percent over the medium term and raise core PCE price inflation by less than 0.1 percentage point in each of 2018 and 2019.   
• We continue to assume that potential GDP growth will step up from 1.7 percent in 2018 to 1.9 percent in 2021, as structural productivity accelerates .  
• With the federal government expected to run historically large and rising deficits over the medium term, the national saving rate is  projected to trend 
                                                 
6 The revis ed contribution of net exports to GDP primarily reflects our updated assessment of the 
responsiveness of net exports to U.S. GDP, foreign GDP, and exchange rates.  
7 That said, if our expectations for aggregate demand were to become more optimistic in 
subse quent forecasts, we would likely build back in some small drag from supply constraints.  
8 On September 24, the United States implemented an additional 10 percent tariff on about 
$180 billion of Chinese imports.  In response, China imposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods 
and also began to implement some nontariff trade barriers.  We have not built into our forecast the 
additional 15  percentage points of tariffs on Chinese imports that the United States has announced would 
be imposed, in the absence of progress on trade negotiations, on January 1, 2019.

  downward.  Nevertheless, private domestic investment as a share of the 
economy is roughly flat over the medium term.  The widening gap between 
domestic investment and national saving is  financed by increased inflows of 
foreign capital.  
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
Labor market conditions tightened further in September, about in line with our 
expectations .9   
• According to the BLS, total nonfarm payrolls increased 134,000 in 
September —about 60,000 less than we had expected , with roughly half of the 
downward surprise l ikely due to disruptions from Hurricane Florence (which 
we had not incorporated into the September Tealbook forecast).  However, estimates of job gains in July and August were revised up , and payroll growth 
for the three months ending in September averaged 200,000 per month on a 
hurricane- adjusted basis, a little higher than in  our previous projection.  
Excluding the effect s of hurricanes, we continue to expect payroll gains to 
average about 190,000 per month this quarter, well above the pace that w e 
estimate is consistent with unchanged resource utilization .
10  
• Data that we analyze from the payroll processing firm ADP (see the exhibit 
“Labor Market Developments and Outlook (1)”) point to an average increase in private  payrolls over the three months ending in September of about 
240,000.  A state -space model , which combines the information from ADP 
and the BLS, estimates average monthly private job gains of 210,000 over the past three months.  
• The unemployment rate edged down to 3.7 percent in September, slightly lower than we had expected.  Because the decline in the unemployment rate was largely due to an increase in the job finding rate, which tends to have some persistent influence on the unemployment rate , we nudged down our 
                                                 
9 The employment report for October will be released on November 2, the Friday before the 
FOMC meeting. 
10 We estimate that Hurricane Florence depressed job gains in September by 40,000, and that 
Hurricane Michael will depress job gains in October by 25,000.  After accounting for the employment 
bounceback in the months after each storm, we expect that the hurricanes will have no net effect on job 
gains in October and that they will boost job gains by 40,000 in November.

  forecast for the unemployment rate through the rest of the year.  We now 
expect it to average 3.6  percent this quarter,  1 percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate.   
• The labor force participation rate (LFP R) was 62.7 percent in September, the 
same as in August, whereas we had expected it to edge up 0.1 percentage 
point .  However, we are reluctant to take much signal from surprises in the 
LFPR during the summer months and expect it to move back to 62.8 perce nt 
for the fourth quarter—the same level it has fluctuated around for the past few 
years  and currently ¼ percentage point above our estimate of its trend.  With 
offsetting misses to the unemployment rate and LFPR, the employment- to-
population ratio in Sept ember came in at 60.4  percent, the same as in our 
September Tealbook forecast. 
We continue to expect the labor market to  tighten further over the medium term, 
consistent with above-trend output growth .  Relative to the September Tealbook, job 
gains are a little slower , the unemployment rate is a touch higher, and the LFPR is a bit 
lower, with these revisions reflecting the slightly slower pace of GDP growth in this 
projection.  As in previous projections, w e continue to assume that, in an extremely tight 
labor market, a larger -than-usual amount of the tightening in labor utilization will 
manifest in a higher LFPR and a smaller -than-usual amount in a lower 
unemployment rate.   
• Average monthly total payroll gains slow gradually in the projection, from about 195,000 in the second half of this year to about 80,000 in 2021.   
• The unemployment rate is projected to decline from 3.6  percent in the fourth 
quarter to 3.3 percent by the middle of next year.  The unemployment rate 
starts to turn up in 2021 and ends that  year at 3.4 percent —still 1¼  percentage 
points below its natural rate.    
• The LFPR  is projected  to remain at 62.8 percent through the end  of 2020 and 
then gradually decline.  With the trend participation rate expected to continue declining about 0.2 percentage point per year, we project that the LFPR gap 
will widen from ¼ perc entage point at the end of 2018 to ½ percent age point 
in 2020 and narrow thereafter .

  • We project that labor productivity will increase a little more than 1  percent per 
year, on average, over the forecast period, ¼ percentage point below our 
estimate of its structural pace .   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Based on our translation of the September CPI and PPI data, we estimate that core 
PCE prices increased 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in September, and that total 
PCE prices increased 2.0 percent.  Both estimates are as we had expected in the September Tealbook and continue to indicate that inflation has firmed somewhat relative 
to a year ago.  We continue to forec ast both 12-month changes to  remain near their 
current levels through the end of this year, about the same as in our September Tealbook 
forecast .  
• Core import prices are expected to decline 1 ¾ percent in the second half of 
2018, reversing their increase in  the first half.  The second- half decline 
reflects dollar appreciation and lower commodity price s.  Beyond this year , 
import price inflation is expected to run at a ¾  percent pace, consistent with 
moderate foreign inflation and a gradually appreciating dollar.   
o These published import price indexes exclude t ariffs .  However, tariffs add 
to the prices that purchasers of imports actually pay— that is,  effective 
import price s.  We estimate that the tariffs implemented so far this year 
will boost effective import price inflation  by 1½ percentage point s in 2018 
and ½ percentage point in 2019. 
The latest readings on survey - and market -based measures of longer- term 
inflation expectations have been mixed since the September Tealbook but appear  
consistent, on balance, with expectations remain ing relatively well anchored.  
• In the final October report from the University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers, the median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years 
was 2. 4 percent, near the bottom of the range seen in recent years.
  
• In contrast, the September reading on median three- year-ahead expected 
inflation from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was 3.0 percent, at the high end of recent readings.

  • Meanwhile, TIPS -based measures of inflation compensation have changed  
little since the September Tealbook . 
We project that core inflation will edge  up to 2.0 percent over the next year or so  
and remain at  that level through 2021.  The projected increase pr imarily reflect s further 
tightening in resource utilization and our small assumed  upward drift in trend inflation.  
Total inflation is projected to run slightly below core inflation after this year, reflecting 
the declining path for consumer energy prices in the medium term .  Relative to the 
September Tealbook forecast, both total and core inflation are a little lower in the 
medium term, because resource utilization is a little less tight.  Offsetting these revisions somewhat, the additional tariffs put in place since the September Tealbook push up inflation a little  this year and next . 
With labor demand remaining strong, we continue to expect that the pace of 
increases in hourly compensation will move up through the medium term, as firms try to 
retain workers and fill job vacancies in part by raising wages and benefits.   
• Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in September, a bit higher than we projected in the September Tealbook, with the upward surprise likely attributable to distortions from Hurricane Florence.
11  
After adjusting measured wages for the estimated effects of all hurricanes this 
year and last, we continue to think the 12-month change in average hourly earnings from September to December will be flat at 2.9 percent.  However, 
we project that  the measured  12-month change to  October and November will 
be distorted by hurricanes Florence and Michael .
  
• We estimate that the year -over- year change in compensation per hour (CPH) 
in the business sector will be 2¾ percent in the third quarter and step up to 3¼ percent in the fourth and first quarters , a slightly  faster pace than in the 
September Tealbook.  We continue to project that CPH will accelerate to a roughly 4 percent rate f rom 2019 through 2021.  
                                                 
11 We think that hurricane -related declines in employment tend to boost measured wages  because 
these employment distortions are likely to be co ncentrated in industries with a relatively large number of 
low-paid hourly workers, such as leisure and hospitality.

  • We have not received any new information on the ECI since the September 
Tealbook.12  Given the ECI’s  relatively muted cyclical sensitivity , we 
continue to expect it to accelerate somewhat from its recent 2½ to 2¾ percent pace to a 3 percent pace later in th e medium  term .  
• The September  reading of the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker came in at 
3.5 percent, near the upper end of the range seen over recent years . 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will be 4.6 percent and that potential output growth will be 1.7 percent per year in the longer run.  
• We have maintained our assumption that the real equilibrium federal funds rate in the longer run will be ½ percent.  The nominal yield on 10- year 
Treasury securities i s assumed to be 3.4 percent ; the term premium gradually 
rises toward 90 basis points, lifted in part by the elevated level of federal debt. 
• We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to put downward pressure on longer- term in terest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portfolio is expected to be at a normal size  by 
mid-2021. 
• With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows to about 1¼ percent from 2022 to 2024, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level and the boost 
to growth from fiscal policy fades.  The unemployment rate moves up 
gradually from 3½ percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural rate in subsequent years.  PCE price inflation remains close to 2 percent throughout the project ion. 
• With resource utilization cooling only slowly and inflation remaining close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate moves down only gradually from its  elevated level at the end of the medium term 
toward its long-run value of 2½ percent. 
                                                 
12 The ECI for September will be released on October 31.

International Economic Developments and Outlook 
Our foreign outlook continues to be positive despite a plethora of downside risks.  
Economic growth abroad remains solid, picking up to an estimated 2 ½ percent at an 
annual rate in the third quarter a fter dipping to 2 percent in the second.  Indicators 
suggest a notable pickup in Latin America, notwithstanding continued stress in 
Argentina, with Mexico reversing its second -quarter contraction and Brazil rebounding 
from a nationwide truckers’ strike .  Conversely, growth slowed in China, and we estimate 
that it moderated in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) from an  unusually strong 
second quarter, largely reflecting a return to a more sustainable pace in Canada 
and Japan. 
We see foreign growth remaining near 2½ percent over the forecast period, about 
in line with its potential.  Overall, our forecast is little changed  from the September 
Tealbook, as  a small upward revision to the AFEs in the near term was mostly offset by a 
small downward revision to the emerging market economies ( EMEs ), including China.  
Against the background of nearly closed output gaps, inflation has been picking 
up around the world.  However, m ost of the rise in headline inflation is due to higher oil 
prices, which hit their highest level in four years before retracing some in recent weeks .  
In the AFE s, aggregate four- quarter inflation rose to 2 percent in the third quarter, but 
core inflation  only edged up to 1.2 percent. Moreover, there is substantial variation 
across the AFEs, with core inflation running close to the 2 percent targeted by central 
banks in the United Kingdom and Canada and lingering a t much lower rates in the euro 
area and Japan. Inflation also rose in the EMEs , reflecting higher energy prices, past 
currency depreciation s, and a surge in food prices in China. 
With inflation picking up and financial pressures increas ing in EMEs , several 
EME central banks  have tightened monetary policy in recent months.  In Argentina, 
interest rates rose to over 70 percent after the central bank , under a revised program with 
the IMF, switched to a monetary targeting regime with a 0 percent money growth target.  
And central banks in Chile, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, and Turkey have all 
raised policy rates .  We generally expect most EMEs to tighten monetary policy further 
over the forecast period, albeit at a measured pace, as U.S. monetary policy normalization 
continues and global financial conditions tighten .  In the AFEs, monetary policy 
normalization promises to be very slow in the face of relatively subdued inflationary

pressures, uncertainties about the outlook, and headwinds that likely continue to weigh on 
r*’s.  Our assumptions about monetary policy in the AFEs are little changed, and even at 
the end of the forecast period, we see policy rates at levels well below historical values. 
The prominent risks we highlighted in September are still on our radar .  First, 
financial distresses in EMEs —which have largely been confined to Argentina and Turkey 
thus far and have left only a small imprint on our baseline forecast—could become more 
widespread , perhaps triggered by problems in China or rising global interest rates .  The 
consequences of such an outcome are described in our “ EME Financial Turbulence” 
alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.  Second, 
negotiations over the Italian budget and Brexit, which have not gone well of late, could 
fall apart and exert a greater drag in Europe than the still relatively modest effects 
currently built into our baseline.  Third, tensions over trade policy could intensify and 
lead to greater disruptions to global trade than we are currently assuming. Fourth, higher-
than-expected inflation  in the United S tates and abroad, perhaps triggered by a rise in oil 
prices, could push up interest rates around the world .  This risk is dis cussed in our 
“Inflation -Driven Global Tightening ” alternative scenario .  Finally, although the equity 
declines registered abroad of l ate—which in part reflect concerns about the risks just 
discussed —have not been large enough to weigh much on the foreign outlook, a more 
substantial global market correction obviously would have more adverse effects. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES 
• Euro area.  Available indicators, such as industrial production through August, 
suggest that economic activity slowed from an upwardly revised 1.8 percent in the 
second quarter to a still-solid 1½ percent in the third.  In Italy, financial tensions increased after the government presented its budget proposal for 2019.  Th e targeted 
deficit is significantly wider than  previously a greed  with the European Commission, 
reinforc ing concerns about the sustainability of Italian public finances and straining 
the country’s relations with the European Union.  With rising financial tensions 
around Italy  and PMIs declining noticeably in October , we project growth in the eu ro 
area to slow a bit further to 1¼ percent in the first half of 2019.  Thereafter, we expect 
growth to edge up  to 1½ percent by 2020 and hover around th at pace through 2021.   
Headline inflation increased to 2.5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter because of a sharp increase in retail energy prices, but core inflation edged down to 
1.1 percent.  As energy prices stabilize, headline inflation should fall just below

1½ percent before edging up as resource slack i s eliminated .  With our growth and 
inflation outlooks little changed, we continue to assume that the European Central 
Bank will cease net asset purchases in December, wait until late 2019 to begin raising 
its deposit rate, and then increase it to ¼ percent in 2021. 
• United Kingdom.  Incoming data are consistent with a rise in real GDP growth from 
1.6 percent in the second quarter to 2½ percent in the third, ¾ percentage point higher 
than estimated in September, partially  reflecting favorable weather conditions.  W e 
project that growth will fall back to 1½ percent (still slightly above our estimate of 
potential) in the current quarter and remain around this pace through the end of the 
forecast period.  This outlook is conditional on our view that the United Kingdom and the European Union will eventually reach an agreement before the March 29, 2019, 
deadline.  That said, with negotiations stalling on the Irish border issue, there is some 
risk that Brexit could occur without a deal in place , resulting in substantial disruptions 
to European supply chains and global financial markets.  
Inflation rose to 2.9 percent last quarter from 2  percent in the second, mostly 
reflecting higher retail energy prices.  We have inflation gradua lly edg ing down to the 
Bank of England’s (BOE ) 2 percent target, as energy inflation eases and pass -through 
from past pound sterling depreciation fades.  Given better -than-expected activity data, 
we moved the next rate hike to the second quarter of 2019, one quarter earlier than 
assumed in September.  Even so, we still see the BOE normalizing policy only very 
gradually, raising the Bank R ate from the current 0.75 percent to 1¾ percent in 2021 
and waiting until then to start reducing the size of its balance sheet. 
• Canada.  Recent indicators, such as monthly GDP for July and manufacturing PMI 
through September, point to 2¼ percent growth in the third quarter, about the average 
pace over the first half of the year and somewhat faster than forecast in September. 
The addition of now- legalized cannabis -related activity to the official data will 
provide a one- time kick to GDP, adding an estimated ½ percentage point to fourth-
quarter growth, now projected at 2½ percent.  With solid momentum in the economy, 
we expect growth to average just over 2 percent in 2019 before settling at its potential 
pace of 1¾ percent by mid -2020.  
After slowing to 1.1 percent in the second quarter, inflation bounced back to 
2.6 percent in the third, as core inflation recovered from earlier one- off price declines 
in a few categories and airfares surged .  Amid reports of rising input costs and solid 
wage growth, we expect inflation to remain somewhat above the 2 percent target in

2019 before edging down to its target level by the end of 2020.  Citing reduced trade 
policy uncertainty after a deal was reached to replace NAFTA with the new U.S. -
Mexico -Canada Agreement, or USMCA , the Bank of Canada (BOC) raised its policy 
rate 25 basis points to 1.75 percent on October 24.  As resource utilization continues 
to increase, the BOC is expected to raise its policy rate to 3 percent by mid -2020. 
• Japan.  Real GDP growth is estimated to have moderated to ¾  percent in the third 
quarter from a blistering 3 percent pace in the second. This estimate is ¼ percentage 
point lower than in the September Tealbook, reflecting weaker- than-expected data on 
household consumption and net exports.  Growth should remain near its potential rate 
of ¾ percent, abstracting f rom substantial fluctuations around the consumption tax 
hike planned for October 2019. 
Inflation swung from negative 2.3 percent in the second quarter to positive 2.7 percent in the third, in part reflecting pickup s in food and retail energy prices. 
Core inflation also turned positive but only to a meager 0.4 percent.  We continue to see core inflation edging up f urther, reflecting elevated resource utilization, and total 
inflation settling near 1  percent over the remainder of the forecast period.  With 
inflation well below the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) 2 percent target, we expect the BOJ to 
maintain a highly accommodative stance, waiting unt il the end of 2020 to lift its 
target for the 10-year Japanese government bond yield to around ¼ percent. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES 
• China.   Bucking the trend in most other EMEs, r eal GDP growth in China fell in the 
third quarter to just below 6 percent , down from 6½ percent in the second quarter and 
a touch weaker than our September Tealbook forecast.  The slowdown was led by 
weaker i nvestment, particularly in infrastructure, suggesting that earlier policy 
tightening  continues to exert a drag on growth.  Exports remained relatively strong, 
even in the face of escalati ng trade tensions with the United States .  With tariffs now 
in effect on about half of Ch inese exports to the United States , we expect export 
growth to  slow somewhat going forward, although the effect of the tariffs will likely 
be mitigated by the nearly 8 percent  depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar, 
which began in mid -June.  In addition, we expect domestic demand to strengthen as 
the authorities shift to a more accommodative policy stance. Indeed, the People’s 
Bank of China recently cut the reserve requirement ratio an additional 100 basis 
points, supporting credit growth.  All told, we see growth picking back up to 
6¼ percent this quarter before  slowing g radually to 5¾ percent by the end of the

forecast period.  Relative to the September Tealbook, this forecast is down a touch 
through the end of 2019, reflecting the latest round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, 
which were announced on September 17. 
Inflation stepped up from ¾ percent in the second quarter to around 4 percent in the 
third as an outbreak of African swine fever and adverse weather conditions caused 
pork and vegetable prices , respectively,  to spike.  As these temporary factors fade, w e 
expect inflation to settle at 2½ percent. 
• Other Emerging Asia.  A recovery in the region’s exports, which had slowed 
markedly in the second quarter, is expected to push gro wth up to 3½ percent in the 
third , despite a somewhat weak preliminary GDP release from Korea.  We expect 
growth to edge up to 3¾ percent in 2019 and 2020.  Although U.S.–China trade 
barriers implemented to date should have a negligible effect on growth in other 
emerging Asian economies, a further escalation of trade tensions remains a clear 
downside risk. 
• Mexico.  R ecent data on retail sales and consumer confidence suggest that real GDP 
expanded at a 2 percent pace last quarter after a second -quarter con traction .  Even so, 
construction activity has been weaker than expected, causing us to revise down  our 
forecast for third -quarter growth ¼ percentage point.  We see growth rising to nearly 
3 percent by mid -2019, supported by robust U.S. demand and the dissipation of trade-
related uncertainties after a deal was reached on the USMCA.  Most Mexican 
producers are already close to meeting the stricter rules of origin and labor content 
requirements  in the revised agreement, so w e do not expect the new accord to result 
in a material shift in production from Mexico to the United States. A deal was 
already factored into our baseline  and did not change our forecast. 
Headline inflation moved up to 5 percent on a 12-month basis in September on the back of energy price increases and base effects (transportation tariffs were cut in 
September 2017 after a series of earthquakes).  In October, the Bank of Mexico 
(BOM) kept its policy rate at 7.75 percent, noting concerns about  the slower- than-
expected decline in inflation and potential second-round effects from higher energy 
prices.  Assuming EME financial stresses abate, we see the BOM easing its monetary 
policy in mid -2019 as inflation moderates. 
• Brazil. We estimate that real GDP growth jumped to 4 percent in the third quarter 
from a tepid ¾ percent in the second, largely reflecting a recovery from the May

truckers’ strike .  Recent data have been mixed but suggest that the economy’s 
momentum is somewhat stronger than we anticipated in the September Tealbook, 
which led us to revise up the third- quarter forecast ½ percentage point.  W e expect 
growth to step back  to 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter and then rise gradually to 
2¾ percent in 2019, helped by a pickup in private investment once political 
uncertainty stemming from the presidential election fades.  In the first round of the 
election, the right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro came in first with a large lead over 
the runner-up Fernando Haddad of the Worker s’ Party.  The next president will be 
determined by a second -round runoff on October 28, and polls indicate a double- digit 
lead for Bolsonaro.  Our baseline forecast assumes that the incoming government will 
push through an urgent social security reform in 2019 and thus avoid a heightening of fiscal and financial stresses .  However, considerable uncertainty remains around the 
policy outlook. 
Headline inflation accelerated to 6.6  percent in the third quarter, pressured by the 
lagged effects of the truckers’ strike and the pass -through from currency depreciation.  
With the dissipation of these transitory effects, we expect inflation to fall to 4 percent 
in the fourth quarter before stabilizing at 4¼ percent —the central bank’s target f or 
2019.  Citing  anchored inflation expectations and considerable resource slack, the 
Central Bank of Brazil did not change its policy rate in its September meeting. 
• Argentina.  On September 26, Argentine authorities agreed on a revised program 
with the IMF intended to restore market confidence and allay growing c oncern about 
government financing needs in 2019.  The new program, which now awaits approval 
by the IMF Executive Board , envisions a larger and more front-loaded disbursement 
of IMF resources and features significantly tighter fiscal targets, strict limits on 
foreign exchange intervention, and a switch to a temporary monetary targeting regime 
in which the growth of the money supply is sharply reduced.  As a result of both 
tighter fiscal and monetary policies and a sharp tightening of financial conditions in 
recent months, we now expect a much deeper recession, with four- quarter growth 
contracting nearly 8  percent this year.  We expect a rebound in agricultural 
production f rom this year’s drought to push overall GDP growth into positive 
territory next year , but outside of agriculture, the recession is expected to continue.

Financial Market Developments 
Concerns about ongoing internati onal trade tensions, the global  growth outlook, 
and rising interest rates wei ghed on equity market sentiment ov er the intermeeting period.  
Stock prices declined substanti ally on net, equity market volat ilities rose not ably, and the 
dollar appreciated.  Treasury yiel ds were little changed, as in creases early in the period 
were offset by decreases owing to flight-to-safety flows associated with large equity 
market declines later in the period.   
Broad U.S. equity price indexes  declined about 7  percent on net .  The VIX
increased significantly to level s that are notably elevated compared with its
historical distribution.
Despite the substantial declines in stock prices, credit spread s on investment-
and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened by modest amounts .
A straight read of market quotes implies that the probability o f a 25 basis
point rate hike occurring at the December FOMC meeting stands a t
75 percent, little changed since the September meeting, while t he probability
of a rate increase at the Novemb er FOMC meeting is negligible.
Nominal Treasury yields were li ttle changed on net.  TIPS yield s rose, leaving
TIPS-implied inflation compensatio n moderately lower, with some of the
decline occurring after the softe r-than-expected September CPI data release.
The trade-weighted dollar index increased 2 percent against AFE  currencies
and 1¼ percent against EME curre ncies.  Major foreign equity price indexes
declined between 7 and 12 percent, on net, amid heightened tens ions between
the U.S. and China, Italian budget negotiations, and spillovers from U.S.markets.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
During the intermeeting period, broad equity prices declined substantially, on net, 
amid unusual day-to-day volatili ty.  At one point, prices had d eclined nearly 10 percent, 
on net, erasing all gains logged earlier in the year, before pa rtly retracing n ear the end of 
the period.  News related to ongoing  international trade tensions, and investors’ concerns

  over potential further increases  in interest rates and the sust ainability of strong corporate 
earnings growth, appeared to weigh on investor sentiment.  Stock prices of the basic 
materials and industria l sectors underperformed the broader market, reportedly reflecting 
an increase in trade tensions  with China.  More broadly, invest ors seemed to reassess 
equity valuations that appeare d elevated.  Investors also react ed to some large firms 
raising concerns about the effect of rising costs on their future profitability in their latest 
earnings reports.  One-month optio n-implied volatility on the S &P 500 index (VIX) 
increased significantly to level s that are notably elevated compared with its historical 
distribution, though it remained be low those seen in early Febr uary.  
Despite the significant declin es in stock prices, spreads of yi elds on investment-
and speculative-grade corporat e bonds over yields on comparable-maturity Treasury 
securities widened only modestl y.  Overall, yields and spreads on both investment- and 
speculative-grade corporate bonds  remained low compared with th eir respective 
distributions over the past sev eral years.  As we look ahead, however, yields and spreads 
on corporate bonds could potential ly be boosted by a decrease i n holdings by 
corporations, as recent tax law  changes have provided incentives for corporations to 
reduce the size of their overseas  financial portfolios and shif t those holdings into more-
liquid asset categories.  The box “Recent Developments in Corpo rate Financial 
Investments” discusses these cha nges in corporations’ investmen t strategies.  
Market-implied measures of moneta ry policy expectations for the  remainder of 
2018 were little changed over th e intermeeting period.  Federal  funds futures contracts 
currently imply a 75 percent probability that the FOMC will rai se the target range for the 
federal funds rate by 25 basis points at its December meeting, while the probability of a 
rate increase at the November  meeting remained close to zero.1  Beyond 2018, federal 
funds rate expectations implied by OIS quotes—unadjusted for te rm premiums—
decreased slightly over the int ermeeting period and currently a ppear to embed about 
50 basis points of additional tightening in 2019.  A staff mode l that adjusts for term 
premiums implies an increase i n the effective federal funds rat e of roughly 75 basis 
points over the course of 2019.   
                                                 
1 Of note, the calculation of the probability of a rate increase  for the November meeting and for 
the December meeting does not tak e into account a potential tec hnical adjustment to the IOER rate.  
Assuming no adjustment at the November FOMC meeting and a 5 bas is point adjustment at the December 
meeting would imply a 90 percen t probability of a rate hike at the December meeting.

 Recent Developments in Corporate Financial Investments  
Nonfinancial firms  (hereafter, firms) have substantially increased their holdings of financial asset s 
over recent years.  Since the first quarter of 2011, the total financial assets of the 10 firms with the 
largest financial investment portfolios have nearly doubled , to $800 billion ; these  asset s have 
grown from about one- third to almost one -half of total assets  (table).1  This growth suggests that 
the investment decisions of firms  could  have a substantial effect  on the market s in which they 
inves t.  In this discussion , we explore recent changes in firms’ financial investment strategies 
following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (T CJA).  
When managing their financial asset s, firms  typically report that they prioritize capital 
preservation and liquidity over risk -adjusted return and thus prefer to hold portfolios of high -
quality, short -duration securities.  That said, firms with the largest portfolios appear to hold a 
relatively wide range of financial securities and products.  For example, t he top 10 firms have 
sizable position s in long -term  corporate bonds  (greater than one year)  while holding relatively 
little in short -term inve stments , such as  CP, CDs, and MMFs  (figure 1 ).  Moreover, these firms  have 
historically held a large fraction  of their financial assets in offshore account s.  For instance, just 
before the passage of the TCJA, three- fourths  of the top 10 firms’ financial assets were held 
offshore.2  
While firms are still evaluating the longer- term  implications of the TCJA, recent data suggest  
three emerging trends in how they might be restructuring their financial asset holdings. 
 
 
                                                 
1 The management of firms’ excess cash is part of their treasury functions, and these investors are typically 
referred to as “corporate cash  managers.”  
2 Estimates are based on SEC filings as of late 2017 and early 2018.  Firms in our sample have since stop ped 
reporting the size of their offshore holdings.

 First, the TCJA reduced the incentive for firms to keep  sizable holdings of financial assets 
offshore.  Consistent with this development, we observe a substantial drawdown in the 
combined financial asset holdings of the largest 10 firms  since the passage of tax reform 
(figure 1 ). 3  
Second, in light of the TCJA , firms are likely to treat their onshore and offshore financial asset 
holdings as close substitutes and  as a result may demand  higher liquid ity in their offshore 
account s.  It is unclear how this will affect firms’ offshor e holdings of short -term money market 
instruments , given  the offsetting effects of (1) a reduction in overall financial asset holdings  and 
(2) a composition shift  into more liquid investments .  In any case, firms may reduce their illiquid 
financial investments, such as corporate bonds , abroad .  Indeed, the  reduction in the top 10 firms’ 
financial asset holdings has been concentrated in U.S. Treasury securities and long -term 
corporate bonds, both of which fell 15 percent over the first two quarters of 2018.4  The reduction 
in corporate bond holdings has coincided with an increase in trading  of U.S. investment -grade 
corporate bonds between dealers and their foreign affiliates .  Such trading increased by 5  percent 
and 20 percent year- on-year in the first and second quarters of 2018 , respectively , consistent with 
dealers intermediating the rebalancing of firms’ more illiquid offshore holdings.   
Finally, foreign offices of domestic banks appear to have become more reliant on their home 
offices for funding , as large U.S. banks’  net lending to their foreign offices has increased 
substantially  (figure 2).  This increase in lending may in part reflect banks ’ needs to replace 
offshore funding they previously received from firms, which may have been significant  when all 
firms are considered . 
Going forward, we intend to monitor changes in firms’ financial asset management .  Their sizab le 
holdings of financial assets, unique investment objectives, and status as counterparties to large 
financial firms  are likely to have ongoing implications for a range of financial markets.  
   
 
                                                 
3 The July Tealbook box “U.S. Corporations’ Repatriation of Offshore Profits” discusses how U.S. 
nonfinancial firms with large holdings of cash abroad appeared to deploy those funds after  the passage of 
the TCJA. 
4 Investments in short -term instruments also dropped 15 percent  over the same period , but those 
investments represent a significantly smaller portion of their aggregate holdings.

  The nominal Treasury yield curve was little changed, on net, si nce the September 
FOMC meeting amid some moderate  volatility over the period, whi ch market participants 
struggled to attribute to a cle ar catalyst.  ISM nonmanufacturi ng data that came in above 
investor expectations and, to a l esser extent, FOMC participant s’ communications were 
cited as two potential factors contributing to a  notable rise in yields early in the 
intermeeting period.  However, market participants viewed neith er factor as being able to 
explain much of the move in yiel ds.  Later in the period, yields declined in response to 
flight-to-safety flows associated with a drop in broad equity p rice indexes and a rise in 
market volatility.  With yields l ittle changed, on net, the spread between 10- and 2-year 
Treasury yields remained ar ound the 25th percentile of its dist ribution since 1971, while 
the near-term forward sprea d stands near its 45th percentile.2  Since the previous FOMC 
meeting, TIPS-implied inflation c ompensation over the next 5 years and 5-to-10-year 
inflation compensation have decl ined moderately, with some of t he decline occurring 
after the September CPI came in below market expectations. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Since the September FOMC meetin g, global markets have been unse ttled, with 
particularly notable declines in equity markets.  Although ther e have been no clear 
drivers of the movements, foreign market participants have been  focused on changes in 
U.S. equity prices and U.S. inter est rates, ongoing trade tensi ons between the United 
States and China, and uncertainty  regarding budget negotiations  between the Italian 
government and the European Union. 
Major foreign equity indexes f ell 7 to 12 percent over the inte rmeeting period.  
Option-implied measures of foreign equity volatility spiked as equity indexes fell in the 
United States and around the wor ld, but such measures remained well below levels seen 
in February. 
AFE 10-year government yields generally declined over the perio d, in contrast to 
U.S. yields.  On net, yields fe ll 15 to 19 basis points in Germ any and the United 
                                                 
2 The near-term forward spread in this context is defined as the  difference between the current 
implied forward rate on three-month Treasury bills six quarters from now and the curre nt yield on a three-
month Treasury bill.  For analysi s of the information content o f these spreads, see Eric Engstrom and 
Steven Sharpe (2018), “ (Don’t Fear) the Yiel d Curve,” FEDS Note s (Washington:  Board of Governors of

  Kingdom, respectively, in part f ollowing weaker-than-expected i nflation data and 
European political developments .  Canadian 10-year yields were little changed, and 
short-term yields rose, bolst ered by the announcement of the U. S.-Mexico-Canada trade 
agreement, or USMCA, and a polic y rate hike by the Bank of Cana da. 
Ten-year Italian spreads widene d about 76 basis points over the  period as the 
Italian government proposed a budget with a wider deficit than market participants had 
expected.  The proposed budget was rejected by the European Com mission, raising the 
likelihood of a prolonged period of political confrontation.  O ther euro-area peripheral 
spreads widened 9 to 31 basis points, and there were significan t outflows from funds 
focused on the euro-area periphery.  
The dollar strengthened 2 percent against AFE currencies, inclu ding a 3½ percent 
appreciation against the euro, amid wider differentials between  U.S. yields and AFE 
yields as well as concerns ove r Italian budget negotiations.  T he dollar appreciated 
1¼ percent against EME currencies.  While most EME currencies a re down against the 
dollar, the EMEs that had experienced financial pressures earli er this year strengthened.  
The Brazilian real appreciated 9 percent as Jair Bolsonaro, perceived to be the r elatively 
more market-friendly candidate, w on the first round of the Braz ilian presidential election 
with a larger-than-expected m argin.  Similarly, the Turkish lir a retraced some earlier 
declines and rose 8½ percent over the period on declining tensi ons between Turkey and 
the United States.  EME-dedicated funds experienced small outfl ows over the 
intermeeting period. 
The three-month FX swap basis for the euro, the Swiss franc, an d the Japanese 
yen increased discretely about 30 basis points at the end of September and remained 
elevated as the three-month cont racts started to cross year-end  (for more details, see the 
box “Recent Developments in Offshore Dollar Funding Markets”). 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
 Overnight rates in short-term funding markets rose in line wit h the increase in the 
target range announced at the September FOMC meeting.  The dist ribution of federal 
funds trades shifted steadily to slightly higher rates over the  intermeeting period, with the 
spread between the effective fede ral funds rate (EFFR) and the interest on excess reserves 
(IOER) rate narrowing from 2 basis points to 0 basis points.  T o date, there has been no 
marked change in the behavior of m arket participants as the EFF R rose to the IOER rate.

 Recent Developments in Offshore Dollar Funding  Markets  
Market participants outside the United States can obtain dollar funding by exchanging foreign 
currency  for dollars in the FX swap market  or, if available to them, b y borrowing dollars directly.1  
The difference in annualized cost s between the two funding sources  is the FX swap basis , 
typically quoted using LIBOR as a borrowing cost.  In a frictionless world, the FX sw ap basis 
should be close to zero (as implied by  “covered interest rate parity”), but dollar funding via the 
FX swap market has been more costly since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) .  
For much of this year, however, the FX swap basis has been at its lowest level since the GFC , 
reflecting generally benign conditions in offshore dollar funding markets.  One factor behind th e 
low basis  has been the flatter Treasury yield curve, which has likely reduced demand for dollar 
funding and hedging via FX swaps.2   
On September 27, however, the first day that a new three -month FX swap contract would mature 
after the end of 2018, th e three- month FX swap basis jumped 20 to 30 basis points in most major 
currencies  (figure 1).  T here were no concurrent  jumps in domestic dollar funding market s, such 
as the commercial paper market.  
A discrete jump in the three -month FX basis also occurred in recent  years when the contract first 
spanned the year- end.   But the increase this year was larger, although it began from a lower level.   
This year’s increase has raised  concerns about an outsized spike at the end of 2018 in the cost of 
shorter- tenor dollar funding via FX swaps, perhaps even larger than the substantial spike that 
occurred last year (figure 2).  I t could also mean , however, that sensitized by last  year’s 
experience, more market participants are obtaining their dollar funding earlier.  
 
 
                                                 
1 In an FX swap transaction, an investor buys dollars with foreign currency in a spot transaction while at 
the same time agreeing with the seller on a date and a forward exchange rate to reverse the transaction.   
2 Foreign investors often use dollar funding obtained via short -maturity FX swaps (and therefore hedged 
against FX risk for that maturity) to invest in longer -term dollar -denominated securities.  A flatter Treasury yield 
curve reduces the return on that strategy.

An important factor explaining the spike in the basis at the end of 2017 was a  temporary pullback 
from the FX swap market by several large banks , including U.S. institutions , that  are important 
intermediaries and providers of dollar funding.  The pullback reportedly  reflected  balance sheet 
constraints  driven by concerns over capital requirements based on year- end re porting .  Among 
these concerns  is that of  being placed in a higher g lobal systemically important bank (G-SIB) 
surcharge bucket . 3 
FX swaps on the books of bank s potentially affect all five risk categories used to calculate the 
G-SIB surcharge scores.  Specifically, besides increasing the size of the balance sheet, FX swap 
transactions are conducted over the counter, are usually cross -jurisdictional, often involve other 
financial institutions as counterparties, and may have the dollar leg funded in the wholesale 
market.  In addition, m any FX swap contracts have very short maturit ies, which means they can 
quickly roll off the books of dealers.  Thus , FX swap activity may be a prime target for a sudden 
year- end pullback by institutions acutely concerned about capital requirements.  
The substantial spike in the FX basis currently priced by FX swap markets for the year- end reflects 
the high probability that some market participants will pay very high dollar funding costs for a 
short period at that time.  We note, however, that previous year- end spikes have not resulted in 
widespread stresses in offshore dollar funding markets  or been accompanied by unusual sales of 
U.S. assets, as m ost market participants likely anticipate d such event s.  Of course, the cost of 
being prepared is the higher basis paid even now on contracts spa nning the year- end, with the 
burden falling on counterparties swapping foreign currency liquidity for dollar liquidity.    
Finally, as with previous year- end spikes in the FX basis, we expect to see an associated rise in 
draws from our central bank dollar swap lines at the European Central Bank  and the Bank of 
Japan .  But  these draws will likely again be far smaller than those  seen in the G FC or the European 
Sovereign Debt Crisis .4  
                                                 
3 G-SIB reporting is based on pur e year -end readings for banks in continental Europe, while f or U.S. and 
U.K. banks, for certain items , “year -end” reporting is based on a Q4 daily average or an average of the three 
month -ends in Q4.  
4 At the end of 2017, draws from our central bank swap lines peaked at $11.9 billion at the European 
Central Bank  and $160  million at the Bank of Japan .

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
While rising interest rates in recent months appeared to have reduced demand for 
credit by some borrowers, a continued easing of lending standards and terms for 
businesses and still generally accommodative  supply conditions for households have 
served to support growth in borrowing and spending.   
•Spreads on corporate bonds and loans have remained low relative to their
average levels over the past several years, and banks reported further easing of
standards and terms for C&I loans.
•Business financing flows have remained strong, especially for investment-
grade corporate bonds and leveraged loans.  However, banks 
reported weaker
demand and lower loan volumes for both C&I and CRE loans.
•Mortgage credit supply conditions for households remained accommodative,
but mortgage originations for home purchase have remained flat.  R efinancing
activity continues 
to be subdued due, in part, to rising mortgage rates.
•Credit card loan growth showed signs of moderation am id rising interest rates
and reported tightening of lending standards at the largest credit card banks.
Other types of consumer
 credit, including student and auto loans, continued to
grow  at a solid pace.
•The October 2018 S LOOS asked a set of special questions on the effects of
movements in the yield curve on banks’ lending policies.  A  summary of
banks’ responses to those questions is discussed in the box “Bank Lending
Policies and the Yield Curve”  at the end of the section.

  BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained  supportive of borrowing 
and spending over the intermeeting period.  Spreads of yields on corporate bonds  and 
institutional leveraged loans  over those on three- month LIBOR  remained low relative to 
their average level  over the past several years but have drifted up in recent weeks.  In the 
October 2018 SLO OS, banks, on net, reported easing standards and terms for C&I loans 
to large and middle -market firms over the past three months, and all banks tha t eased  
cited  increased competition from both bank and nonbank lenders as an important reason.  
Other reasons provided by a significant fraction of banks that eased standards and terms 
on C&I loans included increased liquidity in the secondary market for t hese loans, a more 
favorable or less uncertain economic outlook, and an increased tolerance for risk.   
Net debt financi ng of nonfinancial firms was robust in the third quarter , as weak 
speculative- grade bond issuance was largely offset by high  leveraged loan issuance, 
reportedly reflecting investors’ stronger demand for floating-rate products.  Although the volume of leveraged loans held by  nonbanks continued to grow steadily, C&I loan 
growth at banks slowed in the third quarter, especially at large and foreign banks , 
consistent with responses to the October 2018 SLOOS that demand for C&I loans had weakened over the third quarter on balance.   
The pace of gross equity issuance through initial public offerings was solid in 
September and so far in October  despite notable recent declines in stock prices.  In 
contrast, the pace of seasoned  equity offerings has slowed a bit  in October , following 
strong issuance in September .   
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations re mained solid , though modest 
signs of deterioration continued, as the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades somewhat outpaced that of upgrades in September.  On net, the KMV expected year -ahead default rate for nonfinancial firms increased somewhat  and stayed 
near the middle of it s historical range.     
The outlook for corporate earnings remained favorable on balance.  During the 
current earning s reporting season, some large firms raised concerns about their future 
profitability due to increasing costs.  Even so, projections by Wal l Street analysts for 
year-ahead earnings for S&P 500 firms were, in aggregate, little changed over the

intermeeting period  and continue d to call for a healthy  five percent growth in year -ahead 
earnings . 
Small Businesses  
Financing conditions for small bus inesses remain ed generally accommodative.  
Conditions have been stable in recent months, with the October 2018 SLOOS 
respondents reporting little change , on net, in bank lending standards to small firms  over 
previous months.  In the National Federation of Independent Business monthly member 
polls, the fraction of respondents with planned capital expenditures in the next six months has climbed  in recent months, although it remains below its levels in the years  leading up 
to the financial crisis .  Lending volumes to small businesses have leveled out after rising  
over much of the past year.    
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions in CRE  markets  remained  accommodative.  CMBS spreads 
remained  near their post- crisis lows , and spreads on CRE loans at banks a lso remained 
low.  The largest b anks reported an easing of standards on all three major categories of 
CRE loan s over the third quarter of 2018 on net.  Banks also reported somewhat weaker 
demand for nonfarm nonresidential and construction and development loans.  Consistent with these reports, growth of CRE loans on bank’s balance sheets slowed a bit, driven primarily by a slowdown at large banks.  Issuance of non- agency and agency CMBS was  
stable  in recent months, similar to previous year levels.  
MUNICIPAL  GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained  accommodative on 
balance.  Yields on 20-year municipal bonds in the primary market increased slightly 
more than yields on Treasury securities, leaving spreads over compa rable- maturity 
Treasury securities slightly higher.  In the third quarter, the credit quality of state and 
local governments improved a bit as the number of upgrades was somewhat larger than that of downgrades .  Gross issuance of municipal bonds in September and October was 
strong, m uch of which raised new capital.

  HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Although financing conditions in the residential mortgage market continued to be 
accommodative for most borrowers, the increase in mortga ge rates since 2016 has 
appeared to have reduced demand , and financing conditions remained somewhat tight f or 
borrowers with low credit scores.  R efinance activity continued to be very muted , and the 
growth in purchase mortgage originations has slowed over the past year  as mortgage rates 
remained  near their highest level since 2011.    
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit  markets, on balance, remain ed 
supportive of growth in household spending, although interest rates for consumer loans 
continued to rise and appeared to have a greater bearing on consumer sentiment for large purchases .  The  share of respondents in the University of Michigan Survey s of 
Consumers that noted high interest rates as a reason for not making large purchases  was 
larger in the most recent  survey than in surveys conducted earlier in the year .  Credit card 
loan growth showed signs of moderating amid rising interest rates and reported tightening of lending standards at the largest credit card banks.  According to the October 2018 SLOOS, b anks were less willing to make credit card loans as compared with  the 
beginning of this year for borrowers across the credit spectrum , though the tightening was 
more pronounced for borrowers  with lower credit scores .   
Other types of consumer credit, including student and auto loans, continued to 
grow  at a solid pace.  Conditions in the consumer ABS market remained  stable, with 
spreads hovering near historical lows and year- to-date issuance outpacing that in recent 
years.

Bank Lending Policies and the Yield Curve  
The October 2018 SLOOS asked banks’ loan officers  a set of special questions on changes 
in lending policies in response to movements in the yield curve.  Loan officers  were first 
asked about changes in their lending policies in response to the flattening of the yield 
curve since the beginning of this year, independent of other factors that have influenced 
those policies.  Loan officers  were then asked  to assess potential changes in their lending 
policies in response to a sustained hypothetical moderate inversion of the yield curve. 1  
Banks’ loan officers generally reported that the recent flattening in the yield curve has not affected their standards or price terms across major loan categories  (figure 1) .  In 
contrast, in response to a hypothetical moderate inversion of the yield curve, banks  
responded that they would tighten somewhat standards or price terms across every 
major loan category  (figure 2).  The vast majority of respondents  interpreted this scenario 
as a signal of a future deterioration in economic conditions.  S pecifically, major shares of 
respondents  indicated that they would anticipate such a scenario to be accompanied by a 
less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a likely deterioration in the quality of their bank’s loan portfolio, and a reduction in their risk tolerance  (figure 3) .  
About half  of loan officers who indicated that their banks would tighten lending 
standards or price terms in response to a moderate yield curve inversion also said that 
less profitable lending  relative to their banks’ cost of funds  and, relatedly, less aggressive 
competition from other banks and nonbanks  under  this scenario would be important 
reasons for tightening .  Because bank lending may become less profitable when the yield 
curve inverts (due to banks obtaining funding at short -term interest rates but lending at 
longer- term interest rates), these responses suggest that a yield curve inversion could, by 
itself, act as a headwind to economic activity by causing some banks to pull back from lending , independent of changes in economi c conditions .  
Relatedly , the September 2018 SCOOS provides one source of analogous information 
regarding the likely response of  nonbanks  to a hypothetical yield curve inversion; that 
survey focuses on securities dealers and the terms they offer to their institutional 
investor clients .
2  On balance, a modest net fraction of SCOOS respondents indicated that 
they would tighten their credit terms somewhat under this scenario.  The most cited 
reasons for that outcome were that the scenario would be associated with higher dealer 
funding costs , a general worsening in the liquidity and functioning  of securities markets , 
and a deterioration in the financial strength of counterparties  associated with a general 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions .3 
1 The hypothetical moderate inversion scenario assumes the 10 -year Treasury yield falls moderately 
below the 3- month Treasury bill, and that this inversion prevails over the next year.  
2 Securities dealers extend financing to investors who, in turn, hold securities that are backed by 
loans to businesses and households.  As such, the terms at which securities dealers engage with clients 
indirectly affect credit conditions for businesses and households.

yield curve and changes in banks’ and dealers’ credit standards and terms, see the following memos:

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF R ISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity over 
the next year or so as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used 
by the FOMC.  In addition, we still judge the upside and downside risks around the projections 
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over that period as being balanced.  On the 
upside, the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain 
strong—bolstered in part by the tax cuts enacted last year—and readings on household and 
business sentiment generally remain upbeat.  In these circumstances, spending and investment 
could expand faster than in the staff projection.  On the downside, foreign economic 
developments and trade policies could move in directions that have significant negative effects 
on U.S economic growth.  These overall assessments are consistent with the four-quarter-ahead 
estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the unemployment rate presented in the 
exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk.”   
We remain  concerned about recession risks during the period beyond the next year or so.  
In our baseline outlook, the economy is projected to move further beyond its potential over the 
next two years.  If that forecast is correct, then we anticipate that a significant slowing in the 
pace of economic growth, along with a gradual increase in the unemployment rate, will be 
necessary to return the economy to a sustainable position in the longer run.   During the period of 
subpar growth, the economy will be more susceptible to being push ed into a recession by 
negative shocks.   Neither we nor anyone else have clear insight as to the precise timing of when 
a recession could occur, but the period of adjustment back to sustainability will be a time of 
heightened downside risk.   
With regard to inflation, the staff still sees average uncertainty and balanced risks around 
the projection over the next year or so.  To the downside, longer-run inflation expectations 
relevant for wage and price
 setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may 
not edge up in the coming years.  Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more 
than expected and put downward pressure on inflation.  To the upside, with economic activity 
projected to move further above its potential, inflation could increase more than in the staff 
forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource 
utilization on inflation.  In addition,  an unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade

barriers could lead to higher inflation.  These assessments are consis tent with the statistical 
estimates of the  time-varying risks for the inflation forecast  over the next year .  Of course, if the 
risks to the forecast for economic activity beyond a year or so  are tilted to the downside , then the 
risks to the inflation projection would also tend to have a downward skew  at that time . 
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s quarterly  
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which judges the overall financial vulnerabilities in 
the United States to be moderate.  Vulnerabilities from leverage and maturity transformation in  
the U.S. financial system appear low .  Banks look to be well capitalized and hold substantial  
amounts of high -quality liquid assets, while liquidity risk associated with mo ney market funds  
remains much reduced owing to the SEC reforms implemented a couple of years ago.  In the 
household sector,  debt has increased only moderately and primarily among  prime-rated 
borrowers .  However, in the nonfinancial corporate sector,  borrowing by highly  levered and 
lower-rated firms is elevated,  suggesting that a weakening in economic activity could be  
amplified by strains within this  sector.  Asset valuation pressures also continue to be elevated 
despite the recent substantial  declines in e quity prices.  In addition, t erm premiums on nominal 
Treasury securities, along with spreads on corporate bonds and on leveraged loans , have 
remained low.  Although some indicators suggest that the p ace of house price appreciation  has 
slowed recently, house values increased substantially over the  past year and still appear to be 
somewhat elevated relative to rents .  Existing domestic financial vulnerabilities could amplify 
shocks from a marked jump in Treasury yields , which could b e caused by an increase in 
concerns about the current high level and unsustainable trajectory of federal government debt .  In 
addition, existing vulnerabilities could amplify  shocks from abroad, including from 
developments associated with international tra de policies, emerging market economies ( EMEs), 
or Brexit. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario posits that increases in interest 
rates could restrain household and business spending by more than is assumed in the baseline.  In 
the second scenario, higher realized inflation  puts upward pressure on  inflation expectations , 
which leads to persistently h igher inflation  and also slower output growth .  The third scenario 
considers a downside risk from an increase in financial market concerns about federal 
government debt , which result s in a larger and faster increase in term premiums  on longer -term 
Treasury securities  and higher borrowing rates .  The fourth scenario posits that the natural rate  of

unemployment is  lower and structural productivity growth is faster than assumed in the baseline. 
The fifth scenario traces out the consequences of a sizable increase in financial market stress in 
China.  Finally, the sixth scenario illustrates the effects of a large increase in oil prices that 
triggers a sharp rise in inflation in advanced economies and a tightening of global financial 
conditions. 
The first four scenarios are simulated with the FRB/US model; the last two scenarios use 
the SIGMA model.1  In all
 of the scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the same policy 
rule as in the baseline.   Additionally, the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are 
assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios. 
Greater Interest Rate Sensitivity  [FRB/US] 
The baseline forecast shows a large positive output gap for a number of years despite 
increases in the federal funds rate to about 2¼ percentage points above its long-run value.  
However, there is a risk that the projected tightening in monetary policy will weigh on economic 
activity more than is assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, we explore the possibility that 
household and business spending,  along with equity prices,  are more sensitive to interest rates 
than in the baseline.2 
With household spending and business investment more responsive to the path of real 
interest rates and equity prices being lower by as much as 25 percent, real GDP growth is weaker 
than in the baseline until 2022.  The unemployment rate is higher than in the baseline and moves 
above 4 percent in 2021; inflation remains close to baseline, reflecting the very flat Phillips curve 
in the FRB/US model.  Resource
 utilization is much less tight than in the baseline, and inflation 
is little changed, which results in the federal funds rate being notably below the baseline path, 
peaking at 3¾ percent in early 2021. 
Inflation Fears [FRB/US]  
In recent years, private-sector expectations of future inflation have been formed in an 
environment mainly characterized by low and stable inflation, generally at or below the FOMC’s 
1 FRB/US is a large-scale macroeconometric model of the U.S. economy, and SIGMA is a calibrated 
multicountry DSGE model. 
2 Specifically, the magnitude of the peak output response to a monetary policy shock of 1 percentage point 
on the federal funds rate is amplified from 0.2 percent in the baseline projection to 0.8 percent in this scenario, a 
value more consistent with some DSGE models.

2 percent objective.  As a result, there is considerable uncertainty as to how these expectations 
might change if inflation were to run persistently and significantly above that objective.  In 
particular, an extended period of inflation above 2 percent may cause long er-run inflation 
expectations to move upward and  also raise the perceived riskiness  of nominal assets, thus 
increasing term premiums. 
In this scenario, we assume a steeper Phillips curve such that the tight economy leads to 
higher inflation than in the baseline, possibly as a result of nonlinearities in the relationship 
between resource utilization and inflation.  Moreover, it is assumed that, in forming their 
inflation expectations, households
 and businesses put more weight on recent inflation experience 
than in the baseline.  Finally, in this environment of heightened inflation risk, Treasury term 
premiums rise persistently to a level about 1 percentage point above their baseline values.  
Under these assumptions, inflation runs substantially above the Tealbook forecast for 
several years.  Yields on Treasury securities and corporate bonds rise in response to the assumed 
increase in inflation risk premiums, causing GDP growth to be about 1 percentage point slower 
than in the baseline in 2019.  The unemployment rate increases slowly throughout the simulation, 
ending almost 1 percentag
e point above the baseline (though still only a little above its assumed 
natural rate by the end of the simulation period).  The response of the federal funds rate in this 
scenario is initially dominated by the lower level of real GDP rather than by the higher path of 
inflation; as a result, the federal funds rate is slightly below baseline until early 2022.  
Thereafter, however, the influence of higher inflation dominates, and the federal funds rate is 
¼ percentage point above baseline by 2024 as inflation is slowly brought back down to ward the 
2 percent objective. 
Federal Debt Concerns [FRB/US]  
In response to the enactment of expansionary fiscal policies  over the past year and the 
resulting higher projected level of the federal debt- to-GDP ratio, the baseline projection has 
assumed that term premiums on Treasury securities will gradually rise further than they would 
otherwise.  However, as noted in the QS assessment, an increase in concerns about the current 
high level and unsustainable trajectory of the U.S. federal government debt could lead to a larger 
and significantly more rapid increase in term premiums than assumed in the baseline.   This 
scenario explores the implications of that outcome.3  In particular, higher term premiums on 
                                                           
3 In the scenario, the 10-year Treasury term premium is about 75 basis points above its baseline value by 
the end of 2019.

Treasury securities show through to higher borrowing rates for both households and businesses, 
which restrains their spending and investment. 
Given the higher borrowing costs, re
al GDP growth slows to ½ percentage point below 
the baseline in  2020, at which time the unemployment rate has risen about ¼ percentage point 
above the baseline.  Inflation remains close to baseline levels, and consequently the federal funds 
rate is about ¼ percentage point lower, on average, over the medium term.  The negative effects 
of a larger and faster increase in longer-term Treasury rates could be greater than illustrated in 
this scenario if, for example, they were to be amplified by financial sector vulnerabilities not 
reflected in this simulation. 
Stronger Supply Side [FRB/US ] 
Although  the unemployment rate is currently about 1 percentage point below our estimate 
of its natural rate, wage gains have remained modest.  One way of reconciling modest wage 
gains with a very low unemployment rate is that the natural rate could be lower than in the 
baseline.  In this scenario, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in 
the past two years than assumed by the staff and that it continues to fall, possibly reflecting 
positive hysteresis.  The natural rate is assumed to reach 4.1 percent at the end of 2019, 
½ percentage point lower than in the baseline.  In addition, we assume that structural 
productivity growth will be about ¼ percentage point faster than in the baseline.  Finally, 
policymakers and the private sector are assumed to fully recognize these changes in supply-side 
conditions.  
As a result, in this scenario, real GDP growth is, on average, ½ percentage point above 
the baseline,  and the unemployment rate declines faster, reaching about 3 percent in 2021.  
Inflation rises more slowly than in the baseline, reflecting faster productivity growth, with core 
PCE inflation hovering around 2 percent in the medium term.  With a narrower output gap 
persisting for several years and  lower inflation, the federal funds rate is 4 percent at the end of 
2020, ½ percentage point below the baseline.4 
4 In this scenario, resource utilization is less tight than in the baseline entering the projection period because

EME Financial Turbulence  [SIGMA]  
A number of developments could trigger an increase in EME stresses over the forecast 
period, including a larger -than-expected increase in global interest rates, an escalation of global 
trade disputes, or a financial crisis in China.  Although we expect tha t activity in China will 
decelerate only modestly over the forecast period, China’s vulnerabilities have increased in 
recent years amid high private-sector debt levels and a still heavily leveraged shadow banking 
sector.  Against this backdrop, adverse dev elopments could put China’s prospects in doubt and 
cause a deterioration of financial conditions , with knock -on effects to other EMEs.  Such 
developments would likely cause flight -to-safety flows into dollar -denominated assets and put 
downward pressure on the renminbi and other EME currencies.  
This scenario assumes that such a risk materializes.  GDP in China and other EMEs falls 
by 4 percent and 2 percent  relative to baseline , respectively, by 2020, as EME corporate 
borrowing spreads increase 150 basis po ints and confidence declines.  The financial turbulence 
in EMEs and worries about future growth in global demand trigger a moderate rise in borrowing 
spreads in the United States and in the advanced foreign economies.  Flight -to-safety flows cause 
the dollar to appreciate 10 percent and depress term premiums on U.S. government bonds.  
Despite weakening macroeconomic conditions, EME central banks are assumed to tighten 
monetary policy to mitigate upward pressure on inflation arising from the depreciation of their 
currencies.  
The appreciation of the dollar, weaker foreign activity, and adverse financial spillovers 
cause U.S. GDP growth to moderate to just under  2 percent in 2019 and the unemployment rate 
to rise to 3¾ percent in 2020.  Lower resource utilizati on and falling import prices reduce core 
PCE inflation to about 1½ percent in 2019.  The federal funds rate follows a shallower path than 
in the baseline, rising to 3¾ percent by the end of 2020.  
Inflation-Driven Global Tightening  [SIGMA]
Oil prices rose to well over $80 per barrel early in the intermeeting period before 
subsiding more recently, and geopolitical tensions could push prices up substantially.  Amid 
historically low unemployment rates  in several major advanced economies , additional oil price 
increases could not only directly raise production costs but also boost inflation expectations and

set in motion a spiral of rising wages and prices.5  Concerns about rising inflation could then 
prompt central banks to quickly increase policy rates and induce some tightening of global 
financial conditions.  
Specifically, this scenario assumes that oil prices rise to $120 per barrel.  In the context of 
very tight labor markets, and coming on the heels of previous large increases in oil prices, the 
cost increases pass through to prices to a much larger extent than in recent decades.  Headline 
inflation in the advanced economies jumps to nearly 3½ percent in 2019 and core inflation 
3 percent.  Term premiums on government securities in the advanced economies rise 50 basis 
points above baseline,  while private-sector borrowing spreads increase almost 40 basis points.  
Financial conditions in the EMEs are assumed to deteriorate a bit more than in the advanced 
economies.  
Higher inflation and tighter financial conditions depress U.S. domestic demand,  while 
lower foreign activity weighs on net exports.  All told, U.S. GDP growth is, on average, a full 
percentage point below baseline in 2019 and 2020, and the unemployment rate reaches 4 percent 
in 2020.  In response to the abrupt rise in inflation, the inertial Taylor rule prescribes that the 
federal funds rate rises 50 basis points above baseline in 2019.  After peaking at around 
4¾ percent in 2020, the federal funds rate declines below baseline as inflationary pressures wane 
and resource slack widens. 
5 It is also plausible that the increased market power of firms could lead to larger and more persistent pass-
through of higher oil prices into inflation.  For evidence of increased market power in the advanced economies, see

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  Compared with the September Tealbook, i nflation is 
projected to be a little higher in 2019 , while the output gap is about ¼ percentage point 
narrower  throughout the medium term.  Overall, in response to these revisions, most of 
the strategies prescribe about the same path for the federal funds rate in the near term as 
in the previous Tealbook and a slightly lower path thereafter.  A special exhibit  illustrates 
how macroeconomic outcomes under flexible price-level targeting (FPLT) depend on the 
way the public forms expectations. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the 
“balanced approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993 ) rule, a first -difference rule, and  an FPLT 
rule.  These near -term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation , shown in the middle panels.1  The top and middle 
panel s also  provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate, which is 
constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2 
Relative to the September Tealbook, the staff projects resource utilization to be a 
little less tight and inflation to be a little  higher in the near  term.  Because the effects of 
these changes to the forecast mostly offset each other, the prescriptions of all of the 
policy rules are little changed from the prev ious Tealbook. 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well above the corresponding policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.  The near- term prescriptions of the first-
                                                 
1 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook bas eline projections for these variables instead of 
the output gap.  
2 Except for the first -difference rule,  which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here 
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

 differen ce rule, which only responds incrementally to the change in economic 
conditions, essentially coincide with those of the Tealbook baseline.  
• The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate the cumulative shortfall in the core 
PCE price index of about 2¼ percent  since the end of 2011, prescribes setting 
the federal funds rate below the current target range.  
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL  
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimates of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the September 2018 Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).3  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used 
to generate an estimate of r *.  This concept of r *, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to 
the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting 
in the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation 
objectiv e or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate. 
• At 3. 29 percent , the current- quarter estimate of the Tealbook-consistent 
FRB/US r*  is 18 basis points lower than the value based on  the September 
Tealbook projection, reflecting the staff’s slightly lo wer output gap projection.   
• At 1. 92 percent , the SEP- consistent FRB/US r*  is significantly lower than the 
Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*.  The difference stems from the fact that the 
SEP-consistent projection has output exceeding potential  by a considerably 
smaller amount over the medium term than does the current  Tealbook 
forecast .  This smaller anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the 
median path for the real federal funds rate implied by the SEP projections 
                                                 
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021 (the 
final year reported in the September 2018 SEP), the  economy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from th e 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 averages almost  1 percent age point less than the corresponding path in the 
Tealbook.  
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) rule, the first- difference rule, and 
the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.4  The 
simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and 
wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest  rates and the economy.  
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate steps up about ¼ percent age point over the rest  of this year, increases 1½  percent age points 
next year , and rises, on average, ½ percent age point per year in 2020 and 
2021, reachin g nearly 5  percent  in the fourth quarter of 2021.  This trajectory 
is a little lower than the one in the September Tealbook because of the narrower projected  output gap. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values until early 2022.  This higher path is associated with 
only a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10 -year Treasury yield than in 
the baseline until mid -2020 a nd a slightly lower path thereafter, because the 
Taylor  (1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate 
beyond the period shown.  For the same reason, inflation is somewhat higher than in the baseline projection.  The path for the une mployment rate lies above 
the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years, but it subsequently lies below and takes a bit longer to return to its natural rate.

4 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.

simulations, despite higher levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption that

 • The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sharp increase in the 
federal funds rate.   Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to 
output exceeding its assumed potential level  over the projection period, t he 
prescriptions of this  rule are lower than those of the Taylor  (1999) rule over 
the period shown.  The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook baseline over the next two years, but, starting at the end of 2020, the path for the federal funds rate falls below the baseline path for a 
sustained period.  As a result, inflation is higher, and the re al 10 -year Treasury 
yield is  lower, than their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.  
The more accommodative conditions also engender a lower  unemployment 
rate than in the Tealbook projection beyond the medium term. 
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule lie s 
somewhat above the path in the Tealbook baseline through 2020 but then runs 
below the baseline path for some years , during which the rule reacts to the 
projected decline in the output gap.
6  The associate d lower path for the federal 
funds rate and the expectation of higher inflation in the future imply lower longer- term real interest rates , higher inflation, and lower unemployment than 
in the Tealbook baseline.   
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate,  the shortfall that has 
cumulated since the end of 2011 between  core PCE inflation and  an annual 
rate of 2  percent .  This  rule’s  prescription generates a higher rate of inflation 
in coming years that eventually undoes th e current 2¼ percent age point 
shortfall of the core PCE price index.  T he FPLT rule calls for keeping the 
federal funds rate somewhat  below the current target range until the first  
quarter of 2020 and for keeping it below the federal funds rate path in the Tealbook baseline thro ugh mid -2027.  Because the simulation embeds the 
assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters 
                                                 
price and wage setters perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond 
the next several years and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage 
setting decisions.  The box “Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results under a scenario in which price and wage setters lack such a perfect understanding.  In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non -inertial 
policy rule led to a significant decline in inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate at the start of the simulation in response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

 correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the 
path of the real 10-year Treasury rate drops below the Tealbook baseline for the next six years.  The unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations shown, dropping below 2½ percent  in 2020. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by three specifications of the loss function.7  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a constraint may improve economic outcomes.
8 
The first two  of the three optimal control policies prescribe much high er paths for 
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline projection, for two reasons.  First, high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up to its natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical  experience, the unemployment rate 
does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the FRB/US model.  Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the 
front -loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.  In practice, however, if the FOMC 
were to raise the real federal funds rate as abruptly as in these simulations , wage and 
price setters and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions 
and may anticipate tighter moneta ry policy than policymakers envision, leading to less 
benign macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.
9  By contrast, the third optimal 
control policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels not experienced since 
the 1950s.  Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those 
predicted by the simulations.  
                                                 
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.   Previous Tealbooks also included a 
simulation labeled “Large weight on inflation gap ,” which has been dropped in this Tealbook.  
8 Under the optimal control policies, polic ymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that will not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 • The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s objective  of 2 percent , on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly higher than the Tealbook baseline path.  T his strategy is designed to temper 
the projected sizable undershooting, over the next several years,  by the 
unemployment rate of its natural rate that  occurs  in the Tealbook baseline—an 
outcome tha t policymakers with the equal-weights loss function judge to be 
costly.  The smaller  unemployment gap generates  only moderately lower 
inflation because, as already indicated, the response in the FRB/US model of 
inflation to the current level of resource ut ilization is small.  
• The second simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This simulated policy seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even 
faster than under the equal -weights specification.  The federal funds rate soars  
to 11 percent  by mid -2019 and then averages around 7½ percent  from 2020 
through 2024. 
• The third  simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function that 
assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate 
when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss function is 
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate 
is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path until 2024; it then exceeds the policy rate paths implied by the other two optimal control strategies and the Tealbook baseline starting in mid -2025.  With the 
asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this more accommodat ive 
path for the policy rate because their desire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent  
is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  T he tighter labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent  
than in the case of equal  weights. Beyond the period shown, the

 unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as 
policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization. 
THE IMPLICATIONS OF EXPECTATIONS FOR FLEXIBLE PRICE -LEVEL 
TARGETING :  A RECESSION SCENARIO  
In the September Tealbook , we illustrated that the effectiveness of an FPLT rule 
in stabilizing the economy in a demand-driven recession varies depending on the initial price- level g ap specified in the rule.  The exhibit “The Implications of Expectation s for 
Flexible Price- Level Targeting :  A Recession Scenario” in this Tealbook clarifies that this 
effectiveness also depends on the ability of price and wage setters  to anticipate  changes in 
future  policy.   
In the FRB/US model and other models used for monetary policy analysis, current 
inflation is influenced by monetary policy through two distinct channels.  The first channel operates through the current level of resource utilization, while the second channel operates through expectations of future inflation.  To illustrate the importance of the second channel, w e compare results from simulations of an FPLT rule under two 
different assumptions about expectations formation.  In the first simulation, price and 
wage setters correctly anticipate the future course of monetary policy as well as the 
evolution of the economy , whereas in  the second simulation, they form expectations 
using small- scale statistical models based on historical r elationships.
10  By contrast , in 
both simulations financial market participants correctly anticipate future monetary policy and its economic implications.  The FPLT rule sets the reference date for the target path of the price level  to 2011:Q4, resulting in an initial price-level gap in 2018:Q4 of 
2¼ percent .
11  The implications of these expectations formation assumptions are 
illustrated using the same recession scenario  as in the Monetary Policy Strategies section 
of the September Tealbook.12 
                                                 
10 Expectations formed in this way are often described as “VAR -based expectations” and are 
regularly used in the Risks and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.  
11 The coefficient on the unemployment gap of the FPLT rule in these simulations is chosen to 
deliver the same marginal response to resource utilization as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and is almost 
double the size of the coefficient used in the FPLT rule shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations.”  The appendix in this Tealbook section contains the precise form of the rule.  
12 To construct the scenario, the current Tealbook baseline is subjected to a sequence of negative 
spending shocks starting in 2018:Q4 that raise the unemployment rate by close to the median increase of 
past recessions .

 In the recession scenario  baseline,  the unemployment rate rises to almost 
6 percent  by mid -2020.  PCE inflation drops quickly below 2 percent  and remains below 
the Committee’s objective for an extended period.  The federal funds rate is set accord ing 
to the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule.  
In the simulation “FPLT , model-consistent price and wage expectations ,” the 
policy rate path prescribed by the FPLT rule and its economic implications are correctly 
anticipated by wage and price setters . 
• Given the large inherited price- level gap  (shown in the bottom- right 
panel ), the FPLT rule prescribes a much lower path for the federal  funds 
rate than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule  in the recession baseline. 
• The path of PCE inflation is markedly higher than in th e recession 
baseline, and the price-level gap narrows to negative 1¼ percent  by the 
end of 2024.  The increase in inflation is achieved mainly  through higher 
expectations of future inflation, as price and wage setters anticipate that the path of the federa l funds rate will remain low in the future until the 
price- level gap has been closed . 
• With a more accommodative policy stance than in the recession baseline, real 10 -year Treasury yields are lower and the peak unemployment rate is 
reduced to 5½ percent.  The unemployment rate then falls below its natural rate for an extended period as the FPLT rule continues to prescribe accommodative policy in order to offset past shortfalls in inflation.   
The simulation “FPLT, VAR- based price and wage expectations” is generated 
under the assum ption that the expectations that underlie price - and wage- setting decisions 
are formed using small -scale statistical models based on historical relationships , while 
financial market participants , as before,  correctly anticipate the future evolution of the 
economy and monetary policy.
13  Expectations of this nature can be thought of as arising 
from a situation in which price and wage setters do not understand policymakers’ intention to pursue a target path for the price level.  
• Under t hese assumptions, price and wage setters  fail to anticipate  the full 
extent of policy accommodation prescribed by the FPLT rule in the future, 
                                                 
13 These statistical models are held fixed throughout the simulation and , in pa rticular , do not 
change in response to the adoption of the FPLT rule.

 and thus inflation expectations are lower  than in the previous simulation.  
As a result,  PCE inflation stays belo w 2 percent  until 2024, and the core 
PCE price- level gap does not narrow until 2023. 
• Given the slow er progress in closing the price- level gap, the FPLT rule 
under VAR-ba sed price and wage expectations  prescribes an even lower 
path for the nominal federal funds rate than in the previous simulation .  
With financial market participants correctly anticipating this lower path , 
real 10-year Treasury yields  and the unemployment rate are considerably 
lower than  in the previous simulation.  
• The h igher  levels of resource utilization  are insufficient to  offset the 
effects of the lower inflation expectations of wage and price setters  
relative to the previous simulation , because the response of both current 
and expected inflation to current resource utilization is small.  Even with 
an unemployment rate far  below its natural rate through most of the 
simulation  period, inflation  does not rise enough to fulfi ll the promise of 
closing the price- level  gap for more than a decade.   
Overall, the se simulation s highlight that the effectiveness of flexible price -level 
targeting  depends crucially on expectations formation.  When price and wage setters do 
not understand the future effects  of policy changes , announcing an FPLT strategy with a 
relatively large  price gap at the onset of a recession require s a prolonged period of policy 
accommodation  and very  low levels of unemployment later on, with little gain in terms of 
higher inflation.  The simulations provide an example of a commitment- based policy that 
is designed  to achieve sizable  stabilization benefits by steering  expectations , yet may turn 
out to be undesirable if expectations fail to respond as intended, because the policy then  
induces substantial labor market overheating. 
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular 
model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section.  It also rep orts the expression for the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a small 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  The right -hand- side variables of the first four rules include the staff ’s projection of 
trailing four -quarter core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 
and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three-

  quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of 
policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible 
price -level targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables include an unemployme nt rate gap  and a 
price  gap.  The unemployment gap is defined as the difference between the unemployment rate, 
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡∗.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the 
difference  between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level 
path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, 
subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.  
Simple Rules  
 
The first two rules in the table  were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price  gap like the FPLT  rule ha ve 
been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1  An FPLT rule similar to the one above is 
also analyzed by Chung and others (2014). 
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given th e Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are

A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit  “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r* ” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
2  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations— that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel a re the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r* .  For a give n economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federa l funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which include s the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

  COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor , 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕=� 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉𝑇𝑇

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers three  
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the three  specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in 
the three  specifications.  
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
3  The third  specification, “Asymmetric weight on 
ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment ra te 
is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these three  specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is 
subject to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as

ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.  Loss Functions

decisions made prior to the simulation period.   
THE IMPLICATIONS OF EXPECTATIONS FOR FLEXIBLE PRICE -LEVEL 
TARGETING :  A RECESSION SCENARIO  
The FPLT rule used in the special exhibit is  of the form  
𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 0. 85𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1+ 0. 15(𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+(𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗)−1.85(𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡−𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡∗)). 
The 2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, 
subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.  We set the coefficient on the 
unemployment gap to -1.85, which would imply a coefficient of 1 on the output gap under the Okun’s law relationship assumed by the staff in constructing the Tealbook projection.

Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial
offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
