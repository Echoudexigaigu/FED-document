 Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information that has become a vailable since the previous Te albook indicates 
that the economy continues t o expand at a solid pace.  Real GDP  appears on track to rise 
at a nearly 3 percent annual rate over the second half of the year, bolstered by 
expansionary fiscal policy and a stance of monetary policy that  remains modestly 
supportive.  Meanwhile, the labor market ti ghtened further in O ctober and November, 
and we continue to expect job gain s to proceed at a solid pace in coming months and the 
unemployment rate to edge dow n to 3.5 percent by early next year. 
At the same time, financial mar kets have been volatile, and the  mood of many 
market participants and commentat ors has soured; that deteriora tion is mainly reflected in 
a lower 10-year Treasury rate a nd wider spreads on corporate bonds.  On net, over the 
period since the previous Tealbook, equity prices have risen sl ightly, the dollar has 
appreciated a bit, and house pric es have risen about as expecte d.1  Also, other indicators 
of aggregate demand, such as household and business sentiment, have been little changed 
from the previous projection.  All told, the changes in financial conditioning factors show 
through to a slightly higher  projection for GDP growth.   
This result could feel counterintuitive if  the maintained hypot hesis is that market 
participants must have recognize d some adverse shift in the und erlying fundamentals of 
the economy.  However, that is not the maintained hypothesis of  the staff projection.  
Instead, because we have seen little to no net deterioration in either hard indicators (such as GDP growth or labor market conditions) or soft ones (such as  business surveys and 
consumer sentiment), we assume that the asset price fluctuation s of the past several 
weeks are mostly aberrations that will be largely shrugged off.  In the meantime, because, in our view, the fundamentals have not deteriorated, the lower interest rates in this 
projection provide a modest boost to activity.  That said, we r ecognize that this 
assessment could be incorrect and that economic fundamentals co uld have deteriorated 
significantly.  To illustrate suc h a possibility, the first alt ernative scenario in the Risks 
1 Equity prices rose about 6 percen t during the 10 days between the time when the October 
Tealbook was closed an d the subsequent FOMC meeting.  Relative to their level at the time of the most 
recent FOMC meeting, equity prices  are down about 4 percent.  
Oil prices are another key conditioning factor for the staff fo recast.  Although they have dropped 
sharply, we see the positive effects on consumer spending as la rgely offset by the negative effects on 
domestic oil-sector activity.

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The December Tealbook projection for real GDP growth lies close to both  the Blue 
Chip consensus forecast and the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) median 
forecast for 2018; all three forecasts step down in 2019 and are within a narrow range.  
The staff’s unemployment rate forecast is  in line with the others in 2018 and a touch 
below in 2019 .  The staff projection for measures of price inflation are a lso a bit below  
the Blue Chip consensus and SPF median forecasts in both 2018 and 2019.  
    Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes input from 
about 50 panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both surveys.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the September FOMC meeting.  The following table compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the September  Tealbook.  
Incoming data for real GDP growth and the labor market have come in close to our 
expectations i n the September Tealbook .  Our projection  for real GDP  over the medium term 
has been revised  down  slightly , on net, reflecting somewhat less favorable trajectories for 
overall financial conditions  (lower equity prices  and house prices ), and t he medium -term 
forecast for the unemplo yment rate has  revised up  a little.  All told , resource utilization, as 
measured by  the output gap or the  unemployment  rate  gap, is somewhat less tight than in 
the September Tealbook . 
Our forecast  for core inflation in 2018  and over the medium term is a little below our 
projection in the September Tealbook , based on slightly softer incoming data and a 
modestly higher unemployment rate.  Nonetheless, we continue to expect core inflat ion to 
be close to 2  percent  over the next few years .  Total inflation has revised down more 
noticeably in the second half of this year and is also down next year, based on declining 
crude oil prices .  In 2020 and 2021, total inflation is forecast to come back in line with core 
inflation  and run at 2 percen t.     
The path  for the federal funds rate derived from the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule 
used in our baseline forecast is lower than its trajectory in September, reflecting the 
narrower output gap and lower inflation in this projection.

  and Uncertainty section of this Tealbook outlines one way in which a sharp decline in 
asset valuations could lead to a recession.    
Over the next few years, we exp ect rising interest rates—which thus far appear to 
have exerted only a modest dra g on economic activity, most visibly through declining 
residential investment—to hold down growth more noticeably as m onetary policy 
tightens further and the boost fr om fiscal policy gradually wanes.  We also expect the 
tariffs imposed this year to r estrain growth slightly over the next couple of years.  All 
told, GDP growth is projected t o slow steadily from a 3 percent  pace this year to 
1.4 percent in 2021.   
Despite the brisk pace of growt h this year, the unemployment ra te, which is 
typically a more reliable indicator of tightness in the economy than GDP growth, has 
declined fairly modestly.  We have taken some signal from the labor market that overall 
resource utilization has tightene d a bit more gradually than we  had estimated earlier, so 
we have revised up our estimate  of potential output.  With the projected paths for both 
potential and actual output revis ed up slightly in this projection, the output gap is about 
unrevised, on net, over the medi um term.  We project the output  gap to peak at just below 
3 percent in 2020 and the unemployment rate to bottom out at 3. 4 percent. 
The recent data on inflation have  been slightly below our expec tations. The 
12-month change in core PCE pri ces was 1.8 percent in October, 0.1 percentage point 
lower than we expected in the previous Tealbook.  We forecast c ore inflation to edge 
back up to 1.9 percent by year-e nd and then to run at 2.0 percent over the medium term, 
as labor and product markets ti ghten further.  Total PCE price inflation is projected to be 
slightly below core inflati on through the end of 2019, reflecti ng projected declines in 
consumer energy prices, but to run in line with core inflation thereafter.     
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy 
 The inertial version of the Taylo r (1999) rule that we use in our projection 
calls for the federal funds rate to increase 1¼ percentage poin ts next year, 
¾ percentage point in 2020, and ¼ pe rcentage point in 2021, reaching 
4.7 percent in the fourth quart er of 2021.  This trajectory is a little lower than 
the one in the October Tealbook.

   The size of the SOMA portfolio c ontinues a grad ual and predicta ble decline 
until the Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more 
securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and 
effectively.  Based on the Committee’s discussion as summarized  in the 
November minutes, we now assume t hat the level of reserve balan ces in the 
longer run will be $1 trillion rather than $500 billion. 
Other Interest Rates  
 The 10-year Treasury yield has  declined 15 basis points since t he previous 
Tealbook.  We now project it to ris e from an average of about 3  percent in the 
current quarter to 4.1 percent  by the end of 2021.  Relative to  the October 
Tealbook, our projection of yields i s revised just a touch lowe r by the end of 
the medium term.  
o The federal funds rate is projec ted to rise above the 10-year T reasury rate 
in the third quarter of 2020, similar to the October Tealbook. 
 Both corporate bond yields and mortg age rates are also expected  to move 
noticeably higher over the proj ection period.  The triple-B spr ead is revised 
somewhat higher for the next couple of quarters,  but, thereafte r, the yields on 
corporate securities move essent ially in line with the Treasury  yield.  The 
30-year fixed mortgage rate is revised lower, in line with the 10-year Treasury 
yield. 
Equity Prices and Home Prices 
 Based on market quotes at the end of Tuesday, December 4, equit y prices are 
projected to end the current qua rter 1.7 percent above the leve l in the previous 
forecast, reflecting the net increases in broad equity price in dexes since the 
October Tealbook.  (Note that e quity prices rose about 6 percen t between the 
October Tealbook and the subseque nt FOMC meeting, so prices are  down 
notably since that meeting.)  We forecast that, beyond the curr ent quarter, 
stock prices will rise at an average annual rate of around ½ pe rcent, similar to 
our previous projection.  As has been true for some time, our p rojection for 
stock price appreciation over the medium term is tempered by th e fact that 
equity valuations are  elevated relative to historical norms.

   The rate of increase in house prices has slowed from 6 percent last year to 
4½ percent this year, and we project a further slowing to an av erage pace of 
about 2½ percent over the next thr ee years.  That expectation reflects both the 
projected rise in mortgage rate s and our assessment that house prices currently 
are modestly elevated relative to rents.   
Fiscal Policy 
 We assume that the expansionar y fiscal policies enacted over th e past year 
will continue through the medium term.2  Given these policy assumptions, we 
still estimate that discretionary fiscal policy actions across all levels of 
government will contribute 0.7 percentage point to the rate of growth in 
aggregate demand this year, 0.6 pe rcentage point next year, and  
0.5 percentage point in 2020 (exclusive of any multiplier effects and financial 
offsets).  We then exp ect the impetus from policy actions to st ep down more 
sharply to only 0.2 percentage point in 2021. 
 We expect the federal budget defi cit, which stood at 3½ percent of GDP in 
fiscal year 2017, to widen t o 4¾ percent in fiscal 2019 and 5¾ percent by 
fiscal 2021, with this increase primarily reflecting recent fis cal policy actions 
and the effects of higher intere st rates on debt service costs.   
o We continue to assume that, in the longer run, policymakers wil l gradually 
reduce the federal deficit by an amount sufficient to stabilize  the debt-to-
GDP ratio.  We expect this ra tio to stabilize at around 105 per cent of GDP, 
20 percentage points higher than would have occurred in the absence of recent and projected fiscal policy actions.  This increment to the debt-to-
GDP ratio is assumed to push up the  term premium on 10-year Tre asury 
yields by 50 basis points in the longer run.  
 Legislation to fund roughly one-four th of federal discretionary spending for 
fiscal 2019 has not yet been enacted, and, without further acti on, current 
funding will expire on December 21.  The baseline projection co ntinues to 
assume that funding legislati on will be enacted with no disrupt ion of 
                                                 
2 In particular, our forecast assumes that  the current level of discretionary spending will be 
maintained in real terms in fi scal years 2020 and 2021; realization of that forecast will require enacting 
legislation to lift the discretionary spending caps for those y ears, which would be consistent with fiscal 
policymaker actions in the recent past.

  government operations; however, eve n if a partial shutdown of t he federal 
government were to occur, we judge that the direct macroeconomic 
implications would be small.  
Trade Policy 
 This year, the United States has imposed tariffs equivalent to an effective rate 
of 14.6 percent on roughly $280 billi on of imports, which const itute about 
13 percent of non-oil goods imports.  Major trading partners, i ncluding China, 
have retaliated with higher t ariffs on U.S. goods, affecting ab out 8 percent of 
U.S. goods exports.  In our forecast , these tariffs lower the l evel of U.S. real 
GDP about 0.2 percent (and raise t he unemployment rate 0.1 perc entage 
point) by the end of 2021 and raise the level of core PCE prices by between 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent by 2020. 
 We have not included in our forecast any further prospective ta riff increases.  
The additional 15 percent ta riff increase on about $180 billion  in imports from 
China originally set to take effect on January 1 has been postp oned pending 
further negotiations between the United States and China.
3  We have also not 
adjusted our forecast to reflect any developments concerning th e recently 
signed trade deal between the United States, Mexico, and Canada , which 
remains to be ratified by each country’s legislature.  Given un certainty about 
trade policy, trade development s will likely remain a focus of market attention 
and continue to pose a risk to the economic outlook.        
Foreign Economic Acti vity and the Dollar 
 Real GDP in the foreign economie s is expected to grow at an ann ual rate of 
2¼ percent in the second half of t his year—a touch below its fi rst-half pace—
before picking up slightly next year and then further in 2020 t o a pace close to 
its potential of around 2¾ percent.  Several factors have led u s to revise down 
our forecast a bit over the next  year:  Recent data suggest les s momentum in 
several economies, lower oil prices will weigh on Canada’s pros pects, and 
increased policy concerns in Mexico will be a drag on growth th ere.  
                                                 
3 We estimate that implementing these additional tariffs would roughly lower the level of real 
GDP by an additional 0.1 percent over the medium term and raise  the level of core PCE prices by about 
0.1 percent.  The tota l effect would also depend on how China responded to these additional U.S. tariff 
increases.

   Since the October Tealbook, the  exchange value of the broad nominal dollar 
has risen slightly.  Over the forecast period, we expect the broad real dollar to 
appreciate at an annual rate of  1¾ percent as market expectations for the 
federal funds rate move up towar d the staff’s assumed path.  Th is pace of 
appreciation is close to that in the October Tealbook, leaving our projection 
for the broad real dollar at  the end of 2021 little changed. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil plunged $14 from the time of the October 
Tealbook, closing on December 4 at $62 per barrel.  Farther-dat ed futures 
prices also dropped, by about $6 per barrel, and the futures pa th through 2021 
is now about flat.  The box “The Recent Fall in Oil Prices” dis cusses oil 
market developments in depth.     
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We expect real GDP to increase at  a solid annual rate of almost 3 percent in the 
second half of this year, essentia lly unrevised from the October Tealbook and only 
slightly less than the 3¼ percent pace of the first half.  With in the second half, real GDP 
growth slows from a 3½ percent p ace in the third quarter to 2¼ percent in the fourth 
quarter, with a swing in inventory investment more than account ing for the deceleration.  
For the first quarter of 2019, we expect GDP to expand at an an nual rate of 2½ percent as 
consumer spending moderates from its strong second-half pace.         
 Recent data on consumer spending have been solid—indeed, strong er than we 
had expected in the previous T ealbook.  Spending is being suppo rted by solid 
gains in labor income, wealth g ains from earlier increases in e quity prices and 
home values, the tax cuts, fa vorable consumer sentiment, and, more recently, 
declines in gasoline prices.  We  expect real PCE to rise at a m ore moderate 
pace in the first quarter of next year and throughout 2019.  Ou r projection for 
a modest slowing in household spending growth next year relativ e to recent 
years is consistent with r ising interest rates.   
 After rising at a rapid clip in the first half of the year, bus iness fixed 
investment is estimated to have  been surprisingly subdued in the third quarter.  
Growth in investment in equipmen t and intangibles slowed from i ts first-half 
pace, while investment in nonresid ential structures declined.  But the quarterly

  investment data are quite volat ile, and, with unfilled orders o f nondefense 
capital goods excluding aircraft rising, we expect investment g rowth to pick 
back up to a solid pace this quart er and next.  We see investme nt currently 
being supported by the acceleration in business output this yea r, still-favorable 
readings on business sentiment a nd profit expectations for capi tal goods 
producers, and the effects of last  year’s tax cuts.  However, a s output growth 
slows and interest rates rise next year, investment growth is expected to 
soften.  
 Residential investment has bee n declining this year, likely ref lecting the 
effects of the substantial increa se in mortgage interest rates since last year, 
which has reduced affordability and damped consumers’ perceptio ns of 
homebuying conditions.  Constructi on spending for new homes edged down 
in the second and third quarters, and the October data on start s and permits 
suggest further declines are in train.  Meanwhile, the forward- looking 
indicators of housing demand have been decidedly negative, and we have downgraded our already-weak sal es outlook accordingly.  In all,  we now 
project that residential invest ment will decline further in the near term.   
 Net exports are projected to subt ract 1 percentage point from G DP growth 
over the second half of this y ear after adding ½ percentage poi nt in the first 
half.  The swing is partly attri butable to fluctuations in soyb ean exports, 
though dollar appreciation has als o played a role.  Next year, net exports are 
expected to exert a ¼ percenta ge point drag on GDP growth as th e dollar 
appreciates further. 
 Manufacturing production is on tr ack to rise at a robust pace i n the second half 
of this year before decelerati ng somewhat early next year.  The softening next 
year primarily reflects a step- down in motor vehicle production  to a still-solid

4 General Motors recently announce d plans to close five plants i n North America as  part of a long-
run strategy to pare excess production capacity.  Two of the pl ants are U.S. assembly plants that account for 
approximately 19 percent of GM’s motor vehicle assembly capacit y in the United States (and 4 percent of 
overall U.S. assembly capacity ).  These two facilities produce sedans, a vehicle type for which demand has 
weakened sharply in recent years as tastes have shifted and gas oline prices have remained low.  GM’s 
move does not appear to reflect the recent steel tariffs or new  concerns about current or expected overall

 The Recent Fall in Oil Prices  
Oil prices have dropped  by about one- third since early October, with the spot price 
of Brent crude oil falling  from just over $86 per barrel to about $62 per barrel at the 
close of trading on December 4  (figure 1) .  About $14  of the decline has occurred  
since the October Tealbook.  Futures prices have also fallen, though by a lesser 
amount, such that the futures curve over the next three years is now flat .  Given 
recent markdowns in forecasts of global growth and oil consumption, concerns 
over the strength of global demand  have  likely played some role in the price 
change.  However, partly because metals prices —which are often correlated with 
global demand —have been relatively stable, staff models attribute most  of the 
decline to a stronger outlook for oil supply . 
The decline in prices partly reflects an easing of some of the factors that pushed up 
oil prices by almost $15 per barrel in late summer.   In particular, prices rose  in 
September as t he United States  moved to reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil 
exports starting in November, potentially removing  a large quantit y of oil from  the 
global marke t.  However, once it became clear in early October that increases in 
Russian and OPEC production —both now at record levels —would be enough to 
cover the expected loss  of Iranian exports, prices started falling.  Additionally, 
when the Iranian sanctions took effect in early November, the United States  
unexpectedl y granted  temporary sanctions waivers to major buyers  of Iranian oil 
(including China and India), lead ing short -term oil prices  to fall even  further.  
Robust U.S. oil production and inventory accumulation also have been pushing oil 
prices down.  Despite infrastructure bottlenecks and rising costs, the U.S. shale 
boom has contin ued apace, and the United States  recently bec ame the largest 
crude oil producer in the world  (figure 2).  In recent months, U.S. production rose  
to close to 12  million barrels per day (mb/d), up nearly 2 mb/d from a year ago and 
1 mb/d above U.S. Department of Energy  (DOE)  projections from a year ago.

 Moreover, the DOE has repeatedly revised up its forecasts of U.S. production for 
2019, including significant upward revis ions in October and November.  Finally , U.S. 
inventories have risen for 10 straight weeks as of late November and are at their 
highest level of 2018. 
We expect oil prices  to remain around current levels through 2021, in part 
supported by a December 7 agreement between OPEC and Russia to address the 
growing supply glut by cutting production.  Relative to the October Tealbook, we 
have revised down  our forecast for the price of imported oil at the end of 2021  by 
about $ 6 per barrel, about half of the decline in spot prices.   
The recent decline in oil prices is expected to have only a modest  net effect on 
aggregate demand in the United States .  To begin with , lower oil prices redistribute 
real income from oil producers to oil consumers.  Given that  the United States  
consumes more than it produces —though by much less than even in the recent 
past —lower oil prices provide a boost to aggregate spending:  Lower prices 
increase households’ purchasing power and boost  consumption  and, if large and 
persistent  enough, could  boost potential output in the non -energy -producing 
sectors of the economy by reducing the cost of a key input.  However, the  effect on 
consumption will likely be offset  somewhat by a drag on capital spending in the 
large and growing U.S. oil sector.  A dditionally, lower prices will lead to lower 
domestic oil production and , thus, a higher volume of imports .   
Overall, taking these different factors into account, the decline in oil prices since 
the October Tealbook has raised our forecast of the level of GDP three years  from 
now by only about 5 basis points .1  As for consumer prices, as a result of changes in 
energy prices, our forecast for the level of total PCE prices  is lower by 0.2 percent  
by the end of 2019  and about 0.1  percent by the end  of 2021.

  indicators of factory activity fro m the national and regional m anufacturing 
surveys remain consistent with f urther moderate gains in manufacturing 
production in the coming months.  
Our medium-term GDP outlook is very similar to the one in the O ctober 
Tealbook.  We project that real GDP growth will slow roughly ½ percentage point per 
year, from 3 percent this y ear to 1½ percent in 2021.  The grad ual deceleration primarily 
reflects the ongoing tighteni ng of monetary policy and waning f iscal impetus.   
 We do not view the recent volatility  in financial markets to ha ve been 
sufficiently elevated to affect our projection other than throu gh conventional 
channels such as the wealt h effect on household spending, the cost-of-capital 
effect on business investment, and t he usual interest rate sensitivity of 
residential investment and consumer durables.     
 We assume that potential GDP grow th will edge up from 1.8 perce nt in 2018 
to 1.9 percent in 2021, as structural  productivity accelerates.   The output gap 
is projected to widen from 2.2 percent this quarter to 2.9 perc ent by 2020 
before easing in 2021. 
 With the federal government exp ected to run historically large and rising 
deficits over the medium term, t he national saving rate is proj ected to trend 
downward.  Nevertheless, private do mestic investment as a share of the 
economy is roughly flat over the me dium term.  The widening gap  between 
domestic investment and nationa l saving is financed by increased inflows of 
foreign capital.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
The October and November employm ent reports indicated that labo r market 
conditions continued to tighte n about as we had expected.  Payr oll growth was solid, the 
unemployment rate held steady a t 3.7 percent in November, and the labor force 
participation rate (LFPR) rose to 62.9 percent.    
                                                 
motor vehicle demand.  As the two  plants are not slated to clos e until mid-2019 at the earliest, we expect 
any effects on manufacturing output to occur well into the medi um term; because utilization at those plants 
is low, we also expect the effects to be small.

   According to the BLS, total nonfar m payrolls increased about 17 0,000 per 
month over the most recent three months—close to what we antici pated in the 
previous Tealbook.  As a result, we made no material changes to  our near-
term forecast.  Excluding the e ffects of the recent hurricanes,  we expect that 
payroll gains will average about 190,000 per month both this qu arter and next, 
well above the pace of 95,000–125,000 that we estimate is consi stent with 
unchanged resource utilization.5  
 Data that we analyze from the pa yroll processing firm ADP (see the exhibit 
“Labor Market Developments and O utlook (1)”) are a little stron ger than the 
BLS readings of private payrol l growth in recent months.  
 The unemployment rate has declined less—and the LFPR has been h igher—
than we would have expected give n output growth this year and o ur previous 
assumption about its potential growth rate.  Consequently, we nudged up our 
estimate of potential output, a nd thereby reduced the output ga p slightly, by 
raising our assumed trend in the LFP R over the past few years.  By the current 
quarter, the level of the t rend LFPR, at 62.6 percent, is 0.1 p ercentage point 
higher than in the past Tealbook.       
We expect the labor market t o continue to tighten through early  2020, consistent 
with above-trend output growth.  W e also continue to assume that, in an extremely tight 
labor market, the projected declin e in the unemployment rate wi ll be attenuated, with a 
larger-than-usual amount of the tightening in labor utilization  manifested in a higher 
LFPR and a smaller-than-usual amount in a lower unemployment ra te.  In 2021, with 
output growth projected to slow be low its potential growth rate, the unemployment rate 
edges up while the LFPR turns down.  
 The unemployment rate is projected to decline from 3.7 percent in the fourth 
quarter of this year to 3.4 per cent by late next year.  By 2021 , with GDP 
growth slowing below potential, t he unemployment rate starts to turn up and 
ends that year at 3.5 percent—still 1 percen tage point below ou r estimate of its 
natural rate.  Over the next f ew years, our forecast for the un employment rate 
                                                 
5 We estimate that recent hurricanes depressed job gains by abou t 15,000 per month in the third 
quarter and pushed them up by a similar amount in the fourth qu arter.

  is revised up about 0.1 p ercentage point rela tive to the Octobe r Tealbook, as 
we now assume the declines will be somewhat more attenuated. 
 The LFPR is projected to hol d steady at 62.9 percent through th e end of 2020 
before gradually declining.  Wit h the trend participation rate expected to 
decline a little less than 0.2 percentage point per year, we project that the 
LFPR gap will widen from ¼ percentage point at the end of 2018 to 
½ percentage point in 2020. 
 Average monthly total payroll ga ins slow gradually in the proje ction, from 
about 190,000 in the second half of this year to about 85,000 in 2021.   
 We project that labor productivit y will increase a little more than 1 percent per 
year, on average, over the forecast period.  As in recent Tealb ooks, we project 
actual productivity to rise more slowly than our estimate of its structural pace, 
reflecting our view that labor productivity is mildly countercy clical, likely 
because workers hired in a tight labor market tend to have lowe r productivity, 
on average, than workers hi red during a slack one. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Although core PCE price inflation through October came in sligh tly below 
expectations, we continue to pr oject that the 12-month change i n core prices will be 
1.9 percent over the next few mont hs, unrevised from the Octobe r Tealbook.6  However, 
the recent declines in oil prices  led us to reduce our forecast  for the 12-month changes in 
total PCE prices in the coming months by a few tenths, to around 1.7 percent.  Our 
projection continues to incorporate a modest boost to core PCE price inflation in the 
current quarter and the first ha lf of next year from the tariffs implemented this year. 
 Given the recent declines in c rude oil prices, we lowered noticeably our PCE 
energy price inflation forecast through 2019.  We now anticipat e that 
consumer energy prices will decline notably in November and Dec ember and 
another 3.5 percent in 2019.  We project consumer energy prices  to move 
                                                 
6 Although the 12-month change in core PCE prices is expected to  be 1.9 percent in both 
November and December, the four- quarter change in 2018 rounds t o 1.8 percent.

  roughly sideways over the remainde r of the medium term, consistent with the 
projection for oil prices to remain about flat. 
 Core import prices are exp ected to be little changed, on net, i n the second half 
of 2018, following a moderate increase in the first half.  The second-half 
slowing reflects the effects of  dollar appreciation and lower c ommodity 
prices.  Beyond this year, import  prices are expected to rise o nly modestly, 
consistent with moderate forei gn inflation and a gradually appreciating dollar.   
o Published import price indexes exclude tariffs.  However, tarif fs add to the 
prices that purchasers of impor ts actually pay—that is, effecti ve import 
prices.  We estimate that the tariffs implemented this year wil l boost the 
level of effective import pr ices by 2 percent by the end of 201 9, which 
should also boost the level of core PCE prices by between 0.1 p ercent and 
0.2 percent by 2020.   
The latest readings on survey- and market-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations suggest t hat expectations remain well an chored. 
 In the preliminary December repor t from the University of Michigan Surveys 
of Consumers, the median of inf lation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years 
was 2.4 percent, in the range obs erved in the past couple of ye ars. 
 Median 10-year inflation expecta tions for PCE prices in the Sur vey of 
Professional Forecasters remained at 2.0 percent in the fourth quarter.   
 The November reading on median t hree-year-ahead expected inflation from 
the Federal Reserve Bank of New  York’s Survey of Consumer Expec tations 
edged down to 2.9 percent, also withi n the range of readings in  recent years.   
 Finally, TIPS-based measures of i nflation compensation have mov ed down 
since the October Tealbook. 
We project that core inflati on will edge up to 2.0 percent in 2 019 and remain there 
through 2021.  The projected step-up next year primarily reflec ts the further tightening in 
resource utilization as well as the small upward drift that we have assumed will occur in 
underlying inflation.  Given the a ssumed trajectory of oil pric es, total inflation is

  projected to run slightly bel ow core inflation through 2019 but  in line with core inflation 
thereafter.   
 Relative to the October Tealbook f orecast, core inflation is un revised over the 
medium term, while total i nflation is revised down in 2019 and up in 2020 and 
2021, reflecting the ener gy price revisions.   
With labor demand remaining strong,  we continue to expect that the pace of 
increases in hourly labor compensation will move up in the medi um term, as firms try to 
retain workers and fill job v acancies in part by raising wages and benefits.  
 The employment cost index (ECI) fo r private-sector workers increased at an 
annual rate of 3 percent over th e three months ending in Septem ber, 
¾ percentage point higher than our forecast in the October Tealbook.  We 
now expect it will increase 3 pe rcent in 2018.  Given the ECI’s  relatively 
muted cyclical sensitivity, we e xpect it will continue rising a t about a 
3 percent pace throughout the medium term.7   
 Compensation per hour (CPH) in the  business sector is estimated  to have risen 
2¼ percent over the four quart ers ending in 2018 :Q3, ½ percenta ge point 
below our estimate in the Oct ober Tealbook, reflecting a sizabl e downward 
revision to compensation in the  second quarter.  Given the extr emely volatile 
nature of the series, we have not taken any signal from that su rprise, and thus 
we continue to project that CPH growth will step up to a roughl y 4 percent 
pace from 2019 through 2021.  
 Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months end ing in 
November, a touch higher than wha t we projected in the October Tealbook.  
 The October reading of the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker ca me in at 
3.7 percent, near the upper end of t he range seen over recent y ears. 
                                                 
7 If, indeed, the ECI increases 3  percent in 2018, it will have risen a little more than our models 
would have expected, based on the explanatory variables they ta ke into account.  Our forecast for the 
growth in the ECI measure of compensation remains at 3 percent,  despite tightening resource utilization, 
because we assume that the unexplained portion of the increase in 2018 does not persist.

  THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment wil l be 
4.6 percent, and that potential output growth will be 1.7 perce nt per year in the 
longer run. 
 We have maintained our assumption t hat the real equilibrium fed eral funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be ½ percent.  Th e nominal yield on 
10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent in the  longer run.   
 We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will continue to 
put downward pressure on longer-te rm interest rates, though to a diminishing 
extent over time.  The SOMA portf olio is expected to be at a no rmal size by 
mid-2020.  This date is about one ye ar earlier than in the Octo ber Tealbook 
due to the upward revision to our a ssumption about the size of reserve 
balances in the longer run.   
 With these assumptions, real GDP growth slows further to slightly above 1 percent from 2022 to 2024, as the federal funds rate is above its neutral level and the boost to growth from fis cal policy fades.  The unemploy ment rate 
moves up gradually from 3½ percen t at the end of 2021 toward its assumed 
natural rate in subsequent years .  PCE price inflation remains close to 
2 percent throughout. 
 With resource utilization easi ng only slowly and  inflation remaining close to 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate moves 
down gradually from 4¾ percent at  the end of the medium term to ward its 
longer-run value of 2½ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Slowing economic growth abroad this year, compared with the brisk expansion in 
2017, has led to mounting concerns  about the health of the global economy .  We take 
these concerns seriously, but as described in the box “ Are Foreign Economies Heading 
for Recession? ” we do not view a sharp downturn in the forecast period as the most likely 
scenario, as  most indicators point to continued moderate growth going forward.  In fact, 
foreign real GDP growth in the third quarter picked up to an estimated 2¼ percent at an 
annual rate from 2  percent in the second quarter.  Growth was buoyed by a sharp rebound 
in activity in Mexico  and South America, which more than offset slowdowns in the 
advanced foreign economies (AFEs)  and China.  In the fourth  quarter, we expect foreign 
growth to edge up to 2½ percent and rise a bit more later in the forecast period , averaging 
in line with potential.   
Although we continue to project moderate growth abroad, the third- quarter pickup 
was ¼ percentage point weaker than expected , partly reflecting some transitory 
developments, including auto retooling in Germany and natural disasters in Japan.  W e 
also revised down somewhat our forecast  through the end of 2019 in light of weaker 
leading indicators in several economies , the effect of lower oil prices on Canadian 
prospects, and increased concerns  about Mexican economic policies. 
With the revision to the forecast for this Tealbook coming on the heels of earlier 
markdowns, it is possible  that growth momentum abroad will dissipat e more rapidly than 
we anticipate, perhaps abetted by ongoing volatility in financial markets.  Such a scenario is discussed in the “Foreign Slowdown” alternative simulation in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook.  We also remain attentive to  the risks  that are 
contributing to the financial volatility .  First, the withdrawal agreement between the 
European Union ( EU) and the U nited Kingdom appears  likely to fail a vote in the U.K. 
parliament on December 11, and thus the specter  of a hard Brexit may  haunt us for some 
time.  Second, notwithstanding a temporary truce on further tariff increases following 
talks between President Trump and President Xi at the recent G-20 summit, tensions over trade policy remain and could intensify , leading  to larger disruptions to global trade than 
we currently  forecast.  Third, concerns about Italy’s public finances persist , even though 
the country’s sovereign spreads have narrowed of late .  Fourth, although financial

 Are Foreign Economies Heading for Recession?  
Economic data from abroad have continued to come in weak er than expected, prompting 
analysts to mark  down their  growth  forecasts .  The prospect  of slower growth , together with  a 
heightened focus  on downside risks , raises concerns that  foreign econ omies might be  heading 
for recession .  Here we examine the likelihood  that  a steep  downturn abroad  is in the offing.   
The staff outlook  for foreign growth  is fairly similar to that of  outside forecasters , though for 
some key economies such as the euro area, it  noticeably less optimistic  (table 1).  Aggregate 
growth i n the advanced foreign economies (AFE s) is estimated to have slowed signi ficantly  in 
2018.  We , along with  outside analysts , see AFE growth remaining near its estimated potential 
pace next year, but only with the support of highly accommodative monetary policy.  In the 
emerging market economies (EMEs), growth has barely slowed ; emerging Asia has continued to 
expand at a solid pace, offsetting  Latin America’s continued  underperform ance .  
More worrisome is the fact that both Board staff and other forecasters have been revising down 
their outlook s repeatedly over the course of 2018.  However, these revisions  appear more likely to 
be an artifact of the temporary surge in growth in 2017 rather than a harbinger of a further slide 
downward.  Figure 1 shows  the evolution of the staff forecast  for foreign growth  in 2018 .  The 
surprising strength of 2017 led us to revise up our growth forecasts, while the subsequent 
weakness of data releases pushed our forecast back down.  Overall, our forecast for foreign 
growth in 2018 has returned to the neighborhood of where it was a year ago.  
Incoming  data have been consistent with the moderation of foreign growth that we have been 
anticipating  but have not signaled a more pronounced downturn.  Figure 2  plots two summary 
measures of the health of the foreign economie s.  The FCI (in black) is a foreign conditions index, 
which  is constructed using data on foreign industrial production, foreign retail sales, the new 
export orders component of foreign PMIs, and foreign GDP growth.1  The FSI (in blue)  is a foreign 
financial stress  index  constructed from the first principal component of country -specific financial

 variables , such as interest rate spreads as well as equity and bond volatilities.  Both series are 
highly correlated with the business cycle, with the FCI dropping markedly in foreign recessions 
and the FSI rising notably .  In recent months, the  FCI edged down slightly and the FSI rose a bit, 
but neither index showed  the large movements that typically precede recessions.  
To quantify the risk of a sharp downturn in the foreign economies, we estimat e a probit model 
that computes the probability  of a foreign recession based on the evolution of the FCI  and the FSI 
indexes.  As shown in figure 3 , current estimates point to  only  a small increase in the recession 
probability since the October Tealbook.  O f course, uncertainty around these estimates is large, 
reflecting the difficulty in predicting cyclical turning points , given that recession s are infrequent 
episodes.  In addition, these estimates sometimes turn upward only shortly before the oncoming 
recession, as was the case on the eve of the Global Financial Crisis.  
Summing up, we do not see much evidence that a foreign recession is imminent.  The weakening 
of foreign growth appears to reflect a reversal of last year’s unsustainable surge rather than a 
more sustained deterioration, and our baseline has the foreign economies expand ing near 
potential over the medium run.  That said, our ability to predict recessions is admittedly poor, and 
we recog nize that  downside risks have become more prominent.

conditions in emerging market  economies (EMEs)  have eased a bit  recently, the risk 
remains of a sharper than expected slowdown in China and renewed deterioration in 
EMEs more broadly in the context of rising global interest rates, as discussed in the box 
“The Effects of U.S. Monetary Policy on Emerging Market Economies.”   
The sharp decline in oil prices has been mainly the consequence of a reduction in  
supply concerns, as discussed in the box “The Recent Fall in Oil Prices” in the Domestic 
Economic Developments and Outlook section .  This decline should have little net effect  
on foreign growth, as the positive effect on oil importers roughly offset s a drag on oil 
exporters  including Canada.  However, lower oil prices should reduce inflationary 
pressures , easing the need to raise rates in the future.  Central banks in Mexico, Korea, 
the Philippines, and Indonesia raised policy rates during the intermeeting period, citing concerns about inflation and exchange rate depreciation.        
In the AFEs, underlying inflation pressures are still  subdued, especially in the 
euro area and Japan, where core inflation has continued to linger near 1  percent and 
½ percent, respectively.  As such, we continue to assume that AFE monetary policy will generally  remain accommodative, with the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank 
of Japan (BOJ) waiting until late 2019 and the second half of 2020, respectively, to begin raising their policy rates .  Even the Bank of Canada (BOC) is now assumed to wait until 
the second quarter of 2019 to resume tightening policy , given the projected drag on 
activity from the lower oil prices.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro area.  T he sharp step -down in r eal GDP growth to 0.7 percent in the third 
quarter from 1.8 percent in the second took us by surprise, with growth coming in almost 1  percentage point below our October Tealbook forecast.  Temporary factors 
contributed to this slowdown, with German car production held down by complications in meeting new emission standards .  Some recovery  in German car 
production in October and November supports our forecast of a rebound in growt h in 
the fourth quarter.  In contrast, in Italy , weak indicators  highlight the negative  real 
effect  of elevated financial stress and suggest that Italian activity will continue to 
stagnate.  In addition, the region’s PMIs slid further through November, tho ugh 
remain ing well in the expansionary range.  Despite the downbeat data , we expect  
euro-area growth to step up to a near-potential pace of 1½ percent this  quarter  and 
remain near that pace in 2019, as weaker momentum is offset by a boost from low er

oil prices .  Growth should edge up further to 1¾ percent in 2020, as financial stresses 
in Italy ease.    
We estimate that headline inflation will fall from 2 .5 percent in  the third quarter to 
about 1 percent in the fourth because of  lower oil prices and a  step-down in core 
inflation .  With retail energy prices declining a bit further, headline inflation should 
fall to ¾ percent in the first half of 2019.  Thereafter, as energy prices bottom out and 
resource slack is eliminated, inflation should increase to 1¾ percent by 2021.  We 
continue to assume that the ECB  will cease net asset purchases by year -end and w ait 
until late 2019 to begin raising its deposit rate, reaching ¼ percent by  2021. 
• United Kingdom.  Real GDP accelerated to a pace of 2.5 percent in the third quarter 
from 1.6 percent in the second, partly boosted by temporary factors such as favorable 
weather conditions.  I ncoming indicators, including retail sales and PMIs , suggest the 
economy has lost some steam , and we project that growth will moderate  to 
1½ percent ( a tad below potential) in the current quarter.   
In November, the United Kingdom and the E U signed a w ithdrawal a greement and 
declared  their intention to maintain  a close economic partnership after Brexit.  
Considerable uncertainty about the ratification process remains ; the U.K. parliament 
is likely to vote against the a greement in a first vote on December 11 , though we 
continue to assume ratification before the U nited Kingdom ’s scheduled exit at the end  
of March  2019.  Even after March , key aspects of the future trade relationship are 
likely to remain unresolved.  Still, in our baseline, with a transition agreement in 
place and monetary policy normalization proceeding quite gradually , U.K. growth 
picks up to a little above 1¾  percent in  2019 and stays at about that pace through the 
forecast period.  Relative to the October Tealbook, this forecast is a bit stronger, 
largely owing to the boost from lower oil prices. 
Despite the stronger growth outlook, we continue to assume that Brexit- related 
concerns will keep policy normalization gradual, with the BOE raising  its Bank Rate 
from its  current level at 0.75 percent to  only 1¾ percent by 2021, at which time it will 
start reducing the size of its balance sheet.  
• Japan.  Real GDP surprisingly declined 1.2 percent in the third quarter.  However, 
the contraction was largely due to temporary disruptions caused by a series of natural disasters, including an earthquake in September.  Recent data have been mixed.

 The Effects of U.S. Monetary Policy on Emerging Market Economies  
The sharp deterioration of financial conditions in some vulnerable emerging market economies 
(EMEs ) in recent months has drawn heightened attention to the question of how ongoing policy 
tightening by the Federal Reserve will affect EMEs .  Here we consider this question by drawing on 
evidence from historical episodes as well as model simulations.1   
U.S. policy tightening s during the 1980s and early 1990s w ere often associated with considerable 
EME financial distress  and a pronounced  slowing of EME GDP growth.  These adverse effects 
largely reflected substantial EME vulnerabilities:  large fiscal deficits, high levels of dollar-
denominated debt, rigid exchange rate regimes , and poorly anchored inflation expectations  that 
forced EME central banks to tighten aggressively in response to currency depreciation.  In addition, EMEs were hurt because U.S. policy t ightenings tended to be  abrupt and often driven by 
concerns about high U.S. inflation, which, by lowering U.S. activity, also reduced EME exports (as 
during the Volcker disinflation  episode).     
However, EMEs generally experienced more- benign outcomes during the U.S. tightening cycles 
that began in 1999, 2004, and 2015.  I mprovements in monetary and fiscal policy frameworks in 
many EMEs, including a shift to inflation targeting and more flexible exchange rates, played an 
important role i n these better outcomes, as did the more predictable and growth -driven nature 
of U.S. policy tightening.  Going forward, it seems likely that pressures on EMEs would be similarly limited if U.S. policy  rates roughly follow ed the path expected by financial markets .  As seen in 
figure 1, the mean Blue Chip forecast (the black line) has U.S. short -term interest rates plateauing 
around 3 percent next year.  But what if the path of U.S. policy rates is significantly steeper as 
under the staff forecast ? 
To explore this question, we use an open economy general equilibrium model that captures  key 
EME vulnerabilities, including the possibility that balance sheets weaken  because of  currency 
depreciation and that inflation expectations are poorly anchored.  The model i s calibrated to 
differentiate between Asian and Latin American EMEs, with the latter regarded as more 
vulnerable.  
We first consider the case in which the faster U.S. interest rate hikes are driven by stronger U.S. 
activity.  Specifically, our “ Stronger U.S. Demand” scenario uses the Blue Chip forecast as a 
baseline and then incorporates favorable U.S. demand shocks to match the lower path for the 
U.S. unemployment rate in the October Tealbook  (the red dashed line in figure 2 ).  This more 
favorable outlook for unemployment implies a rise in the federal funds rate to about 4½  percent  
(the red dashed line in figure 1 ), similar to the assumption in the staff forecast .

Fiscal Policies on Emerging Market Economies,” m emorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, Division of International Finance , October 26 .  The simulations reported here are taken fro m th e memo.

 Output in the Asian EMEs (figure 3) rises relative to baseline as stronger net exports —beca use of  
higher U.S. activity and a depreciation of their currencies —more than offset a slight tightening of 
financial conditions  in these economies .  While Latin Amer ican  net exports also rise, financial 
conditions in those economies tighten enough that their GDP contract s modestly  relative to 
baseline (figure 4).  In particular, currency depreciation weakens  corporate balance sheets by 
boosting the local currency value of foreign debt and induces Latin American central banks to 
tighte n aggressively to mitigate inflationary pressures.   
The second scenario assumes that the stronger demand in the first scenario is accompanied by a 
steepening  of the Phillips c urve, which pushes U.S. inflation to 2¾ percent by early 2022 (not 
shown) and th e funds rate to over 5 percent  (green line in figure 1 ).  While EME net exports still 
improve relative to baseline, EME financial conditions tighten substantially and cause  a 
pronounced slowing  in EME  GDP,  especially in the more vulnerable Latin America n economies .  
All told, these simulations support our view  that most EMEs will likely weather the further 
increases in U.S. interest rates assumed in the staff outlook, which are driven by continued solid 
growth of the U.S. economy.  Even in the growth -driven scenario, however, we cannot rule out 
the possibility of disruptive effects, especially on more vulnerable EMEs .  Moreover, if U.S. 
inflation surprises on the upside and leads to even more monetary tightening  than assumed in 
our forecast , the probability of more widespread financial distress and economic downturns in 
the EMEs would rise significantly.

Exports and industrial production re bounded in October, while the manufacturing 
PMI fell to a two -year low in November.  All told, we project that growth will 
rebound to 2 percent in the current quarter before settling near its potential pace of 
¾ percent thereafter.  Relative to the October  Tealbook, the growth outlook is 
somewhat stronger on a boost from lower oil prices, given Japan’s high dependency on oil imports. 
Sizable increases in food and energy prices boosted inflation to 2.7 percent last 
quarter , but c ore inflation was only 0.4 percent.  Given the recent  plunge in oil prices, 
we project overall inflation to sharply decline, falling to 0  percent in early 2019.  
Thereafter, we expect  elevated resource utilization will gradually push up inflation 
over the forecast period, though onl y to about 1 percent, given inflation expectations 
remain well below the BOJ’s 2 percent target.  Thus , we still have  Japanese monetary 
policy remain ing highly accommodative.  
• Canada.  Real GDP growth slowed  to 2 percent in the third quarter from a 2¼  percent 
first-half pace, as private consumption growth fell  and investment contracted.  With 
the plunge in oil prices weighing further on investment, we expect GDP growth to 
decline to 1¾ percent in 2019 before edging up to almost 2 percent in 2020.  The fall 
in oil prices has led us to revise down growth almost ½  percentage point next year. 
Headline inflation has been running a bit above the BOC’s 2 percent target  but should 
be pushed down in the near term by the drop in oil prices.  Thereafter, with current readings of core inflation near 2  percent and a slightly positive output gap, headline 
inflation is projected to hover around 2 percent.  Given the markdown in growth, we now expect the BOC to wait until mid -2019 to tighten policy further, one quarter late r 
than assumed in the October Tealbook.  Still, with inflation near target and a relatively tight labor market , the BOC is expected to raise its policy rate from the 
current 1.75 percent rate to 3  percent  (our estimate of Canada’s neutral rate) by 
late 2020. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China .  After slowing to 5.9 percent in the third  quarter, reflecting an earlier 
tightening of credit policy, China’s real GDP growth is expected to pick up to 6¼ percent this  quarter.  The improvement partly reflects a turnaround in 
infrastructure investment, given a loosening of  restrictions on local government

spending.  So far, exports have held up surprisingly well, in part as exporters  front -
ran U.S. tariffs  more than we expected .  Going forward , we expect the tari ffs already 
in place to weigh on exports and growth, and trade tensions more broadly will remain 
a major risk .1  The Chinese economy also faces headwinds from a deterioration in the 
housing market and a fall  in equity prices , which ha ve undermined consumer 
confidence.  These downdrafts should be only partially offset by fiscal stimulus, including recently announced tax cuts.  W e see growth slow ing to about 6 percent in 
2019 and 2020 and to 5¾ percent in 2021.  Relative to the October Tealbook, this forecast is down one-tenth in the current quarter and ¼ percentage point in the first quarter of 2019—mainly reflecting payback on the strength of exports in recent months—and up a touch in the rest of 2019. 
Inflation stepped up sharply to about 4 percent in the third quarter from ¾  percent in 
the second as an outbreak of African swine fever and adverse weather conditions 
caused pork and vegetable prices , respectively,  to spike.  As these factors fade, we 
expect inflation to settle at 2½  percent.  
• Other Emerging Asia.  Real GDP growth in the region remained at an unusually low 
2½ percent last  quarter , well below our October Tealbook projection.  A rebound in 
exports from the very weak second quarter had led us to expect a significant pickup in growth.  However, a puzzling surge in imports in the region caused net exports to weaken , which was only partly offset by a modest pickup in domestic demand.  W e 
expect domestic demand to strengthen, boosted by low oil prices and fiscal stimulus 
in some countries.  We also expect export growth to remain relatively robust, 
although recent declines in PMIs and new export orders led us to revise down the near-term outlook slightly.  All told, we see growth picking up to 3½ percent in the 
current quarter and remain ing at about that pace over the forecast period.     
• Mexico.   Real GDP rose  3.4 percent in the third quarter after falling 0.4 percent in the 
second , beating our expectations by 1¼ percentage points.  Growth was driven by 
robust performance in the se rvice sector.  The demand -side components have not 
been released yet , but monthly data indicate that exports accelerated, particularly 
automotive, which were up 30 percent  at an annual rate.  P rivate consumption picked 
up, supported by real wage growth, while  investment weakness persisted .  We see 
                                                           
1 China and the United States agreed to  hold off on additional tariffs on $180 billion of Chinese goods until 
March  1 as the United States and China engage in negotiations with respect to longstanding U.S. trade complaints on 
China, such as forced technology  transfer and intellectual property protection.

growth averaging about 2 percent through the end of 2019, down about ¾ percent age 
point from the October Tealbook forecast .  These revisions reflect our view that the 
new government will implement less market- friendly policies than we had previously 
expected .  The recent steps the government has taken—including slating a major 
infrastructure project for cancellation and stalling energy -sector reforms —have 
already led to a deterioration of investor sentiment and the tightening of financial 
conditions. 
Headline inflation moved down to a still-high 4.7 percent on a 12-month basis in 
November, with upward pressures from electricity tariffs .  Core inflation moderated 
slightly , to 3.6 percent.  In De cember, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) increased its 
policy rate to 8  percent with a hawkish bias ; among the factors cited by the BOM was 
market concerns  about some of the new administration policies .  We now see the 
BOM keeping the policy rate at 8  percent through 2019, with the risk of more 
tightening in the next few months . 
• Brazil.   Real GDP growth jumped to 3.1 percent in the third quarter after a tepid 
¾ percent  in the second.  The rebound primarily reflected the recovery from the 
truckers’ strikes in May.  Additionally, a one- time release of funds from a 
compulsory public savings program helped private consumption.  Monthly activity data point to relatively soft momentum.  As such, we expect growth to fall to 2 percent in the fourth quarter and then gradually rise to 2¾ percent by 2020, supported by the reduction in political uncertainty and increasing confidence after the 
recent presidential election.   Our baseline scenario assumes that the new 
administration pushes through social security reform in 2019, thus avoiding breaching 
the fiscal expenditure cap, which would disrupt investor sentiment and weigh on growth.  
Headline inflation fell to 4  percent on a 12-month basis in November, below  this 
year’s inflation target.  We have inflation stabilizing at 4¼  percent, the target for 
2019.  Given anchored inflation expectations and tepid growth, the Central Bank of Brazil kept its policy rate unchanged at 6½ percent at  its October meeting.   
• Argentina.  We estimate that real GDP contracted 2  percent in the third quarter and 
expect a 12  percent plunge this quarter as the effects of the new monetary targeting 
regime begin to bite.  After that, we expect growth to return to positive territory, driven by a recovery in agricultural production from this year’s historica lly bad

drought.  Thus far, the new IMF program appears to have stopped the downward 
spiral in financial markets that started in May, with the exchange rate appreciating 
some .  Additionally, recent data suggest that the 2018 fiscal target is well within 
reach, while the 2019 budget was approved by both the Lower House and the Senate, 
with support from some parts of the opposition and several state governors.  Finally, after two months of declining inflation expectations, the interest rate will be allowed to fall below the previous floor of 60 percent, in line with the conditions set out in the 
IMF program.   The monthly pace of depreciation of the crawling exchange rate band 
was also decreased from 3 percent to 2 percent.

Financial Market Developments 
Concerns about international trade frictions, downside risks to  the global outlook, 
and the sustainability of corporate earnings growth weighed hea vily on investor 
sentiment, driving substantial  declines in equity prices and Treasury yields as well as 
sizable increases in corporate  bond spreads.  Some FOMC communi cations over the 
period were seen by investors as signaling a more accommodative  stance than previously 
conveyed, providing some support to risky asset prices while co ntributing to the declines 
in Treasury yields. 
 Market quotes imply that a quarter -point rate hike in the targe t range at the 
December meeting remains highl y likely.  A straight read of for ward rates 
suggests that investors expect one additional quarter-point inc rease in the 
target federal funds rate during 2019, down considerably over the period.  
Adjusting for term premiums suggests an expectation for about 6 0 basis points 
of additional tightening in 2019. 
 Yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Tr easury securities declined 1 9 basis points 
and 35 basis points, respectively, over the period.  TIPS-implied inflation compensation over the next 5 years as well as 5-to-10-year inflation 
compensation fell 20 basis points and 12 basis points, respecti vely. 
 Broad U.S. equity price indexes fluctuated wid ely and declined,  on net, more 
than 4 percent since the November FOMC meeting.  (Equity price indexes are 
little changed, on net, since the previous Tealbook.)  The VIX rose, on net, but remained within its range of the past few months. 
 Credit spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate b onds widened 
about 40 basis points and 75 basi s points, respectively, and now stand around 
the middle of their hist orical distributions. 
 As in the United States, markets  abroad experienced considerabl e volatility.  
On net, foreign equity indexes e nded the period lower and sovereign yields in 
the major advanced foreign ec onomies (AFEs) declined notably.  In contrast 
to the sharp moves in equity a nd bond markets, the movement in the dollar 
was relatively muted, with the t rade-weighted index ending up 0 .78 percent.

  DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Yields on nominal Treasury securiti es have fallen markedly sinc e the November 
FOMC meeting, with 2-, 5-, and 10- year yields dropping 19 basis points, 31 basis points, 
and 35 basis points, respectivel y.  Early in the period, the de clines appeared to be driven 
by the pullback from risky assets  owing to concerns about international trade frictions 
and the growth outlook as well as  by declines in the price of o il.  Nominal interest rates 
fell further following some commu nications from FOMC participan ts that were perceived 
by many to suggest a lower path for  policy rates than indicated  in previous 
communications.  The final leg down came after the G-20 meeting  amid the confusion 
and reescalation in trad e tensions between t he United States an d China.  
The resultant narrowing in the spread between the 10- and 2-yea r Treasury yields 
leaves that spread at 11 basi s points, the 18th percentile of i ts distribution since 1971.  
The near-term forward spread f ell by more, leaving it around it s 23rd percentile since 
1971.1  Inflation compensation over th e next 5 years is 20 basis poin ts lower and 5-to-10-
year inflation compensation i s 12 basis points lower on net. 
Expectations for policy rates ch anged little for the current mo nth but dropped 
markedly further out.  Federal f unds futures contracts currentl y imply that the probability 
that the FOMC will raise the ta rget range for the federal funds rate 25 basis  points this 
month is about 95 percent.2  A straight read of forwa rd rates implied by OIS quotes 
suggests that investors expect one additional quarter-point rat e increase during 2019 and 
no increases in 2020.3  A staff model that adjusts for  term premiums implies that 
expectations for the federal  funds rate at the end of 2019 have  fallen about 16 basis 
points, on net, with investors ex pecting about 60 basis points of additional tightening in 
2019.  The model estimates indicate t hat the federal funds rate is expected to rise 
gradually in 2020, while the consensus from the Blue Chip Finan cial Forecasts survey of 
                                                 
1 The near-term forward spread is defined as the difference betw een the six-quarte r-ahead forward 
rate on Treasury bills and the t hree-month Treasury bill yield.   This spread has been shown to dominate the 
spread between the 10- and 2-year  Treasury yields for predictin g a transition to recession in the subsequent 
four quarters. 
2 This probability is calculated under the assumption that inves tors anticipate the IOER rate will be 
adjusted down 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range at the December m eeting.  Ignoring the 
potential technical adjustment to the IOER rate, the probabilit y of a rate increase at the December meeting 
is about 75 percent.   
3 The spread between the end-2019 and end-2018 forward rates (un adjusted for term premiums) is 
currently 21 basis points, its nar rowest reading since February  2018.

  professional forecasters, taken November 19–20, suggests the fe deral funds rate is 
expected to decline a bit in 2020. 
Early in the period, concerns ove r the sustainability of corpor ate earnings growth, 
coupled with trade tensions betw een China and the United States , weighed on investor 
risk sentiment.  Stock prices of  firms in the technology and co nsumer discretionary 
sectors, especially retailers, pos ted particularly large losses following disappointing 
guidance about future earnings from several companies despite generally strong third-
quarter reports.  Federal Reserve  communications that were inte rpreted as signaling a 
more accommodative stance helped spur a rebound in stock prices , but those gains were 
largely erased amid the heightene d China–U.S. trade tensions th at resurfaced late in the 
intermeeting period.  One-month option-implied volatility on th e S&P 500 index (VIX) 
rose over the period but remained within its range in recent months. 
Investment- and speculative-gra de corporate bond spreads widene d considerably, 
rising about 40 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively,  on net.  Their cumulative 
increases over the past year have left spreads across the credi t spectrum close to the 
middle of their histo rical distributions, notably above the ver y low levels that prevailed a 
year ago.  The widening in corporate bond spreads  over the inte rmeeting period was 
relatively broad based across industries, though spreads in the  energy and utilities sectors 
widened more than spreads in other industries. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Since the November FOMC meeting , foreign markets were affected by many of 
the same factors that drove  U.S. markets, including ongoing unc ertainty about trade 
relations between the United Sta tes and China an d the steep decline in oil pri ces, as well 
as Italian fiscal developments  and Brexit negotiations.  On net, foreign equity indexes 
and foreign sovereign yields fell,  and the dollar appreciated m odestly.   
Equity markets in AFEs suffered t he largest declines, with most indexes falling 
about 5 to 7 percent, and Europe-dedicated bond and equity fund s reported strong 
outflows.  Equity declines in emerg ing market economies (EMEs) were more modest, 
and emerging market funds received moderate inflows.  One exception was Mexico, where equity prices dropped 11 pe rcent, reflecting, in part, a growing perception that the 
policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s administrat ion may be less market-
friendly than previously thought.

  Long-dated AFE sovereign yields  declined significantly, and the market-implied 
paths of policy rates pivoted down, amid decreases in U.S. bond  yields and weaker-than-
expected euro-area and U.K. economic data.  Both near- and long er-term measures of 
inflation compensation generally moved down, partly reflecting sharp decreases in oil 
prices.  Declines in oil prices c ontributed to the cautious ton e of communications by the 
Bank of Canada and weighed on Canad ian sovereign yields, with the 10-year yield 
ending the period 45 basis points lower.  Although U.K. and EU leaders agreed on a draft 
for the Brexit withdrawal agreem ent, it remains highly uncertain whether the agreement 
will be approved by the U.K. par liament on December 11.  Agains t this backdrop, yields 
on the 10-year gilt fell 29 basis  points.  Spreads of Italian sovereign yields over German 
counterparts were volatile but e nded the period little changed amid ongoing budget 
negotiations between t he Italian government and the European Co mmission.   
The exchange value of the U.S . dollar appreciated only modestly  over the 
intermeeting period.  Although the sharp declines in U.S. yields weighed on the dollar, 
deteriorating risk sentiment pr ovided support.  The Chinese ren minbi experienced notable 
fluctuations, appreciating sharply following the G-20 summit an d subsequently retracing 
most of these gains. 
In November, the European Banking Authority and the Bank of Eng land released 
the results of their stress tests on EU and U.K. banks, respectively.  As discussed in the 
box “The 2018 European Union Bank Stress Tests,” the results el icited a muted market 
reaction. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) generally 
held at 2.20 percent—the same level as the IOER rate—and daily federal funds trading 
volumes averaged $67 billion.  In the triparty Treasury repo market, rates averaged 
2.21 percent.  The high level of issu ance of Treasury securities reportedly continued to 
put upward pressure on repo rates a nd reduced the attractivenes s of the Federal Reserve’s 
ON RRP facility; take-up averaged only $5 billion per day over the intermee ting period.4 
                                                 
4 The Desk reinvested $29 billion of Treasury secu rities in Nove mber, the amount by which 
Treasury maturities from the SOMA  portfolio exceed the $30 bill ion redemption cap.  No MBS purchases 
were made other than for s mall-value test operations.

 The  2018 European  Union Bank Stress Tests 
The European  Banking Authority  (EBA) and the Bank of England (BOE) published  
the results of their stress tests in November.  The EBA  test covered 48 of the 
largest and most systemically  important  EU banks, and  the BOE test covered  the 
7 largest U.K. lenders.   Stress‐test results were in line with market expectations,  
and the majority of the banks projected  adequate capital  levels under stress.  
On average,  this year’s adverse scenario  in the EBA  test was a bit tougher than in 
previous years; however,  it was significantly  less severe  than the most severe 
scenario in this year’s Comprehensive  Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)  of U.S. 
banks.   The severity  of the scenario’s  assumptions  varied by country, in  part to 
reflect ongoing country‐specific developments  (such  as Brexit).  Although the  
adverse scenario  was particularly  severe for the United  Kingdom  and some 
Nordic countries,  it was rather mild for peripheral  countries, particularly  Italy.  For 
example, as  it was announc ed in January,  the adverse scenario  assumed  a 10‐year  
Italian sovereign  yield spread over the  German equivalent  that is now well below  
the current spread.  Additionally,  the adverse scenario  assumed  a decline  in 
Italian GDP  growth that was notably smaller than  for other  European  countries, 
which contrasts  with the recent deterioration in  Italy’s growth prospects.  
Not surprisingly,  the two largest  Italian banks  performed  quite well in the EBA 
test.  Even with the  generous  assumptions,  however,  both midsized  Italian banks  
in the test—Banco  BPM and Unione di Banche Italiane—underperformed,  
particularly  BPM.  
In the EBA test,  U.K. banks  underperformed their  European  peers, with Barclays  
showing the weakest results among its peers and Lloyds performing  poorly.  
Among non‐U.K. G‐SIBs, Deutsche  Bank (DB), Société Générale,  and BNP Paribas 
underperformed, in  part because they  had lower starting  capital ratios than most 
banks in the test and their market risk losses  were relatively  large.  Additionally,  
DB’s weak profitability  resulted in losses under stress.   
The equity market response  to the release of the EBA  stress‐test results was 
muted, perhaps partly because the EBA  test did not feature explicit minimum  
capital thresholds.  That said, there was  a small positive correlation  between 
banks’ excess  stock returns on the day after the release and banks’ projected  
capital ratios, especially  their projected  leverage  ratios.  The  day following  the 
announcement,  Italian bank  shares underperformed,  potentially  indicating  that 
investors  recognized  that the scenario  for Italy was not particularly  adverse and 
that the “doom loop” between the Italian  banks and the Italian sovereign  is alive 
and well.  
The four largest U.K. banks participated  in both the EBA and BOE stress tests.  
Unlike the EBA test,  the BOE test specified  bank‐specific hurdle rates that, if not

 met in the adverse scenario,  would require banks to raise additional  capital.  Also 
in contrast  to the EBA  test, the BOE test allowed banks to assume  mitigating  
actions over the  projection  period (such as expense  reductions  attributable to 
cuts in staff costs).  These actions  had a material effect on some banks’ results.  
The adverse  scenario  applied in the BOE test was meant to capture  the possible 
economic  fallout of a hard Brexit.  Overall, the BOE’s  adverse scenario  was 
slightly more severe than that of the EBA, but all seven U.K. banks  passed the 
BOE stress test, which meant that  no capital actions were required.    
Barclays and Lloyds passed the  BOE test, which, on the surface, contrasts  with 
their poor performance  in the EBA  test.  However, the tests  delivered similar 
results after reconciling  differences  in their treatment  of IFRS 9, the new 
European  accounting  standard.  IFRS  9 was implemented  in the European  Union 
in 2018 and  will be phased in over the  next five years.  This new standard  requires 
banks to provision for loans  up front, on an expected  basis, rather  than after 
evidence  of loan impairment.    
Both the EBA and BOE released  results on a fully phased‐in and transitional  IFRS 9 
basis.  In the BOE test, however,  only the transitional  capital ratios were 
compared  to banks’ hurdle  rates to determine capital  needs.  This difference  is 
significant  for Barclays and Lloyds, because they  could meet the  hurdle rate on a 
fully phased‐in basis only with the conversion  of additional  tier 1 (AT1) 
instruments  into common  equity tier 1 (CET1) capital.   
Because transitional  arrangements  for IFRS 9 will be in effect through the test 
period, the BOE test appears to support the  BOE’s conclusion  that large U.K. 
banks are prepared  to absorb  hard Brexit‐like shocks.  Market reaction  to the 
BOE test results was muted, likely because the outcome  was anticipated.

  In offshore dollar funding market s, the one-month FX swap basis in most major 
currencies jumped 60 to 108 basis points on November 29, the fi rst day that one-month 
contracts would mature after y ear-end, indicating continued yea r-end pressures.  In 
domestic markets, spreads to OIS  for unsecured instruments, suc h as negotiable 
certificates of deposit, remained s omewhat elevated at maturiti es beyond one month, 
likely reflecting year-end pressu res as well as relatively heavy Treasury bill issuance.  
Spreads on overnight double-A-ra ted nonfinancial and financial commercial paper to the 
EFFR changed little over th e intermeeting period on net.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that financing conditions for 
businesses and households tightened a bit  but remained  supportive of economic activity.  
Financing flows to business es and households moderated in recent months as  interest rate 
spreads  on bonds and on some loans widened.   
•Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds increased over the intermeeting  
period, and i ssuance of speculative-grade bonds slowed notably.  Issuance of  
institutional leveraged loans also reportedly declined  as credit spreads  
widened.
•Private-sector analysts revised down their projections for year-a head corporate  
earnings a bit
, though the outlook for earnings remained favorable overall.
•Mortgage origination activity slowed a  little further, likely reflecting both the 
rise in mortgage 
rates over the past year and the high level of house prices.
•Broad consumer credit growth r emained solid, but credit card growth edged a  
bit lower at banks.
•An array of financial conditions indexes support our assessment that although 
conditions have tightened a bit during the intermeeting period, they generally 
remained supportive of economic activity (see the box “Financial Conditions
 
Indexes” and t he appendix , both of which are at the end of this section ).

BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative, on 
balance, although funding conditions through capital markets tightened somewhat.  
Spreads  on nonfinancial corporate bonds increased further over the intermeeting period; 
as a result of their cumulative widening over the past year, spreads on those bonds now 
stand near the m iddle of their historical distribution .  Before this notable increase, 
corporate bond spreads were low by historical standards, particularly those for speculative-grade bonds, which were very close to the bottom of their range since 1997.  Gross issuance o f corporate bonds moderated  in November, mostly because of  a 
significant step -down in speculative- grade  bond issuance.  
Although issuance of institutional leveraged loans rebounded in October from 
previous months, leveraged loan i ssuance reportedly slowed i n November as  credit 
spreads widened .  Growth of commercial and industrial (C&I ) loans on banks’ balance 
sheets picked up in October and November, as interest rate spreads on C&I loans 
reportedly held steady at low levels.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed some signs of 
deterioration , as the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades somewhat 
outpaced that of upgrades in October and November.  T he six -month trailing bond default 
rate remained low in October , while t he K MV expected year -ahead default rate stayed 
close to the middle of its  respective historical range  in October and November. 
Private -sector analysts revised down their projections for year- ahead corporate 
earnings a bit , though the outlook for earnings remained favorable overall .  Based on 
reports for nearly all S&P 500 firms, we assess that third -quarter earnings grew about 
28 percent on a four- quarter basis , substantially faster  than a year ago (in part due to the 
direct effects of the tax reform) .  Energy firms reported very strong earnings growth as 
did firms in  the financial, technology, and material s sectors.   However, earnings for 
2019:Q1 were marked down significantly for the energy, materials , and technology 
sectors .  Even so, an index of revisions to analysts’ estimates of year -ahead earnings for 
firms in the broader index was only a bit negative in November.  
The staff’s quantitative analysis of a representative sample of nonfinancial firms’ 
earnings transcripts suggests that tariffs are a salient concern in the changed outlook for

corporate earnings.  In earnings transcripts of 40 S&P nonfinancial firms for 2018:Q3, 
trade-related topics were discussed more frequently than in 2017:Q3, especially for firms 
in the industrial, consumer- discreti onary, and materials sectors.  These discussions 
contained  a larger number of negative- and uncertainty-oriented words. 
The pace of gross equity issuance through both seasoned and initial offerings 
moderated in October and November, consistent with the weakness and volatility in the 
stock market.  Seasoned equity offerings declined to a level well below their historical average over the past few years.  Initial offerings were robust in October, though some weakness emerged in November.  
Small Businesses  
Overall, small business credit market conditions appeared to be little changed 
over the intermeeting period.  Although an increasing share of firms in the National Federation of Independent Business monthly survey  indicate d near -term plans for 
expansion, the utilization rates on  outstanding credit lines to small businesses  continued 
to decline, suggesting that such firms  continued to have little appetite for additional 
credit.   Lending volumes to small businesses leveled out after rising over much of the 
past year, and indicators of recent loan performance remained strong.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained  accommodative.  
Commercial mortgage -backed securities  (CMBS ) spreads widened slightly over the 
intermeeting p eriod but remained  near their post- crisis lows.  Issuance of non -agency 
CMBS  was stable in  November .  Moreover, commercial real estate loan growth remained 
strong at banks through October  and November.  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on balance.  
Gross issuance of municipal bonds in October and November was  robust.  Yields on 
20-year municipal bonds decreased roughly in line with  yields on Treasury securities, 
leaving their ratio over comparable- maturity Treasury securities little changed .  In 
November, indicators of the credit quality of state and local governments improved a bit as the number of credit upgrades slightly outpaced the number of downgrades.

HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remain ed accommodative 
for most borrowers , but the demand for mortgage credit continued to appear soft.  R ates 
on 30- year fixed -rate conforming mortgages decreased 23 basis points over the 
intermeeting period  and remained low by historical standards.  However, the rise in 
mortgage rates earlier this year as well as  high house prices reportedly weighed  on the 
volume of home sales.  Purchase mortgage origination activ ity continued to decline 
modestly through October, while  refinance activity remained muted.  
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained accommodative 
against the backdrop of rising interest rates for credit cards and auto loans.  Broad 
consumer credit grew at a solid pace, on balance, through September.  More recently, credit card growth  at banks  edged  a bit  lower  in October and November on average .  
Conditions in the consumer asset -backed securities  market remained stable over the 
intermeeting period with slightly higher spreads and robust issuance.

 Financial Conditions Index es 
An array of financial conditions  indexes indicate that conditions  tightened 
somewhat over the intermeeting period, reflecting in part the sizable decline in 
equity prices and the widening of corporate credit spreads.  Despite their recent 
changes, these indexes suggest that conditions have remained accommodative, 
on balance, relative to historical standards.  
That said, the extent of recent changes in financial conditions varies across indexes.  As shown in the a ppendix to this section, a staff index that tracks 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations tightened slightly  in recent 
months.   While other publicly available financial conditions  indexes ( FCIs ) also 
point to tighter financial conditions  of late, the widening in corporate credit  
spreads and the declin es in equity prices over the intermeeting period appeared 
to weigh more heavily on some of these other  indexes.  For example, the 
Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions I ndex tightened  a fair bit since early 
November and is now at its tightest  level since March  2017.   The table in the 
appendix highlights some key differences in the construction of the indexes that can account for such variation.

The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes.”  
The first index in the table, the Staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This  index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative- grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment -grade

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF R ISKS  
We continue to view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity over 
the next year or so as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used 
by the FOMC.  In addition, we still judge the upside and downside risks around the projections 
for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate over the next year or so as being balanced.  On 
the upside, the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain 
strong —bolstered in part by the tax cuts enacted last year —and readings on household and 
business sentiment generally remain upbeat.  In these circumstances, spending and investment 
could expand faster than in the staff projection.  On the downside, the materialization of risks 
associated with issues such as Brexit or EME vulnerabilities could generate adverse spillovers to 
the U.S. economy.  Trade policies also could move in directions that have significant negative 
effects on U.S. economic growth.  These overall assessments are consistent with the four-
quarter-ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the unemployment rate 
presented in the exhibit “Time -Varying Macroeconomic Risk.”   
We remain concerned about recession risks during the period beyond the next year or so, 
and the recent heightened financial market turbulence has increased those concerns.  In our 
baseline outlook, the economy is projected to move further beyond its potential over the next two 
years.  If that forecast is correct, then we anticipate that a significant slowing in the pace of 
economic growth along with a gradual increase in the unemployment rate will be necessary to 
return the economy to a sustainable position in the longer run.  During the period of subpar 
growth, the economy will be more susceptible to being pushed into a recession by negative 
shocks.1  Neither we nor anyone else has clear insight as to the precise timing of when a 
recession could occur, but the period of adjustment back to sustainability will be a time of 
heightened downside risk.2  
                                                           
1 For example, the probability of a recession, based on stochastic simulations in the FRB/US model around 
the baseline projection, rises from 8 percent in 2019 to 23 percent in 2021. 
2 This assessment is consistent with recent research on the distribution of fluctuations in the unemployment 
rate and in real GDP growth using quantile regressions.  For a discussion of the unemployment rate, see Michael 
Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018 -067 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067 .  For a discussion

With regard to inflation, the staff still sees average uncertainty and balanced risks around 
the projection over the next year or so.  To the downside, longer-run inflation expectations 
relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may 
not edge up in the coming years.  Also, the foreign exchange value of the dollar could appreciate 
more than expected and put downward pressure on inflation.  To the upside, with economic 
activity projected to move further above its potential, inflation could increase more than in the 
staff forecast, consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of 
resource utilization on inflation.  In addition, an unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase 
in trade barriers could, for a time, lead to higher inflation.  These assessments are consistent with 
the statistical estimates of the time-varying risks for the inflation forecast over the next year.  Of 
course, if the risks to the forecast for economic activity beyond a year or so are tilted to the 
downside, then the risks to the inflation projection would also tend to have a small downward 
skew at that time.   
All of these inflation risks would be of relatively modest size as long as inflation 
expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  The risks could increase substantially, in both 
directions, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such movements in 
expectations could induce changes in inflation to build upon themselves and so lead inflation to 
deviate more, and more persistently, from 2 percent.   
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario illustrates a recession caused by 
a correction in financial market valuations in which the effects are amplified by leverage 
constraints on financial intermediaries that curtail the supply of credit.  The second scenario 
considers the possibility that aggregate supply conditions are stronger than judged in the baseline 
such that the output gap was essentially zero in the middle of this year; in addition, this scenario 
assumes that potential GDP growth is faster in the coming years.  In contrast, the third scenario 
examines the consequences of supply constraints that could arise when labor markets are very 
tight for an extended period, causing faster wage growth than in the baseline.  The fourth

Brookings Institute, August) https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WP42- NL-updated.pdf .  Their 
results suggest that the upside risk to the unemployment rate and downside risk to GDP growth are more 
pronounced in the medium term —specifically, two to three years ahead —particularly when credit growth is high 
and the 
unemployment rate is low.

scenario assumes that increases in interest rates could restrain household and businesses 
spending by considerably more than is assumed in the baseline.  In the fifth scenario, we 
consider the possibility of a pronounced slowdown in foreign economies and a stronger dollar.  
Finally, the sixth scenario illustrates the effects of a foreign supply-driven decline in oil prices. 
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of four models maintained by the staff that 
embed different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.3  In all of the scenarios, the federal 
funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline.   Additionally, the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the 
scenarios. 
Financial -Based Recession [Gertler and Karadi Model] 
Recent staff QS reports have highlighted that asset valuations are elevated and that 
leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is an area of potential vulnerability, although overall 
financial vulnerabilities are judged to be moderate and commercial banks are well capitalized.  In 
this scenario, we assume that a correction in asset valuations begins in the first quarter of 2019; 
this correction reduces intermediaries’ capital, including that of shadow banks.  In turn, lower 
capital tightens leverage constraints and disrupts the supply of credit.  This credit crunch is 
accompanied by a loss in confidence by businesses that is reflected in the model by exogenous 
shocks to investment. 
Under these circumstances, intermediaries’ net worth falls about 25  percent, and 
corporate bond spreads increase 300 basis points during 2019.  Investment drops 10 percent in 
2019 and GDP declines, starting in the second half of next year, for three quarters before 
beginning to recover.  The unemployment rate rises 1.5 percentage points above the baseline at 
the end of 2019 and peaks at 7 percent in 2020 before slowly returning toward the baseline.  
Inflation slows only a little relative to the baseline because the Phillips curve is flat.  Monetary 
policy provides substantial accommodation:  Even under the inertial Taylor rule assumed here,

the federal funds rate decreases almost 2 .5 percentage points in response to the rapid increase in 
slack and comes within 50 basis points of its effective lower bound.4 
Stronger Supply Side [FRB/US] 
Although the unemployment rate is currently about 1 percentage point below our estimate 
of its natural rate, wage gains have remained modest in recent years, perhaps because the Phillips 
curve is flat.  Another way of reconciling modest wage growth with a very low unemployment 
rate is that resource utilization may be less tight than currently estimated by the staff.  In this 
scenario, we assume that the level of aggregate supply in recent history has been stronger than 
judged in the baseline, such that the output gap was essentially zero in the middle of this year.  
Moreover, we assume that potential output growth in future years is faster than in the baseline.  
Specifically, it is assumed that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past 
several years than in the baseline and continues to fall to 4.1 percent at the end of 2019, 
0.5 percentage point lower than in the baseline.  We also assume that trend labor force 
participation has been decreasing at a slower rate than in the baseline for the past several years 
and continues to do so going forward; as a result, the trend participation rate is 1 percentage 
point above the baseline by the end of 2025.  In addition, multifactor productivity is assumed to 
grow 0.25 percentage point faster than in the baseline in the past several years and also going 
forward.  Finally
, policymakers and the private sector are assumed to fully recognize these 
changes in supply-side conditions. 
All told, real GDP growth is, on average, about 1 percentage point per year above the 
baseline, boosted by higher potential growth.  The unemployment rate falls 0.7 percentage point 
below the baseline.  With a flat Phillips curve in the FRB/US model, inflation is little affected 
over the course of this scenario.  Mainly reflecting the smaller positive output gap persisting for 
several years, the federal funds rate is 3.4 percent at the end of 2020, almost 1 percentage point 
below the baseline. 
                                                           
4 The federal funds rate would fall more aggressively if monetary policymakers respond to sustained 
increases in the unemployment rate in line with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.  As a result, the 
federal funds rate would reach the effective lower bound in early 2020 for four quarters, and economic outcomes 
would be less adverse:  The unemployment rate would be about 1 percentage point lower at its peak.  (In the 
simulations from this model, the economy is responding more strongly and rapidly to monetary policy 
accommodation than, for instance, in the FRB/US model.)

Supply Constraints [Gertler, Sala, and Trigari Model] 
In the baseline, although the unemployment rate is persistently below the natural rate of 
unemployment, inflation remains subdued, consistent with the modest response of prices to 
economic activity seen for some time.  However, in this scenario, inflation picks up more than in 
the baseline, as tighter supply constraints in the labor market push up wages and those higher 
wages in this alternative scenario pass through into prices.  In particular, when the 
unemployment rate is unusually low, filling a job vacancy becomes increasingly difficult, which 
could imply a reduced pace of hiring and a substantially steeper rise in wages as the value to 
firms of filling a vacant job increases.  We illustrate these risks using simulations from a 
nonlinear New Keynesian model with costly search and matching frictions in the labor market.5  
 Under these assumptions, the unemployment rate continues to decline until the end of 
2019 but by 0.2 percentage point less than in the baseline projection, and this gap persists over 
the forecast horizon.  Real wage growth is 0.5 percentage point higher, on average, than in the 
baseline for the next two years.  However, GDP growth is close to the baseline throughout the 
projection, as  the more intense utilization of capital in this model partially compensates for the 
reduction in labor input.  Because of higher recruiting costs and higher wages, inflation rises 
significantly and peaks at 2.6  percent by 2020.  Monetary policymakers infer that resource 
utilization is less tight from the unemployment rate path that is 0.2 percentage point above 
baseline.  Nonetheless, the federal funds rate is slightly above the baseline,  as the effect of higher 
inflation dominates the effect of the smaller unemployment rate gap .  
Greater Interest Rate Sensitivity  [FRB/US] 
The baseline forecast shows a large positive output gap for a number of years despite the 
fact that the federal funds rate moves 2.2 percentage points above its long-run value.  However, 
there is a risk that the projected tightening in monetary policy could weigh on economic activity 
more than is assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, we explore the possibility that household

and business spending, along with equity prices, are more sensitive to interest rates than in the 
baseline.6 
With household spending and business investment more responsive to the path of real 
interest rates, and with equity prices being lower by as much as 25 percent, real GDP growth is 
weaker than in the baseline until 2022.  The unemployment rate is higher than in the baseline and 
rises to 4 percent in 2020; inflation remains close to baseline, reflecting the very flat Phillips 
curve in the FRB/US model.  The federal funds rate runs notably below the baseline path and 
peaks only at 3.6 percent in early 2021. 
Foreign Slowdown  [SIGMA] 
In our baseline, the decline in foreign growth that took place earlier this year levels out, 
and we expect that growth will move up a bit over the forecast period to a pace near potential.  
However, it is possible that the recent slowing abroad may signal a more persistent loss in 
foreign growth momentum than we have assumed.  In this scenario, we assume that continued 
tepid growth abroad, combined with concerns both here and abroad about downside risks and 
associated volatility in financial markets, cause households and investors to progressively lose 
confidence in the durability of the foreign expansion and engender significant further weakness 
in the global economy.   
Specifically, this scenario envisions that a general deterioration in the macroeconomic 
environment leads corporate borrowing spreads in the foreign economies to widen 125 basis 
points amid sharp declines in equity prices.  The financial turbulence abroad and concerns about 
the foreign outlook trigger a 75 basis point rise in borrowing spreads in the United States.  
Foreign GDP growth dips to 1.5 percent in 2019 and the first half of 2020, about 1 percentage 
point below baseline.  Flight- to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar to appreciate about 
5 percent.  
Weaker foreign activity, the stronger dollar, and tighter global financial conditions cause 
U.S. GDP growth to moderate to 1.6 percent in 2019, 0.8 percentage point below the baseline.  
Core P
CE price inflation runs at only 1.7 percent next year and remains below 2 percent until 
                                                           
6 Specifically, the magnitude of the peak output response to a monetary policy shock of 1 percentage point 
in the federal funds rate is amplified from 0.2 percent in the baseline projection to 0.8 percent in this scenario, a 
value consistent with some DSGE models.

2021.  Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a noticeably shallower path than in the 
baseline. 
Lower Oil Prices [SIGMA] 
Oil prices have
 declined markedly in recent months and closed on December 4 at $62 per 
barrel, down nearly 30 percent from the peak reached in early October 2018.  As noted in the box 
“The Recent Fall in Oil Prices” in th e Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section, 
supply-side factors are likely responsible for most of the recent decline.  In this scenario, we 
consider the possibility that favorable oil supply developments abroad cause the path of oil prices 
to shift down further so that they are a persistent $15 per barrel below our baseline. 
The supply-driven decline in oil prices gradually contributes to a slight expansion of U.S. 
output, boosting the level of U.S. GDP only about 0.1 percent above baseline in 2020.  The small 
GDP effect reflects that the expansionary effect on U.S. consumption —as well as some stimulus 
to investment in the non-oil-producing sectors of the economy —is largely counterbalanced by a 
sharp decline in U.S. investment in the mining and drilling sectors, as well as some fall in oil 
production.7  While headline inflation dips to 1.4 percent in 2019, core inflation only runs a tad 
below baseline,  given the low pass-through of oil price shocks into core consumer prices.  The 
path of the federal funds rate is little changed from baseline. 
Importantly, the simulation does not incorporate the possibility that oil prices may exert 
nonlinear effects.  It is plausible that as oil prices fall below a certain level, further declines, 
especially if rapid, may have adverse effects on the balance sheets of firms tied to the energy-
producing sector, undermine confidence, and cut deeply into production and investment.  Our 
sense is that a decline in oil prices to the range of $ 45 to $50 per barrel is unlikely to generate 
such nonlinear effects, but such effects could become apparent if oil prices fall much below these 
levels to the territory last experienced in 2016. 
                                                           
7 The staff’s SIGMA model does not explicitly incorporate a mining and dril ling sector, and also probably 
understates the extent to which supply-driven declines in oil prices boost consumption (relative to empirical 
evidence).  Accordingly, this simulation includes additional shocks to consumer confidence and to investment to 
match the empirical responses of macroeconomic variables to an oil supply shock that are found in recent staff work.

Oil Price Fluctuations, ” Journal of Monetary Economics.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  Compared with the October Tealbook, core inflation 
is projected to be a touch lower  in the near term  but roughly unchanged in the medium 
term, and  the output gap is somewhat  narrower  throughout 2019 (owing to a small 
upward revision in potential output) but about unrevised, on net, thereafter .  In response 
to these revisions, most of the strategies prescribe a slightly lower path for the federal funds rate than in the previous Tealbook.  A special exhibit  provides updated estimates of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run; the se estimates are largely 
unchanged from the last time we presented them, in  the September Tealbook . 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the 
“balanced approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993 ) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible  
price- level targeting  (FPLT ) rule.  These near -term prescriptions take as given the 
Tealbook baseline projections for the output gap and core inflation , shown in the middle 
panels .1  The top and middle panel s also  provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal 
funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.2 
Relative to the October  Tealbook, the staff projects resource utilization to be a 
little less tight and inflation a touch  lower  in the near  term.  Consequently, most of the 
policy rules call for a slightly lower  level of  the federal funds rate than  they did in the 
previous Tealbook. 
• The prescriptions of the Taylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not feature interest rate smoothing terms, remain well abo ve the corresponding 
policy rates in the Tealbook baseline.  The near- term prescriptions of the first-
                                                 
1 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook bas eline projections for these variables instead of 
the output gap.  
2 Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here 
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

 difference rule, which responds only incrementally to changes in projected 
economic conditions beyond the near term, are essentially unchanged from  
those of the Tealbook baseline.  
• The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate the cumulative shortfall in the core 
PCE price index of about 2.4 percent  since the end of 2011, prescribes setting 
the federal funds rate near the bottom of the current target range.  
A MEDIUM-TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL  
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimates of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate generated under two baselines:  the Tealbook 
baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the September 2018 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).
3  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used 
to generate an estimate of r *.  This concept of r *, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to 
the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting 
in the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that 
period.  This concept of  r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real 
economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation 
objectiv e or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate. 
• At 3. 13 percent , the current- quarter estimate of the Tealbook-consistent 
FRB/US  r* is 16 basis points lower than the value based on  the October  
Tealbook projection, reflecting the staff’s slightly lowe r output gap projection.   
• At 1. 92 percent , the corresponding SEP -consistent FRB/US  r* based on the 
September SEP is significantly lower than the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US 
r*.  The difference stems from the fact that the SEP -consistent projection has 
output exceeding potential  by a considerably smaller amount  over the medium 
term than does the current  Tealbook forecast.  This smaller anticipated output 
gap occurs despite the fact that the median path for the real federal funds rate 
                                                 
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021 (the 
final year reported in the September 2018 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an outpu t gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 implied by the SEP p rojections averages almost 1 percent age point less than 
the corresponding path in the Tealbook.  
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports results from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and 
the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap and 
inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.4  The 
simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions that policymakers commit 
to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy.  
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases 1 ¼ percentage 
points next year , ¾ percent age point in 2020, and  ¼ percentage point in 2021, 
reaching 4.7 percent  in the fourth quarter of 2021.  This trajectory is a little 
lower than the one in the Octo ber Tealbook because of the narrower projected  
output gap. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values until 2022.  This higher path is associated with only 
a modestly higher trajectory for the real 10- year Treasury yield than in the 
baseline until 2020 and a slightly lower path thereafter, because the Taylor  (1999) rule calls for somewhat lower values of the federal funds rate 
beyond the period shown.  I nflation is somewhat higher than in the baseline 
projection.
5  The path for the unemployment rate lies above the Tealbook 
                                                 
4 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.  
5 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this and the Taylor (1993) rule 
simulations, despite higher levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption that 
price and wage setters perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond 
the next several years and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage 
setting decisions.  The box “Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results under a scenario in which price and wage 
setters lack such a perfect understanding.  In th at scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non -inertial 
policy rule led to a significant decline in inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate at the start of the simulation in response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

 baseline path over the next few years, but it subsequently lies below and takes 
a bit longer to return to its natural rate.  
• The Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate sizable  increase in the 
federal funds rate.  Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to output exceeding its assumed potential level  over the projection period, t he 
prescriptions of this  rule are lower than those of the Taylor  (1999) rule over 
the period shown.  The prescriptions from the Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook baseline throughout 2020 but subsequently fall below the 
baseline path for a sustained period.  As a result, inflation is higher, and the real 10 -year Treasury yield is  lower, than their corresponding values in the 
Tealbook projection.  The more accommodative conditions also engender a lower  unemployment rate than in the Tealbook projection.  
• The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule lie s a 
touch above the path in the Tealbook baseline through early  2021 but then 
runs below the baseline path for some years , reflecting the fact that this rule 
react s to the expected future change in the output gap rather than its level.  
The associated lower path for the federal funds rate, together with  the 
expectation of higher inflation in the future, implies  lower longer- term real 
interest rates  and thus lower unemployment than in the Tealbook baseline.   
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate,  the shortfall that has 
cumulated between  the level of core PCE prices  and a target path for that price 
level that grows at an annual rate of 2 percen t from the end of 2011 onward.  
Eliminating the current 2.4 percent shortfall of the core PCE price index requires inflation to run above 2 percent in coming years.  To achieve this outcome, t he FPLT rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate somewhat  
below the current target range until the end  of 2020 and for keeping it below 
the federal funds rate path in the Tealbook baseline through 2027.  Because the simulation embeds the assumptions that policymakers can credibly 
commit to closing this gap over time and that financial market participants, 
price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the real 10 -year Treasury rate drops below 
the Tealbook baseline for the next six years.  The unemployment rate is

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

OPTIMA L CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by three specifications of the loss function.7  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today constrain future policy choices; such a constraint may improve economic outcomes.
8 
The first two  of the three optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for 
the federal funds rate than the path in the baseline projection, for two reasons.  First, high levels of the real federal funds rate are necessary to push the unemployment rate up to its natural rate, because, consistent with recent historical experience, the unemployment rate does not respond strongly to changes in real interest rates in the FRB/US model.  Second, because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and fully credible, the front -loading of policy tightening is not disruptive.  In pr actice, however, if the FOMC 
were to raise the real federal funds rate as abruptly as in these simulations , wage and 
price setters and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate tighter monetary policy than  policymakers envision, leading to less 
benign macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.
9  By contrast, the third optimal 
control policy allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels not experienced since the 1950s.  Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those predicted by the simulations.  
                                                 
6 The special exhibit “The Implications of Expectations for Flexible Price -Level Targeting:  A 
Recession Scenario” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the October 2018 Tealbook A illustrated 
that when price and wage setters do not understand the future effects o f policy changes, announcing an 
FPLT strategy with a relatively large price gap at the onset of a recession requires a prolonged period of 
policy accommodation and very low levels of unemployment later on, with little gain in terms of higher inflation.  
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simu lations.    
8 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

 • The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s objectiv e of 2  percent , on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantl y 
higher than the Tealbook baseline path.  T his strategy is designed to temper 
the projected sizable undershooting, over the next several years,  by the 
unemployment rate of its natural rate that  occurs  in the Tealbook baseline—an 
outcome that policymakers with the equal-weights loss function judge to be costly.  The smaller  unemployment gap generates  only moderately lower 
inflation because, as already indicated, the response in the FRB/US model of 
inflation to the current level of resource utilization is sm all. 
• The second simulation, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This simulated policy seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natural rate even faster than under the equal -weights specification.  The federal funds rate soars  
to nearly 11 percent  by mid -2019 and then averages around 7 percent from 
2020 through 2024. 
• The third  simulation , “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function that 
assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss function is 
identical to the specification with equal weights when the unemployment rate is above the natural rate.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control simulation with equal weights and below the Tealbook baseline path until the end of 2024; it then exceeds the policy rate paths implied by the other two optimal control 
strategies and the Tealbook baseline starting in mid -2025 (not shown).  With 
the asymmetric loss function, policymakers choose this more accommodative 
path for the policy rate because their desire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent  
is not tempered by an aversion to undershooting the natural rate of unemployment.  T he tighter labor market keeps inflation closer to 2 percent  
than in the case of equal weights.  Beyond the period shown, the

 unemployment rate runs a little above its natural rate for several years as 
policymakers act to contain the inflationary pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization. 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit, “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run,” updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the 
longer ru n, denoted rLR; this concept is the rate consistent with the economy operating at 
its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated.  This rate, along 
with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer -run level of the nominal 
federal funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and economic models.  In addition, r
LR is also a parameter in many of the simple  policy rules, including the 
staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of Tealbook A.  
• The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of historical values through 2018:Q3 for several model- based time -series estimates of r
LR.10  The  
estimates for 2018:Q3 range from ½ to 2 percent , with a mean of 
1 percent .  Relative to their respective 2018:Q2 values reported in the 
September Tealbook, the measures are only slightly  changed.  All of the 
point estimates used to compute the range have de clined since the early 
2000s.11 
• Time -series estimates of  rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as 
depicted in the middle panel.  The sources of this uncertainty vary across the studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach 
                                                 
10 For a discussion of time -series estimates of rLR over history, see the Monetary Policy Strategies 
section of the October 2017 Tealbook  A.  See the appendix to this section for sources and methodology.   
Although the modeling approaches and econometric techniques differ across models, the studies have the 
common feature that they use time -series methods to infer rLR from the co -movement of either 
macroeconomic series (like inflation, interest rates, and output) or both macroeconomic and financial data 
(like TIPS yields).  
11 There are differences in the paths of rLR across the studies.  In particular, while some of the 
paths (such as that of the estimate of Laubach and Williams, 2003) seem consistent with  the possibility that 
the recent recession played a key role in the decline of the equilibrium rate, others (such as those arising 
from the estimates of Johannsen and Mertens, 2016, and Christensen and Rudebusch, 2017) suggest a slow decline, which is more c onsistent with the importance of ongoing secular factors such as changes in 
demographics or a productivity growth slowdown.  The role of demographics is considered by Gagnon, Johannsen, and L ópez-Salido (2016).

 as well as uncertainty about the prevailing state of the economy and the 
parameters of the model.  
• The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer- term forecasts of the real 
federal funds rate from selected sources .  The Tealbook baseline 
assumption, at ½  percent , is below the other measures, which range from 
0.84 to 1.15 percent.  That said, the evidence presented in this exhibit, 
taken as a whole, indicates that the Tealbook baseline assumption is 
consistent with time -series and survey estimates, especial ly in light of the 
fact that all of these estimates  are subject to considerable uncertainty. 
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules and optimal control simulations described previously.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular 
model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when 
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section.  It also rep orts the expression for the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version , augmented with a small 
temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 
denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for quarter t;  for quarters prior to 
the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the historical data in the economic 
projection.  The right -hand- side variables of the first four rules include the staff ’s projection of 
trailing four -quarter core PCE price inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 
and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three-

  quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap ( 𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of 
policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible 
price -level targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables include an unemployment rate gap and  a 
price  gap.  The unemployment gap is defined as the difference between the unemployment rate, 
𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢𝑡𝑡∗.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the 
difference  between the log of the core PCE price level , 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level 
path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 2011:Q4 value of  𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, 
subsequently, 𝑔𝑔 𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.  
Simple Rules  
 
The first two rules in the table  were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price  gap like the FPLT  rule ha ve 
been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1  An FPLT rule similar to the one above is 
also analyzed by Chung and others (2014). 
Where applicable, the intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen 
so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do 
not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given th e Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are

A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit  “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r* ” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
2  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations— that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel a re the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r* .  For a give n economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federa l funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which include s the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

  COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discoun t the future using a quarterly discount factor , 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕=� 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉𝑇𝑇

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers three  
specifications of the weig hts on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the three  specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in 
the three  specifications.  
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
3  The third  specification, “Asymmetric weight on 
ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment ra te 
is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these three  specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is 
subject to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as

decisions made prior to the simulation period.   
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the exhibit “Estimate s of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch (2017); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, and Tambalotti (2017); Hols ton, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); 
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2017); and Lubik and Matthes (2015).  For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data through 2018:Q3.  Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they make use of historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical movements can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of tho se studies.  
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each 
model’s point estimate for 2018: Q3.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are 
specific to each study.   
The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝑟
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 values from selected forecasters.  These values were 
obtained as follows:  
• “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run.  
• “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the fed eral funds 
rate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the September  2018 FOMC meeting .  
• “Median Survey of Primary Dealers” equals the long -run median dealer forecast for 
the target rate minus the longer -run median deal er forecast of PCE inflation as of the 
November 2018 survey. 
• “Median Blue Chip (6 -to-10-year)” equals the consensus five- year average (2025 –
29) forecast for the federal funds rate minus the consensus five -year average (2025 –
29) forecast for the annual change in the GDP chained price index as of the October  
2018 Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey. 
• “Congressional Budget Office (10-year)” equals the federal funds rate in 2028 minus the annual change in the PCE index in 2028 as of August 2018.

Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial         offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
        the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)
        is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
