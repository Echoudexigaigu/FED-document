Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
In the December and January Tealbooks , we were confronted with a deterioration 
in financial markets  and business sentiment , while the domestic  economic data were 
generally quite positive .  To a degree, the situation is now reversed:  Conditions in 
financial markets have improved, but much of the incoming  spending and production 
data has softened materially , suggest ing a more marked deceleration in output at the 
beginning of 2019 than we had been projecting .  Most striking was the sizable reported 
drop in retail sales in December, but data on motor vehicle sales, new orders of capital 
goods, construction activity, and manufacturing production also disappointed—as did the 
February payroll figures, even after considering possible weather effects .   
While those softer data led to a notable weakening in our current -quarter GDP 
growth projection —to an annual rate of 1 percent from the 2 .3 percent pace w e had 
expected in the January Tealbook —we also judge that  figure  to exaggerate the slowing of 
economic activity .  In our assessment, labor market readings have remain ed solid , on 
balance, in recent months .  And , with consumer sentiment also remaining at favorable 
levels, we project GDP growth  to bounce back to 2.6 percent in the second quarter.  Even 
so, we now project growth to be  1.8 percent for the year  as a whole, nearly  ½ percentage 
point less than in the January Tealbook .  Of course , we could be under estimating the 
extent of the weakness , and we have explored this possibility in the scenario “Momentum 
Weakens Further” in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
Meanwhile, higher equity prices and lower interest rates in this projection should 
provide a little more support for aggregate demand over the medium term relative to the 
January Tealbook .  As a result , we nudged up our forecast of real GDP growth to  
2 percent in 2020 and to  1.5 percent in 2021.  As before, the slowing in the pace of 
growth relative to the past couple of years  is driven by the ongoing tightening of 
monetary policy and waning fiscal stimulus .   
The weaker near -term GDP  forecast  implies that the output gap this quarter  is less 
tight than in  our earlier assessment .  In addition, we revised up our estimate of the level 
of potential output —thereby further lowering  the output gap— because of an upward 
revision to our estimate of the  sustainable trend in labor force participation .  That lower 
output gap persists through the medium term, and , accordingly, the unemployment rate is 
a little higher, bottom ing out at 3.6  percent  by late this year .

Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The Blue Chip consensus expect s GDP growth this year t hat is  ¼ percentage point 
stronger than the staff’s projection , while both the staff and Blue Chip project an 
unemployment rate of 3.6 percent by year -end.  In 2020, the Blue Chip project s GDP 
growth  to be  ¼ percentage point lower than in the staff  forecast , and they expect the 
unemployment rate to edge up to 3.8  percent.  The Blue Chip and staff projection s for 
CPI inflation are similar in both 2019 and 2020 .  As before, the staff’s projections for 
short -term interest rates are above the range of  Blue Chip forecasters, and our 
projection for longer -term rates are relatively high as well.  (Note that we do not 
include the Survey of Professional Forecasters in this comparison because the most 
recent SPF projection is from November.  The SPF ordinarily released in February was 
postponed because of the government shutdown and is now s cheduled for March 22.)  
Please note that the Blue Chip data are embargoed until March 10.  
     Note:  CPI is the consumer price index.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes 
input from about 50  panelists.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the Decemb er FOMC meeting.  The following table compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the December  Tealbook.  
Recent  data for real GDP growth have been below our expectations in the December 
Tealbook, while readings on labor market  conditions  have  been close , on balance,  to what 
we had expect ed.  Our projection  for real GDP  growth this year has been revised  down , 
mostly reflecting the soft incoming spending data , along with a downward revision to our 
projection for foreign economic growth, which ha ve been  only partially  offset by somewhat 
more favorable  trajectories for equity prices and interest rates .  The downward revision to 
GDP, along with an upward revision to our estimate of the sustainable labor force 
participation rate, imply that our forecast for resource utilization is less tight than in the 
December Tealbook.  The unemployment rate is a littl e higher, and the output gap is smaller.  
Our forecast  for core  inflation in 2019  and over the medium term is unchanged from our 
projection in the December  Tealbook , and we continue to expect core inflat ion to run at  
2 percent  over the next few years .  Total inflation  is projected to be a bit below 2 percent 
over the medium term —slightly lower than in the December forecast —reflecting projected  
declin es in  crude oil prices .      
The path  for the federal funds rate derived from the inertial  version of the  Taylor (1999) rule 
used in our baseline  forecast  is notably lower than its trajectory in December , reflecting the 
narrower output gap in this projection.

 The data on inflation have come in largely as expected , with core PCE prices 
rising 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending i n December .  We continue to project that 
the four -quarter change in core PCE prices will edge up  to 2 percent by the second half of 
2019 and will remain at that level over the medium term .  This slight step -up in core 
inflation reflects both a small  further tightening of resource utilization and our 
assumption of a gradual small increase in underlying trend inflation .  Given the assumed 
trajectory of oil prices, total PCE inflation is projected to run slightly below core inflation  
throughout the medi um term. 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
During the period s ince the January Tealbook, financial market volatility  has 
decreased while stock prices and credit conditions for nonfinanc ial firms have improved.  
In addition , the projected  trajectories for the federal funds rate and for long -term rates 
have been revised down  to reflect our revised path for the output gap .  Thus , relative to 
the January  Tealbook projection, our financial assumptions  are now more  supportive of 
economic activity .   
Monetary Policy  
•The ine rtial version of the Taylor (1999) rule that we currently use to
mechanically set our assumed path for the federal funds rate continues to
project  a substantial increase over the next three years —one that we recognize
is out of line with the expectations of most private forecasters .1  However, the
current  trajectory is notably  lower than in the January  Tealbook due to the
narrower  output gap.  We now assume the federal funds rate will rise t o
around 4 percent in 2021, about ½ percentage point lower than in January .
•We assume that the size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual  and
predictable decline until early 2020 , at which point reserve balances are
projected to have fallen to $1 trillion .  Thereafter, both reserve balances and
the SOMA portfolio are assumed to grow roughly in line with nominal GDP .
These projections are consistent with the SOMA portfolio exerting lessdownward pressure over time on the term premium embedded in long -term
Treasury yields .
1 We are reevaluating the policy rule that we currently use and  will likely make adjustments in the 
April Tealbook.

  Other Interest Rates  
• The 10 -year Treasury yield is projected to rise from an average of 2. 7 percent 
in the current quarter to 3.7 percent by  the end of 2021.  Most of the projected 
increase is due to our assumption that downward pressures on the term 
premium, including from  the effects of the SOMA portfolio, will gradually 
wane, letting it return to levels closer to its long -run value by the end of the  
medium term.   To a smaller extent, the increase reflects our assumption that 
market participants will revise up their expectation of the path of the federal funds rate to that of the Tealbook .  Relative to the January  Tealbook, the path 
for the 10- year Tr easury yield is revised down an average of about 
¼ percentage point, mostly because of  lower expected short rates over the 
valuation window.  
o We still project the f ederal funds  rate to rise above the 10 -year 
Treasury rate in 2020, but the magnitude of the i nversion by 2021 is 
now a little  smaller than in the January Tealbook . 
• In the near  term, our projection for t riple-B corporate yields has been revised 
down somewhat more than that for 10- year Treasury yields, as spreads  have 
narrowed faster than we had previously anticipated.  Fu rther out over the 
medium term, t riple-B yields have been revised roughly the same as Treasury 
yields, as we expect currently elevated corporate leverage—and the credit risk it implies —to limit the scope for further declines in corporate spreads . 
• In contrast, spreads on mortgage rates are essentially unchanged, and  the 
30-year fixed mortgage rate is revised lower in line with the 10 -year Treasury 
yield.  
Equity Prices and Home  Prices   
• Equity prices  have risen 6 percent  since the January Tealbook , and valuation 
pressures appear to have increased , even given  the lower projected path for 
10-year Treasury yields .  Accordingly , we have nudged down  our assumed 
stock price appreciation going forward to 1  percent per year, compared with  
1.2 percent per year in the previous Tealbook .   
• Growth in house prices slowed from 6 percent in 2017 to 4½ percent last year , 
and we project a further slowing  to about 2 ½ percent per year over the next

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

  three years .  The slowdown reflects both the weakness in housing demand  and 
our assessment that house prices are, at present, modestly elevated relative to 
rents .   
Fiscal Policy  
• We assume that the expansionary  fiscal policies enacted over the past year and 
a half will continue through the medium term .  In particular, our forecast 
assumes that the current level of discretionary spending will be maintained in real terms in fiscal years 2020 and 2021; realization of that forecast will require lawmakers to lift the discretionary spending caps for those years, which would be consistent with fiscal policymaker actions in recent years.
2 
• Given these policy assumptions, we continue to project that discretionary fiscal policy actions across all levels of government (exclusive of any 
multiplier effects and financial offsets) contributed 0.6 percentage point  to the 
rate of growth in aggregate demand last year and will contribute the same 
amount this year  before  taper ing to 0.5 percentage point in 2020 and 
0.2 percentage point in 202 1.   
• We expect the federal budget deficit, which was  3¾ percent of GDP in fiscal 
2018, to widen to 4¾ percent by fiscal 2021, reflecting upward pressure from recent fiscal policy actions, the effects of higher interest rates on debt service costs, and growth in mandatory spending.  
Trade Policy  
• The additional tariff increase of 15 percent age points  on many imports from 
China that was scheduled for March 2 has been indefinitely postponed.  T rade 
talks between the United States and China have reportedly been productive, and t he A dministration has suggested some form of agreement could be 
reached by  late March .  We continue to assume tariff rates on Chinese imports 
will remain at current levels  through the medium term .  However, given the 
substantial issues that remain unresolved in the U.S. –China negotiations, as 
                                                 
2 The federal government enter ed a debt issuance suspension period on March 4, 2019, during 
which the government will use extraordinary measures to issue additional debt to the public .  The 
anticipated breach date, when the federal government will no longer be able to meet its financial 
obligations, is expected to occur between late August and the end of November .  We anticipate that 
policymakers will reach a resolution on the debt ceilin g before  this breach date.

  well as the uncertainty related to possible auto tariffs and the still uncertain 
prospects for c ongressional ratification of the USMC A trade pact , trade 
developments will likely remain a focus of market attention and continue to 
pose a risk to the economic outlook .   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
• Foreign GDP growth is projected to be  1.7 percent in the current quarter, 
about 0.5 percentage point lower than our January Tealbook forecast and the 
fourth consecutive quarter of growth below its estimated potential rate of 2.5 percent .  However, t he slowdown in foreign growth this quarter  appears to 
reflect , in part, temporary factors .  Accordingly,  we expect growth to move up 
to 2.4 percent  in the second quarter and to continue to run close to potential 
through 2021, supported by accommodative monetary policies  in the 
advanced foreign economies and stimulus measures in China .   
• The broad nominal dollar  is little changed , on net, s ince the January  Tealbook.  
The dollar initially depreciated  following the January FOMC meeting, but it 
retraced th is move as major foreign central banks  signaled increased 
accommodation  amid  growth concerns .  We expect the broad real dollar to 
appreciate at an annual rate of  1.7 percent through 2021, as market 
expectations for the federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast .  The 
broad real dollar at the end of the forecast horizon is little changed from the 
January Tealbook .   
Oil Prices  
• The spot price of Brent crude oil is up about $ 5 per barrel from the January 
Tealbook, at $66 per barrel .  Farther -dated futures prices are also up , but less 
than spot prices, resulting in a slightly  downward- sloping  futures curve .  
Prices were supported by reductions in OPEC supply , particularly in Saudi 
Arabia; but the increase in oil prices also coincided with more accommodative 
monetary policy communications  from central banks and market optimism 
regarding  trade negotiations between the United States and China .  At the end 
of January, the Administration imposed sanctions on the Venezuelan state -
owned oil company, sequestering revenues earned in the United States ; 
however, these sanctions do not appear to ha ve had much effect on  oil prices .

  THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  
Taken at face value, the incoming data indicate that growth of aggregate demand 
has weakened materially .  Top -line GDP was reported to have increased at an annual rate 
of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018, just a bit below our estimate in the January  
Tealbook .  However , private domestic final purchases , which we find to be more 
indicative of underlying momentum, were a good deal weaker than expected, while 
inventory investment was larger .  Moreover, t he softening in the available spending 
indicators led us to forecast GDP growth of  just 1 percent this quarter .3  Nonetheless , 
given the generally solid labor market indicators and other fundamentals for spending, we assume that a fair bit  of the softening will prove to be transient , and thus we expect 
growth to move back  up to 2. 6 percent in the second  quarter .   
• We estimate that the partial government shutdown lowered GDP growth 
0.3 percentage point in the first quarter, primarily reflect ing lost government 
production.  As production in the government sector returns to baseline in the second quarter, we project that output growth will be boosted by 0.4 percentage point .  If not for  the effect of the shutdown, projected GDP 
growth would be 1.3 percent in the first quarter and 2.2 percent in the second 
quarter.  
• Although real consumer spending rose a solid 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter,  that growth rate was 1  percentage point less than we had expected  in 
our previous projection , as retail sales were reported to have plunged in 
December.
4  In addition, motor vehicle sales weakened notably in January and 
February, and a lthough measures of consumer confidence remain fairly high, 
they have softened a little, on balance, over the past few months .  In all, even 
assuming a  solid gain  in retail sales in January, we now project real PCE 
growth at just 1 percent in the first quarter.  
                                                 
3 The median prediction of first -quarter GDP growth from the Federal Reserve System’s suite of 
nowcasting models  is 1.9 percent.  
4 Initial readings on retail spending around the turn of the year from First Data indicated a strong 
increase in spending —which was at odds with the Census Bureau’s retail sales data for December.  
However, recent revisions to the First Data estimates now also show some softening in spending, though 
still not to the extent of the Census data.  The Census Bureau will release retail sales data for January , and 
any revisions to earlier months,  on Monday, March 11 .

  • In recent  Tealbooks , we projected  PCE growth to slow this year, but this 
quarter’s slowing now appears likely to be  much more pronounced than we 
expected .  Given our continued positive expectations about employment, 
income, household wealth,  and consumer sentiment , we expect PCE growth to 
move back up to a solid 2¾  percent pace over the remainder of the year .   
• After h aving increased 7 percent in 2018 , business fixed investment  (BFI) is 
expected to decelerate substantially  this year as business output growth slows  
from an elevated pace in 2018  and interest rates rise further .  The latest data 
provide some corroboration of this assessment .  Orders of nondefense capital 
goods declined in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are now below the level of 
shipments, suggesting that shipments are likely to flatten out this quarter .  
Spending on structures has also been soft recently , and we expect only modest 
gains this year, in part because lower oil prices imply a slowdown of 
investment in drilling structures after the rapid g rowth  of 2017 and 2018.  
Year -ahead earnings expectations have turned negative in recent months, 
though lon ger-run profits expectations have remained quite upbeat .  Taking all 
of these factors into account, we expect sluggish  BFI growth  of 2½ percent 
this year . 
• Housing activity , which weakened  throughout 2018, appears to be 
deteriorating more  this quarter than we  had expected .  Incoming data through 
January on s ingle -family starts  and permits and on existing home sales have 
disappointed, on balance, and w e have marked down our first -quarter  forecast .  
Still, the decline in mortgage interest rates over the past s everal months should 
help arrest the decline, and we expect residential investment to begin to grow 
again  in the second quarter .  (For more on this topic, see the box “The Current 
Weakness in Residential Investment .”) 
• Smoothing through some wide quarter -to-quarter swings, we now estimate 
that net exports subtracted about 1 percentage point from GDP growth in  the 
second half of last year, and about 0.3 percentage point for the year as a 
whole .  The brisk pace of domestic activity led to above -trend import growth, 
and slowing foreign growth held down exports .  As domestic demand slow s in 
the first half of 2019, import growth is also expected to slow, and net exports are projected to reduce GDP growth by just 0. 2 percentage point .

 The Current  Weakness in Residential Investment  
Housing activity was surprisingly weak last year.  R esidential investment declined  for the 
first time since the recovery began , and incoming data indicate that the weakness has  
extended  into this year.  We had expected the rise in mortgage interest rates in 2018 to 
be a drag on the housing market, but investment has been weaker than  we projected, 
even though the level of mortgage r ates at the end of last year was close to our 
projection at the beginning of the year.  
Coming into 2018, the staff expected s low but steady growth in residential investment, 
consistent with a simulation of our fundamentals  model, shown by the dashed blue line in 
figure 1.  This model relates housing demand and investment to a set of fundamentals  
that includes mortgage rates.  Unsurprisingly, mortgage  rates —which rose about 
1 percentage point  from the end of 2017 through late 2018 —exerted  considerable 
downward pressure on the model’s projection of investment growth in 2018, but this 
pressure was  offset by other factors, including strong overall economic growth and 
healthy gains in household income.  
In contrast, the dotted red line shows a simulation of a different model that we use 
specifically to inform our near- term outlook.  This model conditions on several indicators 
that we select from a much larger set  of data  using  a standard machine learning 
technique.  The indicators  model also saw a considerable drag on investment growth 
from the rise in mortgage rates last year and by roughly the same magnitude as in the 
fundamentals  model.  But it took  additional negative signal from other indicators —most 
notably , the low level of homebu ying sentiment , shown in figure 2 —yielding a forecast 
for growth in 2018 that track ed a bit  below  the staff’s  current estimate  of actual 
investment  (the solid black line in figure 1 ).

Ac
cording to t he detailed questions in the University of Michigan Survey s of Consumers , 
the decline in homebuying sentiment in recent years is the result of  households’ 
perceptions of both higher mortgage rates and rising housing prices  (figure 3) .  Although  
prices  have decelerated recently, they  remain much higher relative to income than 
several years ago, which has combined with higher mortgage rates to reduce 
affordability.  We think that rising house prices, taken in combination with moderate 
levels of investment, have  reflected relatively tight supply conditions, inc luding of land, 
labor and materials.  That said, it seems unlikely  that supply  conditions  worsened 
sufficiently in 2018 to account for  the swing  in investment.  
Another possible contributor to weak residential investment was tax policy.  The Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act  put new caps on both the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction 
for state and local taxes , and it increased  the number of filers who claim the standard 
deduction rather than itemizing.  However, we have not found evidence in the data of a 
material drag of tax reform on housing activity or prices.  Accordingly, we continue to 
believe that the effects of the changes in tax policy  on nationwide housing demand are 
likely small, as the additional disposable income flowing to households from lower  tax 
rates is estimated to roughly balance out the less  favorable treatment of housing itself.   
In summary, we view residential investment last year as having been weaker than our 
usual reading of the fundamentals would suggest, though closer to what  one would 
expect  after accounting for homebuying sentiment.  Looking ahead , residential 
investment  in our projection begins to grow again in the second quarter, consistent with

  • Firms accumulated i nventor ies at a high rate in the second half of 2018.  We 
anticipate that  firms will slow the pace of inventory accumulation this year  to 
prevent an excessive buildup , implying a small drag on GDP growth in 2019.  
• After a solid increase in the fourth quarter, industrial production declined  in 
January as motor vehicle manufacturers pulled back on assemblies , and 
manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles also turned down.  Motor 
vehicle production plans call for a partial rebound in February  and March , but 
the recent sales weakness suggests those plans may be trimmed .  In addition , 
readings from  national and regional surveys of manufacturers have softened 
appreciably in recent months and point to only modest i ncreases in 
manufacturing production ahead.5   
Although  the incoming data have led us to revise down our project ion for GDP 
growth in  the first half of this year , we have maintained our projection for growth just 
under 2 percent in the second half  and boos ted slightly our forecast for growth in 2020 
and 2021, reflecting  improved financial conditions .  With regard to the contour of the 
projection, w e see the past  tightening of monetary policy as contributing to the slow ing in  
GDP growth this year, and we project that the additional assumed  tightening, along with 
waning fiscal support, will lead to a further deceleration in economic activity in 2021.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  AND RESOURCE UTILIZATION  
Taken together, the two employment reports that we have received since the 
January Tealbook indicate that the labor market  has continued to gradually tighten.  Even 
when the weak February reading  is taken into account , average payroll employment 
growth has remained solid in r ecent months , the unemployment rate  has remained low , 
and labor force participation  has picked up .  Given the projected slowing in aggregate 
demand growth this year, we expect employment gains to slow over the course of this  
year.    
• In the establishment s urvey, total nonfarm payrolls increased  more than 
300,000 in January but only 20,000 in February .  Our translation of the 
microdata from the payroll -processing firm ADP also pointed to a marked  
deceleration in private employment last month , and the pooled estimate of 
                                                 
5 The step -down in motor vehicle production thi s quarter is roughly consistent with a ½ percentage 
point drag on GDP growth.

  private employment growth that co mbines the signals from the BL S and 
ADP/FRB payroll estimates  stood at 106,000 in February. 
o We believe some of the weakness in  February job growth is weath er 
related, as evidenced by a large pa yroll decline in the weather -
sensitive construction sector a nd an increase in the number of 
household survey respondents indi cating they were not at work o r 
working part time because of bad weather.    
o Payroll gains over the past three months averaged a solid 186,0 00, 
which is nevertheless below our expectations in the January Tea lbook.  
In response to these data along w ith the weaker near-term GDP 
projection, we marked down our forecas t for payroll gains in co ming 
months by about 20,000, to an ave rage of about 165,000 per mont h. 
 The unemployment rate moved back down to 3.8 percent in Februar y but was 
still 0.1 percentage point above our  projection in the previous  Tealbook.  We 
project the unemployment rat e will edge down to 3.7 percent in the second 
quarter. 
 The labor force participation rat e (LFPR) moved up further in the first two 
months of the year to 63.2 percent; this level was two-tenths h igher than in the 
January Tealbook and is well above the 62.8 percent level that we expected to 
prevail in the first quarter of 2019 as recently as last fall.   
 In response to the continuing str ength in labor force participa tion, we nudged 
up our estimate of its trend level by 0.2 percentage point in r ecent years, 
putting the level of the trend at 62.8 percent in the current q uarter (now 
0.4 percentage point below the actual participat ion rate).   
 With this revision to trend la bor force partic ipation, together  with the softer 
near-term GDP growth, we now estimate the output gap to be 2 pe rcent in the 
first half of this year, ½ percen tage point less tight than we estimated in the 
January Tealbook.

  We expect labor market conditi ons to tighten further through 20 20 before easing 
somewhat in 2021.   
 We project the unemployment rate will edge down to 3.6 percent by the end 
of this year, hold at 3.6 per cent through 2020, and return to 3.7 percent by the 
end of 2021—nearly 1 percentage point  below our estimate of its  natural rate.   
o Over the medium term, the output gap is projected to be roughly  
½ percentage point narrower than i t was in the January Tealbook , and 
the unemployment rate is 0.1 percentage point higher.6   
 Strong job gains and rising real w ages are expected to continue  to draw 
individuals into the labor f orce while also damping outflows, and thus we 
project the LFPR to be above our estimate of its trend over the  medium term.   
 Average monthly total payroll ga ins slow over the projection, f rom 150,000 
this year to 130,000 in 2020 and 75,000 in 2021.   
 Business-sector labor productivit y is reported to have increased almost 
2 percent last year.  As the productivity data are highly varia ble, we continue 
to take little signal from that pickup, and we expect productiv ity growth to 
average about 1 percent over the medium term, close to its aver age so far this 
expansion. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Core PCE prices increased 1.9 per cent over the 12 months ending  in December, 
and total inflation was 1.7 percen t.  We continue to project that core PCE inflation (on a 
four-quarter change basis) will edge up to 2 percent by the third quarter of 2019 as 
resource utilization tightens s lightly further.  Core inflation  remains at that level in 2020 
and 2021, as our assumption of a gradual small increase in unde rlying inflation is offset 
by a greater drag from import pric es after this  year as tariff effects fade.  Given the 
                                                 
6 We assume that the response of the unemployment rate to change s in the output gap is only about 
one-half as large during periods of very tight labor markets as  it is during other periods, and that the LFPR 
becomes more cyclically sensitive in a tight labor market.  Wit hout the assumed attenuation in the 
unemployment rate response, the upward revision to the unemploy ment rate in this projection would have 
been about 0.2 percentage point.

  assumed downward trajectory of oil  prices, total PCE inflation is projected to run slightly 
below core inflation throughout the medium term. 
 The incoming data on prices, includi ng the CPI and PPI data for  January, are 
in line with our January Teal book projection, and we continue to expect the 
12-month change in core PCE pr ices to remain near 1.9 percent f or a few 
more months. 
o Monthly readings on core PCE price inflation slowed a bit in th e 
second half of last year.  Howev er, the second-half decline was largely 
driven by some weak readings in pr ices for goods (for example, 
apparel) that we think are providing little signal for future i nflation.  In 
addition, residual seasonality tends to hold down measured PCE 
inflation toward t he end of the year. 
 Total PCE price inflation is be ing restrained by recent decline s in consumer 
energy prices.  We expect the 12-m onth change in total PCE pric es to move 
down to 1.5 percent in January and F ebruary before moving back up to 
1.7 percent in March.   
 Boosted by implemented tariffs, the effective price of imported  goods is 
estimated to have risen about 2.5 pe rcent (at an annual rate) in the second half 
of 2018.  With no additional tariff changes in our forecast, im port prices are 
expected to rise less than 1 pe rcent per year in 2019 and there after, restrained 
by the gradual appreciation of the dollar and consistent with m oderate foreign 
inflation.  Effective core import prices are estimated to have been neutral for 
PCE price inflation in 2018 and are expected to hold down core inflation only 
slightly in 2019, as the estimated boost from tariff hikes larg ely offsets the 
drag from dollar appreciati on and weak nonfuel commodity prices .  For the 
remainder of the medium term, w ith no further boosts from tarif f hikes, core 
import price inflation is proje cted to be a bit more of a drag on core PCE price 
inflation. 
 The latest readings on longer-ter m inflation expectations sugge st, on balance, 
that expectations remain well anchored.

  o Among survey-based measures, long- term inflation expectations f rom 
the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers came in just be low 
the range of recent years and matched the all-time low for this  measure 
(from December 2016).  However, the median of three-year-ahead 
expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of 
Consumer Expectations remained w ithin its range of readings in recent 
years.   
o TIPS-based measures of longer-term  inflation compensation have 
increased some since the January Tealbook. 
  The incoming data on labor compensation remain consistent wit h the gradual 
firming we have been projecting. 
 The average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm pay rolls rose 
3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in February, up from 2.6 percent a year 
earlier.   
 Compensation per hour (CPH) in the  business sector rose 2.9 per cent over the 
four quarters of 2018, about the sam e as a year earlier.  Over the remainder of 
the forecast, we project gain s of about 3¾ percent per year, a pace we think is 
more in line with tight labor m arket conditions, trend price in flation, and trend 
productivity growth.   
 The employment cost index (EC I) rose 3 percent over the 12 mont hs ending in 
December, compared with 2.6 percent a year earlier.  We expect it will 
continue rising at a similar pace over the medium term.  (Note that increases 
in the ECI tend to run a little lo wer than those in business-se ctor CPH.) 
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Atla nta’s Wage Growth Tracker was 
3.7 percent in January, near the  upper end of the range observe d in recent 
years. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment wil l remain at 
4.6 percent.  Also, as in previous Tealbooks, we assume that po tential output

  growth slows after 2021, as the boost to potential from fiscal policy wanes, 
and that growth converges to 1.7 pe rcent per year in the longer  run.   
 We have maintained our assumption t hat the real equilibrium fed eral funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run will be 0.5 percent.  The nominal yield 
on 10-year Treasury securities is assumed to be 3.4 percent in the longer run.   
o We expect that the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities will 
continue to put downward pressure  on longer-term interest rates , 
though to a diminishing extent over time.  
o We continue to assume that, in the longer run, fiscal policymak ers will 
gradually reduce deficits by an a mount sufficient to stabilize the debt-
to-GDP ratio.  We expect thi s ratio to level off at around 105 percent 
of GDP, 20 percentage points hi gher than would have occurred in  the 
absence of recent and projected policy actions.  We also contin ue to 
anticipate that this increment to the debt-to-GDP ratio will pu sh up the 
term premium on 10-year Treasury y ields 50 basis points in the longer 
run. 
 With these assumptions, GDP grow th slows to about 1.3 percent f rom 2022 to 
2024, as the federal funds rate is  above its neutral level and the contribution to 
growth from fiscal policy fades .  The unemployment rate moves u p gradually 
from 3.7 percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural rate in 
subsequent years.  PCE price in flation remains close to 2 perce nt throughout.   
 With resource utilization easi ng only slowly and  inflation remaining close to 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the nominal federal funds rate moves 
down gradually from about 4.1 percent at the end of the medium term toward 
its longer-run value  of 2½ percent.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Although many of the temporary headwinds to foreign growth that we have 
previously reported have faded, growth abroad remains sluggish and trade has slumped 
globally.  We still expect growth to pick up later this year, supported by more favorable 
global financial conditions that reflect, in part, expectations of easier policy.  That said, we have become increasingly cognizant of the risks of a more pronounced and sustained slowdown abroad.   
Foreign real GDP growth dropped to a tepid 1.7 percent at an annua l rate in the 
fourth quarter from 2.1 percent in the third—½ percentage point below our already weakened estimate at the time of the January Tealbook.  The fourth -quarter slowdown 
reflected unexpected weakness in Canada and in some emerging market economies (EMEs), including Mexico and Brazil, as well as continued subdued performance in the euro area.  Furthermore, data on PMIs and industrial production since the time of the January Tealbook have continued to come in somewhat below expectations.  All told, the 
data now point to a considerable slowdown in world trade and manufacturing, although 
some indicators for domestic demand and services have held up.  Consequently, we revised down our outlook for foreign growth over the first half of this year by about ¼ percentage point and now see growth abroad continuing at its lackluster pace of late last year into the current quarter.  
We still see foreign growth turning up later this year to nearly 2½ percent, about 
its potential pace.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), growth is supported by continued highly accommodative macroeconomic policies, in line with the more dovish central bank communications in recent weeks.  In China, a measured increase in stimulus will likely pull up activity there and in the rest of the world, particularly in emerging Asia 
and the commodity-intensive economies in South America.  Canadian growth should also 
pick up as oil production rebounds from current cutbacks.   
That said, our baseline outlook is confronting an uncomfortable fact:  We have 
repeatedly marked down our foreign outlook over the past year in response to 
disappointing incoming data.  As a result, although we still see growth picking up from 
its soft patch, we acknowledge that a more persistent loss of momentum in the foreign

  economies may be in the offing.  We explore the consequences of such an outcome in our 
“Foreign Slowdown” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.   
In addition to this generalized risk, we are also keeping a watchful eye on some 
more specific triggers for distress abroad.  First, there could be a no- deal Brexit that roils 
global markets.  Second, Italy has been in a recession since mid -2018, and political and 
financial conditions there could deteriorate further, inflicting collateral damage in Europe and beyond.  Third, China remains financially vulnerable, exposing it to any number of adverse shocks.  These downside risks are undoubtedly weighing on business and 
consumer sentiment, but they also hint at an upside:  As we discuss in our “Everything 
Goes Right Abroad” alternative scenario, should these challenges be resolved more favorably than assumed in the baseline, this rosier outcome could provide a significant 
boost to the U.S. and global economy.   
Consistent with the subdued pace of economic growth, we see foreign inflation 
remaining very low in the first quarter, held down by the pass-through of earlier declines in energy prices, weak activity, and, in the EMEs, by drops in food prices .  We expect 
inflation in the major AF Es to edge down to ½ percent at an annual rate in the first 
quarter from ¾ percent in the fourth.  Core inflation in the euro area and Japan remains depressed.  With inflation persistently below target levels and given renewed concerns 
about the economic outlook, we see AFE central banks delaying any further removal of 
policy accommodation.  The European Central Bank (ECB) extended its forward guidance on policy rates and rolled out a new round of loans for euro-area banks to reduce the risk of renewed funding pressures, especially in some periphery countries. 
Concerns about the global outlook, along with reduced financial pressures on 
emerging market s, have prompted several EME central banks to strike a more dovish 
tone in their communications.  In terms of actual actions over the intermeeting period, the Reserve Bank of India cut its policy rate 25 basis points in response to weak inflation readings.  
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro Area .  Following lackluster growth of only 0.8 percent in the second 
half of last year, the softness appears to have persisted in the first quarter.  Some headwinds, such as disruptions from social unrest in France, have been unwinding, contributing to a recent uptick in the composite PMI and in retail

 sales.  Even so, several sentiment indicators weakened further.  The 
disappointing data suggest that underlying growth momentum is less than we previously judged, likely reflecting weaker external demand (as discussed in the box “Euro-Area Growth and the Export Slowdown”) and last ye ar’s 
tightening of financial conditions, especially in Italy.  Accordingly, we now expect GDP growth to stay around 1 percent in 2019 before gradually rising to above potential (estimated to be 1½ percent) in 2021, supported by still-accommodative monetary  policy, solid real wage growth, and a reduction in 
uncertainty related to Brexit and Italy.  
Core inflation remained  around 1 percent on a 12-month basis in February, 
and some market -based measures of long -term inflation expectations have 
continued drift ing down.  Given the subdued growth outlook, inflation  should 
remain mired near  1 percent this year before  edging up only to 1¼ percent in 
2021.  Against this backdrop, the ECB is likely to maintain a highly accommodative policy stance.  At its March 7 meeting, the ECB announced a new round of 2- year floating -rate targeted long -term refinancing operations 
for euro -area banks starting in September.  The ECB also extended i ts 
commitment to hold its policy rates steady at least through the end of 2019 (about one quarter later than its previous commitment).  We assume the ECB will wait until the third quarter of 2020 (one quarter later than assumed in the January Tealbook) to start hiking its deposit rate and not reach 0 percent until 2021.   
•United Kingdom.  Real GDP grew only 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter amid
elevated Brexit uncertainty, tighter financial conditions, and tepid euro- area
activity.  We project that growth will stay near this pace in the first half of2019, in line with weak economic indicators and continued uncertainty aroundthe ratification of a Brexit deal by the U.K. parliament.  That said, wecontinue to assume that the United Kingdom, after securing an extension tothe end  of March deadline, will exit the European Union (EU) without major
disruptions by midyear and then start a transition period during which it will
negotiate its future relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.  As
Brexit -related uncertainty gets resolved, growth should rise to almost
2 percent in the second half of 2019.  However, as a no- deal Brexit is still
possible, both U.K. and EU authorities are stepping up their preparations.  Inparticular, the Bank of England (BOE) announced additional weekly sterling

 Euro -Area Growth and the Export Slowdown 
Euro- area real GDP growth (black line in figure 1) slowed markedly , from 2.7 percent in 2017 to 1. 1 percent 
in 2018, with Italy falling into a technical recession and Germany avoiding one only narrowly.  Observers 
have suggested that  weaker demand from China may help  explain  this slowdown.  This discussion  
examines the factors behind the recent euro-area slowdown.  We find that , although weaker external 
demand account s for the slowdown in euro- area growth, China does not appear to have played a 
dominant  role.  
Weaker export  growth  has been the main source of the euro- area slowdown.  T he contribution of exp orts 
to real GDP growth (red bars  in figure 1 ) declined from 3.1 percentage points in 2017 to 0. 8 percentage 
point in 2018 , more than fully accounting for the slowdown in growth over the same period.   
What drove this export slowdown?  Two factors are the significant slowdown  in average growth of the 
euro area’s main trading partners in 2018 (bl ack line in figure 2 ) and the substantial appreciation of the 
trade- weighted real euro in 2017 and in the first half  of 2018 ( red line ).  To quantify the importance of 
these factors, we estimated the historical relationship between euro- area real export growth, the trade-
weighted real euro, and foreign growth from  2001 to 2016.  We then used this model to predict  export 
growth in 2017 and 2018 (dashed black line  in figure 3 on the next page ) and parse the contributions from 
the euro and foreign growth.1  The model suggests that the slowdown in foreign growth (red bar) was an 
important  factor , although euro appreciation (blue bars) also weighed on export s somewhat .  That said, 
the model can explain only part of the slowdown in actual export growth ( solid black line) .  
What trading partners account for the slowdown in actual export growth?  Although exports to China 
have slowed (proportionally) more than total exports, China accounts for less than 10 percent of euro-area exports, and the slowdown in exports has been broad based across most major trading partners.  As a result, China’s direct contribution to the slowdown (red bars in figure 4  on the next page), while 
noticeable, has been limited compared with  the contributions from other important trading partners such 
as other European economies (light and dark blue bars).   
A disproportionate share of the slowdown in exports to Europe has come from emerging European  
economies (such as Turkey and Russia included in the light blue bar of figure 4).  This fact suggests that 
the general tightening in global financial conditions in 2018, which weighed substantially on domestic 
demand in emerging markets around the world, may have also been an important driver of the slowdown in euro- area exports .  
 
 
 
 
     
 
    
                                                 
1 We regress the four -quarter change in real exports on the four -quarter changes in foreign real GDP (using 
weights reflecting each country’s importance in euro -area trade) and the real trade -weighted euro, as well as the 
first lag of the dependent variable.  Since we include a lagged dependent variable, we generate the out -of-sample 
forecast recursively using the model’s prediction of lagged real export growth (rather than actual lagged export 
growth).

t is possible that this accounting decomposition significantly understates the importance of China; the 
Chinese slowdown could have weighed heavily on growth in the euro area’s other trading partners , which 
in turn  would reduce their imports from the euro area.   However, we tested this hypothesis, and we did 
not find that euro- area exports weakened most to countries with relatively stronger trading relationships 
with Ch ina.  In addition, even though Chinese import growth slumped markedly in the fourth quarter of 
2018, euro- area export growth in that quarter was relatively solid.  All told, our analysis suggests that 
while a weakening of export growth has played an important role in the euro- area slowdown, slackening 
demand from China has been a significant but not dominant factor; weaker demand from other European 
economies has played an even more important role. 
The foregoing analysis has considered the effects of the fairly modest deceleration in China’s growth to 
6.4 percent in 2018 from 6.7 percent in the previous year.  An important open question is how the euro area would be affected  in the event of a more substantial falloff in China’s growth accompanied by a rise 
in financial stress.  According to the staff’s SIGMA model, a slowing in China’s GDP growth to 4 percent in 2019 –2020 —compared with  around 6 percent in our baseline —could p ush the euro area into recession 
(figure 5, red line) given its limited ability to respond by easing monetary or fiscal policy.

  liquidity auctions and activated euro swap lines with the ECB to mitigate 
possible funding pressures. 
In line with a weaker economic outlook and the more dovish tone of its recent 
communications, we expect the BOE to wa it until the end of 2019, one quarter 
later than anticipated in the January Tealbook, to resume tightening its policy stance.  And we see the BOE raising its policy rate only to 1.5 percent by 2021, ¼ percentage point lower than previously assumed. 
• Canada.  Temporary oil production cuts and a weakening housing market led real GDP growth to drop to 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 2 percent in the third.  Weak PMIs and slower projected U.S. growth suggest that Canadian growth will edge up to only 1 percent in the current quarter.  As oil 
production recovers, growth should rebound to nearly 2 percent in the second 
quarter before settling at a near -potential pace of 1¾ percent thereafter.   
With recent communications by the Bank of Canada (BOC) highlighti ng the 
weaker outlook for the domestic economy and elevated uncertainty about global demand, we expect that the BOC will raise its interest rate only in the fourth quarter of 2019, two quarters later than assumed in the January 
Tealbook.  We also expect a more gradual tightening schedule, with the policy rate rising from 1.75  percent currently to 2.75 percent in 2021. 
• Japan.  Following a weaker -than-expected 1.9  percent rebound in the fourth 
quarter, recent data suggest  that GDP growth will slow  to a pace of just 
½ percent in the current quarter .  Exports and industrial production declined 
sharply in January, and the manufacturing PMI moved into contractionary territory in February.  Going forward, we project that growth will hover near its poten tial pace of ¾  percent over much of the forecast period.  We expect 
the October 2019 consumption tax hike to induce only a mild and short- lived 
contraction, given the Japanese government’s recent announcement that it plans to allocate much of the additiona l revenues from the tax increase toward 
new public expenditures.  Relative to the January Tealbook, this forecast is nearly ½ percentage point weaker in the first half of this year and little changed thereafter.  
With the growth outlook weaker and inflatio n remain ing well below the Bank 
of Japan’s (BOJ) 2 percent inflation target, we now see the BOJ lifting its

target for the 10-year yield on Japanese government bonds from 0 percent to 
¼ pe rcent  in late 2021, one year later than assumed in the January Tealbook. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
•China .  Real GDP growth slowed to just under 6 percent in the second half of
2018 from 7  percent in the first half of the year in response to the Chinese
government's efforts to rein in risky financial activities and reduce high levels
of corporate debt.  To ward off further slowing and with increased tradetensions weighing on the outlook, Chinese authorities have unveiled stimulusmeasures  over the past half-year, including cutting banks’ required reserve
ratios  and boosting credit to local governments for infrastructure spending.
Although infrastructure investment has firmed, broader economic
improvement has proved elusive, and consumption remains soft.  For
example, auto sales, which accounted for the bulk of the decline in retail salesgrowth last year, fell further in January.  We now see growth slowing furtherto 5¾ percent in the current quarter, about ¼ percentage point below ourJanuary Tealbook projection.
In early March, at the annual National People’s Congress, Chinese authorities
announced a more proactive fiscal policy, including a VAT cut and additional
credit to local governments.  Even so, the easing measures announced sincelast year appear to involve far less stimulus than the “credit floodgates” thatthe go vernment opened during the 2008-09 and 2015-16 episodes, indicating
that Chinese authorities are reluctant to abandon their de -risking campaign .
We expect growth to improve in the second half of this year as the negativedrag from tighter credit conditions fades and fiscal stimulus provides some
modest additional boost to bring growth to the government’s new growth
target of 6 to 6.5 percent .  However, with Chinese real indicators still
weakening  and financial vulnerabilities still very evident, a sharp slowdown
remains a significant risk.
•Other Emerging Asia .  Weak external demand continues to weigh on growth
in the region.  Following a sharp drop in exports in late 2018, incoming tradedata and export orders have been tepid, with especially poor performance in
the high- tech sector.   Moreover, PMIs declined through February and the
sparse hard data on manufacturing have been downbeat.  We now expect
Int’lEconDevel&Outlook
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
March 8, 2019
Page 45 of 136
Authorized for Public Release
 growth to ease to 2.7 percent in the first quarter from 2.9 percent in the fourth 
quarter.  Accommodative mac roeconomic policies and the expected 
strengthening in China should help growth in Asia rise toward its potential rate, 3½ percent, by the end of the year and remain near that pace through the 
end of the forecast period.  
•Mexico.  R eal GDP growth retrenched sharply to 1 percent in the fourth
quarter from 2.4 percent in the third.  Manufacturing production and exports
were lackluster, and household demand was soft even as unemployment
remained l
ow.  Fixed investment continued to stagnate, in part pulled down by
falling investment of the troubled government-owned energy firm, Pemex.
Although trade-r elated
 uncertainties appear to have receded as a constraint on
private investment, worries have refocused on the economic policies of
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
Although Mexico’ manufacturing PMIs moved well into expansionary
territory in February, we 
expect growth to edge down further to 0.8 percent in
the first quarter, as U.S. manufacturing production has softened and gasoline
shortages and labor strikes have disrupted activity.  Growth should pick back
up to about 2 percent in the second quarter and gradually move up to its
potential rate of about 2½ percent by 2020.
Concerns about economic policy have prompted us to downgrade our medium-
term outlook for Mexican growth by about ¼ percentage point.  The
government intends to expand its role in the energy sector, undermining the
2013 reform that opened the sector to private investment.  The abrupt
cancelation of construction on a new Mexico City airport  last fall also raised
questions about the investment climate.  And even this subdued forecast is
subject to sizable downside risks.
•Brazil.  Brazil’s 
climb out of its deepest recession on record sputtered yet
again, as real GDP growth expanded a paltry 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
Although manufacturing and service PMIs have improved in recent months,
industrial production has continued to stagnate, and we now see growth
stepping up to only 1.7 percent in the current quarter.  We expect that growth
will reach
 a s
till-moderate level of 2½ percent by the second half of this year.
This baseline scenario assumes that Brazil’s new government secures support

 for pension reform later this year, hence taking a decisive step toward 
addressing Brazil’s serious fiscal imbalances.  But, there is a material risk that the fiscal reforms are not aggressive enough to allay concerns about Brazil’s high level of public debt, which is nearly 90 percent of GDP, increasing the 
risk of a debt crisis.

 Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, monetary policy communications th at were viewed 
as more accommodative than had been expected and optimism regarding trade 
negotiations between the United S tates and China contributed to  a further rebound in 
sentiment toward risky assets; e quity price indexes rose notabl y, and corporate bond 
spreads narrowed.  In contrast, T reasury yields declined slight ly, on net, as downward 
pressure from market perceptions of more accommodative policy a ppeared to outweigh 
upward pressure from the improvement in risk sentiment and U.S.  economic data releases 
that, on balance, prompted posit ive reactions in yields.1 
The S&P 500 index increased 4 perc ent over the intermeeting per iod.  Option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 i ndex—the VIX—decreased modes tly, on
net, and corporate bond spreads  narrowed 14 basis points for in vestment-
grade bonds and 31 basis points for speculative-grade bonds.
As was the case through Januar y, investors appear to expect no change in the
target range for the federal funds rate at the March FOMC meeting.  Lookingfurther ahead, the expected path f or the federal funds rate ove r the next several
years shifted down slightly.
Yields on nominal Treasury securiti es decreased slightly; on net, 2- and
10-year yields edged down 8 basis points and 6 basis points, re spectively, over
the period.  Inflation compensat ion rose 3 basis points and 10 basis points,
respectively, for the 5-year  and 5-to-10-year horizons.
The prices of risky foreign assets  generally increased, with ma jor equity
indexes around the world risi ng over the period and flows into emerging
market–dedicated funds remaining solid.
1 The analysis in this section re flects market data through clos e of business on M arch 7.  On the 
morning of March 8, the Bureau of Labor Statistics published th e February Employment Situation report.  
Although market commentary described employment growth in the r eport as far below expectations, 
Treasury yields were little changed across the maturity spectru m, and equity futures p rices fell only about 
½ percent, on net, in the first hour of trading subsequent to t he release.

  DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Investor sentiment toward risky assets continued to improve ove r the intermeeting 
period, bolstered by FOMC communicat ions indicating that the Committee would be 
“patient” in adjusting the sta nce of policy and by  increased op timism about a trade deal 
between the United States and C hina (for a discussion of asset price changes over a 
longer horizon, see the box “The Pa rtial Recovery in Investor R isk Sentiment This 
Year”).  Major stock price inde xes increased notably, with broa d-based gains across 
sectors, despite generally lackluster earnings news.  Consistent with renewed optimism 
about a trade deal, stock prices  of firms with high internation al sales and greater exposure 
to China generally outperforme d the S&P 500 index.  The VIX dec reased modestly, on 
net, over the period and now stands  at a level slightly below its long-run median.  Spreads 
on both investment- and speculativ e-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity 
Treasury yields also narrowed. 
Yields on nominal Treasury securiti es moved within a relatively  narrow range 
over the intermeeting period.  Improved risk sentiment—together with economic data releases that appeared, on balance, to surprise market particip ants positively—put upward 
pressure on yields.
2  However, the January FOMC statement and press conference were  
viewed as more accommodative than had been expected, and subseq uent communications 
from policymakers reinforced those expectations, putting downwa rd pressure on yields.  
On balance, Treasury yields declined a bit over the period.  Ev en so, 5-year and 5-to-10-
year TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation rose 3 basis  points and 10 basis 
points, respectively, likely ref lecting, in part, rising oil pr ices and the January CPI 
release, which came in above market expectations. 
As was the case in January, investors appear to expect no change in the target 
range for the federal funds rate at the March FOMC meeting.  Lo oking further ahead, 
market-based measures of the e xpected path for the federal fund s rate at longer horizons 
shifted down a little.  A strai ght read of market quotes sugges ts that investors now expect 
the target range for the feder al funds rate to decline slightly  during 2019 and to further 
decline about 20 basis points and about 5 basis points in 2020 and 2021, respectively.  In 
contrast, a staff model that adj usts for term premiums projects  increases at a pace of 
                                                 
2 Economic data releases with par ticularly large positive effect s on yields over the intermeeting 
period were the January employment report, the ISM manufacturing report, the January  CPI release, the 
fourth-quarter 2018 GDP release, and the Chicago PMI release.  Economic data releases with particularly 
large negative effects on yields were retail sales and initial jobless claims.

 The  Partial  Recovery  in Investor Risk Sentiment  This  Year 
Investor risk  appetite has rebounded  considerably  year‐to‐date after having  deteriorated  
markedly in  the fourth quarter  in the face of rising U.S. recession concerns,  worries that the 
Federal Reserve  would continue  along a path of policy firming and balance sheet  reduction 
despite those concerns,  greater global  risks, and heightened  trade tensions.  This year, asset  prices 
have been boosted  primarily  by communications  indicating  that the FOMC  would be “patient”  in 
adjusting  the stance of  policy and by optimism  regarding  trade negotiations  with China.  
Nonetheless, investor  risk sentiment has  not fully recovered to its  elevated  September  levels.1  
Although  the S&P 500 index is up  roughly 10 percent  this year, it remains about 6 percent below 
its level at the end  of September.2  Likewise, risk spreads  on speculative ‐grade corporate bonds  
relative to comparable‐maturity  Treasury  securities,  which climbed sharply last quarter, have  
narrowed  about 80 basis points year‐ to‐date but are  still about  50 basis points wider than in late 
September.  In  contrast,  the dollar is  little changed, on  net, over  the same  period.3   
Consistent  with a net deterioration  in investor risk sentiment,  2‐ and 10‐year nominal  Treasury  
yields are  now lower by  34 basis points and 41 basis points, respectively, than  at the end of 
September.  Expectations  for more  accommodative  monetary  policy than was anticipated  last fall 
also contributed  importantly  to the decline in yields.  Indeed, the June  2020 federal  funds futures 
rate fell 55 basis  points since September.  The sizable decline  in the market‐implied path of the 
federal funds  rate suggests  that investors  believe the FOMC is more attuned to the downside  
risks to the  macroeconomic  outlook than in September. 
 
                                                 
1 This discussion  reflects  data that were available through March 7, before the release of the BLS February  
Employment  Situation  report on the morning of March 8. 
2 We use the last trading  day of the third quarter—September  28, 2018—as  our reference  date.   The 
conclusions  are qualitatively  unchanged  if we instead  use as the reference  date the S&P 500 index’s all‐time 
closing high on September  20, 2018; relative to its peak, the S&P 500 index  is down 6.2 percent. 
3 The modest  change in the broad dollar  since September  potentially  reflects two offsetting  factors:   (1) the 
net deterioration  in investor risk sentiment,  which typically would be associated  with dollar  appreciation;  and 
(2) more accommodative  U.S. monetary  policy relative to the change in monetary  policy expectations  abroad, 
which typically would be associated  with dollar depr eciation.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
The prices of foreign risky assets  broadly tracked the positive  moves in similar 
U.S. assets over the interm eeting period.  Communications by ma jor central banks, which 
were more accommodative than expected, along with optimism rega rding trade 
negotiations between the United S tates and China, contributed t o the upward price moves 
and more than offset the effect s of continued concerns about fo reign economic growth.   
Foreign equity prices continued to climb from their December lows.  Over the 
intermeeting period, major equity i ndexes rose more than 4 perc ent in advanced foreign 
economies (AFE S) and about 3 percent in emerging market economies (EMEs), larg ely in 
Asia.  Chinese equity prices were particularly buoyant, rising almost 20 percent on 
optimism over trade negotiations  with the United States and lar ger-than-expected fiscal 
stimulus measures that reduce va lue-added tax rates for the manufacturing and 
construction sector.  The rise i n EME equity indexes also reflected continued strong 
investor demand for EME assets a s measured by flows into EME-dedicated mutual funds. 
Long-term AFE yields fluctuate d over the intermeeting period bu t ended the 
period lower, on net, on concerns a bout slowing foreign economi c growth and related 
dovish communications from majo r central banks.  At its March m eeting, the European 
Central Bank (ECB) extended its commitment to hold its policy r ate steady at least 
through the end of 2019.  The ECB also announced a new round of  low interest rate loans 
to euro-area banks, or targete d longer-term refinancing operati ons (TLTROs).  Long-term 
German sovereign yields declin ed about 4 basis points following the announcement and 
are about 13 basis points lowe r over the period on net.  In the  United Kingdom, yields 
declined 10 basis points over the intermeeting period, notwithstanding a temporary boost 
from the prospect of an extensi on of the March 29  Brexit deadli ne.  Additionally, the 
Bank of England announced additional weekly sterling liquidity auctions and activated 
euro swap lines with the ECB as  a part of its contingency plan in case of a no-deal Brexit 
outcome. 
The broad dollar index gained abou t 1 percent over the intermee ting period.  The 
dollar weakened slightly follo wing the January FOMC meeting, bu t subsequent

SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
The effective federal funds ra te printed consistently at 2.40 p ercent—the same 
level as the interest on excess reserves rate.  Yield spreads o n commercial paper, 
negotiable certificates of depos it, and LIBOR generally narrowe d further from their 
elevated year-end levels, likel y reflecting some pickup in inve stor demand for short-term 
financial assets.  
On March 1, the suspension of t he debt ceiling expired, and the  debt ceiling was 
reestablished at a level of $22.0 trillion.  The Treasury has “ extraordinary measures” that 
can be used over coming months t o keep total debt below the lim it.  These measures are 
expected to be exhausted by lat e summer or early fall.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Information received over the intermeeting period indicates that financing 
conditions for businesses and households were slightly improved, on balance, and remain 
generally supportive of spending.    
•Gross  issuance of corporate bonds and new-money institutional leveraged
loans was strong in February , and implied risk  spreads on those instruments
narrowed  this year .
•Issuance of non -agency CMBS remained s olid through February, and CMBS
spreads narrowed .
•Hom e mortgage rates were about unchanged , and mortgage underwriting
standards continued  to be relatively supportive of borrowing.
•Consumer credit conditions remained generally  supportive of spending,
although the rise in interest rates over the past year co uld weigh  on credit
demand in the coming months.
•Financial  conditions indexes eased  further in recent weeks  and have reverse d
much of the tightening observed through the end of 2018.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms became somewhat more 
accommodative over the intermeeting period , continuing to revers e the tightening that 
occurred  late last year.   Gross issuance of corporate bonds was strong in January and 
February , with both investment- and speculative- grade issuance recovering notably from 
the very low levels seen in December.   Investor appetite for credit risk appears to have 
recovered a fair bit, as suggested by the continued narrowing in corporate bond spreads over the intermeeting per iod.  The  institutional leveraged loan market  recovered  in 
January —following a tightening at the end of last year—resulting in a  pickup in deal 
launches in January and higher issuance of completed new -money leveraged loans in 
February .  Spreads on new-mone y leveraged loans  ticked up over the intermeeting period

  after narrowing in January.   C&I lending showed continued strength in January and is on 
track for a solid increase in February. 
Gross equity issuance through initial public offerings was  sluggish in January and 
February , possibly weighed down by the partial closure of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission during the federal government shutdown.  However, market participants 
continue to expect 2019 to be a strong year for initial offerings, with sever al high -profile 
deals reportedly expected to come to market .  Equity issuance through seasoned offerings 
was slow in January but picked up in February to about an average pace. 
Credit quality in the corporate sector may  have deteriorated a bit on balance.  
Earnings per share of S&P 500 firms decreased about 3 percent in the fourth quarter relative to the previous quarter, and private- sector analysts revised down further their 
projections f or year -ahead earnings .  Even so, actual corporate defaults in recent months 
have remained low, outside of the default of one large utility firm in January.  
Small Business 
Available data suggest that t he supply of credit to small businesses remains 
relatively accommodative .  For example, the fraction of respondents to the Wells Fargo 
Small Business Index survey reporting that it was somewhat or very difficult to obtain credit over the past 12 months is near post-crisis lows at 15 percent.   
However, small business loan originations, as measured by Thomson Reuters and 
PayNet , slowed  at the end of 2018, and December originations were only 2 percent 
higher than a year ago .  The softening in lending volumes appears to  reflect weaker 
demand.  Small business optimism, as measured by the National Federation of Independent Business monthly member polls, has been declining  since peaking in 
August.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions for commercial real estate continued to be generally  
accommodative.  CMBS spreads declined over the intermeeting period , with  triple -B 
spreads now almost back down to their late November levels.  Issuance of non- agency 
CMBS remained strong through February , and CRE lending by banks grew at a healthy 
pace in February following relatively sluggish growth in  January.  New commitments 
from life insura nce companies to fund CRE mortgages continued to be robust through the 
fourth quarter, roughly matching their average pace over the past several years.

  MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative.  Gross 
issuance of municipal bonds was solid in January and February , with new capital raising 
accounting for the majority  of issuance.  The yield ratio on 20-year municipal bonds over 
comparable -maturity Treasury securities dropped slightly over the intermeeting period.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the resi dential mortgage market remained  accommodative 
for most borrowers.   Estimates of maximum debt- to-income ratios allowed by lenders 
held steady in Fe bruary for moderate - and  high -FICO -score borrowers .  Rates on 30- year 
conforming mortgages were about unchanged  since the January  FOMC  meeting .  At 
4.6 percent, mortgage rates are down about 50 basis points from the highs reached in 
November, easing the downward pressure on mortgage origination activity.  After having 
trended down for much of 2018, home-purchase originations were flat in December  and 
edged up in January.   
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally supportive of 
household spending.  Auto loan growth maintained a steady pace through the end of 2018, and gross issuance of prime and subprime auto ABS was robust in early 2019.  That said, the rise in auto loan interest rates over the past year could start to weigh on auto loan demand and vehicle sales  in the coming months.  According to the University 
of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the share of consumers citing high interest rates as a factor for the next 12 months being a bad time to buy a car has trend ed up through 
February.     
Credit card loan growth remained solid through December, though the pace slowed 
during 2018 amid a tightening trend of lending standards by commercial banks.  Bank credit data indicate moderate growth of credit card debt in January and February, while 
gross issuance of credit card ABS was solid , on balance, during these two months.      
FINANCING CONDITIONS INDEXES  
A staff index that provides a measure of financing  conditions for nonfinancial 
corporations indicates that financing conditions continued to ease over the intermeeting 
period and remain accommodative relative to historical standard s.  The easing in

  financing conditions since the beginning of the year is consistent with the decline in 
corporate spreads and the increase in equity prices over the same period .  As shown in the 
appendix to this Tealbook section, other publicly available financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set of financial variables into a summary series, have also eased , 
on net, over the intermeeting period.  These indexes indicate that broad financial conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical standards.

Appendix  
Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes 
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes.”  
Financing Conditions
Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)
March 8, 2019
Page 69 of 136
Authorized for Public Release
The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative- grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.  
The second index in the table  measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending 
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices .  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.
2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both  changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy.

Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.

C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and t he Macroeconomy,” Journal of

category .

 Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS  
We continue to view  the uncertainty around the staff  forecast of economic activity  over 
the next year or so  as being in line with the average over the past 20 years, the benchmark used 
by the FOMC.  In addition , we still judge  the upside and downside  risks around the projection s 
for real GDP growth  and the unemployment rate  over that period  as being balanced.  O n the 
upside, the underlying fundamentals for household  spending  and business investment  remain  
solid —bolstered in part by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017 —with solid  labor market 
conditions and readings on consumer  sentiment  that remain  at a relatively high level .  Also, 
financial conditions might not tighten as much as expected in our baseline.  In these 
circumstances , consumer spending and investment co uld expand  at a pace similar to last year, 
which would be  faster than in  the staff  project ion.  On the downside,  the recent softening in a 
number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deterioration in economic 
activity .  In addition, foreign economic developments and  trade policies  could move in direction s 
that ha ve significant negative effects on U.S econom ic growth.  These overall  assessments are 
consistent with the  four-quarter -ahead  estimates  of forecast risks around  GDP growth and the 
unemployment rate  presented in the exhibit “Time -Varying Macroeconomic Risk .”   
We remain concerned about downside risks to our projection for economic activity 
beyond this year.   In our baseline outlook, the economy  is projected to run close to potential 
output growth over the next two years , maintaining a sizable positive output gap .  If that  forecast  
is correct , then we anticipate that a significant slowing in  the pace of  economic growth  beginning 
in 2021 , along with a gradual increase in the unemployment rate,  will be  necessary  to return the 
economy to a sustainable position in the  longer run.   During the period of slowing  growth , the 
economy will be  more  susceptible to being push ed into a recession  by negative shocks .  
Forecasting the precise timing of when a r ecession could  occur  is always highly uncertain , but 
we judge that  the period of adjustment back to sustainability will be a time of heightened 
downside risk.   
With regard to inflation, the staff  still see s average uncertain ty and balanced risks around 
the projection  over the next year  or so .  To t he downside , longer -run inflation expectations 
relevant for wage and price setting could currently be lower than assumed in the baseline or may 
not edge up in the coming years.   Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more

than expected  and put downward pressure  on inflation.   To the upside, an extended period with 
resource utilization notably above potential could eventually lead to greater upward pressure on 
wages and prices.  In addition , an unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade 
barriers coul d lead to higher inflation.  These assessments are consistent with the statistical 
estimates of the  time-varying risks for the inflation forecast  over the next year .  Of course, if the 
risks to the forecast for economic activity beyond a year or so  are tilted  to the downside , then the 
risks to the inflation  projection  would  also tend to have a downward skew  at that time .   
All of these inflation risks would be of relatively modest size as long as inflation 
expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  T he risks could increase substantially, in either 
direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such movements in 
expectations could induce changes in inflation to build upon themselves and thus lead inflation to 
deviate more, and more persistently, from 2 percent.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario  considers the possibility that the 
momentum  in the economy could weaken more  than in the baseline.  The second scenario  starts 
out with a similar loss of momentum as in the first, but it layers on a significant worsening of 
sentiment and financial conditions resulting in a recession starting in the  middle of this year.  
The third scenario illustrates  a downside risk for inflation in which households and businesses 
have lower longer -run inflation expectations  than in the baseline.  The fourth scenario examines 
the upside risk that the response of wag es and prices to an extended period of tight  labor market 
conditions will prove to be stronger than assumed  in the baseline  and that inflation expectations 
will be more responsive to a rise in actual inflation .  The fifth scenario considers the possibility  
that aggregate supply conditions are stronger than judged in the baseline such that the output gap 
was essentially zero in the middle of last year ; this scenario also assumes that potential GDP 
growth is somewhat faster in the coming years.   In the sixth scenario, we consider the possibility 
of a pronounced slowdown in the foreign economies and a stronger dollar.  The seventh scenario 
assumes that the main risks to the foreign outlook resolve more favorably than assumed in the 
baseline.

We simulate each of  these scenarios using one of three  models maintained by the staff 
that embed different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.1  In all  of the scenarios  except the 
second , the federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the baseline .  (The  second  
scenario, which features a recession, allows for a more aggressive monetary policy response than 
would be prescribed by the inertial baseline policy rule .)  Additionally , the size and composition 
of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the base line paths in all of the scenarios.  
Momentum Weakens Further [FRB/US]  
Increases in c onsumer spending and business investment look to have softened in recent 
months .  The baseline assumes that this deceleration is mostly transitory, but it is possible  that 
the loss of  economic momentum  will be  larger and  more persistent .  In this scenario, we assume 
that the slower pace of growth in consumer and business spending this quarter persists , leading to  
less hiring by firms and contributing to an adverse feedback loop that lowers income, 
consumption, and investment  growth  further.   
Real GDP growth is only about 0.7 percent this year  before picking back  up next year .  
The unemployment rate increases to about  4.3 percent at the end of 2021 , about 0.6 percentage 
point above baseline, while i nflation is only a little  below the baseline , reflecting the relatively 
flat Phillips curve .  The federal funds rate moves  roughly sideways and averages around  
3 percent  over the medium term, substantially below the baseline.  
Recession [FRB/US]  
The recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a more 
substantial deterioration in the outlook than assumed in the previous scenario.  Some statistical 
models indicate that the probability of a recession beginning in the next four quarters  is higher 
than the unconditional probability ; for example, see  the exhibit “Assessment of Key 
Macroeconomic Risks.”2  This scenario  assumes that  adverse  shocks to financial market 
conditions, along with a significant deterioration in  household and business confidence , are 
1 The three models used are the following :  (1) FRB/US, which is a large -scale macroeconometri c model of 
the U.S. economy; (2) an estimated medium -scale New Keynesian DSGE model  of the U.S. economy  based on 
Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2015), “Inflation in the Great Recessio n and New 
Keynesian Models,” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics,  vol. 7 (January), pp. 168 –96; and (3) SIGMA, 
which is a  calibrated  multicountry  DSGE model.  
2 For instance, based on the term spread between the yields on 10 -year Treasury bonds and 3 -month 
Treasury bills, the probability of transitioning into or remaining in a recession over the next 4 quarters  is currently 
estimated to be 5 8 percent.

sufficient to generate a n economic  downturn later this year that is similar in magnitude to the 
typical  recession  over the past 50 year s.  We also assume that monetary policymakers respond to 
sustained increases in the unemployment rate  more aggressively than prescribed by the inertial 
baseline rule, in line with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions .  
In this scenario, r eal GDP starts to declin e by the end of this year and only begins to 
recover at  the start of 2021 .  The unemployment rate peaks around  6.2 percent by the beginning 
of 2021, an increase of about 2 percentage points from the start of the recession.   With a 
subst antially lower level of resource utilization,  inflation runs about 0.2 percentage point below  
the baseline, on average, from the start of the recession through  2021.   The sharp deterioration in 
economic conditions causes the federal funds rate to reach its  effective lower bound from the end 
of 2020 to mid -2021 before increasing  gradually.  
Lower Inflation Expectations [Del Negro, Giannoni, Schorfheide Model]  
Total  and core PCE  price  inflation have run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
for most of the time since the most recent recession .  In addition, the measure of longer -run 
inflation expectations reported in the Michigan survey has been lower in recent years than it had 
been earlier; indeed,  the February reading of this measure was tied for the lowest ever recorded 
in the survey .  In the baseline projection, longer -run inflation expectation s relevant for wage and 
price setting are  assumed to edge up  such that the underlying trend in inflation  gradually rises  to 
2 percent  over the medium term .  However, there is a risk that actual inflation expectations 
remain anchored at a level somewhat  below the Committee’s objective .  In this scenario, we 
assume that the public’s longer -run inflation expect ations are only 1 .7 percent and remain  at that 
level  for an extended period of time.   
Lower inflation expectations lead to  actual inflation run ning below the baseline and 
remaining near 1.6 percent over the projection  period .  Accordingly , the federal fun ds rate 
increases less than in the baseline .  With inflation expectations remaining depressed  (rather than 
rising  as in the baseline), expected real interest rate s are initially higher  than in the baseline  and 
reduce  spending somewhat .  As a result, real GDP growth is a touch lower in 2019 than in the 
baseline, and the unemployment rate runs slightly higher.

Steeper Phillips Curve with More -Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]  
In contrast to the previous scenario , persistent tig htness in resource utilization could 
cause inflation to rise above the baseline .  Some research suggests that the wage Phillips curve 
may be steepe r when the labor market is very tight.3  In the FRB/US  model , faster wage growth 
also implies higher consumer  price inflation .  This scenario captures this  risk by boosting the 
response of wages to tight labor utilization and by  also assuming that longer -run inflation 
expectations become more sensitive to the higher realized price inflation that stems from faster  
wage growth.4  These two assumptions interact to produce a marked increase  in price inflation.  
Inflation reaches 2.8 percent by the end of 202 1, compared with 2 percent in the 
baseline.5  In response to the higher path of inflation, the federal funds rate increases  more  
steeply  and is near 4.8 percent at the end of 202 1.  As a result, real GDP rises a bit more slowly, 
and the unemployment rate is slightly above the baseline.  
Even Stronger  Supply Side [FRB/US]  
Although the unemployment rate is currently about ¾ percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate, wage gains have remained modest in recent years —in our assessment , 
because the Phillips curve is relatively flat and producti vity growth has been slow .  Another way 
of reconciling modest wage growth with a very low unemployment rate is that resource 
utilization may be less tight than assumed in the baseline .  In this scenario, the level of potential 
output  in recent years  is ass umed to have been higher  than judged in the baseline, such that the 
3 For evid ence of a nonlinear relationship between wage growth and slack, see, for example, Peter Hooper, 
Frederic S. Mishkin, and Amir Sufi (2019), “Prospects for Inflation in a High Pressure Economy:  Is the Phillips 
Curve Dead or Is It Just Hibernating?” paper pr esented at the 2019 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the 
Initiative on the Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, held in New York, 
February 22, https://research.chicagobooth.edu/ -/media/research/igm/docs/2019 -

Sylvain Leduc, Chitra Marti, and Daniel Wilson (2019), “Does Ultra -Low Unemployment Spur Rapid Wage 
Growth?” FRBSF Economic Letter 2019 -02 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, January), 
https://www.frbsf.org/economic -research/files/el2019 -02.pdf .  
4 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that  both the slope of the wage Phillips curve  and the 
sensitivity of long -run inflation expectations to realized inflation  are four times larger th an in the current version of 
the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the se increase s reflects a comparison between estimates of the recent past 
and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.  Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the 
coefficie nts used in this scenario are well below those characterizing inflation dynamics in the 1970s.  
5 With a steeper Phillips curve, but no increase in the sensitivity of inflation expectations, inflation would 
average 2 percent in 2021.

output gap was essentially zero in the middle of last year .6  Moreover, this scenario  assume s that 
potential output growth in future years is faster than in the baseline.  Specifically , it is assumed 
that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past several years than in the 
baseline and continues to fall to 4.1 percent at the end of 2019, 0.5 percentage point lower than 
in the baseline.  We also assume that trend labor f orce participation has been decreasing at a 
slower rate than in the baseline for the past several years and continues to do so going forward; 
as a result, the trend participation rate is almost 1 percentage point above the baseline by the end 
of 202 4.  In addition, structural productivity is assumed to grow 0.2 percentage point faster than 
in the baseline in the past severa l years and also going forward.   
Because we assume that households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential 
growth  and its im plications for income and profits , consumer spending and investment are 
stronger .  All told, real GDP growth is, on average, almost 1 percentage point per year above the 
baseline.  The unemployment rate falls 0.6 percentage point below the baseline  by the end of 
2021 .  With a relatively flat Phillips curve in the FRB/US model, inflation is little affected in this 
scenario.  Because policymakers recognize the supply -side conditions  and see the smaller 
positive output gap persisting for several years, they raise the federal funds rate  only to 
3.2 percent in 202 1, almost 1 percentage point less than in the baseline.   After that, the federal 
funds rate rises slowly back to the baseline.  
Foreign Slowdown [SIGMA]  
In our baseline, we view the slowdown in foreign growth that began last summer as a 
temporary soft patch and expect that foreign monetary and fiscal easing will help boost growth 
close to potential by later this year.   However, disappointing foreign data m ay be signaling a 
more persistent loss of momentum than assumed in the baseline.   In this scenario, continued 
tepid growth abroad and ongoing concerns about downside risks cause households and investors 
to progressively lose confidence in the outlook .  As a result, foreign financial conditions 
deteriorate and households expand their precautionary savings, leading to further weakness in the 
global economy.7   
6 In this Tealbook, the  staff have revised potential output growth over history, such that the level of 
potential output at the end of 2014 is 0.2 percent higher than previously assumed.  The upward revisions in this 
scenario are substantially larger, amounting to 1.5 percent by  mid-2018.  
7 While this scenario does not assume that some of the salient risks to the foreign outlook —such as a hard 
Brexit, a financial crisis in the euro area, or a sharp slowdown in China —materialize, the realization of these risks 
could also precipitate a foreign downturn.

Specifically, the scenario envisions that amidst a loss of confidence and general 
deterioration in the macroeconomic environment , corporate borrowing spreads in the foreign 
economies widen 125 basis points and equity prices decline sharply.   The financial turbulence 
abroad and concerns about the foreign outlook trigger a 75 basis point rise in borrowing  spreads 
in the United States.  Foreign GDP growth dips to 0. 8 percent in the second half of 2019, 
1.7 percentage points below the baseline.  Flight -to-safety flows cause the broad real dollar to 
appreciate 8 percent.   
Weaker foreign activity, the stronger dollar, and tighter global financial conditions cause 
U.S. GDP growth to moderate to 1 .1 percent , on average , in the second half of 2019 and 2020, 
almost  1 percentage point below the baseline.  Core PCE inflation runs at only 1. 3 percent in the 
second half of this year and remains below 2 percent until 2023 .  Accordingly, the federal funds 
rate follows a noticeably shallower path than in the baseline.  
Everything Goes Right  Abroad  [SIGMA]  
We see the panoply of downside risks facing foreign economies  as weighing on business 
sentiment and contributing to the weakness of activity abroad.  This scenario assumes that th ese 
risks resolve more favorably than in the baseline —in particular, t he immediate achievement of a 
Brexit deal that minimizes trade and financial disruptions  quickly dispels uncertainties , a new 
Italian government embraces fiscal responsibility , swift  progress in trade negotiations helps 
dissipate fears of a tariff war , and China’s stimulus measures fuel a strong pickup in  economic 
growth.   Against this backdrop, f oreign GDP growth increases to 3.5 percent in the second half 
of 2019, 1 percentage point above the baseline.  Positive business sentiment leads corporate 
borrowing spreads in the foreign economies and in the United States to retr ace to early  2018 
levels.  The broad real dollar depreciates 7 percent, reversing the rise observed over the 
past year.  
Stronger activity abroad, the weaker dollar, and looser financial conditions boost U.S. 
economic activity.  U.S. GDP expands at an annual rate of  around  2.6 percent in the second half 
of this year and in 2020, 0.7 percentage point more, on average, than in the baseline.  Higher 
import prices and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE  price  inflation to reach 
2.4 percent by the end of this year.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the 
baseline.

 Model Forecasts:  FRB/US and EDO  
In addition to the judgmental projection, the staff also maintains model projections 
that provide different perspectives on the economic  outlook.  This discussion  focuses 
on the medium -term forecasts from two models —FRB/US and  EDO —which  are 
shown  in the  exhibit “Alternative Model  Forecast s.”1 
The FRB/US projection .  As shown in figure 1, the FRB/US model projects real GDP 
growth to slow from 3.1 percent i n 2018 to about 1 ¼ percent  per year  over the 2019 –21 
period .2  The projected deceleration in real GDP mainly  reflects  the model’s forecast of  
tighte ning  financial conditions and the projection that  the growth rate of  
consumption falls back from strong readings in recent years to a rate  closer to the 
model’s trend .  In addition,  investment  growth slows  as the level of investment  move s 
back in line with the model’s  trend .  The weak forecast of real GDP growth in 2019 also 
displays a nega tive contribution from inventories.  
In particular, the FRB/US model project s consumption growth to slow from 
2.7 percent last year  to around 1¾ percent per year over  the medium term.  This  rate  is 
a marked stepdown from the pace  of consumption growth in recent years , which  the 
model  could not explain based on fundamentals (wealth and income ) and hence does 
not carry that strength forward in the projection .  In addition, t he model’s assessment 
that  asset price s (equity and property wealth)  are currently above nor mal valuations 
and will fall or decelerate markedly  over the next year contributes to  the weak ening  in 
consumption growth through the wealth channel.   
The model’s forecast of business fixed investment  growth  also slows substantially 
over the projection pe riod.  Th is development reflect s the projected tightening of  
financial conditions (higher interest rates and rising cost s of equity finance ) as well as  
the weak ening in overall business output (which weigh s on capital spending  through 
an accelerator channel ). 
The growth rate of potential GDP  in the model  is 2.0 percent at the beginning of the 
forecast period and slow s to about 1.8 percent by the end of 2021 .  Given the sharp 
deceleration  in real GDP  and the  relatively  stable trajectory for potential output  
growth , the model forecasts the output gap  to fall from 1. 9 percent at the end of 2018  
to zero  at the end of 2021.   As shown in the “Alternative Model  Forecasts ” exhibit, the 
unemployment rate in the FRB/US project ion rises  to 4.5 percent at the end of 2020  
and increases further to the models ’ estimate of the natural rate , 4.8 percent , at the 
end of 2021.  Core inflation  in the model  increases from 1. 9 percent in 2018 to just 
below  2.2 percent in 2019 and then gradually declines to 1.9 at the end of 2021 —
slightly below the underlying inflation rate in FRB/US —as the pressures from resource  
utilization in the FRB/US model are decreasing over the projection period.  
                                                 
1 In FRB/US, t he federal funds rate is governed by the same policy rule as in the staff projection; 
EDO uses its own estimated rule.  
2 Note that the FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projection s for the variables from 
the government sector, foreig n real GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar 
and oil prices.

The EDO model projection .  The EDO model projects that real GDP will grow 
1.5 percent  in 2019 , 1.9 percent in 2020 , and 2.2 percent in 2021, roughly  ¼ percent age 
point  below  potential growth  in each  year .  The output gap, currently estimated  in 
EDO  to be negative 0.2 percent, is projected to reach negative 0.6 percent in the last 
quarter of 2021.  The EDO model’s projection of b elow -potential  real GDP growth is 
driven by the slow fading of favorable risk premium shocks —the main fundamental 
driver of aggregate demand —and the waning effects of the currently accom modative 
stance of monetary policy.  Core i nflation hovers around  2.2 percent  over the 
projection period, slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective .  For a number 
of years, wages have been below the level consistent with the model’s wage Phillips 
curve, holding down marginal cost s and depressing inflation over that period.  The 
model expects these wage shocks to fade  gradually, which offset s the downward 
pressure from decreasing  resource utilization on the trajectory for inflation .3  
Conclusion .  While the EDO projection of GDP growth  is stronger than that of the 
FRB/US model, it is worth noting that both models forecast an economy growing 
below potential , as favorable but transitory conditions quickly fad e and financial 
conditions continue  to tigh ten for most of their projections.  The slowdown in 
economic growth  is more pronounced in the models’ forecasts compared  with  both  
the staff judgmental  projection and outside projections ( for example, the Blue Chip 
survey) , which forecast a more  gradual  slowing  of real GDP growth . 
3 More information about forecast s from the EDO model  is provided in the memo to the 
Committee on March 12, 2019, “System DSGE Project Forecasts. ”

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  Compared with the January  Tealbook, the current 
projection for the output gap is about ½ percentage point narrower in 2019, reflecting 
notably weaker projected GDP growth in the near term and an upward historical revision to the level of potential output.  The i nflation projection is little changed  from the January  
Tealbook.  In response to these revisions, the strategies considered herein prescribe path s 
for the federal funds rate that are, in general,  lower  than in the January  Tealbook.  A 
special exhibit examines policy rule simulations under a baseline projection that is consistent with the median responses to the December 2018 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  Over the next few years, the median SEP policy rate path and associated macroeconomic outcomes are well described either by a Taylor rule that places no weight on the output gap when output is above its potential level or by  a first -
difference rule.  A second  special exhibit  provides updat ed estimates of the equilibrium 
real federal funds rate in the longer run.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the Taylor  (1999) rule  (also known as the 
“balanced approach” rule) , the Taylor (1993 ) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible 
price- level targeting  (FPLT ) rule.1  These near -term prescriptions take as given the 
Tealbook baseline projections for the output gap and core inflation , shown in the middle 
panels .2  The top and middle panel s also  provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal 
funds rate, which is constructed using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.3 
•The prescriptions of the Ta ylor (1999) and Taylor (1993) rules, which do not
feature interest rate smoothing terms, are well above the corresponding policy
1 The appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on the se simple policy rules .  
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook bas eline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection of the output ga p. 
3 Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here 
use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.

    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the December 2018 median SEPresponses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baselineprojections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

 rates in the Tealbook baseline.  The near- term pr escriptions from these rules 
are lower than in  the previous Tealbook, reflecti ng the narrower projected 
output gap. 
•The near -term prescriptions of the first- difference rule, which responds to the
change in the expected output gap,  is little changed from  the January
Tealbook, consistent with a projection for the output gap that, although lower,
continues to be relatively flat in the near  term as well as consistent with  a
similar projection for inflation.
•The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the core PCE
price index of 2.4 percent  since the end of 2011, prescribes setting the federal
funds rate somewhat  below its currrent value .
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimates of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate ( r*) generated under two baselines:  the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the December 2018 SEP.
4  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used to generate an estimate 
of r*.  This concept of r *, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real 
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in the current 
quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or 
avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate.  
•At 2.6 percent , the current value of the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  is
about 45 basis points lower than its estimate based on  the January  Tealbook
projection; the difference reflect s the staff’s narrower  output gap projection.
4 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021 (the 
final year reported in the December 2018 SEP), the  econ omy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 • At almost 1.7 percent, the corresponding SEP -consistent FRB/US r*  based on 
the December SEP is significantly lower than the Tealbook-consistent 
FRB/US r* .  The difference stems from the fact that the SEP -consistent 
projection has output exceeding potential by a smaller amount over the medium term than does the current  Tealbook forecast .  This smaller 
anticipated output gap occurs despite the fact that the median path for the real 
federal funds rate implied by the SEP medians  is below the corresponding 
path in the Tealbook baseline projection . 
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline and results from dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model under the Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) rule, 
the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect the endogenous 
responses of the output gap and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied 
by the policy rules.5  The simulations for each rule are carried out  under the assumptions 
that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and that financial market  
participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate  that monetary policy  will 
follow through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates 
and the economy. 
• Under the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate increases about 1 percent age point this year, ½ percentage point in 2020, and  ¼ percentage 
point in 2021, reaching 4 percent  in 2021.  This trajectory is lower than the 
one presented in the January  Tealbook because of the narrower projected  
output gap. 
• The Taylor  (1999) rule calls for an immediate and substantial increase in the 
federal funds rate, and the prescribed values remain above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline values until 2022.  Nonetheless, this higher path is 
associated with a trajectory for the real 10 -year Treasury yield similar to that 
in the Tealbook baseline because the Taylor  (1999) rule calls for somewhat 
lower values of the federal funds rate for most of the decade and generates 
                                                 
5 Because of  the endogenous responses  of the output gap and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths , the near -term prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ from those shown in 
the top panel of the first exhibit.

 somewhat higher inflation than in the baseline projection.6  The path for the 
unemployment rate is similar to the Tealbook baseline path.  
•T
he Taylor (1993) rule also calls for an immediate increase in the federal
funds rate.  Because the Taylor (1993) rule responds less strongly to the
positive output gaps in coming years, this rule prescribes lower rates than  does
the Taylor  (1999) rule over the period shown.  The prescriptions from the
Taylor (1993) rule are higher than the Tealbook baseline through 2020 butsubsequently fall below the baseline path for a sustained period.  As a result,inflation is higher, and the real 10- year Treasury yield is  lower, than their
corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.  The more accomm odative
monetary conditions also produce a lower  unemployment rate than in the
Tealbook projection.
•The path for the federal funds rate prescribed by the first -difference rule is
similar to  the path in the Tealbook baseline this year and next but then runs
below the baseline path for some years , reflecting the fact that this rule react s
to the expected future change in the output gap rather than its level .  This
lower path for  the federal funds rate creates an expectation of higher inflation
in the future , which , in turn , implies  a lower  path for longer- term real interest
rates  and thus lower unemployment than in the Tealbook baseline.
•The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate,  the shortfall that has
cumulated between  the level of core PCE prices  and a target path for that price
level that grows at an annual rate of 2 percen t from the end of 2011 onward.
Eliminating the current 2.4 percent shortfall of the core PCE price indexrequires inflation to run above 2 percent in coming years.  To a chieve this
outcome, t he FPLT rule calls for keeping the federal funds rate somewhat
below the current target range until 2022 and below the federal funds rate path
6 The result that inflation runs above the baseline projection in this simulation, despite higher 
levels of the federal funds rate in the near term, depends on the assumption  that price and wage setters 
perfectly anticipate the more accommodative path of the federal funds rate beyond the next several years 
and factor these future monetary policy conditions into today’s price and wage setting decisions.  The box 
“Learning and Misperceptions of Policy Strategies” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2018 Tealbook A presented results for a scenario in which price and wage setters lack such a perfect 
understanding.  In that scenario, the switch from an inertial to a non- inertial policy rule led to a significant 
decline in inflation and a rise in the unemployment rate at the start of the simulation in response to an unexpected jump in the federal funds rate.

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

 in the Tealbook baseline until 2027 (not shown).  Because the simulation 
embeds the assumpt ions that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this 
gap over time and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage 
setters correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the real 10- year Treasury  rate immediately  drops and remains 
below the Tealbook baseline for the next six years.  As a result, the unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations shown, dropping to  2.8 percent  in 2021, and inflation run s 
somewhat higher .  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under various assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by three specifications of the loss function.7  
The concept of optimal control employed here assumes policymakers are able to commit future policymakers to their plans; such a commitment may  improve economic 
outcomes.
8 
The first two  of the three optimal control policies prescribe much higher paths for 
the federal fu nds rate than the path in the baseline projection.  B ecause monetary policy 
actions are assumed to be perfectly understood and fully credible, these dramatic changes in the federal funds rate are not disruptive.  In practice, however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as abruptly as in these simulations , wage and price setters 
and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate tighter monetary policy than policymakers envision, leading to les s benign 
macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.
9  By contrast, the third optimal control policy 
allows the unemployment rate to decline to levels not experienced since the 1950s.  Such a development might likewise entail outcomes different from those predicted by the simulations.   
7 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.    
8 Under the optimal control policies, policyma kers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these  promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 • The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s objective  of 2 percent , on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous value.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantly 
higher than the Tealbook base line path .  This strategy is designed to temper 
the projected sizable undershooting, over the next several years,  by the 
unemployment rate of its natural rate that  occurs  in the Tealbook baseline—an 
outcome that policymakers with the equal-weights loss function judge to be 
costly.  The smaller  unemployment gap generates  only moderately lower 
inflation because the response in the FRB/US model of inflation to the current level of resource utilization is very small.  
• The second simulation, “Minimal weight on ra te adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns only a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate 
but that is otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  This simulated policy seeks to return the unemployment rate to its natu ral rate even 
faster than under the equal -weights specification.  The federal funds rate soars  
above 9 percent  in 2019 and then averages around 6 percent  through 2024. 
• The third  simulation, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function that 
assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate 
when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but the loss function is 
otherwise identical to the specification with equal weights  when the 
unemployment rate is above the natural rat e.  Under this strategy, the path for 
the federal funds rate is considerably below the path in the optimal control 
simulation with equal weights , and below the Tealbook baseline path, until the 
end of 2025; beyond the date range that is shown, the federal funds rate exceeds , for a time,  the policy rate paths implied by the other two optimal 
control strategies and the Tealbook baseline.  Policymakers choose this more accommodative path for the policy rate because , with the asymmetric loss 
function, their des ire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent  is not tempered by an 
aversion to the unemployment rate falling below its natural rate .  The tighter 
labor market keeps inflation closer to  2 percent  than in the case of equal 
weights.  Beyond the period shown, the unemployment rate runs a little above

 its natural rate for several years as policymakers act to contain the inflationary 
pressures stemming from the prolonged period of elevated resource utilization.  
CHANGES  IN PRESCRIPTIONS AND OUTCOMES FROM THE  JANUARY  
TEALBOOK  
As noted previously, the staff’s downward revision to the projection for the output 
gap implies sizable downward revisions to the paths for the federal funds rate prescribed 
by the simple policy rules and the optimal control policies shown in the previous two exhibits .  These revisions, along with the associated revisions to the unemployment rate 
and inflation, are shown in the fourth exhibit, “Changes in Prescriptions and Outcomes from the January Tealbook.”   
• Compared with the corresponding results based on  the January Tealbook 
projection, the simple policy rule simulation s prescribe paths for the federal 
funds rate that , at the end of 2021, are lower by about 20 basis points 
(“Flexible price -level targeting rule ”) to 40 basis points  (“Taylor (19 99) 
rule”). 
• Compared with the corresponding results based on the January Tealbook projection, the optimal control simulations prescribe paths for the federal funds rate that, at the end of 2021, are lower by about 30 basis points 
(“Asymmetric weight on ugap” ) to 100 basis points (“Minimal weight on rate 
adjustments”).  
POLICY RULES  USING A PROJECTION CONSISTENT WITH THE SEP 
In the next exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations Using a Projection Consistent with 
the SEP,” we analyze policy rules under a projection that is consistent with the medians 
of the responses in the December 2018 SEP  rather than under the Tealbook baseline.  We 
consider the Taylor (1999) rule, a version of the Taylor (1999) rule that reacts to the 
output gap asymmetric ally in that the coeffi cient on the output gap is zero when output is 
above potential, and the first- difference rule.10  Like optimal control policies under a loss 
                                                 
10 The asymmetric Taylor (1999) rule is specified in the appendix in this Tealbook s ection.  
Consistent with the median responses to the December 2018 SEP, the long -term value of the federal funds 
rate in this section is assumed to be 2.8  percent.

 function with an asymmetric weight on the unemployment rate, the asymmetric Taylor 
(1999) rule does not directly respond to the high levels of resource utilization projected in the coming years .
11  Unlike Taylor-type rules, the first-difference rule does not include a 
long-run intercept term, obviating the need for policymakers to respond to uncertain 
estimate s for the value of the federal funds rate in the longer run. 
•The SEP -consistent policy rate path rises gradually in 2019 and 2020 and then
levels off  at around 3 percent  before declining slowly toward its longer -run
normal level .  As shown in the upper-right pa nel, the projected unemployment
rate gap is negative over the next several  years.12  Projected inflation rises
slightly above 2 percent in 2020 (a s shown in the bottom-right panel).
•With inflation near 2  percent and high levels of resource utilization in the
SEP-consistent projection, the Taylor (1999) rule prescribes an immediate and
lasting increase in the federal funds rate.  The tighter stance of monetarypolicy under the Taylor (1999) rule than under the SEP- consistent baseline
policy rate path leads to  levels of the unemployment rate that are closer to its
natural rate and to a slightly lower path for inflation .
•Under the SEP-consistent projection, the asymmetric Taylor rule (1999)prescribes a policy rate path that is remarkably close to the SEP -consistent
baseline and accordingly produces macroeconomic outcomes that are similar
to those in the SEP-consistent projection (the lines labeled “Taylor (1999)
rule, asymmetric coef. on yga p”).
oThe asymmetric Taylor (1999) rule does not directly respond to theoutput gap for some time because the projected output gap is positive.
oWith inflation somewhat below 2 percent, the asymmetric Taylor (1999)rule prescribes levels for the federal funds rate in the near term that are
somewhat lower than its longer- run average level of 2.8  percent.  As
11 We discussed o ptimal control policies under a projection consistent with the median respon ses 
to the December 2018 SEP in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the January 2019 Tealbook A.   The 
exhibit “Policy Rule Simulations Using a Projection Consistent with the SEP” can be thought of as a 
counterpart to th at discussion that considers  simple policy rules instead of optimal control exercises . 
12 Because of the differences in the estimates of the natural rate of unemployment in the SEP -
consistent baseline and the Tealbook baseline, the unemployment gap in the Tealbook baseline differs from  
the one implicit in the SEP baseline, both going forward and in the recent past.

 inflation gradually moves up and output remains above potential, the 
asymmetric Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a path for the federal funds rate that g radually rises in the near term before leveling off in 2020.   
• The first -difference rule prescribes levels for the federal funds rate that are 
close to the SEP -consistent baseline policy rate path in the near term and 
somewhat below that  path after 2020. 
o The first -difference rule prescribes increases in the federal funds rate in 
2019 as inflation rises toward 2 percent.   In late 2020, inflation levels off 
near 2¼  percent, the unemployment rate is projected to move up toward 
its natural rate, and the output gap is projected to narrow.  As a result, the first -difference rule begins to prescribe declines in the federal funds 
rate, reflecting the fact that this rule reacts to the expected future change in the output gap rather than to its level.   
o The policy rate path being lower under the first -difference rule than in 
the corresponding SEP -consistent baseline produces levels for inflation 
that are above the SEP -consistent projection and  above the outcomes 
under the Taylor- type rules.   Accordingly, levels for the unemployment 
rate under the first- difference rule are below those in the SEP -consistent 
projection and below the outcomes under the Taylor- type rules . 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit, “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run,” updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run, denoted r
LR; this concept is the rate consistent with the economy operating at 
its potential o nce the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated.  This rate, along 
with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer -run level of the nominal 
federal funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and economic models.  
In addition, rLR is also a parameter in many of the simple policy rules, including the 
staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of Tealbook A.

    Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to headline inflation.  This choice
 of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation. Because the most recent SEP was conducted in December 2018, the FRB/US simulations under the SEP−consistent baseline begin in the current quarter. The unemployment rate gap is defined as the difference between the unemployment rate and the natural rate of unemployment.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

and mean of the point estimates are only slightly changed from theirrespective 2018:Q3 values reported in the December Tealbook .  All of the
point estimates used to compute the rang e have declined since the
early  2000s.

•T
ime-series estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as
depicted in the middle panel.  The sources of this uncertainty vary across thestudies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach as wellas uncertainty about the prevailing state of the economy and the parameters ofthe model.
•The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer- term forecasts of the real federal
funds rate from selected sources.  The Tealbook baseline assumption, at½ percent , is below the other measures, which range from 0.75 to
1.13 percent.  That said, the evidence presented in this exhibit, taken as awhole, indicates that the Tealbook baseline assumption is consistent withtime-series and survey estimates, especially in light of the fact that all of these
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty .
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations ” and optimal control 
simulations  shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment.” 
13 See the appendix to this section for sources and methodology.  Although the modeling 
approaches and econometric techniques differ across models, the studies have the common  feature that they 
use time -series methods to infer rLR from the co -movement of either macroeconomic series (like inflation, 
interest rates, and output) or both macroeconomic and financial data (like TIPS yields).  
14 For a discussion of time -series estimate s of rLR over history, see the Monetary Policy Strategies 
section of the October 2017 Tealbook A.  There are differences in the historical paths of rLR across the 
studies.  The top panel reports the range of one -sided estimates, meaning that the estimates for a particular 
date only condition on data up to that date.  Estimates that condition on all available data generally suggest 
a slow decline of rLR, which is consistent with the importance of secular factors such as changes in 
demographics or a productiv ity growth slowdown.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule; the staff uses that inertial version , 
augmented with a small temporary intercept adjustment, in the construction of the Tealbook 
baseline projection .  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy for 
quarter t;  for quarters prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the 
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand- side variables of the first fo ur rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four- quarter core PCE price inflation for the current 
quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap

  (𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, 
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price- level targeting rule , the right -hand- side varia bles 
include an unemployment rate gap and  a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is defined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡∗, 
which currently stands at 4.6 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference 
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 
2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently, 
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2 percent annual rate. 
Simpl
e Rules  
 
The first two rules in the table  were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), whereas the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule and rules that depend on a price  gap like the FPLT  rule ha ve 
been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1  Where applicable, the intercepts of the  
simple  rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent 
longer-run inflation objective and an equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 
0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on the level of the output 
gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see Orphanides  (2003). 
This Tealbook includes analysis of a version of the Taylor (1999) rule that is specified so 
that the coefficient on the output gap is equal to zero when output exceeds its potential level.  The table “Asymmetric Taylor (1999) Rule” gives an expression for this rule.

  NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the  Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r* ” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
2  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations— that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel a re the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r* .  For a give n economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federa l funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered

exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which include s the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discoun t the future using a quarterly discount factor , 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers three  
specifications of the weig hts on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the three  specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in 
the three  specifications.  
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Minimal weight on rate adjustments,” places almost no 
weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
3  The third  specification, “Asymmetric weight on 
ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment ra te 
is above the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate

ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.  Loss Functions

  falling below the natural rate.  The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the 
relative (rather than the absolute) values of the wei ghts.   
For each of these three  specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is 
subject to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.   
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN  THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the exhibit “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of  𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch (2017); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, and 
Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); 
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2017); and Lubik and Matthes (2015).  For comparability, all computa tions use the latest vintage of historical data 
through 2018: Q4.  Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they 
make use of historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical movements can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.  
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each 
model’s point estimate for 2018: Q4.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are 
specific to each study.   
The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝑟
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 values from selected forecasters.  These values were 
obtained as follows:  
• “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run.  
• “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal funds rate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the December 2018 SEP.  
• “Median Survey of Primary Dealers” equals the long -run median dealer forecast for 
the target rate minus the longer -run median dealer forecast of PCE inflation as of the 
January 2019 survey. 
• “Median Blue Chip (6 -to-10-year)” equals the consensus five- year average (2025 –
29) forecast for the three -month Treasury bill  rate minus the consensus f ive-year 
average (2025 –29) forecast for the annual change in the GDP chained price index as 
of the October 2018 Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey.

3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.
4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial
offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
