Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Following a marked deterioration in the economic data leading up to the March 
Tealbook, we have been reassured by the tenor of the data received in recent weeks.  
Retail sales  and payroll employment rebounded from  earlier anemic readings, much as 
we had projected, and the risk that the economy is currently  headed into a period of 
pronounced weakness seems to have diminished.  
More generally, t he incoming data on spending and production for the first 
quarter  have been consistent with our expectation that GDP growth is slowing  this year 
from its strong 3 percent pace in 2018 .  We currently project  GDP to rise  at a 2 percent  
pace in the first half of this year , 0.2 percentage point higher than the March Tealbook  
foreca st.  In contrast , consumer price data have been softer than expected in recent 
months, leaving our near -term forecast of core PCE inflation well below the March 
Tealbook projection.   We estimate that the 12 -month change in core PCE prices was 
1.6 percent i n March , 0.3 percentage point lower than our previous  Tealbook projection , 
and we expect it to move up to only 1.8 percent by the end of the summer . 
We made two important changes in this forecast that have notable effects on our 
medium -term outlook.  First, we adjusted the policy rule that we use to mechanically set  
the path for the federal funds rate  in the Tealbook.  ( See the box “A New Conditional 
Baseline Policy Rule” for details .)  This change yields a much  flatter  projected  path for 
the federal funds rate relative to the March Tealbook, which  in turn  lowers the projected 
paths of longer -term interest rates, boosts equity prices, and reduces the exchange value 
of the dollar.  By themselves , these new financial assumptions  would have raised the 
projected  level of GDP by more than  1 percent at the end of 2021 .  However, some of this 
increase was offset in the projection by the effects of a downward revision to household 
wealth  as published in the Financial Accounts of the U nited States and other modest 
adjustments to the assumptions underlying our forecast.  All told, we project that GDP  
growth will be about ¼ percentage point faster in each year relative to the March 
Tealbook :  2.2 percent this year and next, before stepping down to 1.7 percent in 2021 .  
The output gap ends the medium term a little more than ½ percentage point higher than in 
March , and, accordingly , the unemployment rate forecast is a little lower, bottoming out 
at 3.5  percent starting late next year.

 A New  Conditional Baseline Policy Rule  
The assumed baseline path for the federal funds rate in the Tealbook  has been , for some time, well 
above the median path for the federal funds rate in the Committee’s Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP) —even after adjusting for differences in the economic projections in the Tealbook 
and the SEP —and above the path anticipated by financial market participants .  Although that 
baseline path had the advantage of being a transparent application of an established Taylor rule, it 
became increasingly improbable over the past year.  
To address this tension and provide a federal funds rate path that w e think  will undergird a more 
informative and useful forecast for the FOMC, in this Tealbook we have adjusted the assumed 
policy rule used to mechanically prescribe a path for the federal funds  rate.  More specifically, for 
our baseline rule, we have downweight ed the response of the federal funds rate to the 
unemployment rate, or output, gap.  This downweighting is one way to capture that the Committee appears to be responding only modestly to the low unemployment rate relative to the 
reported  longer- run normal level, perhaps because inflation shows little sign of persistently and 
materially exceeding the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective.  This approach may reflect a number of rationales , including uncertainty about the unemployment rate consistent with 
achieving the Committee’s inflation objective, uncertainty about the current level of inflation 
expectations, or risk -management considerations.  We recognize that Committee participants may 
have different views on how the appropriate path for the federal funds rate should respond to changing economic conditions.  But we think that the simple adjustment to our assumed baseline 
rule described here can encompass a wide variety of i nterpretations of the policy rate paths 
currently in the SEP.  
Two additional points are important:  First, we view this adjustment as specific to the current state 
of the economy, not as a policy rule that we would use in all economic conditions.  Indeed, if 
current and projected  conditions for inflation and economic activity were to change materially , 
then we would change our assumed baseline policy response.
1  Second, the adjustment to our 
baseline rule is not intended as a prescription of optimal monetary policy.  This  conditional baseline 
rule is merely a simple rule that we think roughly captures the recent views of Committee 
participants for appropriate policy.   
The staff has been using an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule in the construction of the 
baseline projection in previous Tealbooks, where the nominal federal funds rate prescribed for 
quarter t is denoted by Rt:  
Rt = 0.85 Rt-1 + 0.15[ rLR + πt + 0.5(πt – πLR) + α×ygap t]. 
The federal funds rate is assumed to be determined by the longer- run equilibrium real interest rate 
(rLR), the trailing four- quarter measure of core PCE price inflation ( πt), policymakers’ longer- run 
                                                 
1 For example, the alternative scenario  that features a recession in the Risks and Uncertainty section of this 
Tealbook assumes a more aggressive monetary policy response than would be prescribed by  either  the current or 
the previous version  of the baseline policy rule , in line with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.

inflation objective ( πLR), and the current -quarter estimate of the output gap ( ygap t).  In this rule, 
policymakers’ longer- run inflation objective is equal to the Committee’s goal of 2  percent, the total 
weight on inflation is 1.5 (the sum of the coefficients on π t in the two places it appears in the rule), 
and the coefficient on the output gap ( α) has previously been assumed to be 1.0.2   
In this Tealbook, we continue to use this basic framework for our baseline policy rule but have 
reduced the assumed value for α , the coefficient on the output gap, from 1.0 to 0.2.3  As shown in 
the figure, this adjustment to our baseline rule—incorporating the median economic projections from the March SEP —yields an implied path for the federal funds rate (the red line) close to the 
median federal funds rate path in the SEP (the hollow dots).   
With this adjustment to our assumed policy rule, the current baseline path for the federal funds rate (the solid blue line)  is much  lower than in the previous forecast  (the dashed blue line), and  it is 
quite close to the SEP path .  The  slight difference  partly  reflects  that  the assumed longer- run 
nominal federal funds rate of 2.5 percent in t he Tealbook baseline (the blue dot) is a bit below  the 
median in the March SEP of 2.8 percent (the hollow dot to the far right).    
2 Alternatively , the output gap can be replaced in the policy rule by the unemployment gap  (ugap t), which is 
defined here as the difference between  an estimate of the natural rate  of unemployment  (u*t) and the 
unemployment rate  (ut):  
Rt = 0.85 Rt-1 + 0.15[ rLR + πt + 0.5(πt – πLR) + α×ugap t]. 
In this case, the coefficient  α on the ugap t would be 2.0 —using a typical Okun’s law relationship —rather than 
1.0 when the rule is described in terms of the ygap t. 
3 With this change , if the rule was described in terms of the u gap t, then the corresponding coefficient α would 
be 0.4.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for GDP growth is close to the projections from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus in 2019, but it is 
½ percentage point higher than the Blue Chip in 2020.  Correspondingly, the staff’s 
unem ployment rate forecast is similar to the SPF and Blue Chip in 2019 but is 
0.3 percentage point below the Blue Chip in 2020.   
With regard to inflation, the staff’s  forecast of  CPI inflation in 2019 is a bit higher 
than outside forecasters .  The staff and B lue Chip bo th project CPI inflation of 
2.1 percent  in 2020 ; the projection from the SPF is a touch higher.   The staff’s 
projections of both total and core PCE inflation are 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point lower 
than the SPF in both years.  
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes in put 
from  about 50  panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both 
surveys.

  Second, we have reassessed our assumpti on about the path for underlying 
inflation —the rate to which inflation eventually return s in the absence of slack or supply 
shocks.  W e now assume that underlying inflation will remain at 1.8  percent through 
2021 , which contrasts with  our previous Tealbook  assumption that it would inch higher 
over each of the next three years.  Reflecting this  change, core PCE price inflation edges 
up from 1.8 percent this year to  only 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, compared with 
2 percent each year in the March Tealbook.  W hile the tighter resource utilization in this 
projection provides a small boost to inflation, this impetus is more than offset by our 
reassessm ent of underlying inflation .  We expect total PCE price inflation to run slightly 
below core  inflation over  the n ext few years , as oil prices are forecast  to decline over the 
medium term .  
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Since the March Tealbook , 10-year Treasury yields , mortgage rates , and triple -B 
corporate bond yields  declined slightly , and equity prices increased a touch.   More  
important , the new baseline policy rule implemented in this  Tealbook  calls for a much 
lower projected path for  the federal funds rate.  As a result, financial conditions are 
significantly more supportive of economic activity throughout the projectio n.   
Monetary Policy  
• The new  baseline policy  rule calls for only a 25 basis point increase in the 
federal funds rate by the end of 2021 , leaving the federal funds rate at the end 
of the medium term 14 0 basis points lower than in the March Tealbook.   
• We assume that the size of the SOMA portfolio continues a gradual and predictable decline until the end of the third quarter of this year, at which 
point reserve balances are about $1.3 trillion.  Thereafter, reserve balances 
decline for some time to offset pe rsistent gradual increases in nonreserve 
liabilities , and the size of the SOMA portfolio remains roughly constant.  
After reserve balances have declined to $1 trillion, which we expect  will occur 
during the second half of 2021, the SOMA portfolio begins to grow  again, 
roughly in line with nominal GDP.  These projections continue to be consistent with the SOMA portfolio exerting less downward pressure over time on the term premium.

 Other Interest Rates 
•The 10 -year Treasury yield is projected to ri se modest ly from an average of
2.6 percent this quarter to 3.2 percent by the end of 2021.  Most of th e
projected increase reflects  our assumption that  the term premium will rise
over the forecast horizon .  The path for the 10- year Treasury yield is , on
average, 50 basis points  lower relative to the March Tealbook , mainly because
of the lower path of  expected future short -term interest rates implied by the
new policy rule.
oIn contrast to previous projections, the federal funds rate remains
below the 10- year Treasury  yield through out the medium term.
•The projected triple -B corporate bond yield is revised down a bit more than
the 10 -year Treasury yield over the next two quarters, as corporate bond
spreads have narrowed since the March Tealbook.  Thereafter, the revis ion to
the triple -B bond yield is in line with the revision to the Treasury yield.
•The 30 -year fixed mortgage rate is revised down in line with the revision to
the 10 -year Treasury yield throughout the projection.
Equity Prices and Home  Prices  
•We project stock prices to be 3.7 percent higher by the end of 2021 than in the
March Tealbook, primarily reflecting the lower projected path for the 10- year
Treasury yield.  Overall, stock prices are projected to increase 1¼ percent per
year after the current quarter, compared with 1 percent per year in the March
Tealbook.
oIn this projection, we expect the equity risk premium to hold steadyover the medium term at its current level, rather than to decline further
(as we had expected in March ).  Th is revision reduc es the significant
equity valuation pressures implied by our previous projections.  If wehad maintained the March contour  of the equity premium, the equity
price path and the overall economic projection  would have been
revised somewhat higher than the  current projection .
•House prices are expected to increase about 3 percent per year over the next
three years, a bit slower than last year’s pace of 4¼ percent.  This projection is

 stronger  than in the March Tealbook, largely reflecting the effects of lower 
projected mortgage rates.  
Fiscal Policy  
•We assume that the expansionary  fiscal policies enacted in 2017 and 2018  will
continue through the medium term.  I n particular, we assume that the current
level of discretionary federal spending will be maintained i n real terms in
fiscal years 2020 and 2021.  R ealization of this  assumption will require fiscal
policymakers  to lift the discretionary spending caps for those years, consistent
with their  actions in recent years.1
•U
nder these policy assumptions, the direct  fiscal impetus from all levels of
government contributes 0.6 percentage point to the growth rate in aggregate
demand this year  before tapering to 0.5 percentage point in 2020 and
0.2 percentage point in 2021.
•We expect the federal budget deficit, which was 4 percent of GDP in fiscal
2018, to widen to 4 ¼ percent this fiscal year.  Reflecting  the downward
revision to  projected  interest rates, which lowers federal  debt service costs, the
budget deficit is expected to remain flat at 4¼ percent through the medi um
term, as opposed to rising to 4¾ percent in fiscal 2021 as in our previous
forecast.
Trade Policy  
•Although  trade talks between the United States and China have reportedly
been productive , we continue to assume tariff rates on Chinese imports will
remain at current levels through the medium term.  G iven the substantial
issues that remain unresolved in the U.S. –China negotiations, the uncertainty
related to possible auto tariffs , and the still uncertain prospects for
congressional ratification of the US MCA trade pact , trade policy
1 The federal government enter ed a debt issuance suspension period on March 4, during which the 
government wi ll use extraordinary measures to issue additional debt to the public .  The anticipated breach 
date, when the federal government will no longer be able to meet its financial obligations, is expected to 
occur between late August and the end of November .  We anticipate that policymakers will raise  the 
statutory federal debt limit before this breach date.

  developments will likely remain a focus of market attention and continue to 
pose a risk to the economic outlook.   
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
• Foreign economic growth  is projected to be  2.2 percent in the first half  of 
2019, below our estimate of foreign potential growth .  Because i ncoming data 
have  been somewhat stro nger than expected,  on net, we have revised up 
growth by 0. 2 percentage point in the first half of 2019.  Supported by 
accommodative monetary policies, economic growth abroad is expected to 
step up in the second half of 2019 and settle at a near -potential pace of 
2.5 percent by early next year .  
• Since the March  Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has changed little .  In 
response to the revised staff outlook for the federal funds rate, the broad real dollar  appreciates  only 0.6 percent  per year , on average, over the medium 
term, compared with 1. 7 percent in the previous forecast.  I t ends the forecast 
horizon 3 .6 percent lower  than in the March Tealbook .   
Oil Prices  
• The spot price of Brent crude oil is up about $ 6 per barrel from the March 
Tealbook, at $72 per barrel.  Farther -dated futures prices are also up, but by 
less than spot prices, resulting in a  downward -sloping futures curve .  Prices 
have been boos ted by OPEC production cuts by Saudi Arabia and others, 
along with concerns about potential sup ply disruptions in Libya. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP  
Although fourth- quarter GDP growth was revised down nearly ½ percentage 
point  at an annual rate, w e think  that GDP growth in the first half of this year  will be 
somewhat stronger than we had  expected , leaving the level of GDP in the second quarter 
similar to its level from our March projection .  Our for ecast for first -quarter GDP growth , 
2.1 percent,  is about 1  percentage point higher  than the March Tealbook  projection , 
reflecting  better -than-expected data on  net exports , housing, and state and local 
construction .  However,  we anticipate  that some of these positive surprises will be 
transitory, which led us to mark  down our forecast  for second -quarter GDP growth  to

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

 2 percent .2  Turning to the  second half of the year , we project that GDP will rise at an 
annual rate of 2.3 percent , 0.4 percentage point faster than the March Tealbook  
projection , reflecting  the effects of the lower assumed interest rate  path .  In all, we expect 
GDP growth to slow from 3  percent last year to 2 .2 percent  this year.    
•We estimate PCE rose just 1. 1 percent  in the first quarter.  However, given the
strong readings for retail sales and motor v ehicle purchases in  March  and our
expectations for  continued solid gains in employment and income , we think
that PCE growth will bounce back this quarter and continue at about a
2.7 percent pace through the end of the year .
•Business fixed investment is for ecast to slow from its elevated pace of about
7 percent last year to an annual rate of 1½  percent  in the first half of this year .
Recent readings on capital  goods orders and shipments have been weak , and
the suspension of deliveries of the Boeing 737 MAX will weigh on aircraft
purchases this quarter .3  Meanwhile, s urveys of business are positive,
although softer than last year.  As for structures, w e expect weakness in
drilling and mining investment to weigh on spending this year.
•We project that r esiden tial investment will decrease modestly  in the first half
of 2019.  T he levels of housing starts and existing home sales spiked higher  in
recent months , leading us to mark up our assessment of residential investment
in the first quarter  from a sharp decline  to about flat .  However , single -family
permits and pending home sales have remained roughly  unchanged,
suggesting these upticks will be temporary.  In  contrast, we believe that
mortgage rates , which  are about 80 basis points below their recent peak in
October 2018 and are expected  to remain low , will support a pickup i n
residential investment in the second half of the year.
2 We estimate that the partial government shutdown lowered GDP growth 0.3 percentage point in 
the first quarter of this year.  A return of federal government purchases  to baseline boosts  growth an 
estimated 0.4  percentage point this quarter . 
3 Specifically, w e assume that deliveries of the 737 MAX will be suspended from April through 
July before  resuming in August  at an accelerated pace so as to deliver the sto ckpiled planes by the end of 
December .  Boeing also announced it will temporarily reduce the production rate for 737 models from 
53 aircraft per month to 42.  This reduction in production will show through to GDP after accounting for 
offsetting revisions t o E&I spending, net exports, and inventory investment.  Limited space to park 
accumulating inventories of finished aircraft represents a downside risk to the company’s stated production 
plans.

 •The contribution of net exports to GDP growth has been revised up
considerably in the first quarter, reflecting weak incoming data on  imports.
We think the suspension of exports of Boeing 737 MAX airliners will leave a
notable imprint on the trade data  in the second quarter , although we expect
these exports to be made up later in the year.  In total, net exports are roughlyneutral for  GDP growth in the projection for t he first half of this year.
•After increasing at a solid pace in the second half of last year, m anufacturing
production fell at an annual rate of 1.1  percent in the first quarter , owing in
part to  a decline in motor vehic le production.  In the second quarter, factory
output will be held down by the  lower production at Boeing .  More broadly,
new orders diffusion indexes in the national and regional surveys of
manufacturers have come down from late last year and point to mod est
increases in manufacturing output in coming months .
We expect GDP growth  to slow over the medium term, reflecting the lagged 
effects of past removal of monetary accommodation and the waning fiscal stimulus further out .  After rising 3  percent last year, GDP is projected to expand 2 .2 percent in 
2019 and 2020 before stepping down to  a 1.7 percent  pace in 2021 . 
•By themselves, the more favorable projected paths of interest rates, equityprices, and the dollar associated with the new monetary policy rule would
have increased the level of GDP by more than 1 percent at the end of 2021 .
However, the effects of the downward revision to measured household wealth,
as well as a modest rethink of certain aspects of our forecast, especially theevolution of the equ ity premium, offset  some of that boost.
4  All told, GDP
growth has been marked up by about ¼ percentage point per year on average.
•GDP growth  is a little above that of potential  in 2019 and 2020 , and the output
gap widens further.  A t the end of 20 20, the output gap peaks at 2.6 percent
before narrowing somewhat in 2021 .  The outp ut gap in this projection is a
4 The level of household wealth reported in the 2018:Q4 relea se of the Financial Accounts of the 
United States was $1.5 trillion lower in the fourth quarter of last year than had been projected in the March 
Tealbook.  This downward revision was due to two factors:  (1) a change in methodology used in the 
Financial A ccounts to value debt securities held by households and (2) weaker -than-expected household 
wealth data that were mostly driven by a downwardly revised commercial real estate price index in 2018.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The labor market continued to improve in the first quarter, though less rapidly 
than in 2018.     
•After nearly stalling in February, t otal payrolls rose by 196,000 in March.  F or
the first quarter as a whole, total payrolls expanded  by 180,000 per month, and
we anticipate gains of a similar magnitude in the second quarter .  While this
pace of job gains is  below the average monthly increase of 223,000 in 2018, it
is well above the 90,000–120 ,000 monthly pace that we judge to be consistent
with no change in labor  utilizati on.
oThe measure of private- sector employment gains we construct f rom
data provided by the payroll -processing firm ADP suggests
employment gains in March similar to those reported by the BLS.
•After moving a bit lower last year, the unemployment rate has h eld fairly
steady so far this year  and stood at 3.8 percent in March.  W e expect the
unemployment rate will edge down to 3.7 percent in the second quarter.
•The LFPR ticked down to 63.0 percent in March, still a little above the level
of about 62.8 percent that had prevailed for several years despite thedownward pull from an aging population.   We expect the participation rate to
remain flat for the remainder of the year.

 Tealbook  Forecast  Errors:  An Update through 2018 
Real activity in 2018 was  somewhat  stronger  than anticipated  by Tealbook  forecasts, 
although  these forecast  errors were  generally  on the same order of magnitude as  in 
previous years.1  
The figure on the next page reports forecast errors over the  past four years of 
Tealbook  forecasts  for real GDP growth, the unemployment  rate, and total and core 
PCE price inflation.   The gray bars show the currently  published  Q4/Q4 percent 
changes of each economic  variable from 2015 to 2018 (or  the Q4 level, in the case of 
the unemployment  rate), 
the green triangles  show the forecast from the April 
Tealbook  in the contemporaneous  year, and the blue squares indicate the staff 
forecasts  made in the April Tealbook  one year before.   The whisker bands  demarcate  
70 percent forecast error bands, so  that unusually  large forecast erro rs  are 
represented  by cases where the top edge of a gray bar falls outside of  the whisker 
bands.  The  red dots show the BEA and BLS estimates  of the four economic  variables  
from mid‐ April of the subsequent  year,  along with 70 percent bands computed  from 
past revisions  of those estimates.2 
Real GDP growth in 2018 is currently  estimated  to be 3.0 percent,  higher than the April 
2017 and April 2018 Tealbook  forecasts  of 2.2 percent and  2.6 percent,  respectively.  
These forecast errors, however,  are well within the  70 percent whisker bands.  The  
too‐low forecast in the April 2018 Tealbook  was largely the  result of taking too much 
signal from weak PCE data early in the year that  turned out to be more transitory  than 
anticipated.   The forecast  error from  the April 2017  Tealbook  was spread across 
inventory  investment,  net exports, and  government  purchases;  the miss in the 
government  sector reflects the unanticipated  boost  from the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 
2018.  In contrast,  our forecast of private domestic final  purchases  was accurate.  
Despite the unexpected  strength  of real GDP growth last year, the  unemployment  
rate ended  the year at a higher  level than  the staff had forecast last April, as shown  in 
the top‐right  panel.  However, the  labor force participation  rate also  ended 
the year 
higher than expected  last April, leaving  the employment ‐to‐population  ratio about  in 
line with expectations  (not shown).  Although  real GDP  growth in 2018 was  higher 
than expected,  we now think that the economy  was less tight at the  end of 2018 than  
we projected  a year ago, as we raised our estimate of  potential  outp
ut. 
As for inflation,  shown in  the bottom‐right panel,  the Q4/Q4 percent change  in core 
PCE prices in 2018 was  in line with the  staff’s expectations  in April 2017  and April 2018.  
The small contemporaneous ‐year error
 in forecasting  total PCE price inflation (the 
green triangle in  the lower‐left panel) is  entirely explained  by lower‐ than‐expected  
PCE energy prices.

models.

 How Have Lower-Educated  Workers  Fared in the Current Expansion ? 
Labor market outcomes in the current economic expansion  have been quite different for lower - 
and higher -educat ed individuals .  The employment -to-population ratio (EPOP) for  higher -
educated workers —namely , college graduates , aged 25 through 54 (prime  age) —declined 
about 2.5 percentage points during the recession but began a steady and sustained recovery in 
2010 and wa s nearly at its pre -recession level by 2018 (see  panel A of figure 1).  In contrast, t he 
EPOP for  lower -educated  prime -age individuals —namely , those  with a high school degree or 
less—fell much more sharply  during the recession and lingered near its trough  for several years  
before beginning to recover in  earnest in  2014.  As of  2018, the EPOP of low er-educated 
workers remain ed well below its pre -recession level .   
At the same time, real hourly wages for lower -educated workers  fell more  over the  
2007 –13 per iod than real wages for college graduates (see panel B of figure 1).  Real wage s 
subsequently  picked up for both groups , and wages  are now above their pre -recession levels  
for both groups.   However, cumulative real wage gains for lower -educated workers  have only 
recently  caught up , in percentage terms , to those with college degrees.  
The relative underperformance of employment  and wages  for low er-educated workers  has 
been  a characteristic of all business cycles at least since 1978 .  However, t his pattern is likely  
due, at least  in part , to a long -term downward trend in the demand for low er-educated workers  
that is unrelated to the business cycle  and caused , perhaps , by changes in technology and 
globalization .  To isolate the effects of the business cycle and control for  changes in the relative 
demand of low er-educated workers and other long -term trends , we take advantage of the 
variation from state -level business cycles since 1978  and estimate the “typical” cyclical decline 
and recovery of employment across ed ucation groups.  Examining state -level recessions allows 
us to control for national - and state -level  trends  and leverage s the different severities of 
business cycles across states to identify the typical patterns of labor market behavior  across  
educational  groups.

We find  a starkly different evolution of employment over the business cycle for lower -educated 
workers  compared to those with college degrees  even after controlling for national and state 
trends .  In response to a one-time, temporary 1 percent decline in state output  growth that 
returns to normal in the next year , the EPOP declines immediately for both groups.1  However, 
that decline is considerably steeper and longer lasting for those with high school degrees or 
less (see figure 2).  Part of th is difference is due to the deeper initial decline in lower -educated 
employment, but part is also due to a delayed start to the recovery for the lower -educated 
group.   Once that  group’s EPOP begins a sustained recovery, though, it increases at a more 
rapid  pace than the EPOP for those with a college degree.  If we extrapolate those estimates to 
an 8.5 percent output shock, roughly equal to the change in the output gap from peak to 
trough in the previous  recession, the predicted decline  and recovery  in EPOP would be similar 
to what was  actually observed over the 2007 –18 period , suggesting  that the recent behavior of 
EPOPs by educational attainment has been  similar to the typical business cycle after controlling 
for the size of the recessionary shock.  
The difference in the magnitude of employment declines  and timing of recovery across 
education groups may be due to employers changing their hiring standards  over the business 
cycle.   Evidence from research by Hershbein and Kahn  (201 8) and Modestino, Shoag , and 
Ballance (2016) shows that employers raise skill requirements for new hires when a n adverse  
shock hits a local labor market and slowly lower skill requirements as the local labor market 
recovers.2  Barnichon and Zylberberg (2019) show that, during re cessions, increased 
competition for high -skilled jobs causes higher -skilled workers to take jobs that require fewer 
skills, making work more difficult to find for the less skilled.3  This pattern could explain the 
differences in labor market outcomes for l ower - and higher -educated workers since the 
previous recession . 
1 We also estimate cumulative wage growth for low er-educated workers to be lower than for high er-
educated workers following an adverse shock to output, but these estimates are quite imprecise, and the 
difference is not statistically significant.

  Labor market conditions are expected to tighten further in 2019 and 2020, i n line 
with our forecast of above -trend GDP growth in those years .   
• We continue  to as sume that, in an extremely tight labor market, a larger -than-
usual amount of the further tightening in labor utilization will be manifested 
as upward pressure on participation relative to its trend (as more workers are  
pulled into or remain in  the labor force) rather than as a decline in the 
unemployment rate.   
o Consistent with this view,  the stronger GDP projection in this 
Tealbook leads to only a small downward revision to the unemployment rate, which now reaches  3.5 percent the end of 2020—
about 1 percent age point below our estimate of its natural rate—and 
then moves sideways.  The participation rate  is expected to remain 
near its current level of 63.0  percent through the end of 2020 before 
edging dow n in 2021 , at which point w e project that t he participat ion 
rate will stand  ½ percentage point above our estimate of its declining 
trend . 
• Average monthly total payroll gains slow over the projection, from 173,000 per month this year to about 150,000 in 2020 and 100 ,000 in 2021.
5   
• We expect productivity growth to average a little more than  1 percent per year 
over the medium term, close to its average so far this expansion  and a bit 
below our estimate of its structural trend . 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Recent readings o n price inflation have been noticeably lower  than we had 
expected .  With the March CPI and PPI in hand, we estimate that the 12 -month change in 
core PCE prices was  1.6 percent last month, 0.3 percentage point lower than we projected 
in the March Tealbook and a notable slowdown from the 12 -month change  of 2 percent  
in December 2018 .  For 2019 as a whole, we now project core PCE prices to rise just 
1.8 percent, down from 2 percent in our previous projection.  
                                                 
5 The payroll forecast is boosted in the first part of 2020 by the government’s hiring of temporary 
census workers.

 •Core PCE prices in January , as well as  both the February and March CPI
readings , came in weaker  than we had anticipated .  Although inflation in a
number of categories was a little softer than what we had been expecting, we
can point to a few specific categories with unusual and notable declines in
some months.6  We have penciled in a bounceback  in some of these
categories , but the 12 -month change in core PCE prices is expected to stay
around 1.6 percent before moving up to 1.8 percent by the end of the summer .
•Import price inflation also appears to have soften ed early this year .  We
estimate that eff ective import prices —import prices inclusive of  tariffs —rose
2.4 percent in 2018, but we expect them to rise only 0.9 percent  this year , with
no further boost from tariffs.
•We estimate that  the 12 -month change in total PCE prices  was 1.5 percent  in
March, and we expect this measure will edge up to 1.7 percent by September .
Earlier consumer energy price declines are restraining  the 12 -month change in
total PCE inflation  relative to core, though this restraint is offset a bit by
moderately elevated food price increases .
•Measures of l onger -term inflation expectations are little  changed, on balance,
since the March Tealbook .
oThe median of l ong-term inflation expectations from the University of
Michigan Survey s of C onsumers  moved back down to 2.3 percent in
the preliminary reading for April ( matching its historical low), while
the median inflation expectation over the next 3 years from the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer  Expectations  ticked
higher in March .  The median expectation for PCE i nflation over the
next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters remained at2 percent.
6 For example, the downward surprise to core PCE prices in January largely reflected the 
nonmarket component of prices, especially the imputed prices of financial services.  These prices appear to 
be partly related to changes in equity prices, the recent movements of which have led us to pencil in a 
rebound to nonmarket prices in February and March.  Likewise, the downward surprise to the CPI in March 
was concentrated in apparel.  This series is qui te volatile, and a new BLS methodology may have led to 
difficulty with its seasonal adjustment.

  o TIPS -based measures of longer -term inflation compensation are about 
unchanged since the March Tealbook.   
Beyond this year, we expect core PCE inflation to  edge up to 1. 9 percent in 2020 
and 2021 , as this year ’s unusually low inflation readings are not repeated.  We project  
that total PCE inflation will run a bit below core over the next few years , reflecting our 
forecast of declining consumer energy prices.  
• Our projection of core PCE inflation in 2020 and 2021 is 0.1 percentage point 
lower relative to the March Tealbook, as tighter resource utilization and a 
weaker dollar path did not provide enough of a boost to offset our lower estimate of underlying inflation .   
o Previous Tealbook forecasts assumed that underlying inflation was 1.8 percent but would start rising this year, reaching nearly 2 percent at 
the end of 2021.  However, neither market - nor survey -based inflation 
expectations seem to be moving up, and none of the models we use to inform our judgment about underlying inflation suggest any upward movement over the past year.  Given that we appear to have been in a low and stable inflation environment for quite a while , we think  that 
the public will need  to see sustained above -trend inflation rates in 
order for expectations  and wage - and price -setting  behavior to change 
in a way that moves underlying inflation higher.  As a result , we now 
assume underlying inflation does not drift up in the medium term, but instead remains at 1.8 percent through 2021.  
• We continue to expect that import prices will be a slight drag on core PCE inflation.  We anticipate that published  core  import prices will increase at a 
modest 1 percent pace over the medium term, consistent with moderate foreign inflation and a gradually appreciating dollar.   Since the March 
Tealbook, import price inflation is revised higher by roughly 0.2 percentage 
point per year, reflecting our downward revision to the projected pace of dollar appreciati on, slightly reducing  the drag on core PCE inflation.

  We have received little new information on  hourly labor compensation since the 
March Tealbook . 
• Average hourly earnings of employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose 
3.2 percent over the 12 months ending  in March , a touch lower than we had 
expected but  up from 2. 8 percent a year earlier.  
• The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Tracker  was 3. 5 percent 
in March , a step -down from its readings at the turn of the year but modestly 
higher than its pa ce a year ago . 
• Looking ahead, we project g rowth in compensation per hour (CPH)  to step up 
from a pace of 2.9 percent in 2018 to 3. 7 percent at the end of the medium 
term, a pace we think is more in line with our projections of tight labor market 
conditions , trend price inflation, and trend productivity growth .  Growth in the 
employment c ost index  is about flat over the projection  at 2¾  percent .  
(Increases in the ECI tend to run a little lower than those in CPH .)  Both 
projections are little changed when co mpared with the March Tealbook, as 
upward wage pressure from tighter resource use is roughly offset by our lower 
assumed underlying inflation  rate.  
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
• We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment will remain at  
4.6 percen t.  W e also continue to assume that potential output growth slows 
after 2021, as the boost to the growth of potential from the 2017 tax  policy  
changes  wanes, moving down  to 1.7 percent per year in the longer run.  
• We have maintained our assumption that the  nominal equilibrium federal 
funds rate in the longer run will be 2.5 percent.  T he nominal yield on 10- year 
Treasury securities is 3.4 percent in the longer run.  
o We assume that, in the longer run, fiscal policymakers will eventually start to  gradually reduce primary deficits by an amount sufficient to 
stabilize the debt -to-GDP ratio , although our assumption about when 
that adjustment  will start has been pushed out a couple of years , 
reflecting the lower path of interest rates in this projection .  We 
conti nue to  expect this ratio to level off at around 105 percent,

 20 percentage points higher than would have occurred in the absence 
of the 2017–18 federal tax and discretionary spending changes  
(including our assumption about the extension of that spending af ter 
the budget legislation expires  this year ).  We assume  that the 
20 percentage point increment to the debt -to-GDP ratio will push up 
the term premium on 10- year Treasury yields 50 basis points in the 
long run. 
•As discussed earlier, we have held the under lying trend in inflation at
1.8 percent through 2021 , and  we now assume that the underlying trend in
inflation  in the longer run responds more slowly to actual inflation than
previous ly judged .  Consequently, u nderlying inflation edges up only very
slowly , from 1.8 percent at the end of the medium term to its long -run value
of 2 percent .
•GDP growth slows from  1.5 percent  in 2022 to 1.3 percent in 2024, as long-
term interest rates rise a little further  and the contribution to growth from
fiscal stimulus  fade s.
•With the incorporation of the new baseline policy  rule, the labor market  is
tighter  by the end of 2024 than in the previous projection.  The  unemployment
rate is 4 percent, roughly ½  percentage point below its natural rate.  As a
result , core PCE price inflation moves up from 1.9 percent in 2021  to
2.0 percent at the end of 2024 despite the downward pressures stemming from
lower assumed  underlying inflation.
•Given this outlook for inflation and resource utilization , the nominal federal
funds rate remai ns close to 2. 8 percent from the end of the medium term to the
end of 2024, and it returns slowly to its long -run value of 2.5 percent
thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The latest data from the foreign economies  have been moderately positive , on net, 
and we have revised up our estimate of growth abroad in the first quarter by ¼ percentage 
point to 2 percent at an annual rate from a tepid 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter.  The 
upward revision applied to  a number of advanced and emerging economies, including the 
euro area, Ca nada, Mexico , and China.   This was the first upward revision since the 
beginning of last year , although the outlook certainly remains weaker than it was 
projected back then.  
We expect foreign growth to improve further, reaching 2.4 percent in the current 
quarter , close to its potential , and then staying near this pace for the remainder of the 
forecast period .  The pickup this year  is largely concentrated in emerging market 
economies ( EMEs ).  Stimulus in China , along with an apparent bottoming out of the 
high-tech cycle , should support reasonably solid growth  in emerging Asia and o ther 
EMEs .  We also expect some improvement in Mexico ’s and Brazil ’s recent moribund 
performance.  Conversely, growth in most of the advanced foreign economies ( AFEs ) 
will likely  continue to languish  through the rest of the year .  In the euro area , PMIs 
continue to point to pronounced weakness in manufacturing despite better numbers for 
services and solid employment and wage growth .  And in the United Kingdom, while the 
extension granted by the European Union has warded off the specter of an imminent “no  
deal” Brexit, the prolongation of Brexit uncertainty will weigh on investment and 
spending .   
With the step-up in growth appearing quite fragile, we remain attentive to the risk 
of a further  loss of momentum in the foreign economies , especially in Europe .  Our 
recession probability model continues to point to a high chance of a downturn  in that 
economy, largely reflecting the continued weakness of manufacturing indicators , and the 
policy and political situation  in the region  remains  deeply unsettled .  We explore the 
effects on the United States of a  “European Recession” scenario in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section.

  Not all risks are to the downside.  Progress toward a  U.S.–China trade agreement, 
for example, provides potential for some upside risk.  In our baseline, we have built in 
only a small drag on growth coming from trade tensions , and we would consequently 
expect only a small boost  were there to be a substantial easing of these tensions .  
However , it is possible that if a successful resolution of  the U.S.–China talks  took place , 
coupled with progress toward resolving trade issues in other areas,  such a development  
could alleviate  uncertainty about future trade policy and catalyze a rise in  confidence 
worldwide , and thus lead to higher global growth .  We discuss this possibility in the 
“Easing of Trade Tensions” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
Foreign inf lation is estimated to have weaken ed further, to only 0.7 percent  at an 
annual rate , in the first quarter, held down by the pass -through of earlier declines in 
energy prices and, in the EMEs, by drops in food prices .  We expect headline foreign 
inflation t o pick up to 2.5 percent this quarter as the temporary factors abate.  That said, 
core inflation in the euro are a and Japan remains depressed  at only around 1 percent .  As 
such, we expect monetary policies in these countries to remain highly accommodative .  
We continue to expect that the European Central Bank (ECB) will not start raising rates 
until the third quarter of 2020.  Given a weaker U.K. outlook , we postponed the next 
policy rate hike for the Bank of England to the second quarter of 2020, two quarters later 
than assum ed in the March Tealbo ok.   
Our lower assumed path for the federal f unds rate  implies less downward pressure 
on foreign currencies than previously assumed .  As such,  we lowered our projections for 
the policy rate paths of the Bank of Canada (BOC) and of several EME central banks .  
The Reserve Bank of India cut its policy rate by 25 basis p oints in April  following an 
earlier cut in Febr uary, reflecting persistently low inflation  and growth concerns . 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro Ar ea.  Hard indicators through February, such as retail sales and 
industrial production,  point to  a modest rebound in economi c activity during 
the first quarter.   These readings are consistent with the unwinding of some 
temporary headwinds, including  social unrest in France and disruptions in car 
production in Germany.  Accordingly, w e revised u p our forecast for the first

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

 quarter to 1 .4 percent.   Further out , soft indicators through April , such as 
PMIs, continue to indicate  lackluster underlying grow th momentum , 
particularly in the manufacturing sector .  Accordingly , we expect GDP growth 
to move back down to  around 1 percent over the rest of this year .  Growth 
should then gradually increas e to 1.7 percent in 2021,  supported by still -
accommodative mone tary policy and solid wage growth .  
Consumer prices were flat in the first quarter because of  subdued  core 
inflation of 1 percent and markedly negative retail energy inflation .  With 
retail energy prices stabilizing and resource utilization rising  only very slowly 
over the forecast horizon, we pr oject that inflation will come in near 1  percent 
this year before edging up to 1 .4 percent by the end of 2021.  Against this 
backdrop, we expect the ECB to start increasing  its deposit rate only in the 
third quar ter of 2020, reaching 0  percent in 2021, and to continue reinvesting 
maturing assets well after that .  At its April 10 meeting,  the ECB indicated 
that it w ould consider measures to mitigate possible side effects of negative 
policy rates on bank intermediat ion, consistent with report s that the ECB is 
considering a system of tiered interest rates on bank reserve s. 
United Kingdom.   Real GDP growth is estimated  to have increased to
1.5 percent in the first quarter  from a tepid 0.9 percent in the fourth .  In
contrast to other AFEs , the manufacturing sector was the main driver of
growth as Brexit -related uncertainty induced stockpiling among households
and businesses.  We project this unexpected buildup to unwind in the second
quarter , with growth falling to  only 0.5 percent.
With the EU grant ing a Brexit extension until the end of October  2019 , we
now expect that the United Kingdom will exit the EU without major
disruptions by that time  and then start a transition period during which it will
negotiate its fu ture relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.  With
Brexit -related uncertainty dissipating  more slowly  than we expected in Ma rch,
we now see growth ris ing more gradually  as well, reaching  its potential rate of
1.5 percent by the end of 2019 and  settling close to this pace  thereafter.
Canada.   First-quarter indicators, such as monthly GDP for January and the
manufacturing PMI through March, point to continued sluggish growth, in
part reflecting the drag from oil production cuts in Alberta.  Accordingly, we
Int’l Econ Devel & Outlook
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)
April 19, 2019
Page 43 of 134
Authorized for Public Release
  
  estimate that GDP growth edged up to only 1 percent in the first quarter from 
0.4 percent in the fourth .  As oil production recovers, we expect growth to 
rebound to 2 .1 percent in the current quarter before settling at a near-potential 
pace of 1.8 percent thereafter.  
Following  more dovish communications by the BOC  and in response to 
expected effects on the Canadian dollar  from a more accommodative U.S. 
monetary policy, we now project  the BOC to tighten policy more gradual ly 
than we assumed i n March.  We expect  the BOC to raise  its policy rate from 
its current level of 1. 75 percent to 2.25  percent  in 2021 , 0.5 percentage point 
lower than projected in the March Tealbook . 
 Japan.   Industrial production, the manufacturing PMI, and retail sales suggest 
that GDP growth was a subdued 0.3 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a 
general loss in momentum in the economy .  Looking through the volatility 
from the consumption tax hike scheduled fo r late 2019, we expe ct muted 
0.2 percent growth for 2019 as a whole.  Over the remainder of the forecast 
period, we expect GDP growt h to hover around its potential pace of 
0.8 percent, supported by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and very accommodative 
monetary policy.  
In light of ou r subdued outlook for growth and with inflation still quite far 
away from the Bank of Japan’s  (BOJ)  2 percent inflation target, we expect the 
BOJ to keep its deposit rate slightly negative, at minus  0.10 percent, 
throughout the forecast period , while contin ued asset purchases keep the long -
term yield around 0 percent . 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 China .  Official GDP growth picked up to 7.1 percent in the first quarter from 
just under  6 percent in the second half of last year .  A pickup in credit growth,  
industrial production , exports, and a positive PMI reading in March all point 
to a recovery in the making .  However, several other key indicators, including 
weak automobile sales , softer momentum in imports,  and slowing housing 
sales , suggest that the und erlying pace of expansion might be a little weaker 
than indicated by the first-quarter print .  That said, we expect growth to be 
supported over the course of the year  by the continued  easing of credit

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

 conditions and tax cuts.  For the year as a whole, we s ee growth coming in at 
6.5 percent, at the top of the  government’s target range of 6 to 6.5 percent.  
But with several indicators still weak and financial vulnerabilities still very 
evident, a sharp slowdown remains a significant risk.  
Other Emerging Asia .  The region’s manufacturing slump deepened in the
first quarter, dragged down by a further contraction in manufacturing and
exports of high -tech goods, especially in Korea and Taiwan.  However, March
data offer a glimmer of hope , as an uptick in exports a nd manufacturing PMIs
suggest that the slowdown may have  bottomed out .  Thus, after having slowed
to 2.6 percent in the first quarter, we see growth picking up to 3 .6 percent later
this year , driven by renewed  external demand for high -tech products, strong er
growth in China, and supportive fiscal and monetary policies.  This forecast
was revised up a touch on stronger U.S. growth.
Mexico .  Incoming data, including industrial production and manufacturing
exports , suggest that growth remained a lackluster 1.3 percent in the first
quarter , dragged down by gasoline shortages, labor unrest, and business
concerns about  the economic policies of the new government.  We see growth
stepping up to 2 .1 percent in the current quarter, as U.S. manufacturing
production reb ounds and the labor situation  stabilizes , before reaching
2.7 percent by 2021 .  We would have written  a stronger  forecast for Mexico in
light of our upward revision to U.S. manufacturing production , but we offset
this upward impulse on account of our greater pessimis m regarding
government  policies.  In particular, w e expect that a halt to energy reform s
and the absence of a plan to improve  Pemex ’s, the Mexican state -owned
petroleum company,  finances  will continue to weigh on business confidence
and growth.
Twelve -month inflation edged up to  4 percent in March, as energy prices
rebounded from declines earlier in the quarter.  Despite the recent weak  pace
of growth , the Bank of Mexico kept its policy rate at 8.25 percent at its March
meeting, citing concerns that inflation  continues to stay at the upper bound of
its tolerance range of 2 to 4 percent.
Brazil .  Brazil’s recovery from the worst recession in its history continues to
be excruciatingly slow.  Retail sales and industrial produ ction remained flat

  through February amid double -digit unemployment.  Exports were also very 
weak.  All told,  real GDP likely stagnated  in the first quarter , much weaker 
than the 1. 7 percent growth we estimated in the March Tealbook .  With strong 
business sentiment in expectation of market -friendly  government policies, 
however, we project  growth to pick up to 2.4 percent by the end of the year .  
Our outlook  assumes that congress approves  the government ’s ambitiou s 
pension reform later this year . 
 Argentina .  Argentina has been experiencing renewed financial turmoil in 
recent weeks  amid growing concerns that the policies implemented under its 
IMF program will fail to stabilize the economy before presidential elections in 
October .  Despite a deep recession, in flation remains stubbornly high at 
almost 55 percent on a 12 -month basis.  The central bank initially responded 
by further tightening its monetary base  target and committing to keep the 
overnight interest rate above 62.5 percent .  Subsequently, authorities  
introduced price controls and eliminated the slow crawl in the exchange rate 
band .  We continue to expect the economy to rebound from last year’s deep 
recession, primarily because of a strong agricultural harvest, but we have 
penciled in a weaker recovery  in light of the deteriorating situation .  Political 
risks are on the rise , and i nvestors are worried  by the prospect of the former 
president , Christina Kirchner , emerging as a major challenger to the current 
president , Mauricio Macri, whose popularity has declined steadily.  
 Turkey .  Economic and financial conditions in Turkey , another vulnerable 
EME, also deteriorated markedly.  Economic activity contracted severely in 
the second half of last year, and 12-month inflatio n has remained elevated at 
around 20 percent .  Against this fragile economic backdrop , Turkish financial 
markets came  under renewed pressure in late March as investors and 
depositors worried that the authorities were unsustainably propping up the 
currency  and loosening fiscal policy in the run -up to local elections .  Since 
then, concerns about the adequacy of Turkey’s reserves and sustainability of 
its fiscal policy have continued to pressure markets.

 Financial Market Developments 
Financial market developments  over the intermeeting period refl ected FOMC 
communications that were more accommodative than expected, U.S. and Chinese data 
releases that were on balance stronger than expected, and posit ive sentiment regarding 
trade negotiations between the U nited States and China.  On net, nominal Treasury yields 
decreased slightly, equity pri ces increased, and corporate bond  spreads narrowed. 
Nominal Treasury yields declin ed about 5 basis points at 2-, 5- , and 10-year
maturities on net.  Inflation compensation remained relatively unchanged, on
net, for both the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year horizons.
Blue Chip survey responses and a s traight read of OIS forward rates both
indicate that no change in the tar get range for the federal fun ds rate is
expected at the next few FOMC m eetings.  Relative to just before the March
FOMC meeting, investors appear to be putting somewhat more weig ht on
lower outcomes for the federa l funds rate in early 2020.  The p ath of the
federal funds rate at longer  horizons implied by a straight read of OIS forward
rates shifted dow n modestly.
The S&P 500 index increased about 3 percent over the intermeeting period.
Option-implied volatility on the S &P 500 index—the VIX—decreased
somewhat, and corporate bond spread s narrowed 18 basis points f or
investment-grade bonds and 20 basis  points for speculative-grad e bonds.
Foreign equity prices increas ed modestly on net.  Ongoing Brexi t
developments had limited effects on global asset prices.  The s taff’s broad
dollar index was little change d, on balance, over the intermeet ing period.
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Yields on nominal Treasury securiti es declined notably in the w eek following the 
March FOMC meeting.  The decline was partially attributed to th e downward revisions to 
FOMC participants’ assessments  of the appropriate path of the f ederal funds rate in the 
March SEP, which were larger than expected, and to the Committe e’s reaffirmation of its 
patient approach.  Weak euro-area da ta releases further contrib uted to the decline in

 yields, and, at one point, 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields were down  close to 25 basis points.  
However, Treasury yields retraced later in the period following  stronger-than-expected 
data on U.S. manufacturing and the C hinese economy as well as p ositive sentiment from 
trade negotiations between the United States and China.   
The near-term forward spread—the difference between three-month  Treasury bill 
yield and the implied forward r ate between six and seven quarte rs ahead—continued to 
reflect a relatively flat expect ed path of policy over the next  few quarters and changed 
little, on net, standing at the 12t h percentile of its distribution since 1971.1  The long-term 
spread—the difference betwee n 3-month and 10-year Treasury yields—also changed 
little, on net, after briefly falling into negative territory n ear the end of March.  
Meanwhile, 5-year and 5-to-10-yea r inflation compensation measu res based on TIPS 
were relatively unchanged, on net, d espite recent softer inflation readings.   
Market quotes and survey responses  both suggest that the target  range for the 
federal funds rate was viewed a s likely to be maintained at the  current level over the next 
few FOMC meetings.  The Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey su ggests a flat policy 
path through the third quarte r of 2020.  Probability distributi ons of the federal funds rate 
implied by options (without adjus ting for risk premiums) indicate that the most likely 
outcome through early 2020 is no cha nge to the current target r ange, but that relatively 
greater probability is assigned t o a lower target range than a higher one beyond the next 
several meetings.  A straight rea d of OIS forward rates implies  that the federal funds rate 
will decline about 15 basis points in 2019 and about 25 basis p oints in 2020.  Over the 
intermeeting period, the OIS-imp lied path was little changed fo r 2019 but declined 
around 5 to 10 basis points for subs equent years.  In contrast,  a staff model that adjusts 
for term premiums projects gradua l increases in the target rang e at a pace of 
approximately one 25 basis point inc rease per year over the nex t several years.  An 
alternative staff model for cal culating near-term term premiums  projects no change in the 
target range of the federal funds rate for the remainder of the  year (see the box “A Macro-
Finance Measure of Term Premiu ms in Federal Funds Futures Rates ”).  
Broad stock price indexes increased about 3 percent over the in termeeting period, 
largely as a result of more-accommodative-than-expected FOMC co mmunications and 
U.S. and Chinese data releases that were, on balance, stronger than expected.  Stock

Treasury yields for predicting a transition to r ecession in the  subsequent four quarters.

 A Macro‐Finance  Measure  of Term Premiums  in Federal Funds  Futures  Rates 
Forward rates derived from quotes  on overnight index  swaps (OIS) or federal funds  futures 
contracts  provide a market ‐based read of the expected  path of the federal funds  rate.  However, 
such a straight read  is contaminated  by the presence  of unobserved  term premiums.  Term  
premium  estimates  are a model‐ specific concept;  different models  will provide  different values.   
This discussion  
introduces  a new and complementary  approach,  based on the one in Diercks and 
Carl (2019), to  the staff’s standard  model estimate  of the term premium–adjusted  path of policy.1  
The new approach relies  on a key economic  assumption  from conventional  asset pricing theory, 
which suggests  that the sign of risk premiums  depends  on the sign of the covariance of  the 
returns of those assets with the typical investor’s  consumption  growth.  For example,  stocks 
require a positive  risk premium  because  equity prices tend to fall during  recessions,  precisely  
when consu mption 
also falls.  In the case of interest rate securities, investors  who position  
themselves  to profit when interest rates fall may expect to realize  these gains in the midst of 
recessions.   If there are  enough investors  willing to accept  a negative return,  on average, in 
exchange  for this insurance ‐like feature, then the 
risk premiums  should be negative.   In 
alternative  environments  in which the federal funds rate may  instead be higher than expected  
during recessions—for  instance,  if the FOMC raises rates to stem economic  activity in an effort  to 
stave off inflation pressures—then  the risk premium s should be positive.  
Figure 1 shows the key measure  of covariance‐based  risk in this model, which is  based on time‐
varying estimates  of the co‐movement between real  activity and nominal measures.2  The figure 
shows that the mean measure  of covariance‐ based risk was positive until 2000, after which it 
turned negative following  the 2001 recession.   Following  the financial crisis, it declined  sharply 
and has only gradually  become less negative  since then.   The model’s  term premium  estimate,  
referred to as  “macro‐finance term premium,”  is shown by the thick green line  in figure 2 at the 
six
‐month horizon (expressed  in basis points per month).   Also shown are term premium  
estimates  from the staff’s term structure  model (the  thin red line)  and a survey‐based measure  
(the blue dashed line).3  The figure shows  that the macro‐finance term premium  was close to 
1 basis point per month up  until 2000, after which it shifted to negative  1 basis point per month  as 
a result of the shift in covariances  shown in  figure 1.  Currently,  the implied term premium  is about 
negative 1½ basis points per month.4

consumption  growth because of their monthly availability)  and the federal funds rate and PCE‐All and CPI‐U

averages  120 covariance  combi n ations of these two  real and three nominal variables,  as well  as window lengths  of

term premium  of close to zero between  2010  and 2014.  This estimate is consistent  with forward guidance  
essentially  pinning down short  rate

Figure 3 shows  the implications  of the macro‐ finance model for the  current path of the federal 
funds rate.  A straight  read from OIS contracts  (the blue line) currently  implies that the federal 
funds rate will decline  12 basis points by the end of 2019.  In contrast, the  staff’s standard  term 
structure model  (the red line) suggests 
29 basis points of tightening.   By subtracting  the term 
premium  estimates  of the macro‐ finance model from  the straight read from OIS  contracts,  one 
can obtain an  alternative  estimate of  the term  premium–adjusted  path for the near  term.  Such a 
path (the dashed green line)  currently  suggests  no additional  tightening  through year‐ end.  That 
said, the true  expected  path for the federal  funds rate likely  lies somewhere in  the range of  the 
red and green lines,  as both the staff model and  the macro‐ finance model embed  model 
uncertainty.   Furthermore,  like all models, the  macro‐ finance method is  not without drawbacks.  
In particular,  it mainly captures  lower‐ frequency  movements  based on macro data  that are only 
available monthly.  Therefore, it  has less to say  about movements  in risk premiums  on a daily or 
intermeeting  period basis than, for example,  the staff’s standard  term structure  model.

 prices of firms in the consumer discretionary, telecommunicatio ns, and technology 
sectors outperformed the broader market.  In the days immediate ly following the March 
FOMC meeting, bank stock prices fell markedly, reportedly as a result of increased 
concerns about yield curve invers ion and lower interest rates; however, prices 
subsequently retraced, partly in response to strong first-quart er earnings reports at some 
of the largest banks, and ended t he intermeeting period a bit h igher on net.  One-month-
ahead option-implied volatilit y on the S&P 500 index (VIX) decreased over the 
intermeeting period and now stands  near the 17th percentile of its historical range. 
Yields on both investment- and sp eculative-grade corporate bond s continued to 
decline.  Spreads on yields of both investment- and speculative -grade corporate bonds 
over those of comparable-matur ity Treasury securities narrowed 18 basis points and 
20 basis points, respectively.  Hav ing mostly retraced from the ir elevated levels late last 
year, both spreads remained below their respective historical m edians.  
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Although disappointing data from the euro area weighed on risk sentiment, 
foreign equity prices increas ed modestly, on net, amid optimism  around trade 
negotiations between the United S tates and China and stronger-t han-expected Chinese 
data.  Ongoing Brexit developmen ts had limited effects on globa l asset prices.  
FOMC communications and a signifi cantly worse-than-expected Ger man 
manufacturing PMI release w eighed on government bond yields in advanced foreign 
economies (AFEs) early in the intermeeting per iod.  Communications by the ECB 
suggesting that it may consider deposit tiering to mitigate the  effect of negative interest 
rates on bank profitability also contributed to the declines, as this policy could take the 
ECB deposit rate further into negative territory or imply a lon ger period of low interest 
rates.  AFE yields largely retraced amid strength in U.S. and C hinese data and, on 
balance, edged higher, although not in Germany.  Additionally, inflation compensation 
for the 5-to-10-year horizon i n the euro area declined 9 basis points and reached its 
lowest level since 2016, in part r eflecting increased downside risks to the outlook, 
especially given limited policy space for the ECB.  
The broad dollar index was little changed, on net, over the int ermeeting period.  
Despite the decline in U.S. inter est rates, the dollar rose nea rly 1 percent against AFE 
currencies in light of weak data  in those economies.  The British pound remained

 sensitive to Brexit developments  and appreciated modestly in th e days leading up to the 
extension of the Brexit dead line; the pound rose on news of the  extension before 
subsequently drifting down, while  option-implied measures of po und volatility declined 
sharply.  On net, the pound weaken ed about 2 percent over the i ntermeeting period.   
The dollar was little changed, on a verage, against emerging mar ket economy 
(EME) currencies, as a small decline against the Mexican peso o ffset much larger 
increases against several highly vulnerable EMEs with much smal ler weights in our 
dollar index.  Pronounced politic al and policy uncertainties le d to a significant tightening 
of financial conditions in Turkey, Argentina, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil, but spillovers 
to other emerging markets were limited, and emerging market cre dit spreads were little 
changed.  Following strong inflows  to dedicated emerging market  funds earlier this year, 
flows slowed over the intermeeting period.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Over the intermeeting period, cond itions in domestic short-term  funding markets 
remained stable.2  The effective federal funds r ate (EFFR) printed mostly at 2.4 1 percent, 
1 basis point above IOER, but ros e a little following the federal income tax deadline on 
April 15.  A similar dynamic has been observed around tax dates  in previous years and 
may be related to banks experien cing temporary deposit outflows .  Spreads on 
commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposits change d little across most 
tenors.  On the March quarter-end, the EFFR and the secured ove rnight funding rate rose 
2 basis points and 22 basis points , respectively, from the prev ious day but quickly 
reverted in the following days.3  
In anticipation of April tax rece ipts, the Treasury reduced Tre asury bills 
outstanding by $83 billion between April 1 and April 18.  The n egative net bill issuance 
had minimal effects on repo rates  or Treasury funding costs.  
2 Overnight reverse repo program take-up remained low, averaging  less than $1 billion over the 
intermeeting period.  The update  to the Policy Normalization Pr inciples and Plans at the March FOMC 
meeting was forecast to increase reinvestments in Treasury secu rities by $148 billion in 2019. 
3 This was the first time the EFFR increased on a month-end sinc e 2013.  Previous pressure for the 
EFFR to decline on month-ends was  eliminated in 2018, when Euro pean regulators reportedly encouraged 
banks to move to daily averaging of balance sheets rather than month- or quarter-end reporting of balances.  
Month-end changes may now be partly driven by banks subject to modified LCR calculations on month-
ends.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Information received over the intermeeting period indicates that financing 
conditions for businesses and households eased  a bit , on balance, and remained  generally 
supportive of spending.    
•Gross issuance of corporate bonds and of new -money institutional leveraged
loans was strong in March.
•Growth of C&I loans on banks’ books remained robust, and , according to the
April 2019 SLOOS, la rge U.S.  banks continued to ease their lending standards
and terms on C&I loans over the first quarter.
•CMBS issuance and  growth of CRE loans on banks’ books remained solid
through March.
•Home mortgage rates declined about 5 basis points, on net, and home-
purchase mortgage originations increased in February .
•Consumer credit conditions remained generally supportive of spending.However, in the credit card market, interest rates rose, and, for someconsumers, standards reportedly tightened.
•Measures of financial conditions indexes support our assessment of continued
improvement in financial conditions over the intermeeting period.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms continued to ease over the 
intermeeting period and were generally accommodative.  Gross issuance of  investment- 
and speculative- grade  corporate bonds remained solid in March, as corporate  bond 
spreads narrowed and risk se ntiment continued to improve .  New -money leveraged loan 
issuance was also solid in March .  However, the volume of leveraged loan refinancings  
continued to be muted, in line with  still somewhat elevated levels of leveraged loan 
spreads.

 In the April 2019 SLOOS, large U.S. banks indicated that, over the first quarter, 
they had eased their standards and most terms for C&I loans to large and middle- market 
firms while experiencing weaker demand for such loans.  Meanwhile, growth of C&I 
loans on banks’ books increased over the first quarter from an already robust fourth-quarter pace, reportedly boosted by loans used to complete a large merger.  
Gross equity issuance from  both initial and seasoned offerings picked up in March 
following their subdued activity early in the year.  The IPO market had a high -profile 
offering in March, and more IPOs are expected over the next few months.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations appears to have improved, on 
balance, after deteriorating somewhat in recent months.  The volume of nonfinancial 
corporate bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of downgrades in March, and expected 
year-ahead default rates decreased a bit in March and so far in April.   
Small Business 
Available data suggest that credit con ditions for small businesses remained 
relatively accommodative.  Banks in the SLOOS reported little change in standards on loans to small businesses over the first quarter, on net, while small business loan originations ticked up in February.  In addition, survey evidence suggests that small business optimism ticked up in March following several months in which it had declined.   
Indicators of recent loan performance remained strong.  Delinquencies on small 
business loans rose a bit over recent months but stayed  well below their historical means.  
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions remained generally accommodative for CRE  lending.  
Agency and non-agency CMBS issuance remained strong through March, and CMBS spreads were about flat  over the intermeeting period, with spreads staying near  the low 
end of their post- crisis range.    
CRE loans on banks’ books continued to grow in the first quarter but at a 
somewhat slower pace than in recent quarters.  Consistent with slower bank loan growth , 
banks in the April SLOOS reported experiencing weaker demand  while tightening credit 
standards for such loans over the first quarter.

 How Did Banks Manage Their Leveraged Loan Pipelines  
during the Market Turmoil in Late 2018 ? 
In the primary market for leveraged loan s, arranging banks  typically form a syndication and 
place a substantial fraction of loans with institutional investors.  When banks struggle to 
attract enough investor  interest  for loans they have committed  to underwrite , the size of 
their underwriting pipelines can increase  unexpectedly , reducing their balance sheet  capacity 
and potentially discouraging them from arranging new syndicated loans  or making other 
types of loans .1  Thus, the size of banks’ leveraged loan pipelines  can have  important 
implications for financing conditions for a wide range of borrowers .  
In this discussion  we present evidence consistent with  arranging banks actively reduc ing the 
size of their pipelines toward the end of last year, largely in response to the weakening of the 
demand for leveraged loans by institutional investors.   We argue that , while the reduction in 
pipelines might have temporarily amplified the price declines in the  leveraged loans market, it 
potentially helped avoid prolonged credit supply disruptions.  
In late 2018 , credit m arket conditions worsened considera bly and investor risk sentiment 
deteriorated .  Open -ended bank loan mutual fund s, which h eld about 15  percent  of 
institutional leveraged loans  outstanding , experienced large net redemption s from investors 
in the last two months of 2018  (figure 1) , leaving investors’ demand  in the new issue market 
substantially weaker .  Market anecdote s suggest that some banks struggled to place loans , 
raising concerns of outsized bank pipeline s and posing  risks to future financing conditions .   
Contrary to these concerns , figure 2 shows that  banks managed to end the year with 
significantly  smaller pipeline positions  than the levels seen in the middle of the year .  In 
addition to reflecting weaker demand for credit from borrowing firms , the decline in 
pipelines  also appeared to reflect active management of pipeline risks by banks  during this 
period .  
 
                                                 
1 Leveraged pipeline  loans refer to loans in the  syndication process that  have not been 
funded .  These loans remain in the pipeline until they are issued  or withdrawn from the primary 
market.   Arranging banks often guarantee at least part of these  loans, especially for loans 
related to acquisition s.

Banks  that originate leveraged loans  with an intent to place some fraction  with  institutional 
investors have  an obvious incentive to manage pipelines , especially  when  investor demand 
for leveraged loans  is weakening .  Standard o rigination arrangements often give banks a 
range  of options to do so :  They can adjust the spread s on loans (spread flex) , mark up or 
down the issuance prices relative to par (Original Issuance Discounts  flex, or OID flex), or pull 
loans from the market .2  As shown in  figure 3, the fraction of loans with upward spread flexes  
(blue bars) —those with increases in loan spreads during the syndication process —rose from 
13 percent  in September 2018 to 33 percent  in December 2018.   Similarly, the fraction of 
upward OID flexes increased from 7 percent to 5 3 percent in the same period  (blue bars, 
figure 4) .  Moreover, the fraction of  pulled  loans  relative to launched loans  (not shown) 
picked up notably at year -end.  A regression  analysis suggests that arranging banks that 
reported  more upward spread  and OID  flexes or pulled more loans  from the market also saw 
larger decline s in their pipelines, consistent with them actively  manag ing their pipelines.  
In the short  run, banks’ active pipeline management  may potentially amplif y price declines 
and reduce credit supply  during market downturn s.  For example,  the monthly average loan 
spread  for B -rated loans at the time of issuance (not shown) increased to 507 basis points in 
December 2018  after staying under 400 basis points for over a year.  However, this 
precautionary behavior by banks should help avoid prolonged credit supply disruptions  and 
limit further amplification s of credit cycle fluctuations.   
2 When investor demand is weak, banks can widen issuance spreads and increase OIDs, 
which mark down loan prices further away from par value, to help  attract investors.  Widening 
of issuance spread and increasing OID is called “flex up,” and narrowing of issuance spread 
and decreasing OID is called “flex down.”

 However, t aking a longer -term view,  banks, in response to a set of special 
questions in the SLOOS regarding changes to their CRE lending policies over the past 
year,  reported eas ing their terms  on CRE loans, including offering lower loan  spreads and 
larger maximum loan sizes  on net.  The vast majority of  banks that eased CRE credit 
policies  over the past year cited more aggressive competi tion from other institutions as an 
important reason for doing so.   
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative over the 
intermeeting period.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds was solid in March, with new capital -raising accounting for the majority of the issuance.  Municipal bond yields in both 
the secondary and primary markets decreased roug hly in line with yields on Treasury 
securities.  In March, the credit quality of general obligation bonds continued to improve, as the number of credit rating upgrades strongly outpaced that of downgrades. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased a bit  over the 
intermeeting period, as the rate on 30 -year confo rming mortgages edged down about 
5 basis points on net.  Mortgage rates have fallen abo ut 75 basis points since their peak in 
November and are now at levels comparable with  those in  early  2017.  Likely i n response 
to the se lower rates, home-purchase mortgage originations increased in February after 
having declined  steadily over the past year.  Mortgage refinanc ing activity also increased, 
though it remain s at historically low levels.  
Taking a longer- term view,  for borrowers with low credit scores, access to 
mortgage credi t has been gradually improving over the past five years.  Loosening 
standards on government- insured mortgages have raised concerns within  the Federal 
Housing Administration (FHA) , which took steps in March to tighten standards on such 
mortgages.  In particular, the FHA will now require a more intensive underwriting process for some loans with higher risk c haracteristics.   One FHA official estimated that 
the number of affected loans each year would be about 4 to 5 percent of the recent annual volume of FHA mortgage originations, which are themselves about 20 percent of total mortgage originations.

  Consumer Credit 
Availabl e data continue to suggest that financing conditions in consumer credit 
markets have generally remained accommodative of growth in consumer spending.  Auto 
loan balances continued to increase at a moderate pace through February, as interest rates on auto loans moved sideways, and a modest net fraction of banks in the SLOOS reported having eased their standards on such loans in the first quarter.  Credit card balances grew 
at a fairly tepid pace over the past few months amid rising credit card  interest rates  and a 
reported further tightening of credit card lending standards by banks, as indicated in the 
April SLOOS . 
Consumer ABS markets remained stable over the intermeeting period .  Spreads 
were mostly unchanged, and issuance continued to be robust during the first quarter amid some monthly volatility.  
FINANCING CONDITIONS INDEXES  
As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook section, a staff index that provides a 
measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations indicates that conditions continued to ease over the intermeeting period .  The staff index is now at a similar level 
to where it stood before the September 2018 FOMC meeting.  The easing in financing conditions since the beginning of the year is consistent with the decline in corporate 
spreads  and the increase in equity prices over the same period.  Other publicly available 
financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set of financial variables into a 
summary series, have also eased, on net, since the beginning of the year.  These inde xes 
indicate that broad financial conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical standards .

Appendix  
Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes 
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes.”

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative- grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.  
The second index in the table  measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending 
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices .  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.
2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both  changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy. 
1 This index was first discussed in the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” in the Financing Conditions for 
Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.  
2 This index is an updated version of the  index developed in  William  F. Bassett, Mary Beth Chosak, John 
C.Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and t he Macroeconomy,” Journal of
Monetary Economics,  vol. 62 (March) , pp. 23–40.  The current index uses a new weighting approach for each loan
category .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
As in past Tealbooks, we view the risks to our forecast for economic activity and 
inflation as balanced over the next year but skewed to the downside thereafter .   
Beginning with our assessment for the next year, w e continue to view  the uncertainty 
around the staff  forecast of economic activity  as being in line with the average over the past 
20 years, the benchmark used by the FOMC.  In addition , we still judge  the upside and downside  
risks around our modal  projection s for real GDP growth  and the unemployment rate  over the 
next year  as being balanced.  On the upside, the underlying fundamentals for household  spending  
and business investment  remain  solid —bolstered , in part , by the 2017 tax cuts —with strong  
labor market conditions , favorable financial conditions,  and upbeat  readings on consumer  
sentiment .  In these circumstances , consumer spending and investment co uld expand  at a pace 
similar to last year, which would be  faster than in  the staff  projection.  On the downside,  the 
softening in a number of economic indicators since late last year could be the leading edge  of a 
more persistent and subst antial deterioration in economic activity .  In addition, foreign economic 
developments and  trade policies  could move in direction s that ha ve significant negative effects 
on U.S econom ic growth.  
This assessment  is consistent with the  four-quarter -ahead  estimates  of forecast risks 
around  GDP growth and the unemployment rate , presented in the exhibit “Time -Varying 
Macroeconomic Risk  1 Year Ahead ,” which are not unusually wide or skewed.   In addition,  as 
shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit,  with the 
notable exception of the term spread model, estimates of the probabilit y of moving into recession  
over the next year are lower than the unconditional recession probability of 23 percent .   
We remain concerned about downside risks to our economic projection beyond a year 
ahead , given the historically low unemployment rate  projected over the medium term .  As 
discussed in the box “ Conditional Distributions of Macro economic Variables Two Years 
Ahead ,” the estimated distributions  are currently skewed to the upside for the unemployment rate

 Conditional Distribu tions of Macroeconomic  Variables Two  Years A head  
In the Risk s and Uncertainty section, the staff regularly provides an assessment of the risks to the 
baseline outlook.  For some time, that assessment has been  informed by the exhibit “ Time- Varying 
Macroeconomic  Risk  1 Year Ahead ,” which shows model estimates of upsid e and downside risk s to 
the staff baseline forecast one year ahead , conditional on currently available indicators.  Of course, 
risks may be roughly balanced at the one-year horizon but might be larger or become more 
skewed further out.  For example, the exhibit “ Prediction Intervals Derived from Historical 
Tealbook Forecast Errors ” shows that the unconditional distribution of Tealbook forecast errors 
around the median unemployment rate becomes more skewed to the upside as the forecast 
horizon moves beyond one year.  
In this discussion  we introduce a new macro- risk exhibit  for the two- year horizon , “Conditional 
Distribution of Macroeconomic  Variables  2 Years Ahead .”  Specifically, t he exhibit shows estim ates 
of the conditional distribution of outcomes  two years ahead  for the unemployment rate, GDP 
growth , and CPI inflation.   The conditional distribution is inferred from the historical relationships 
between a set of macroeconomic and financial indicators ( including contemporaneous recession 
probabilities ) and realizations of the aforementioned macro variables two  years later.1  We provide 
estimates for the median of the conditional distribution as well as for tail risks to those macro 
variables.  To be clear, the “Time- Varying Macroeconomic Risk  1 Year Ahead ” exhibit describes the 
conditional distribution of the Tealbook forecast errors, while this new exhibit is focused on the distributions of the actual outcomes for the macro variables.   
The top  panel of the exhibit shows that there is substantial variation over time not only in  the 
median  (plotted in red) of the distribution for the unemployment rate two  years ahead, but also in 
the balance of risks around the median.  For example, the distribut ion around the median becomes 
substantially more skewed to the upside before each of the past three recessions .  Similarly, for 
GDP g rowth, shown in the middle panel, the downside risk around the median is very cyclical and 
worsens sharply well before past recessions.  This feature is predominantly driven by the recession 
probability variable.  In contrast, upside risk to GDP growth as measured by the 95 th percentile 
moves comparatively little over time.  The conditional distribution for CPI inflation two  years 
ahead is much less cyclical than that  for the unemployment rate or GDP growth.   
For the current month , the quantiles of the conditional distribution two  years ahead are provided 
to the right of each chart .  Given the current information, the risks to the unemployment rate are 
skewed to the upside at  the two -year horizon ; the 95 th percentile is 3  percentage points above the 
median , whereas the 5 th percentile is  only  about 1 percentage point below.  Based on the 
85th versus  15th percentile, the skew is less stark.  GDP growth two  years ahead is currently 
skewed to the downside, as is inflation (though to a smaller degree).  This assessment is consistent 
with the staff’s judgment,  as described in  the Risks and Uncertainty section in recent Tealbooks, 
that the risks beyond the 12 -month horizon  have been  tilted toward the downside for GDP growth 
and toward the upside for the unemploymen t rate.  
                                                 
1 The explanatory variables include indexes for inflation, real activity, financial factors , and macro uncertainty 
that are also used for the “Time- Varying Macro economic Risk  1 Year Ahead ” exhibit.  T he estimated recession 
probability two years ahead is based on the spread between 10 -year Treasury and 3- month T -bill yields.   Our 
empirical methodology uses quantile regressions.

and skewed to the downside for real GDP growth  two years ahead .1  In addition , as indicated in 
the “Effective Lower Bound Risk” exhibit, the e stimate d probabili ty of returning to the effective 
lower bound  (ELB ) over the next three years  is currently  17 percent —and it  rises further to 
around 32 percent by the end of the medium term —materially higher than in previous forecast s 
because of the lower  baseline federal funds rate  path in this Tealbook .  Given the proximity  of 
the federal funds rate  to the ELB, monetary policy  may have less capacity to offset negative 
economic shocks than positive ones , contributing  to a downside skew in  economic outcomes.       
With rega rd to inflation, the staff  still see s average uncertain ty and balanced risks around 
the projection  over the next year .  To t he downside , the recent soft data on consumer prices could 
be more persistent than assumed in the baseline.  In addition, underlying  inflation  could currently 
be even  lower than assumed in the baseline.   Also, the exchange value of the dollar could 
appreciate more than expected  and put downward pressure on inflation.   To the upside, an 
extended period with unusually tight resource util ization could eventually lead to greater upward 
pressure on wages and prices , consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear 
effects of resource utilization on inflation .  In addition , an unexpectedly widespread and 
sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to higher inflation.  These assessments are 
consistent with the statistical estimates of the  time-varying risks for the inflation forecast  over 
the next year .  Of course, if the  risks to the forecast for economic activity beyond a year  are tilted  
to the downside , then the risk s to the inflation  projection  would  also tend to have a downward 
skew  at that time .   
These inflation risks would be of relatively modest size as long as in flation expectations 
remain ed reasonably well anchored.  The risks could increase substantially, in either direction, if 
expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such movements in expectations could 
induce changes in inflation to build upo n themselves and thus lead inflation to deviate more  
significantly , and more persistently, from 2 percent.  
                                                           
1 The results shown in the box are consistent with recent research , using quantile regressions,  on the 
distribution of fluctuations in the unemployment rate and in real GDP growth.  For the unemployment rate, see 
Michael Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” F inance and Economics Discussion Series 2018 -067 (Washington:  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067 .  For real  
GDP growth , see Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Nellie Liang, and Sheheryar Malik (2018), “The Term 
Structure of Growth -at-Risk,” Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Working Paper 42 (Washington:  
Brookings Institute, August) , https://www.brookings.edu/wp -content/uploads/2018/08/WP42 -NL-updated.pdf .  The 
results of their research  suggest that the  upside risk to the unemployment rate and downside risk to GDP growth are 
more pronoun ced in the medium term —specifically, two to three years ahead —particularly w hen the unemployment 
rate is low or credit growth is high.

Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s latest 
quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment, which will be described in  the Financial Stability 
Report  to be published in May.   In that assessment, the staff judges overall financial 
vulnerabilities in the United States as moderate  and little changed since the February 2019 QS 
assessment.   On the one hand , household borrowing  remains at a modest level relative to income .  
In addition, t he largest U.S. banks continue to have strong capital positions , and f unding risks in 
the financial system are low , as e stimates of total financial system liabilities most vulnerable to 
runs, in cluding those issued by nonbanks, remain modest .  On the other hand , although  asset  
valuation pressures have eased relative to their highs  of last summer, they remain elevated in a 
number of markets.   Additionally , borrowing by nonfinancial businesses , as a ratio to nominal  
GDP , is at a historical high .  Reflecting this assessment, e xisting  financial  vulnerabilities, 
particularly in the nonfinancial corporate sector, could amplify shocks emanating from both 
domestic and foreign developments . 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  The first scenario  considers the possibility that the 
softening in a number of economic indicators early this year could be the leading edge of a more 
persistent and substantial deterioration in economic activity that results in a recession , which  is 
amplified by elevated leverage in the nonfinancial business sector.  The second scenario  
considers the possibility both that the impetus  from the  2017  tax cuts is now behind us and that 
federal government purchases will decline when the current budget agreement expires later this 
year.  The third scenario assumes that aggregate supply conditions have been stronger than 
judged in the baseline and that potential GDP growth will be  somewhat faster in the coming 
years.   The fourth scenario examines the prospect  that consumer spending and business 
investment could  increase this year  at a pace comparable with last year , and  it further assumes 
that the response of wages and prices  to stronger demand  will prove to be greater  than in the 
baseline .  The fifth scenario consider s the possibility of a recession in Europe  and a stronger 
dollar.  The s ixth scenario assumes that successful resolution of trade talks result s in an 
alleviation of trade policy uncertainties and  a rise in global sentiment . 
We simulate each of these scenarios using one of two models maintained by the staff , 
which  embed different macroeconomic structures and dynamics.2  In three  of the scenarios , the 
2 The two models are  (1) FRB/US, which is a large -scale macroeconometri c model of the U.S. economy, 
and (2) SIGMA, which is a calibrated  multicountry  DSGE model.

federal funds rate is governed by the new policy rule used in the baseline .  However, t he first 
scenario, which features a recess ion, allows for a more aggressive monetary policy response than 
would be prescribed by either the new baseline policy rule  or the policy rule used in previous 
Tealbooks .  The fourth and fifth scenario s assume  the same parameter values in the policy rule  
used in previous  Tealbooks,  which put more weight on the output gap  rather than the new 
specification of the baseline rule.  Under the conditions in th ese two scenario s, we judge it 
unlikely that monetary policy would react in the manner embodied in the  new baseline rule, 
because either inflation rises materially or output growth slows  sharply .  Finally , the size and 
composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the 
scenarios.  
Recession with Financial Amplification  [FRB /US]  
The softness in a number of economic indicators early this year and the recent flatness in 
the yield curve could be harbingers of a substantial deterioration in economic  activity .  Indeed, 
one statistical model based on the term spread in Treasury yie lds indicate s that the probability of 
a recession over the next year  is substantially higher than the unconditional probability; see the 
bottom table in the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks”  exhibit.   Furthermore, as noted 
earlier , leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is elevated, making firms and their creditors 
vulnera ble to adverse economic shocks.  In this scenario, a recession  is amplified  by highly  
indebted  businesses reduc ing hiring and investment by more than they would if their debt  was 
not elevated .3  We assume that monetary policymakers respond to  sharp and  sustained increases 
in the unemployment rate more aggressively than prescribed by either the new or old  baseline 
rules, in line with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.  
Real GDP starts to declin e in the third quarter of this year  and only begins to recover at  
the start of 2021 .  The unemployment rate peaks  at 7.0 percent in the first quarter of 2022 , an 
increase of more than 3 percentage points from the start of the recession.   With substantially 
lower resource utilization,  inflation runs about 0.2 percentage point below  the baseline, on 
average, from the start of the recession through 2021.   The federal funds rate reach es its ELB  in 
the second  quarter of 2020  and stays there until mid-2023 .  
                                                           
3 Specifically, we assume shocks that are somewhat more severe than those consistent with the recession in 
the early 1990s.

Falloff in Fiscal Impetus  [FRB/US]  
Real GDP growth last year was boosted by fiscal stimulus.  In the baseline projection, the 
effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) are expected  to provide further  impetus to real GDP 
growth this year and next.  In addition, while the Bipartisan Budget Act  (BBA)  of 2018 increase d 
the level of government appropriations in fiscal years 2018 and 2019 only, the staff assumes that 
appropriations will remain steady in real terms .  In this sce nario, we assume that the stimulative 
effects of the TCJA on GDP growth are behind us and that , after the BBA expires this year , 
appropriations will decline  to much lower levels , consistent with  the caps in  the 2011  Budget 
Control Act .  The reduction in federal purchases , compared with the baseline , widens to  about 
½ percent of nominal GDP in 2022.  
Real GDP growth falls more than ½ percentage point below the baseline this year and 
next.   The unemployment rate increases gradually  over the projection period, reaching 
4½ percent by the end of 2024 .  Because the weight on the output gap is small under the new 
baseline policy rule and the path for inflation is little changed  from the baseline, t he federal 
funds rate is only about 2 0 basis points lower, on average, over the projection horizon .4 
Stronger Aggregate Supply [FRB/US ] 
Although the unemployment rate is currently about ¾ percentage point below our 
estimate of its natural rate, wage gains have remained modest in recent years —in our assessment, 
because the Phillips curve is relatively flat and productivity growth has been slow.  Another way 
of reconciling modest wage and pr ice inflation  with a very low unemployment rate is to consider 
that resource utilization may be less tight t han assumed in the baseline.  This scenario assumes 
that the level of potential output in recent years has been higher than judged in the baseline  and 
that potential output growth in future years is faster than in the baseline.  Specifically, it is 
assumed that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past several years than in 
the baseline and continues to fall to 4.1 percent at the end of 201 9, 0.5 percentage point lower 
than in the baseline.  We also assume that trend labor force participation has been decreasing at a 
slower rate than in the baseline for the past several years and continues to do so going forward; 
as a result, the trend parti cipation rate is almost 1  percentage point above the baseline by the end 
4 Alternatively, if we assumed the old policy rule with the output gap coefficient of 1, th e federal funds rate 
would decline gradually to reach 1¾ percent by the end of 2022.  In this case, the unemployment rate rises 
somewhat less and real GDP growth is slightly higher than shown in this scenario.

of 2024.  In addition, structural productivity is assumed to grow ¼ percentage point faster than in 
the baseline in the past several years and also going forward.  
Because we assume t hat households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential 
growth and its implications for income and profits, consumer spending and investment are 
stronger.  Real GDP growth is, on average, almost 1 percentage point per year above the 
baseline.  The unemployment rate falls further than in the baseline and reaches 2 ¾ percent by the 
end of 2024 , more than a full percentage point below the staff projection .  The path for i nflation 
is only 0.1  percentage point  below the baseline , on average,  over the p rojection horizon .  
Because policymakers recognize the supply -side conditions and see the smaller positive output 
gap persisting for several years, the path of the  federal funds rate  is lower than in the baseline by 
about 25 basis points , on average , over the projection horizon .   
Stronger Aggregate Demand and  Higher Inflation [FRB/US]  
The underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain 
solid , with strong  labor market conditions , favorable financial conditions,  and upbeat  readings on 
consumer sentiment .  In this scenario, we assume that consumer spending and investment expand 
at a pace similar to last year, a good bit faster than in the baseline .  We also assume both that the 
lower level of the unemployment rate bring s us to a steeper portion of the Phillips curve and that 
inflation expectations turn out to be more res ponsive to re alized inflation  than we have assumed . 
Under these assumptions, GDP increases  3 percent per year , on average , this year and 
next, a pace comparable with that in 2018.  The unemployment rate declines substantially below 
the baseline, falling to under  3 percent  in 2020 .  Inflation reaches 2.7 percent by the end of 202 1, 
compared with 1.9  percent in the baseline.   We assume that policymakers follow the interest rate 
rule used in previous Tealbooks and raise  the federal funds rate more aggressively than the new 
baseline rule would prescribe because inflation rises persistently and significantly above the 
FOMC’s 2 percent objective in this scenario .5  With this assumption, consistent with the 
markedly higher  paths for both  inflation  and the output gap , the federal funds rate increases 
steeply and reaches  4.4 percent at the end of 2021 . 
5 If we instead assume that the federal funds rate is guided by the new baseline policy rule with the output 
gap coefficient of 0.2, inflation rises more sharply than described in this scenario, reaching 3¼ percent by the end of 
2024.

Recession in Europe  [SIGMA]  
While we expect that growth in the euro area will pick up to close to potential over the 
forecast horizon —supported by highly accommodative monetary policy and some easing of 
headwinds —continued soft euro -area data, especially in manufacturing, may be sign aling more 
pronounced weakness.   Furthermore, ongoing negotiations between the European Union and the 
United King dom will prolong uncertainty around the outcome of Brexit.   In this scenario, we 
assume that Europe slides into a protracted recession that is exacerbated by its lack of fiscal and 
monetary space, and which exerts substantial spillovers to the global economy.  
Specifically, our scenario envisions that a sharp tightening of financial conditions in 
Europe causes equity prices to decline sharply and corporate borrowing spreads to widen 
150 basis points, with borrowing spreads in the United States and emerging market economies 
rising 100 basis points.  Real GDP growth dips to negative 0.2 percent in advanced economies 
and to 2 .1 percent in emerging ec onomies in the second half of 2019.  Flight -to-safety flows 
cause the broad real dollar to appreciate 8 percent.   
Weaker foreign activity, the stronger dollar, and tighter global financial conditions cause 
U.S. GDP growth to moderate to 1.1 percent, on average, in the second half of 2019 and 2020, 
about 1 percentage point below the baseline.  Core PCE inflation runs at only 1. 6 percent in the 
second half of this year and remains below 2 percent over the projection horizon .  Accordingly, 
the federal funds  rate follows a noticeably shallower path than in the baseline.  
Easing of Trade Tensions  [SIGMA]  
Numerous commentators, including the International Monetary Fund’s April 2019 World 
Economic Outlook  report, have asserted that trade tensions have played a ma jor part in the global 
slowdown over the past year.6  Our analysis suggests that other factors —including Chinese 
deleveraging, problems in Germany’s auto industry, and financial stresses in some EMEs —have 
also been important.  Nevertheless, it is possible that a resolution of trade negotiations that 
substantially alleviates trade uncertainties could catalyze a surge in global sentiment and 
significantly boost global growth.

This scenario considers such a possibility.  In particular, we assume that successfu l trade 
talks lead to a reversal of the tariff hikes imposed last year and greatly diminish fears of a trade 
war.  These developments cause global sentiment to improve and financial conditions to ease 
markedly, with corporate borrowing spreads in both the foreign economies and the United States 
retracing to early 2018 levels.  Foreign GDP growth increases to 3 .2 percent by the end of 2020, 
with the level of foreign GDP about 1 percent above the baseline.  The broad real dollar 
depreciates 3 percent because of some reversal of flight -to-safety flows.  
Stronger global confidence and looser financial conditions, coupled with a weaker dollar, 
boost U.S. economic activity.  U.S. GDP expands, on average, in the second half of 2019 and 
2020 at an annual rate of 2. 9 percent, 0. 7 percentage point more than in the baseline.  Higher 
import prices and heightened resource pressures cause core PCE price inflation to reach 
2.2 percent by the end of this year.  The federal funds rate rises more quickly than in the 
baseline.  
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS  
As shown in the “Alternative Model  Forecast s” exhibit , the FRB/US model project s real 
GDP growth to slow from 3 percent in 2018 to 1½  percent in 2019 before hovering slightly 
below 1¾  percent thereafter .7  Compare d with the previous Tealbook, the forecast of real GDP 
growth is revised up by slightly more than 0.3 percentage point, on average, primarily reflecting 
the change in the policy rule.  The projected deceleration in real GDP mainly reflects the 
projection that co nsumption  growth  falls back from what the model perceives as unusually 
strong readings in recent years.  The model could not explain those positive surprise s based on 
fundamentals (wealth and income) and hence does not carry that strength forward in the 
projection , but it instead has consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend.  The 
model’s assessment that asset prices (equity and property wealth) are currently above normal 
valuations and thus will fall or decelerate markedly over the next year  also contributes to the 
weakening in consumption growth through the wealth channel.  The model forecas ts the output 
gap to fall from 1.8 percent at the end of 2018 to a bit more than  ½ percent at the end of 2021.  
The unemployment rate rises from 4.1 perc ent in 2019 to 4.5  percent at the end of 2021, below 
its estimate of the nat ural rate of 4.9  percent.  Core inflation increases from 1.6  percent in 2019 
to 2.0  percent in 2020 and 2021.  
7 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projection s for variables from the  U.S. government 
sector, foreign real GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar and oil prices .

The EDO model proje cts that real GDP will  grow 2.1 percent in 2019, 2.1 percent in 
2020, and 2.3  percent in 2021, roughly 0.1 percentage point, on average, below its estimate of 
potential growth.  In contrast to both the staff and the FRB/US projection s, the EDO model ’s 
concept of the output gap includes a contribution from the gap between actual and potential 
capital stock s.  The model views the current capital stock to be below potential and hence 
estimates that the output gap is slightly negative this quarter.   The output gap is then pr ojected to 
decline to negative 0.4  percent by the end of the 2021.   The EDO model’s projection of below -
potential real GDP growth is driven by the slow fading of favorable risk premium shocks —the 
main fundamental driver of aggregate demand  in the model —and the waning  effects of the 
current accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Core inflation hovers slightly above the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective after 2019.  For a number of years, wages have been below the 
level consistent with the model’s wage Phillips curve, holding down marginal costs and 
depressing inflation over that period.  The model expects these wage shocks to fade gradually, 
which offsets the downward pressure from decreasing resource utilization on the trajectory for 
inflation.

 FRB/US and EDO Forecast Errors  
This discussion reports real -time forecast errors for the FRB/US and EDO models over the past 
four years and compares them with the errors in the judgmental Tealbook projection.  
The figure reports the point forecasts and 70 percent confidence intervals of  the Tealbook 
projection and of the FRB/US and EDO model projections of real GDP growth, the 
unemployment rate, and total and core PCE  price  inflation for 201 5 through 2018 .  Unlike the 
box “Tealbook Forecast Errors:  An Update through 2018” in the Domesti c Economic 
Developments and Outlook section,  this discussion focuses solely on forecasts for the fourth 
quarter that were made as of the April Tealbook of the same year.  
In the figure, the gray bars represent the currently published data, the purple s quares and 
whisker bands show the forecasts and 70 percent confidence intervals for FRB/US, the  blue 
circles and whisker bands show the counterparts for EDO, and the green triangles and whisker 
bands show the counterparts for the judgmental Tealbook foreca sts.1

The FRB/US and EDO forecast errors are, on average, somewhat larger than the Tealbook 
forecast errors  over the past four years , and neither model uniformly  outperforms  the other 
one in forecasting.  Both models underpredicted real GDP growth and over predicted the 
unemployment rate in 2018, with FRB/US having the largest error for GDP growth and EDO 
having the largest error for the unemployment rate.   In comparison, the Tealbook forecast  
slightly  underpredicted both real GDP growth and the unemployment  rate in 2018.  
The errors made by the FRB/US and EDO models  in forecasting real GDP growth were 
particularly large in 2018.  In the case of FRB/US, realized real GDP growth is even located above 
the 70  percent real -time confidence interval around the model  forecast , as indicated by the 
purple whisker bands.  GDP growth in 2018 was boosted by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs 
Act.  The EDO and FRB/US models , however,  have no or only limited ability to consider such 
special factors.  For instance, while the FRB/US forecast conditions on the staff assumption s for 
fiscal policy variables such as government spending and average tax rates, changes in future 
taxes have only small effects on spending due to the backward -looking expectations assumed 
in the model .2  Another factor contributing to the large forecast error in FRB/US was the 
model’s estimate that consumption at the time of the forecast was above its trend.  As a result, 
the model  predicted counterfactually weak consumption growth in order to close th e gap 
between actual and trend consumption over the medium term.  
FRB/US did well in forecasting both core and total PCE price inflation from 2015 through 2018.  
Its root mean squared errors for total and core inflation are 0.1  percentage point and 
0.2 perc entage point  smaller , respectively, than those of the EDO projection and comparable to 
those of the Tealbook projection.  That said, both EDO and FRB/US viewed inflation as having 
been surprisingly weak in 2017 and 2018 and to a greater extent than the jud gmental projection.  
It is notable that the two models made forecast errors for total and core PCE  price  inflation  
close to the lower bounds of the 70 percent confidence intervals.  
Over a longer period  (not shown) , from 2008 through 2018, the  judgmental  Tealbook forecast 
performed better than the FRB/US forecast.3  The root mean squared forecast errors associated 
with GDP growth and the unemployment rate are  each  35 percent larger , on average,  in the 
FRB/US projection, while those associated with total and core PCE  price  inflation are , 
respectively , 15 percent and 47 percent larger.   
Over that  same period, i f we instead look at forecasts made in April for the subsequent year —
that is, a forecast horizon of nearly seven quarters —FRB/US did as well as the Tealbook 
projection in predicting real GDP growth.  However, the root mean squared forecast errors 
associated with the unemployment rate and total  and core  PCE price inflation are larger in the 
FRB/US projection.  
2 The FRB/US forecast was also conditioned on the judgmental  projections for foreign real  GDP growth, 
foreign inflation, and the paths of the U.S. dollar and oil prices.   The federal funds rate was  governed by the 
same policy rule as in the staff projection.  
3 The EDO forecast errors are not available over this longer period .

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary  Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  Starting in this Tealbook, the staff is constructing its 
baseline projection using a new conditional attenuated  rule that responds less strongly to 
the output gap than does the inertial Taylor (1999) rule used in previous Tealbooks.1  
This change in the baseline rule result s in a substantially and persistently lower trajectory 
for the federal funds rate over the medium term, along with a higher level of GDP , 
compared with  the March Tealbook.  R eflecting weak er-than-expected  incoming data as 
well as a change to the staff’s  assumption for underlying inflation over the medium term, 
projected inflation is lower  than in the March Tealbook.  In a special exhibit, we use the 
FRB/US model to separate the effects of adopting the new baseline policy rule from the effects of other changes in the staff’s projection.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
the Taylor  (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible price -level targeting  (FPLT ) 
rule.2  These near -term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation , shown in the middle panels.3  The top and middle 
panel s also  provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate. 
1 The box “A New Conditional Baseline Policy Rule” in the Domestic Economic Developments 
and Outlook section of this Tealbook A describes the new rule. 
2 Given that the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule is no longer the staff baseline rule, 
starting with this Tealbook, our exhibits report values f or the former rule in place of values for the (non -
inertial) Taylor (1999) rule.  T he appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on the se 
simple policy rules .  Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules 
examined here use intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the 
longer run.  
3 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook bas eline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection of the output gap.

 •With the exception of the first-difference rule, the prescriptions of the policy
rules are lower t han in the March Tealbook, mostly reflecting the downward
revision to projected inflation in the current and next quarter.
•The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule prescribes higher policy rates than the
Tealbook baseline, because it responds more strongly to the positive outputgap than the conditional attenuated rule now underlying the Tealbook baselineprojection.
•The Taylor  (1993) rule , which does  not feature an interest rate  smoothing
term, prescribe s higher policy r ates than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule.
•The first -difference rule, which responds to the change in the expected output
gap, prescribes a slightly higher federal funds rate in the current and next
quarter  than in the March  Tealbook because of a slightly faster pr ojected rise
in the output gap.
•The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the core PCE
price index of 2.6 percent  since the end of 2011, prescribes an immediate
decrease in the federal funds rate and a further decline to less tha n 2 percent in
the third quarter of 2019.
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimates of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate ( r*) generated under two baselines:  the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March  2019 
Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP).4  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US 
model are used to generate an estimate of r *.  This concept of r *, labeled “FRB/US r*,” 
corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12- quarter 
4 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP res ponses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021 (the 
final year reported in the March 2019 SEP), the  economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth 
and monotonic wa y.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the 
SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP es timate of its longer -run value.

 period starting in the current quarter, would bring the output gap to zero in the final 
quarter of that period.  This concept of r*  is a summary of the projected underlying 
strength of the real economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate. 
• The current value of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* , at 2.02 percent,  is 
63 basis points lower than its estimate for the same quarter based on the March  Tealbook projection.  This decrease occurs because the output gap in 
the current baseline has not been revised up as much as would be implied solely by the more accommodative policy rate path, as discussed in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section of this Tealbook.  Consequently , the staff’s forecast implicitly contains less underlying strength 
than in the March Tealbook, which r esults in a lower FRB/US r* .   
• At 0.91 percent , the corresponding March SEP -consistent FRB/US r*  remains  
significantly lower than the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* .  The difference 
stems from the fact that the SEP -consistent projection has output exceeding  
potential by a smaller amount  over the medium term than does the current  
Tealbook forecast , while the path s for the real federal funds rate are similar in 
both projections.  The March 2019 SEP -consistent FRB/US r*  is 
¾ percentage point lower than its estimate for the same quarter  based on the 
December 2018 SEP  (not shown).
5  As with the staff forecast, this downward 
revision reflects less underlying strength in the economy than previously projected.  In particular, between the December and the March SEP rounds, the median projected unemployment rate through 2021 edged up even though the median projected federal funds rate declined ½ percentage point.   
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline and results from dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.  The simulations for each rule are carried out under 
                                                 
5 For comparison, the cumulative decrease in the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r*  since the 
December Tealbook is almost 1¼  percentage points.

 the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and t hat 
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that 
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy.  Compared with the previous Tealbook, all of the policy rules prescribe lower paths for the federal funds rate , reflecting the 
reduced underlying strength in the staff’s forecast mentioned earlier .   
•The new policy rule used to construct the Tealbook baseline calls for only asingle  ¼ percentage point increase in the federal funds rate in coming years,
leaving the policy rate almost 1½ percentage points lower by the end of 2021
than in the March Tealbook.  The  inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, which embodies
the same degree of inertia as the new  Tealbook baseline rule but responds
more strongly to the positive output gap, calls for the federal funds rate to
increase at a faster pace and to reach 3½  percent in at the end of 2020, after
which it remain s above the Tealbook baseline path for an extended period of
time.  Inflation is lower , and the real 10- year Treasury yield is  higher, than
their corresponding values in the Tealbook projection.  The lessaccommodative monetary conditions also produce an unemployment rate that ,
unlike in the Tealbook baseline,  rises  steadily toward  the staff’s estimate of
the natural rate of unemployment.
•Similarly, the  Taylor  (1993) rule calls for significant increases in the federal
funds rate in coming years .  After that, the federal funds rate path prescribed
by th is rule is below the corresponding path under the inertial Taylor (1999)
rule but above the path in the Tealbook baseline.  This difference arisesbecause the strength of the output gap response in the Taylor (1993) rule is
weaker than in the inertial Taylor (1 999) rule but stronger than the baseline
rule underlying the staff’s projection.  As a result, the paths for the real
10-year Treasury yield, unemployment rate, and inflation rate implied by the
Taylor (1993) rule are between the corresponding pat hs under the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline.
•The first-difference rule, which reacts to the expected change in the output
gap rather than its level, prescribes gradual increases in the federal funds ratethrough 2020, followed by a sequence of reductions when the output gap is
projected to narrow.  Later in the projection, the federal funds rate path under

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

 this rule drops below the Tealbook baseline path.  This prescription results in 
a similar unemployment rate path, and somewhat hig her inflation, relative to 
the Tealbook baseline.  
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate,  the cumulative shortfall of 
the level of core PCE prices  from  a target path for that price level th at grows 
at an annual rate of 2  percen t from the end of 2011 onward.  Eliminating the 
current 2.6 percent shortfall of the core PCE price index requires inflation to run above 2 percent in coming years.   To achieve this outcome, t he FPLT rule 
calls for keeping the federal funds rate below the current target range until 2025 (not shown).  Because the simulation embeds the assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the 
real 10 -year Treasury rate immediately  drops and remains below the Tealbook 
baseline throughout the period shown.  As a result, the unemployment rate is 
substantially lower than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping to 3 percent  in 2021.  Inflation ex ceeds 2  percent by ¼  percentage 
point, on average, over the next decade before slowly return ing to 2 percent.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under two different  
assumptions about policymakers’ preferences captured by different  specifications of the 
loss function.6  The concept of optimal control employed here assumes policymakers are 
able to commit future policymakers to their plans; such a commitment may  improve 
                                                 
6 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies s ection of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.   In previous Tealbooks, we also 
showed an optimal control simulation that used a loss function assigning only a very small cost to changes 
in the federal funds rate.  Even though that  simulation called for raising the federal funds rate to 10 percent 
in the near term, it led to unemployment rate and inflation outcomes near long -run levels.  Arguably, if 
implemented, such a dramatic policy rate tightening could lead to less benign outcomes than suggested by 
the FRB/US model.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 economic outcomes.7  Compared with  the previous Tealbook, both optimal control 
simulations produce lower paths for the federal funds rate. 
•The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in which
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s objective  of 2 percent , on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previousvalue.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantlyhigher than the Tealbook baseline path.
8  This strategy is designed to counter
the projected sizable undershooting by the unemployment rate of its naturalrate that  occurs in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with
the equal -weights loss function judge to be costly.  The smaller
unemployment gap generates  only moderately lower inflation because, in the
FRB/US model,  the respons e of inflation to the current level of resource
utilization is small.
•The second  simulation, labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss
function that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from thenatural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but is
otherwise identical to the specification with equal weights.  Under this
strategy, the path for the federal f unds rate is only a bit below the Tealbook
baseline path  and considerably below the path under equal weights throughout
the period shown.  Policymakers choose this more accommodative path forthe policy rate because  their desire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent  is not
tempered by an aversion to the unemployment rate falling below its natural
rate.  T he tighter labor market pushes inflation more promptly to ward
2 percent  than in the case of equal weights.
7 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promis es that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  
8 Because monetary policy actions are assumed to be perfectly understood and fully credible, these 
dramatic changes in the federal funds rate are not disruptive.  In practice, however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate as abruptly as in these simulations, wage and price setters and financial 
market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate tighter monetary policy 
than policymakers envision, leading to less benign macroeconomic outcomes than shown here.

 IMPLICATIONS OF ADOPTI NG THE CONDITIONAL ATTENUATED RULE A ND 
OF OTHER FORECAST REVISIONS  
In the next exhibit, we use the FRB/US model to provide a decomposition of the 
overall revision in the staff’s projection into two parts:  the effects of adopting a new 
baseline policy rule and the effects of other revisions to the forecast .  The exhibit displays 
the current -Tealbook simulation of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule as well as the current and previous Tealbook baseline projections.   
• The March Tealbook baseline projection was constructed using the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule.  Comparing th e March  Tealbook baseline to the simulation 
of the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule under the current Tealbook baseline reveals 
the changes in the staff’s projection that the FRB/US model attribute s to 
revisions other than the adoption of the new baseline policy rule. 
• In the current Tealbook inertial Taylor  (1999) rule simulation, the 
unemployment rate is significantly higher than in the March Tealbook 
baseline and rises steadily over the next few years , reflecting lower underlying 
economic strength  in the projection.  In addition, inflation is substantially and 
persistently lower than in the March Tealbook baseline because of  the staff’s 
downward revision of underlying inflation.
9  In response to these revisions, 
the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule prescribes a lower path for the federal funds 
rate than it did in the previous Tealbook.   
• Comparing the simulation of the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule to the current 
Tealbook baseline reveals how, in the FRB/US model, th e introduction of the 
conditional attenuated policy rule affects the policy rate pat h and 
macroeconomic outcomes holding constant the economic projection. 
• The new baseline policy rule responds less strongly to the projected 
overshooting of potential output over the next several years than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule.  Accordingly, it prescribes a substantially lower federal 
funds rat e path than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule for an extended period of 
                                                 
9 The immediate, significant decline in inflation depends in part on the assumption that price and 
wage setters perfectly anticipate and understand the effects of lower underlying inflation and of changes in 
the federal funds rate path , and that they factor these conditions into today’s price - and wage -setting 
decisions.

 time.  Real  10-year Treasury yields  are up to ½ percentage point lower in 
coming years than under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  The additional policy 
accommodation produces a path of the unemployment rate that i s substantially 
lower than under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  It also produces a path for 
inflation that is little changed from the March Tealbook despite the staff ’s 
assum ption of weaker underlying inflation. 
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations ” and optimal control 
simulations  shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment.”

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the 
Tealbook baseline projection .1  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy 
for quarter t;  for quarter s prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the 
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand- side variables of the first four rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four- quarter core PCE price inflatio n for the current

and Outlook section of this Tealbook A describes the new conditional baseline rule.

  quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, 
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price- level targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables 
include an unemployment rate gap and  a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is d efined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡∗, 
which currently stands at 4.6 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference 
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 
2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently, 
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate. 
Simp
le Rules  
 
The first rule  in the table was studied by Taylor (1993).  T he inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time compared with  the 
Taylor (1993) rule .  The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap, like the 
FPLT  rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .2  The conditional 
attenuate d rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but places a coefficient of α  
on the output gap that is conditional on economic conditions; in the current Tealbook projection, 
α is set to 0.2.  Where applicable, t he intercepts of the simple rul es, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and 
chosen so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and an 
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking a s given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are s hown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown

 and then conditioned on their simulated lagged fe deral funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of  
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r* ” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
3  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations— that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined  solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline p rojection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r* .  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economi c projection,  the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB /US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption tha t market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

  COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕=� 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉𝑇𝑇
𝝉𝝉=𝟎𝟎�𝜆𝜆𝜋𝜋 (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃−𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)𝟐𝟐+𝜆𝜆𝑢𝑢,𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏(𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+𝜏𝜏)𝟐𝟐+𝜆𝜆𝐿𝐿(𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉−𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡+𝝉𝝉−𝟏𝟏 )𝟐𝟐�. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two 
specifications.  
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The optimal control policy and associated outc omes depend on the relative (rather than the 
absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject 
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’  future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.

2. Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.
3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.
4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial
offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
