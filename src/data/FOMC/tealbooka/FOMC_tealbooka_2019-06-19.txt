Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The tenor of the incoming information on economic activity, on balance, has 
become somewhat more downbeat of  late.  In particular, business  fixed investment 
appears to have sta lled in the second quarter, residential inve stment and manufacturing 
output have posted outright declin es so far this year, and the May reading on job growth 
was weak.  Moreover, amid height ened concerns about trade tensi ons and slowing global 
growth, the dollar is  stronger, and interes t rates, equity pric es, and longer-term profit 
expectations have moved lower .  To be sure, not all of the news  has been negative:  GDP 
growth in the first quarter sur prised us to the upside, the une mployment rate has moved 
lower, and consumer spending grow th appears to be on track to p ost a solid gain 
following a weak first quarter .  Even so, we now project that G DP growth will slow from 
a pace of 2½ percent at an annual rate in the first half of thi s year to 1¾ percent in the 
second half.  Our forecast for the second half of 2019 is ½ percentage point below the 
previous Tealbook forecast.   
Many of the same factors that l ed us to revise down our near-term projection have 
also led us to revise down our medium-term projection a little.   We now expect GDP to 
rise 2 percent next year and 1¾ pe rcent the year after.1  By the end of 2021, we project 
the output gap will be 2 percent, close to its level at the end  of 2018 and ½ percentage 
point narrower than in the Ap ril Tealbook.  We now expect the u nemployment rate to be 
3.7 percent over the medium term; previously, we expected it to  edge down to 
3.5 percent.   
Incoming price data are consiste nt with our view that the weak readings on core 
price inflation earlier this y ear are likely to prove transitory, and, thus, we still expect the 
12-month change in core PCE pr ices to edge up from 1.6 percent in April to 1.8 percent
by the end of this year.  For the me dium term, we continue to p roject core inflation to
edge up to 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, t he same as in the April Tealbook.  Total PCE
1 Our projection includes the eff ects of all tariffs implemented  to date.  We expect that by the end 
of 2021, the cumulative direct e ffect of the tariffs enacted si nce the beginning of 20 18 will reduce the level 
of real GDP by about ¼ percent a nd will increase the level of c ore PCE prices by ab out ¼ percent.  As 
noted in the “Key Background Fact ors” discussion later in this section, we have not adj usted our forecast to 
reflect the direct effects of possible new tariffs on imports f rom Mexico.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for GDP growth is a little below the projections from both the Survey of 
Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus in 2019, but it is nearly  ½ percentage 
point higher than the Blue Chip in 2020.  Correspondingly, the staff’s unemployment rate forecast is 
a little above  the SPF and Blue Chip in 2019 ; the staff forecast is the same as the Blue Chip forecast   
in 2020.   
With regard to inflation, the staff’s forecast of CPI inflation is a bit lower than outside forecast ers 
in 2019 and a bit higher in 2020.  The staff’s projection of total PCE price inflation is lower than the 
SPF in 2019; the staff and the SPF  both  have total PCE price inflation at 1.9  percent  in 2020 .  For core 
PCE price inflation, the staff is 0.1  perc entage point above the SPF in 2019 and 0.1  percentage point 
below the SPF in 2020.   
Please note that the Blue Chip data are embargoed until June 10 . 
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includes in put 
from  about 50  panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 pa nelists contribute to both 
surveys.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the March  FOMC meeting.  The following table compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the March  Tealbook.  
The staff ’s projection is conditioned on a substantially lower path for the federal funds rate 
than in March, a reflection of the new policy rule that w e incorporated in the April Tealbook.  
In isolation,  that lower funds rate path would have led us to strengthen our  economic 
projection  materially .  However, notwithstanding the upward surprise to published first -
quarter GDP growth,  the incoming data o n spending, income, and wealth have all been 
below our expectations  on balance ; the recent movements in  equity prices, the dollar, and 
foreign economic growth point to a  somewhat  weaker outlook as well.   On net, our 
projection for real GDP growth is just a  little stronger than in the  March Tealbook.  
Moreover, i n assessing resource utilization, we discounted the strong GDP growth reading in 
the first quarter, and, as a result, the output gap flattens out at a slightly lower level —and 
the unemployment rate a t a slightly higher level —than in March . 
Our forecast for inflation is revised a little lower from the March Tealbook  projection .  In the 
near term, the revision reflects surprisingly soft incoming inflation data, and further out, it 
reflects the small downward revision we made in April to our estimate of underlying 
inflation.  Accordingly, core PCE inflation is now projected to be a bit below 2 percent 
throughout  the medium term.

 price inflation is forecast to r un below core inflation this ye ar and to move in line with 
core inflation in the ne xt couple of years. 
Our baseline projection incorporates our estimate of both the d irect effects of 
recently implemented tariffs and t he effects of trade tensions that feed through to changes 
in the stock market, expectati ons about future profits, and oth er financial measures.  
Nevertheless, the recent softne ss in business investment and ma nufacturing production, 
along with the increased volatilit y in financial markets and th e recent flatness in the yield 
curve, could be signs that heightened uncertainty about trade t ensions will have a more 
adverse effect on the U.S. econom y than we have assumed.  Indee d, as discussed in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section, we  have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks 
around our outlook to the downside.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
The baseline policy rule calls for the federal funds rate to remain at
2.4 percent in coming quarte rs before edging up to 2.6 percent by the end of
2021, about unchanged since the April Tealbook.  By contrast, m arket quotes
and surveys suggest that financial market participants are anti cipating a
federal funds rate that is eith er declining or flat over the pr ojection period.
Our assumptions for the SOMA portfolio, which will be detailed in the
Balance Sheet and Income Pr ojections section of Tealbook B, imp ly that
downward pressure on the term prem ium in Treasury yields diminishes over
time.
Other Interest Rates and Equity Prices  
After declining markedly in rec ent weeks, the 10-year Treasury yield is
projected to rise gra dually from the currently prevailing level  of 2.1 percent to
3.1 percent by the end of 2021.  We pro ject that the term premi um will rise
over the forecast period toward its long-run value—albeit to a slightly lower
level than in the April Teal book—reflecting our assumption that  the recent
decline in the term premium is  mostly transitor y.  The path for  the 10-year
Treasury yield is, on average, 14 ba sis points lower than we as sumed in the
previous Tealbook.

   The projected triple-B corporate bond yield and 30-year fixed mortgage rate 
have declined less than the 10-ye ar Treasury yie ld since the Ap ril Tealbook, 
resulting in slightly wider spr eads.  We assume that this widen ing is transitory 
and fades over the next two quart ers.  Thereafter, both rates m ove in tandem 
with the Treasury yield.  
 Stock prices, which declined 2.1 percent since the April Tealbo ok (3.6 percent 
since the FOMC meeting), are exp ected to increase just under 2 percent per 
year after the current quarter .  We pushed up modestly the rate of stock price 
appreciation, as the recent dr op in stock prices and the 10-yea r Treasury yield 
have eased valuation pressures so mewhat.  Overall, we project that the level 
of stock prices at the end of t he projection will be a touch lo wer than in the 
April Tealbook.  Our stock price forecast reflects our assumption that concerns over trade tensions and global growth will gradually abate over the forecast horizon.  
Trade Policy  
 Trade tensions escalated significantly in May ; although we are not assuming 
further escalation, it is a pro minent risk.  The United States increased tariffs 
on $180 billion of imports from Ch ina, from a rate of 10 percen t to 25 percent, 
and China raised tariffs  in retaliation as well.2  Additional tariffs on imports 
from China have been threatened, bu t we have assumed that tarif f rates will 
remain at their current levels through the medium term.  
 More recently, President Trump signaled that he would impose a tariff 
increase of 5 percentage points on imports from Mexico starting  June 10 in 
response to migrant flows across the southern border.  Until si gnificant action 
is taken by Mexican aut horities to limit migrant flows, the tariffs would rise 
each month, reaching 25 percent in October.  As negotiations re garding these 
tariffs are ongoing, we have not bui lt them into our projection.3  If the tariffs 
go into effect, passage of the USMCA trade deal may be more dif ficult; 
                                                 
2 We estimate that these tariff i ncreases will raise core PCE pr ices by 11 basis points and will 
lower the level of real GDP by 10  basis points after two years.  
3 We estimate that a 5 percent tariff on all goods imports from Mexico would raise core PCE 
prices by 6 basis points and lower the level of real GDP by 6 b asis points after two years.

  passage had been looking more lik ely after the removal in mid-M ay of tariffs 
imposed last year on imported metals from Canada and Mexico.   
 In addition, in mid-May, the Administration delayed until mid-N ovember a 
decision on imposing auto tariffs.  Trade developments will lik ely remain a 
focus of market attention and continue to pose a risk to the ec onomic outlook. 
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
 Our outlook for foreign activity is a bit weaker than in the Ap ril Tealbook.  
Positive surprises in some AFEs were more than offset by weaker -than-
expected data in Canada and m ajor EMEs, by the ratcheting up of concerns 
about the escalation of trade tensions, and by the weaker U.S. outlook.  We 
now estimate that foreign GDP  growth picked up only a touch in the first 
quarter to an annual rate of 1.6 pe rcent.  We see growth abroad  gradually 
rising over the remainder of this year and reaching a near-pote ntial pace of 
2.5 percent by the middl e of next year.   
 Since the April Tealbook, the broad nominal dollar has apprecia ted 
1.4 percent.  Looking ahead, we expect the broa d real dollar to appreciate at 
an annual rate of 1.0 percent th rough 2021, as market expectations for the 
federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast.  Due to t he recent decline 
in market expectations for the  federal funds rate, this rate of  appreciation is 
notably steeper than in the April Tealbook.  On net, the broad real dollar at the 
end of 2021 is revised up 2.2 percent. 
 Fiscal Policy  
 We assume that the expansiona ry fiscal policies enacted in 2017  and 2018 will 
continue through the medium term.  In particular, we assume tha t the current 
level of discretionary federal spending will be maintained in r eal terms in 
fiscal years 2020 and 2021.  Realizat ion of this assumption wil l require fiscal 
policymakers to lift the discretionary spending caps for those years, consistent with their actions in recent years; for fiscal 2020, policymakers would need to 
enact legislation this year before the October 1 start of the next fiscal year.

 Under these policy assumptions, the direct fiscal impetus from all levels of
government contributes 0.7 percen tage point to the growth rate in aggregate
demand this year—about the same as in 2018—before tapering to
0.5 percentage point in 2020 and 0.2 pe rcentage point in 2021.
We expect the federal budget defi cit, which was 4 percent of GD P in fiscal
2018, to widen to 4½ percent this fiscal year and to remain steady through theend of the medium term.  Federal  debt held by the public is pro jected to rise
from 78 percent of GDP in fis cal 2018 to 82 percent of GDP by t he end of the
medium term.
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
The spot price of Brent crude  oil has dropped $11 per barrel si nce the April
Tealbook, closing most recently at $61 per barrel.  Prices rose  initially in the
intermeeting period on the announcem ent that the United States would not
renew waivers for sanctions aga inst Iranian oil exports.  Howev er, prices have
tumbled in recent weeks as trade tensions and softer economic d ata
exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth.  As f arther-dated
futures prices have fallen $7 per barrel, our projection for oi l prices has moved
from downward sloping to nearl y flat in the medium term.
Nonfuel commodities prices have decreased 3 percent since the A pril
Tealbook.  Metals prices have fa llen about 7 percent, primarily  because of
heightened trade tensions.  Agricultural prices are down just 1  percent, as
trade-related declin es in soybean and cotton prices have been l argely offset by
rising corn and wheat prices stemm ing from heavy rains that hav e reduced
expected U.S. supply.
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
In recent weeks, many of the incoming signals on economic activ ity have been on 
the softer side, and sentiment in financial markets has deterio rated.  New information for 
the second quarter implied weaker -than-expected business invest ment that was largely 
offset by stronger-than-expected c onsumer spending, leaving sec ond-quarter growth at 
anticipated breach date, when the federal government will no lo nger be able to meet its financial 
obligations, is expected to occu r between late August and the e nd of November.  We assume that 
policymakers will raise the stat utory federal debt limit before  this breach date.

  1.8 percent, down only slightly f rom our April projection.  Looking forward to the rest of 
the year, however, we expect the  weakness in the business secto r to persist and gains in 
consumer spending to step down from their second-quarter rate.  Furthermore, we 
anticipate that the pace of inventory accumulation will slow ov er the rest of the year 
following a period of strong stockbuilding.5  All told, real GDP is projected to increase 
2 percent this year, 0.2 percentage  point less than in the Apri l Tealbook, as the weaker 
outlook for the second half is only partly offset by the surprisingly strong reading in the 
first quarter.6  
 Business fixed investment (BFI) is the most important contributor to the lower outlook for GDP growth in this projection.  After increasing 7 percent in 
2018, BFI rose at just a 3 percent  pace in the first quarter an d is expected to 
edge down, on net, through the end of this year, a markedly slo wer path than 
in the April Tealbook.  The new path reflects disappointing data on orders, shipments, and imports of nondefense capital goods, as well as more 
downbeat business surveys and a s harp deterioration in analysts ’ expectations 
of firms’ longer-term profit grow th.  The increase in tariffs o n imports from 
China should push up the relative  price of capital goods and th e user cost of 
capital, but the negative effect  on overall business investment  is expected to 
be minimal this year.  In contra st, we assume that the groundin g of Boeing’s 
737 MAX aircraft will exert a mo re pronounced restraint (partic ularly in the 
third quarter).  As for investment in structures, we expect wea kness in drilling 
and mining to weigh on growth this year, consistent with our as sumed path for 
oil prices.   
 After having declined in 2018, res idential investment is projec ted to contract 
further in the first half of 2019 before increasing in the second half.  Recent 
signals from the housing sector  have been choppy and somewhat m ixed.  
Single-family permits declined through April, but home sales ha ve trended 
higher and builders’ sentiment  has improved, lik ely reflecting the more than 
1 percentage point decline in mortg age rates from last fall’s peak.  We expect 
                                                 
5 We assume that the grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft will  hold down GDP growth by 
less than 0.1 percentage point t his year and will boost growth next year by the same amount.  (Although the 
overall effect on GDP is small, t here are noticeable effects on  some components of spending.) 
6 It is worth noting that GDI has been notably weaker than GDP.  Over the past four quarters, GDI 
rose only 1.9 percent, more than  1 percentage po int less than G DP.  Any difference between these figures 
reflects measurement error in the two indicators.

 low mortgage rates to boost residential investment in the second half of the 
year.  
Manufacturing production fell in three of the first four months  of 2019, and
the data in hand suggest that it only ticked up last month.  We now expect
factory output to decline about 2 percent at an annual rate in the second
quarter, similar to the decrease  posted in the first quarter an d a notable change
from the modest gain project ed in the April Tealbook.  Although  lower output
for motor vehicles and aircraft  has been an important source of  weakness, the
recent declines for manufacturing have been broadly based.  Mea sures of new
orders from the national and regional surveys of manufacturers have also
turned down recently and suggest that output will remain soft in the coming
months.
In contrast to the weakness in ot her segments of the economy, c onsumer
spending has picked up since earl ier in the year, and the most recent readings
for retail sales and motor vehicle sales have surprised us to t he upside.7
Looking ahead, we project that favorable sentim
ent and expected  gains in
labor income should continue to support spending, although our projection is
tempered somewhat in response to a downward revision to persona l income
data for the fourth quarter of l ast year.  All told, we expect PCE to increase
about 3 percent in the second qua rter and a little under 2½ per cent in the
second half of the year.
Net exports are expected to provi de a small boost to GDP growth  over the first
half, in part because imports have been restrained relative to fundamentals.  Inthe first quarter, net exports a dded 1 percentage point to GDP growth, about
0.4 percentage point more than exp ected in the April Tealbook, as exports
surprised to the upside.  In April, imports fell, with large de clines for capital
and consumer goods categories, a nd we now expect that net expor ts will
7 A preliminary, and noisy, measure of consumer spending using c redit and debit card transactions 
provided by First Data fell ba ck sharply in May.  We are still gaining experience with t hese data, which can 
revise substantially; moreover, the May reading was driven by u nusually large declines in a few spending 
categories, raising the possibility of underlying data-quality issues.  Thus, we have for now taken only a 
little signal from this drop and continue to estimate that retail spending rose modestly last month.  We will 
have a better read on May retail sales with the Census Bureau’s  official data release on June 14, after the 
Tealbook has closed but before the June FOMC meeting.

  subtract 0.5 percentage point f rom GDP growth in the second qua rter, about 
0.3 percentage point less of a drag than in the April Tealbook.   However, 
Boeing 737 MAX aircraft delivery del ays will restrain export gr owth in the 
third quarter, and we expect net e xports to have a neutral effe ct on real GDP 
growth in the second half of the year, about 0.2 percentage point weaker than 
in the previous projection.  
 We project that the contributi on of government purchases to real GDP growth 
will step down from 0.6 percentage point in the first half of t he year to 
0.2 percentage point in the second h alf.  This contour largely reflects a surge 
in infrastructure investment by s tate and local governments in the first four 
months of the year that is exp ected to partially unwind over the remainder of 
the year.    
After having advanced 3 percent last year, GDP is projected to grow 2 percent 
this year and next before ste pping down to 1¾ percent in 2021; this gradual deceleration 
in GDP reflects both the lagged effects of past removal of mone tary accommodation and 
the waning effects of fiscal pol icy impetus.  This outlook for growth is lower than in the 
April Tealbook, as we expect the  negative effects from concerns  about trade policy and 
the global outlook to diminish only gradually. 
 On average, GDP growth is projected to run in lin e with potenti al after this 
year, leaving the outpu t gap fairly flat over this period.  By the end of 2021, 
GDP exceeds its potential level by 2 percent—about ½ percentage  point less 
than in the April Tealbook but still indicative of a very tight  economy. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The labor market has continued to tighten so far this year but at a slower pace 
than last year.  Job gains have  been solid, on average, the une mployment rate has moved 
lower, and the employment-to- population ratio has been unchanged, on net, from late last 
year. 
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose 224,000 in April and 75,000 last month.  On average, these readings are a lit tle lower than what we expected in the April 
Tealbook but still well above  the gains (85,000 to 115,000) that we estimate

  are needed to keep labor  utilization constant.8  Over the first five months of 
the year, payroll gains averaged 164,000 per month, down substa ntially from 
their strong pace in 2018.  Given the projected slowing in aggr egate demand 
growth in coming quarters, we expe ct monthly employment gains o f around 
155,000 in the second half.  
o The staff’s measure of private-s ector employment that is derive d from 
microdata from the payroll-pro cessing firm ADP has also decelerated 
markedly relative to its pace la st year and showed a sharp step -down from 
April to May. 
o Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained near hi storically 
low levels, contributing to our decision to take only limited s ignal for our 
near-term outlook from the weak employment gain in May.   
 The unemployment rate moved dow n to 3.6 percent in April and May from 
3.9 percent in the first quarter .  The LFPR also declined, from  63.1 percent in 
the first quarter to 62.8 percent in April and May.  Combining the signal from 
these measures, the employment- to-population ra tio ticked down to 
60.6 percent, and we expect it t o hold steady through the third  quarter, 
0.1 percentage point less than we ha d expected in the April Tea lbook.  The 
unemployment rate is expected  to edge up to 3.7 percent next qu arter. 
In the medium term, we expect the  labor market to remain tight.   However, in 
contrast with recent Tealbooks, we expect essentially no furthe r tightening from the 
middle of this year through t he end of 2021.  This less robust outlook for the labor market 
reflects the downward rev isions to output growth. 
 Average monthly total job gain s slow over the projection, from about 
160,000 per month this year  to about 140,000 in 2020 and 100,00 0 in 2021.9  
Payrolls are projected to expand about 10,000 per month more slowly over the 
medium term than in the April Tealbook. 
                                                 
8 This range assumes that the L FPR declines in line with the sta ff’s estimate of its trend.  With an 
unchanged participati on rate, the pace of mont hly job gains req uired to keep the unemployment rate 
constant ranges from 115,000 to 145,000.  
9 The payroll forecast is boosted i n the first part  of 2020, but  not for the year as a whole, by the 
government’s hiring of temporary census workers.

 We project that the unemployment rate for 2020 and 2021 will be
3.7 percent—nearly 1 per centage point below its natural rate an d
0.2 percentage point above our proj ection in the April Tealbook .
We expect the LFPR to decline grad ually and in line with its tr end beginning
in late 2020.  At the end of  2021, the LFPR is 62.7 percent, 0. 1 percentage
point lower than in the April Tealbook.
Business-sector productivity ros e 2.4 percent ov er the four qua rters ending in
the first quarter of this year, well above the pace we expected  in the April
Tealbook.  However, we have taken little signal from this stron g reading, in
part because some of the strength reflects reported declines in  a volatile
component of business-sector hou rs, and also because even these annual
figures can be quite erratic.  We project productivity growth t o slow to around
1¼ percent per year for the rest  of the medium term.  One of th e alternative
simulations in the Risks and Uncer tainty section explores the i mplications of a
stronger underlying prod uctivity trend (toge ther with a lower n atural rate of
unemployment and a higher LFPR  trend) than we have assumed.
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION
After surprisingly soft monthly readings earlier in the year, c ore PCE prices 
posted a larger gain in April, and w e continue to expect the 12 -month change in core PCE 
prices to move back up over the second half of this year and to  be 1.8 percent for 2019 as 
a whole.  Looking further ahead, we continue to project core PC E inflation to edge up to 
1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, a bit above our estimate of under lying inflation, as the 
boost from a tight labor mar ket is only partly offset by subdue d import price inflation.  
We project headline PCE inflati on to be below core inflation th is year but to move in line 
with core for the rest of the m edium term, reflecting increases  in food prices and a 
lessening of the projected downward pull of oil prices on consu mer energy prices.  
Since the beginning of the year, core PCE inflation has been held down byunusually weak readings for a few  categories.  However, the pac e of monthly
increases picked up in April t o 0.2 percent (from an average pace of less than
0.1 percent in the first quarter), and we expect this higher pa ce to continue
through the near term.  In additi on, the imprint from last year ’s exceptionally
low August reading will soon dr op out of the 12-month window.  As a result,

 core PCE inflation moves up from 1.6 percent in April to 1.8 percent by 
September. 
oTwo alternative inflation measures that are intended to reduce the
influence of idiosyncratic price movements are consistent with our view
that the recent softness in inf lation is trans itory.  The Dalla s Fed’s
trimmed mean measure rose 2.0 perc ent over the 12 months ending  in
April, and a staff model estimat e of what core inflation would have been
had there been no idiosyncratic pric e changes over the past 12 months was
1.8 percent in April.
We expect that the tariffs on imports from China implemented in May will
boost effective import prices t his year, but the upward revisio n to the path of
the dollar and lower commodit y prices should provide a partial offset.10  On
net, we have revised up our pr ojection of 2019 effective im
port price inflation
from 0.9 percent in the previous Tealbook to a moderate 1.5 per cent currently.
Total PCE prices rose 1.5 per cent over the 12 months ending in April, and we
expect this measure of inflation to remain close to this pace t hrough
September as recent declines in crude oil prices feed through t o lower
consumer energy prices.
oWe expect consumer food prices to p artially offset these energy  price
movements.  The 12-month cha nge in food prices was only 0.8 per cent in
April, but, consistent with the rise in futures prices for some  farm
commodities, we expect the cha nge in consumer food prices to in crease to
around 2 percent by the end of  the third quarter.
The most recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-ter m inflation
expectations suggest that these expectations remain reasonably well anchored.
Although TIPS-based measures of lo nger-term inflation compensat ion have
decreased further since the April Tealbook, we attribute much o f this
movement to a narrowing in risk premiums rather than to a decline in inflation
expectations.
10 Published import price indexes exclude tariffs.  However, tari ffs add to the prices that 
purchasers of imports actually pay—that is, effective import prices.

   Incoming data on labor compensa tion indicate that wage growth remains 
moderate.  As in previous projections, we expect compensation growth over the medium 
term to be higher than in recent years, in line with our projec tions of a tight labor market, 
trend price inflation, and  trend productivity growth.  
 Average hourly earnings of emp loyees on private nonfarm payrolls rose 
3.1 percent over the 12 months  ending in May, up from 2.9 perce nt in May 
2018.  
 The April reading of the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker came  in at 
3.6 percent, within the range in which it has moved over the pa st few years. 
 Business-sector compensation p er hour (CPH) rose 1.6 percent over the four 
quarters ending in the first quart er of this year, considerably  less than we had 
expected.  However, this series  is noisy, and we expect CPH gro wth to pick

from the 2017 tax cuts wanes.  
 We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equili brium federal 
funds rate will be 0.5 percent.  The nominal yield on 10-year T reasury 
securities is 3.4 percen t in the longer run.  
o We continue to assume that, in the longer run, fiscal policymak ers will 
eventually start to gradually r educe primary deficits by an amount

 sufficient to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.  We expect this ratio to 
level off at around 105 percent, 20 p ercentage points higher th an 
would have occurred in the absence of the 2017–18 federal tax and 
discretionary spending changes (including our assumption about the 
extension of that spending after the budget legislation expires  this 
year).  We also still assume tha t this 20 percentage point incr ement to 
the debt-to-GDP ratio will push u p the term premium on 10-year 
Treasury yields 50 basis points in the long run. 
GDP growth slows from 1.7 percent in 2021 to 1.4 percent in 202 4, as the
contribution from fiscal policy impetus fades.  The unemployment rate movesup gradually from 3.7 percent at  the end of 2021 toward its ass umed natural
rate in subsequent years.  PCE  price inflation moves up from 1. 9 percent in
2021 to 2.0 percent at the end of 2024.
Given the outlook for inflation a nd resource utilization, the n ominal federal
funds rate remains a little below 2.7 percent from the end of t he medium term
to the end of 2024, and it declines slowly to its long-run valu e of 2.5 percent
thereafter.

 Using New Microdata to Measure Wages and Labor Compensation  
The staff closely monitors a variety of measures of labor compensation, each of which has relative 
advantages in terms of timeliness and comprehensiveness.  Although these measures tend to move in a broadly similar manner over long horizons, they often send different signals over shorter 
periods.  To sharpen our understanding of labor compensation growth, we  have been working with 
microdata from the payroll- processing company ADP to create alternative measures of 
compensation growth that can  complement the official statistics .
1 
The ADP payroll data include linked employer– employee records from firms that hire ADP to 
manage their payrolls.  The ADP data cover roughly 20 percent of private- sector jo bs.2  The records 
include information for each worker on earnings, pay rates, hours worked, other components of total compensation  (such as bonuses ), and some demographic, industry, and geographic 
information.  Federal Reserve staff typically have access t o the data within 10  days of the month’s 
end, comparable to the release schedule of the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS) Employment 
Situation  report.  The ADP data provide a unique combination of accuracy, detail, timeliness, 
and coverage.
3  
In this discus sion  we focus on two measures of compensation derived from the ADP payroll 
microdata.  First, we create a broad measure of compensation per hour (ADP -CPH), in which 
compensation is defined as  base pay (the contractual hourly wage or per- pay-period salary) plus 
tips, commissions, and bonuses.  The inclusion of bonuses makes it  somewhat  comparable to the 
broad BLS-CPH measure from the productivity and costs release.  That said, our measure does not 
cover other benefits .4  Second, we build a measure similar to the Atlanta Fed  Wage Growth Tracker 
(WGT) by following the same workers for 12 months and calculating the median year- over- year 
change in  individuals ’ hourly wages . 
The ADP -CPH and BLS -CPH measures (shown in panel A of figure 1) tended to track each other 
relatively well until the surprisingly low BLS-CPH readings in 2016.  This divergence is at least in part 
due to sharp declines in the growth of employers’ insurance and  retirement contributions  in that 
year, which  are not captured in our ADP measure.  Since 2011, both measures of CPH rose about 
2½ percent per year; both measures show some acceleration since 2017, with the BLS -CPH measure 
averaging a little under 3 percent and the ADP -CPH measure averaging a little above 3 percent .   
Importantly, the ADP wage microdata are considerably more timely than BLS -CPH, which is 
available about one month after the end of the quarter and continues to revise substantially for  
                                                 
1 The ADP confidential worker -level data are protected by strict technical protocols governing access to the 
microdata, and tabulated data are released only after a disclosure review process.  
2 Only firms that hire ADP are included in the data, which may p roduce a sample that is not representative of 
the U.S. workforce.  However, as with the ADP employment measures we have been reporting for over a year, we 
attempt to make our series more representative by weighting the microdata by firm size and industry.  
3 The measures introduced in this discussion are based on data for roughly 20 million workers for quarterly 
changes and 11 million workers for the matched year -over -year growth rates.  
4 The BLS -CPH measure includes employer -provided benefits, such as contr ibutions to health insurance and 
retirement plans, which we have found difficult to account for in the ADP data.  We are in the process of building a series comparable to the BLS measure of average hourly earnings, which is a narrower measure that does not  
include benefits or bonuses.

up to half a year after the end of the quarter.5  The timely and comprehensive nature of the ADP -
CPH series  would have been particularly useful at the end of 2012, for example, when employers 
pulled forward bonus pay because of  the anticipated increase in 2013 income tax  rate s.  The initial 
releases of BLS-CPH for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 did not reflect any 
timing change in compensation  (the blue bars in panel B  of figure 1) .  It was only several months 
later, in mid -2013, that revisions showed BLS-CPH growth had surged in 2012 :Q4 before falling in 
2013 :Q1 (the green bars).  In contrast, the ADP -CPH measure revealed the shift in bonuses in near 
real time (the red bars).  
Measures  of average compensation, like BLS -CPH and BLS Average Hourly Earnings (AHE), have 
some disadvantages:  T hey can be influenced by changes in the composition of employment , and 
they give more weight to high earners.  A more direct measure of wage pressure m ay be the 
change in wages paid to the same workers,  the approach taken by the WGT published by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.   In figure 2 we plot median wage changes from the ADP payroll 
microdata and the WGT.  ADP  hourly wages (including tips and c ommissions) —the red line— have 
tracked the WGT series reasonably well in recent years, though there is a gap earlier in the sample.  
Median individual growth in base pay —the dashed blue line in figure 2 —appears to be remarkably 
5 That is, until tabulations from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages are available to measure the 
near -totality of U .S. payrolls .  In the initial releases, BLS- CPH is estimated using limited information from BLS- AHE 
and various measures of hours.

 stable and smooth, and it runs somewhat below median  ADP hourly wage growth .  The  gap 
between the ADP series and the WGT  may reflect a number of factors, including topcoding in the 
Current Population Survey (CPS, the source data for the WGT), measurement error, and differences  
in earnings and hours definitions between the source data.6 
In fact, the ADP data provide us with direct evidence of measurement error in the individual-level 
CPS reports, though it is unclear how much it contributes to the differences between the ADP - and 
CPS-based time series.  Figure 3 shows part of the distribution of 12 -month wage changes for a 
representative month.  The ADP distribution is heavily bunched around round numbers, corresponding to raises of 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0  percent per year.  In contrast, the CPS distribution is more 
diffuse and shows almost no bunching.
7  We take this dispersion as an indication of measurement 
error in the CPS responses:  Many workers receive round- number  raises , but CPS wage changes are 
calculated from respondent -reported earni ngs and hours levels , so small reporting errors may 
obscure the pattern of round -number raises in the CPS.8  
The results of the staff’s analysis of this new source of compensation data are encouraging, and we are hopeful that these data will improve our understanding of the conditions faced by U.S. 
workers .  Importantly, the data confirm the gradual step -up in compensation growth seen in both 
the BLS series and the WGT over the past several years.  Nonetheless, the work is preliminary.  
Constructing measures of compensation that can be compared to official statistics is daunting, partly because the complexity of compensation makes it difficult to construct equivalent measures.  Looking forward, th e richness of the ADP data provides many further avenues to explore, such as 
creating a measure of average hourly earnings and further analyzing the importance of bunching in wage changes.   
Figure 3 :  Distribution of Wage Changes (March 2015)  
 
                                                 
6 In the CPS, households with earnings above $150,000 per year are shown as earning $150,000 (topcoding) so 
that any changes in those households’ earnings will not be visible.  In addition, earnings are self- reported, leaving 
room for considerable reporting error.  Moreover, the ADP measures have a substantially larger sample size  and 
include workers who ch ange residence, so long as ADP continues to process their payrolls.  
7 The bunching in figure 3 helps explain some features of figure 2.  When the median of a series is at a bunching 
point, moderate changes in the distribution will cause little or no change  in the median .  Thus, median ADP base pay 
hovers at 3 percent (a bunching point) for years, while the CPS series is volatile over the same window.   
8 This reasoning is also consistent with the higher cross- sectional variance in CPS wage growth as well as 
results in the academic literature emphasizing survey response error in questions about income and hours.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Our optimism about growth abroad in the April Tealbook—guarded though it 
was—has been undermined by several factors:  data flow that, on the whole, has been 
disappointing; an abrupt escalation of trade tensions; a markdown to U.S. growth; and the 
resurgence of other risks (Brexit, Italy) .  These developments have roiled markets, 
increased uncertainty, and dimmed the growth outlook for foreign economies.   
At the time of the April Tealbook, we had received some encouraging data from 
China and the euro area.  We had hoped to find confirmation in subsequent data that  
global growth was firming .  However, recent data have disap pointed on balance.  April 
data for China were downbeat, and the recovery from last year’s growth slowdown now seems more tentative, raising questions about prospects for emerging Asia.  In Latin America, Mexico and Brazil continued to languish, surprising us with first -quarter 
contractions.  In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), weaker -than-expected  
Canadian GDP growth  in the first quarter offset  stronger- than-expected growth 
elsewhere.  Indicators for the current quarter suggest that the expected pickup in Canadian growth is in train, but growth in other AFEs is slowing .   
We expect foreign growth to improve somewhat, to an annual rate of 2.2 percent  
this quarter, from a substantially below-potential rate of 1.6 percent in the first.  O ur 
conviction around this pickup is not strong, however, as it comes mainly from  a rebound 
in Latin America.  B eyond the current quarter, w e have total foreign growth edging up 
further as growth rises a bit more  in the emerging market economies (EMEs) , whi le AFE 
growth stabilizes around potential.  We expect the L atin America n recovery to gain 
traction , and emerging Asia ex -China should benefit from an upswing in the high -tech 
cycle, of which we are beginning to see some tentative signs (s ee the box “Accoun ting 
for the Asian Tech Cycle”).     
Relative to the previous Tealbook, we revised down foreign GDP growth  in the 
first half  on weaker- than-expected data from the EMEs described above .  Further out, we 
revised down our forecast a touch, given the mark down in U.S. growth and the recent 
escalation of trade tensions  between the United States and China and Mexico, which led 
to an increase in implemented tariffs and exacerbated  policy uncertainty.

 Accounting for the Asian Tech Cycle  
Global trade weakened markedly at the end of 2018, with particular weakness in the emerging 
market economies (EMEs).  EME exports contracted almost 7 percent at an annual rate in the 
fourth quarter and a further 3½ percent in the first quarter of this year.  Emerging Asia’s tech 
sector has been  especially  weak, with production and export of high -tech products  falling  
substantially in recent quarters .  These developments raise the question of whether the tech 
slowdown has been a driver of the broader slowdown in global trade, perhaps due to supply- side 
factors such as the timing of new product  release s, or whether the tech  slowdown merely  reflects  
either a broader slowdown in global demand  or the effects of recent tariff hikes and trade 
tensions.  This discussion  argues that  slowing  Chinese domestic demand , more than supply -side 
developments or tariffs, was  the primary  driver of recent developments in the Asian tech sector.  
 Highly integrated global supply chains for consumer electronics have  created a correlated pattern 
of production and trade in electronics and software across economies, particularly in emerging Asia , now commonly referred to as the tech cycle.  The tech cycle is increasingly dictated by 
smartphones, for which  sales have generally eclipsed those of other tech products:  G lobal 
smartphone sales were about 1.4 billion units in 2018, compared to 260 million units for personal computers.  This trend is reflected in regional trade patterns, with about half of Asian 
semiconductor exports now directed to China, the final assembler of most mobile phones.  
 Technological advanc es in the semiconductor industry are often viewed as the fundamental 
driver of the tech cycle.  The high rate of obsolescence for new chips leads to relatively short 
product life cycles for high -end electronics.  Upturns in the tech cycle may therefore reflect the 
production and export of components associated with new product releases, which are 
prompted  by innovations in semiconductor and circuit technology.  
 
We first examine the historic al relationship between p roduct releases and high -tech data. 
Specifically, we run country -level regressions of semiconductor inventories, high -tech  production, 
and high -tech  exports on smartphone release date indicators, controlling for trend growth and 
lunar New Year effects .  We find that release dates can help explain the inventory cycle in 
semiconductors.  However, new  releases have little explanatory power for trade and production .

1 This exercise closely follows Benjamin Carton, Joannes Mongardini, and Yiqun Li (2018), “A New 
Smartphone for Every Fifth Person on Earth:  Quantifying the New Tech Cycle,” IMF Working Paper No. 18/22 
(Washington:  International Monetary Fund, January 2 4).  However, their paper  uses non -seasonally adjusted data 
as dependent variables.  While we believe this approach has merits, there are likely seasonal factors influencing 
these d ata beyond smartphone releases; hence,  we use seasonally adjusted data .

What about developments over the past year?  Semiconductor inventories continued to grow in 
2018 (the blue line in figure 1), and the previous analysis suggests that product releases in late 
2018 and early 2019 could partially explain this  trend .  In spite of new releases, however, phone 
production has remained weak.  Figure 2 shows that Chinese phone production (the black line) 
has been in decline since 2017.  This contraction, amid still- robust semiconductor output in 
emerging Asia, including Korea and Singapore (the red and blue lines, respectively), helped drive the run -up in inventories and depressed semiconductor prices (the black line in figure 1), which 
subsequently weighed on trade through 2018.
 
W
hat accounts for the weak ness of  phone production since 2017?  The most notable factor is a 
broad -based slowdown in Chinese demand, likely reflecting in part the authorities’ financial 
deleveraging campaign.  As can be seen in figure 3 , beginning in 2017, Chinese domestic 
consumption slowed for mobile phones, household durables , and autos, with purchases of 
phones showing particular weakness toward the end of last year.  With China accounting for 
about one-third of global smartphone consumption, this falloff in demand has been sufficient to 
drive the downturn in  the regional supply chain.  
W
hat are the prospects  for a recovery in  the high -tech  industry  in 2019?   Data received since the 
April Tealbook show some signs of the tech sector stabilizing.  Chinese mobile phone production picked up in April f or the third successive month.  Likely supported by this strengthen ing in 
demand, Singapore’s tech  exports stepped up in April, and Ko rean semiconductor  exports this 
quarter are up through May.  More generally, after a contraction in high -tech  industrial 
production across emerging Asia in March, data for April have thus far been promising, with 
rebounds in  Korea, Singapore , and Taiwan.  
S
emiconductor equity  prices provide a useful forward -looking indicator of global electronics 
trade. We construct a tech equities indicator by extracting common variation from the stock 
prices of 133 firms in the semicond uctor industry globally.  As can be seen in figure 4 , changes in  
our headline indicator track global semiconductor shipments growth quite closely. 
O
ur tech indicator suggests that  investor sentiment bottomed out at the turn of the year. 
Expectations of recovery are likely driven by a more optimistic growth outlook in China and the 
rollout of 5G networks globally, which should accelerate product releases in 2019 and 2020.  
However, heightened U .S.–Chinese trade tensions , including  U.S. restrictions on business with  
Huawei, drove semiconductor equities down in May and  remain the most prominent downside 
risks to a recovery in the industry.

  Of course, trade policy developments have proved fluid and unpredictable .  In our 
baseline forecast, we are assuming the United States and China reach a “ceasefire” in 
which tariffs are neither rolled back nor increased .  For now, we are also assuming no 
imposition of tariffs on Mexico, although that could well change by June 10, when the 
Administration may implement the first 5 percent tariff hike on imports from that country.  However, it is possible that trade tensions could subside if a U.S. –China trade 
deal, perhaps as early as at the G -20 Leaders ’ Summit later this month , rolls back earlier 
tariff hikes .  Conversely, escalation is also quite possible , with the United States 
imposing tariffs on  the remainder of its imports from China and proceeding with a series 
of tariff hikes on Mexico , prompting retaliation.   We explore both these scenarios in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section. 
Some other key downside risks have also reemerged.  The most prominent are the 
increased probability of a “no deal” Brexit and renewed concerns about the sustainability 
of Italy’s publ ic debt .  And, as mentioned above, our confidence in a Latin American 
recovery is not high, given repeated disappointment over the past few years .     
Against this global backdrop of modest growth and elevated policy uncertainty, 
foreign inflation remained  moderate, and we anticipate it will remain so throughout the 
forecast horizon.  Among the AFEs, t he latest reading s of 12-month core inflation were 
below 1 percent in both the euro area and Japan.  As such, we expect monetary policies in these countries to remain highly accommodative, and we now assume the European Central Bank (ECB) will wait until early 2021 to start lifting its policy rate, two quarters  
later than previously anticipated .  The Reserve Bank of Australia cut its policy rate in 
response to below-target inflation and weak economic growth.  Several  EME central 
banks—including those in India, Malaysia, and the Philippines—also reduced their interest rates , citing  subdued underlying inflation, slowing growth, and heightened 
downside risks in the global economy.     
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro Area .  Following lackluster growth of only 0.8 percent in the second half of 
2018, real GDP rebounded 1.6 percent in the first quarter, 0.2 percentage point higher than our April Tealbook for ecast .  However, t he rebound likely reflects the unwinding 
of some temporary headwinds from last year , and indicators through May, such as 
PMIs, continue to indicate weak underlying momentum, particularly in manufacturing.  Accordingly, we expect GDP growth to slow to a subdued

 1.2 percent in the second quarter and stay around 1 percent the rest of this year.  
Growth should then gradually increase to  1.7 percent in 2021, supported by still-
accommodative monetary policy.  We revised down a touch our forecast for 2020 
because of  the recent increase in global trade tensions , the markdown to U.S. and 
global growth , and renewed concerns over Italian fiscal policy .  The fiscal outlook for 
Italy worsened , as key members of the Italian government  called for  new fiscal 
stimulus  even as  the European Com mission  officially reprimanded Italy for breaching 
EU budgetary rules. 
Core inflation came in at 0.8 percent  in May on a 12-month basis.  W e expect 
headline inflation to be held down in the near term by the recent fall in oil price s, 
before edg ing up to 1.3 percent by 2021, as economic slack  diminishes .  In line with 
this low -inflation environment, a t its June 6 meeting, the ECB said that it ex pected to 
hold policy rates steady at least through the first half of 2020.  W e now assume that 
the ECB will not start raising its deposit rate , currently at negative 0.4 percent, until 
the first quarter of 2021, reaching 0 percent by la te 2021, and will continue 
reinvesting maturing assets well after that.  The ECB also announced details of the 
new quarterly t argeted longer- term refinancing operations program , which will have a 
maturity of two years and entail  an interest rate as low as 10 basis points above the 
ECB deposit rate.  
•United Kingdom.  Real GDP growth picked up from 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter
to 2 percent in the first, 0.5 percentage point higher than our April Tealbook forecast.
Economic activity was supported by robust domestic demand, largely due to
stockpiling by households and businesses ahead of the original Brexit date.  As thisboost unwinds, we forecast growth in the second quarter to slow to 0.7 percent.  Evenso, this projection is slightly  higher than our previous forecast, largely because of
positive surprises in services PMIs , which point to stronger- than-expected domestic
demand.
Brexit -related uncertainty has increased again, following the resignation of Prime
Minister May , who could be replaced by a new Conservative Party leader that favor s
a no- deal Brexit .  As such, we project that growth in the second half of this year will
stay subdued, at 1.2 percent, with uncertainty weighing on economic activity.  Further
out, we assume in our baseline forecast a non-disruptive resolution of Brexit, withuncertainty noticeably reduced  by the end of the year (either by ratifying a Brexit
deal, providing yet another extension, or canceling the Brexit process).  Growth

should  then pick up to 1. 6 percent next year, close to its potential rate.  That said, in 
our view , recent political developments put the risk of a disruptive no -deal Brexit at 
an all -time high.   
Canada .  GDP growth  in the first quarter  remained low at 0.4 percent, 0.6 percentage
point weaker than estimated in the April Tealbook, because of shutdowns  in oil
production and harsh winter weather .  Recent indicators such as monthly GDP for
March and employment for April  are upbeat and consistent with a growth pickup  to
2.1 percent this quarter.  We then expect GDP growth to settle at a near-potential pace
of around 1.7 percent.  Relative to the April Tealbook, the medium -term outlook  is
somewhat  weaker because of  the lower path for oil prices  and the markdown to U.S.
growth .
We expect headline inflation to  settle at the current pace of core inflation of 2  percent
by late 2019 .  The Bank of Canada (B OC) kept its policy rate unchanged at
1.75 percent in its May 29 meeting.  Given the weaker economic outlook, we now
expect that the BOC will wait until late 2020 to resume gradually tightening its policy
stance , two quarters later than previously assumed.
Japan.   Real GDP expanded 2.1 percent in the first quarter, well above our April
Tealbook forecast of 0.3 percent.  That said, private consumption and exports both
declined, and the positive GDP growth mainly reflected plummeti ng imports.  Recent
indicators have been mixed and, on net, suggest real GDP will stagnate this quarter.
Looking through the volatility from the consumption tax hike scheduled for late 2019,
we expect GDP to barely edge up in the second half of the year .  Over the remainder
of the forecast period, we expect GDP growth to be slightly above its potential pace
of 0.7  percent, supported by additional spending related to the  2020 Tokyo Olympics
and very accommodative monetary policy.
The 12 -month changes in total and core CPI picked u p to 0.9 percent and 0.5 percent ,
respectively, in April.   Given the recent decline in oil prices and the yen appreciation ,
we expect inflation to slow a bit over the near  term, but then we expect  it to edge up
to around 1 percent  by the end of 2020 .  With inflation still far lower than the Bank of
Japan’s (BOJ) 2 percent target, we expect the BOJ to keep its deposit rate at negative
0.1 percent throughout the forecast period, while continued asset purchases should
keep the 10-year sovereign  yield around the current target of zero  percent.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
China.  After rebounding to a brisk 7.3 percent in the first quarter fo llowing a broad -
based  slowdown last year, China’s GDP growth is expected to step down to
6.1 percent in the current quarter , 0.5 percentage point lower than in the previous
forecast .  April’s activity indicators disappointed, with industrial production
contracting sharply and retail sales growing at the slowest pace in more than a
decade.  The extent of the softening suggest s that some key areas of the Chinese
economy continue to struggle to gain a solid footing.
We expect the escalation of the trade conflict with the United States since early May
to weigh further on China’s growth outlook, both through direct effects of higher
tariffs on China’s exports  and through indirect effects from  prolonged uncertainty
weighi ng on investment.  Indeed, recent data on manufacturing investment,
particularly for machinery and equipment, have weakened notably .  That said, we
expect policy stimulus to partly offset the drag from heightened trade policy
uncertainty .  All told, we see  growth holding relatively steady at around 6 percent for
the rest of the year before falling to 5.7 percent next year , in line with declining
potential growth.  Compared with the April Tealbook, our forecast is down an
average of 0.2  percentage point over  the forecast period.
Other Emerging Asia.  Real GDP growth slowed a touch to a sub par 2.6 percent in
the first quarter, the fourth consecutive q uarter of below -trend growth.  On balance,
growth was in line with our April  forecast ; a surpris ing contraction in Korea  and a
slowdown in India  were offset by stronger -than-expected growth in Hong Kong .
Available data on PMIs, industrial production, and exports for  the second quarter
suggest that manufacturing, though weak er than expected , is stabi lizing.  We expect
this improvement , together with support from fiscal policy in some countries , to boost
growth to 3.1 percent  in the current quarter and to 3.5 percent  in the second half of
the year.  Our forecast is  down a touch from that in  April, reflecting the weaker -than-
expected incoming data  and spillovers from lower growth in China .
Mexico.   After stagnating in the fourth quarter, real GDP contracted 0.7 percent in the
first.  Household consumption remained weak, and e xternal demand appears to have
been  a drag, with weakness in U.S. manufacturing  weighing on Mexican exports and
export -oriented  services.  However, s ome of the weakness in the export sector
reflected disruptions from labor unrest  that have faded, contributing to a rise in

  manufactu ring exports in April .  As such, we see growth turning  positive in the 
current quarter .  That said,  a downward revision to U.S. manufacturing output and 
increased uncertainty regarding U.S. trade policy toward Mexico  led us to revise 
down  the outlook .  We now see growth limping along at below 2 percent for the rest 
of this year  and then rising  to 2.5 percent by the end of next year .  Moreover, the 
possibility of a further escalation in trade tensions ha s greatly increased the d ownside 
risks to the outlook . 
Downplaying the recent weak pace of growth, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) left its 
policy rate unchanged at 8.25 percent at its May m eeting.  Although headline 
inflation dropped sharply in the first quarter as a result of the fall in energy prices , the 
BOM expr essed concerns that wage inflation has been high and that core inflation has 
been persistently above the 3 percent inflation target .  
 Brazil .  Brazil’s sluggish climb out of its deepest recession on record faltered yet 
again in the first quarter, with the economy contracting 0.6 percent after barely eking 
out positive growth in the fourth  quarter.  Some of the weakness is the result of  
temporary disruptions related to a large dam disaster, and we expect growth to pick 
up some in the current quarter but rema in weak at 1.2 percent.  Plummeting demand 
from neighboring Argentina and a deterioration in confidence and survey indicators , 
amid delays in an important pension reform , point to a slower recovery than we 
anticipated.  We now have  growth reach ing only 2.5 percent by the second half of 
next year , 0.2 percentage point  below that in the April Tealbook .

 Financial Market Developments 
Negative news about international trade tensi ons and, to a lesser extent, soft U.S. 
and foreign economic data increas ed investors’ concerns about d ownside risks to the 
economic outlook and weighed on finan cial markets over the intermeeting period.  
Nominal Treasury yields posted ve ry large declines, and the exp ected path of policy—
whether adjusted for term premiums or not—shifted down consider ably over the period.  
Investors now appear to be put ting substantial weight on a poli cy easing by as early as the 
July meeting.  Equity prices dec lined, on net, and corporate bo nd spreads widened 
appreciably. 
 Nominal Treasury yields fell  37 basis points at both 2- and 10- year maturities.  
Partly reflecting the moves in nominal yields, inflation compen sation 
narrowed 18 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively, for the 5-year and 
the 5-to-10-year horizons. 
 A straight read of OIS forward rates suggests that investors ex pect the federal 
funds rate to decrease about 60 ba sis points by the end of this  year and an 
additional 30 basis points in 2020.  A staff model that adjusts  for term 
premiums indicates a 30 basis point decline in the rate by year -end 2019 and a 
modest additional decline next ye ar.  Both the adjusted and una djusted paths 
shifted down considerably over the intermeeting period.   
 On net over the period, the S&P 500 index decreased 3.5 percent.  Stock 
prices declined notably through the end of May but subsequently  rose 
somewhat, reflecting in part FO MC communications that were perc eived to 
increase the likelihood of a n ear-term policy easing.  Option-implied volatility Outside of this box, the Financial  Market Developments section of the Tealbook is 
based on information that was av ailable by 5:00 p.m. EDT on June 6.  On June 7, at 
8:30 a.m. EDT, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics published its Emp loyment Situation 
Report for May 2019.  The release w as reportedly interpreted by  market participants 
as weaker than expected.  Nomin al yields were down 9 basis poin ts and 5 basis points 
at the 2- and 10-year maturitie s, respectively, in the first 30  minutes of trading 
subsequent to the release.  Equit y index futures were little ch anged on net.

Foreign equity prices and soverei gn yields in the advanced fore ign economies
(AFEs) decreased markedly over the intermeeting period.  The br oad dollar
index rose, with notable apprecia tion of the dollar against the Chinese

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
The large declines in nominal Treasury yields over the intermeeting period were 
driven primarily by negative head lines about trade tensions bet ween the United States 
and two major trading part ners, China and Mexico.1  Softer-than-expected domestic 
economic news also contributed to t he declines.  A relatively w eak preliminary May U.S. 
Markit PMI release appeared t o have had an unusually large negative effect on yields in 
late May, reportedly because it w as interpreted as indicating t hat trade developments had 
begun to affect macroeconomic outco mes.  Nominal yields also dropped in response to 
weaker-than-expected ADP employment data. 
FOMC communications had little  net effect on yields.  Yields ro se modestly 
following the Chair’s May FOMC pr ess conference comments about inflation but, later in 
the period, moved down on FOMC partic ipants’ remarks that repor tedly were seen as 
signaling an increased likeli hood of near-term policy easing.  Five-year and 5-to-10-year 
inflation compensation based on T IPS declined and finished the intermeeting period at 
1.56 percent and 1.83 percent, respectively. 
Based on a straight read of OIS fo rward rates, investors expect  the federal funds 
rate to decline about 60 basis  points by the end of this year—a  40 basis point downward 
revision over the intermeeting peri od.  A staff model that adju sts for term premiums, 
which was about flat for the ne xt two years at the beginning of the period, currently 
projects a 30 basis point decline for the federal funds rate by  year-end 2019 (see the box 
“Revision to the Staff’s Term-P remium-Adjusted Policy Rate Path ”).2  In contrast, the

deciles of their distributions since 1994.   
2 An alternative staff model of t erm premiums, which implies a p olicy path that lies closer to the 
unadjusted path, was discussed in the box “A Macro-Finance Meas ure of Term Premiums in Federal Funds

 Revision  to the Staff’s Term‐ Premium ‐Adjusted  Policy Rate Path 
Forward rate  curves fitted to overnight index  swap (OIS) rates have often been used  as a 
measure of the market’s  expected  path of the policy rate.  Most recently,  such a  “straight read” 
based on OIS  (the blue lines in figure 1) implies expected  federal funds  rates of 1.81 percent  for 
year‐end 2019 and 1.43 percent for year‐ end 2020.   These numbers  stand in contrast to recent  
Blue Chip  survey forecasts  (the yellow diamonds  in figure 1),  which are relatively  flat over the  next 
several years.   The gap  between OIS forward  rates and survey forecasts  suggests  the possibility  
of negative  term premiums  in OIS  markets. 
The staff employs  a variety  of tools to gauge  the magnitude of  these 
premiums.   The measure  
used in previous  Tealbooks  to construct  a term‐premium ‐adjusted policy rate path came  from a 
shadow rate term  structure  model estimated  with historical  OIS rates  and Blue Chip  survey 
forecasts  (the red lines in figure 1).1  The model produces  results consistent  with  an effective  
lower bound  on OIS rates  by specifying  a “shadow federal funds  rate” that is permitted  to move 
freely and allowed to turn negative;  the model‐ implied federal funds  rate is equal to the shadow 
rate when the  shadow rate is above the  lower bound  and is constrained  at the lower  bound 
otherwise.   The previous  version of this model had  been estimated  on a sample  beginning  in 1991 
and ending in 2016.2 
Consistent  with the state of the art in academic  research  and data limitations  at the time, the 
model was  thus effectively  premised  on the assumption  that the dynamics  of the shadow rate  as 
well as the pricing of interest rate risks are  described  by the same set of model parameters  before 
and after the onset of the Global Financial  Crisis.  
However, this  assumption  of structural  stability 
may be called into question  for several reasons:  
 Many macro models  imply that the joint behavior of key macroeconomic  variables  
changes once the policy rate hits the effective  lower bound, as  conventional  monetary  
policy can no longer respond to a chang ing  macroeconomic  outlook.  
 It is not clear that the effects of the unconventional  policy tools used by the Federal 
Reserve are well described by  the same shadow rate model parameters  as those that 
described  the pre‐crisis years. 
 Long‐term trends as  well as the fallout from  the Great Recession  may have caused lasting 
structural  changes (such as a downshift in  ݎ∗).  Indeed, recent staff  research  finds that 
various formal statistical  tests reject the hypothesis  of structural  stability of the shadow 
rate model.3  
                                                 
1 A complementary  measure based on a macro‐finance model was introduced  in the box “A Macro‐Finance 
Measure  of Term Premiums  in Federal  Funds Futures Rates” in the Financial Markets section of the April 2019 
Tealbook  A. 
2 The model is described  in detail in Marcel A. Priebsch (2017), “A Shadow Rate Model of Intermediate ‐Term 
Policy Rate Expectations,”  FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board  of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve System,

In a revised version  of the staff’s shadow rate model, different sets  of model parameters are  used 
to describe  the period before December  2008 and  the period after December  2008.  In other 
words, the revised shadow  rate model has  a structural  break around the time of the onset of the 
Global Financial  Crisis.  Con s equently,  the estimated  parameters  of the model that  are relevant 
for yield dynamics  in recent years are based on a substantially  shorter sample (December 2008 to 
March 2019)  than the previous  model.  In  the staff’s best judgement,  the benefit  of the revised 
model in terms of  topicality  now outweighs  the greater estimation  uncertainty  associated  with a 
shorter sample period.4 
The green lines in  figure 1 show the implied path for the federal funds  rate from  the revised 
model.  The revised model suggests  a substantially  flatter federal funds  rate path  over the  next 
several years  than the unadjusted  path.  In contrast,  the previous  model indicates  further gradual 
rate increases  over  the medium term.  Put differently, the  revised model currently  implies less 
negative term premiums  compared  with
 the previous  model.  Longer ‐range expectations  from 
the revised model—that  is, expectations  for the average  federal funds  rate 5 to  10 years ahead—
have also been notably lower than  those  from the previous  model in  recent years (figure 2).  
Nevertheless,  the 
expectations  implied by both models share certain qualitative features  such  as 
the prominent increase in  long‐term expectations  after the U.S. presidential  election in late 2016, 
which was not mirrored in  long‐range Blue  Chip survey forecasts.  That said, the  revised model 
better captures  the preceding  decline in long‐range survey  forecasts  in 2015 and 2016 and the 
lower level of  those forecasts  seen since.  
Going forward,  the staff will show  the term‐premium ‐adjusted federal  funds 
rate path based  on 
the revised model.  In  light of the still‐ limited post‐2008 data,  the staff will monitor  the model’s 
output closely and make further 
updates as judged appropriate.    
4 The revised version also makes a number of technical  adjustments  to the specification  of the model.  Most 
importantly,  to account for the potential  difficulty in forecasting  the path of the federal funds  rate in a new 
interest  rate environment,  the revised model uses a more sparse cross section of Blue Chip survey forecast 
horizons in it

 Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey, conducted through May 24, continued to suggest a 
flat policy path through the t hird quarter of 2020.  Options prices (unadjusted for term 
premiums) suggest that investors have attached better-than-even  odds of a rate cut by the 
July 2019 meeting. 
Reflecting the sharper downward tilt of the unadjusted OIS-implied policy path, 
the near-term forward spread on T reasury securities—defined as the difference between 
the six-quarter-ahead forward r ate and the three-month Treasury  bill yield—has moved 
down further since the May FOMC meeting and now stands at negative 58 basis points, 
its lowest level since the  beginning of 2008.  The spread betwe en 10-year and three-
month Treasury yields fell to n egative 13 basis points, a level it last reached in early 
2007.  Both spreads are in the botto m decile of their respectiv e distributions since 1971.3  
The current low levels of these  spreads suggest, in a reduced-f orm analysis, that the 
probability that the United State s will enter a recession over the next four quarters is 
roughly 70 percent.  To be sure, s uch probabilities should be i nterpreted with caution, 
given the long sample periods ove r which the models are estimat ed and secular trends (in 
particular, declining term premiu ms) that may materially affect  predictions.4   
The S&P 500 index fell 3.5 percent,  on net, over the intermeeti ng period, 
primarily in response to the esc alation of trade tensions with China.  Although stock price 
declines were fairly broad base d, firms with high China exposur e and those in cyclical 
sectors—such as energy, inform ation technology, consumer discre tionary, 
communication services, and banks —posted particularly large losses.  The announcement 
of possible additional tariffs on Mexican imports also contribu ted temporarily to stock 
price declines, particularly for  the automotive sector.  Later in the period, stock prices 
regained some of their losses amid an easing of trade tensions with Mexico and 
expectations of a more accommodative stance of policy.  On net,  one-month option-
implied volatility on the S&P 500 i ndex (the VIX) increased to 16 percent, just below the 
median of its historical range .  During the period, the VIX mov ed as high as 21 percent 
but remained well below the 36 percent peak reached in December  2018. 
3 The near-term forward spread has  been shown to be a bit more i nformative in terms of predicting 
a transition to recession in the subsequent four quarters, comp ared with some popular measures such as the 
spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields. 
4 Model-based recession probability  estimates, along with estima tes derived from stochastic 
simulations around the staff baseline forecast and the FRB/US m odel forecast, are also shown in the Risks 
and Uncertainty section.

 Spreads on investment-grade and s peculative-grade corporate bon ds over 
comparable-maturity Treasury yi elds widened 20 basis points and 47 basis points, 
respectively.  Even so, spreads  on both types of corporate bonds are currently near the 
midpoints of their respec tive historical ranges. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Global risky asset prices fell sharply and the prices of safe-h aven assets increased 
as risk sentiment turned decide dly negative over the intermeeti ng period.  The ongoing 
trade policy dispute between the  United States and China, the p rospect of additional 
tariffs on imports from Mexico, and soft economic data weighed on investor confidence.  
Developments in Europe, includi ng an increase in the probabilit y of a “no deal” Brexit, a 
worsening of the fiscal situation in Italy, and stress in the euro-area banking sector, also 
contributed to the decline in risk sentiment.  
Equity indexes in AFEs and emerg ing market economies (EMEs) fell.  Increased 
trade uncertainty and trade rest rictions placed on the Chinese technology sector had a 
strong effect on Asian equity prices—the Hong Kong and Shanghai indexes fell 9.2 percent and 8.1 percent, respec tively.  Mexican equity pric es fell 3.2 percent, 
primarily on news regarding poten tial tariffs on Mexican export s to the United States.  
Foreign equity price declines w ere accompanied by outflows from  EME-dedicated funds, 
and EME sovereign spreads widened  moderately.  AFE equity index es declined 1 to 
6 percent, with European bank stock s underperforming significan tly, especially those of 
Italian and German banks. 
Negative market sentiment and growing concerns about global gro wth contributed 
to notable declines in AFE polic y expectations and sovereign yi elds.  Ten-year sovereign 
yields declined 36 basis points in the United Kingdom and 25 basis points in Germany, 
with the German yield falling t o a record low of negative 0.24 percent.  Five-year, five-
year-forward euro-area infla tion compensation declined 12 basis  points to 1.29 percent, 
close to its lowest level sin ce mid-2016.  Despite the risk-off  sentiment, euro-area 
peripheral bond spreads over Germ an yields generally narrowed, and yields reached 
record lows in Greece and Portugal.  The notable exception was Italy, where spreads 
widened 18 basis points as the c ountry’s fiscal outlook worsene d.  Key members of the 
Italian government called for additional fiscal stimulus measur es, even while the 
European Commission officially war ned Italy that it was already in breach of European 
Union budget rules.

 The dollar generally appreciated a gainst EME currencies and dep reciated against 
AFE currencies, leaving the br oad dollar inde x 0.77 percent hig her since the previous 
FOMC meeting.  Safe-haven flows c ontributed to the dollar’s dep reciation against the 
Japanese yen and the Swiss fran c.  The dollar rose 2.7 percent against the British pound 
amid increased Brexit uncertain ty.  In the EMEs, the announceme nt of potential tariffs on 
Mexican imports and the downgrade  of Mexican sovereign debt wei ghed on the peso, 
which depreciated 3.9 percent over the intermeeting period.  Th e sizable 2.6 percent 
decline of the Chinese renminbi  against the dollar notably occu rred as the PBOC was 
leaning against the depreciati on (see the box “Recent Depreciat ion of the Chinese 
Renminbi”). 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Conditions in domestic short-term  funding markets remained stab le.5  Overnight 
secured and unsecured rates dec lined in response to the technic al adjustment that reduced 
the IOER rate 5 basis points to 2.35 percent after the May FOMC  meeting.  The effective 
federal funds rate and the secure d overnight financing rate ave raged 2.39 percent and 
2.42 percent, respectively, over th e intermeeting period, about 6 basis points below their 
respective levels just before the May FOMC meeting.  Rates on o vernight commercial 
paper and yields on one- and three -month negotiable certificates of deposit also declined 
somewhat.  
Aggregate reserve balances a veraged $1.5 trillio n over the inte rmeeting period, 
well above the staff’s estimate of the aggregate lowest comfort able level of reserve 
balances (LCLoR), whic h is currently $860 billion.6  The fraction of surveyed banks with 
reserve balances falling below their individual self-reported L CLoRs on any given day 
averaged 15 percent in May. 
5 Take-up at the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP facility remained low,  averaging about $2 billion for 
the intermeeting period.   
6 The staff’s estimate for the ag gregate level of LCLoR, which h as been updated with recent data 
from the Senior Financial Officer Survey, is based on an approa ch described in Thomas Keating, Francis 
Martinez, Luke Pettit, Marcelo Rezende, Mary-Frances Styczynski , and Alex Thorp (2019), “Estimating

The RMB has fallen 2.5 percent  against the U.S. dollar since  trade tensions escalated  in early 
May,  and the spot exchange  rate  is approaching  the psychological  barrier of 7 yuan per 
dollar  for the  third time since  its unexpected  depreciation  in August  2015 (figure 1).  There 
are signs of continued  depreciation  pressure,  albeit modest, as the offshore RMB  has 
consistently  been trading  at a weaker  level
 than the onshore RMB.  In addition, investor 
demand for protection  against further RMB depreciation  (relative to appreciation)  as 
measured  by risk reversals  spiked in recent  weeks, though to still‐low levels (figure  2). 
The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has not engaged in direct sales of foreign reserves and 
instead has used other measures  to 
support  the currency.   In recent weeks, the PBOC has set 
the daily central parity rate  of the onshore RMB stronger than would have been  expected  
based on its de jure central parity fixing rule (figure 3).1  Market  participants  generally  
interpret  stronger‐than‐expected  fixings as a signal that the PBOC prefers  a stronger RMB.  
Indeed,  the recent fixing is remarkably  stable at 6.9 (figure 4).   
  
             
                                                 
1 In early 2016, the PBOC detailed the rule for fixing the RMB’s daily central parity rate, which serves as 
the midpoint  for the intraday trading range  of 2 percent,  as the sum of the previous day’s market close of 
the RMB  to the dollar and the change that would offset  overnight  changes in a trade‐weighted  basket of 
currencies.

 The PBOC has also attempted  to discourage  the shorting of the offshore RMB  by selling 
short‐term  bills in Hong Kong to tighten  offshore liquidity,  as evidenced  by a jump in 
offshore RMB  interbank  lending rates, with  announced  plans for further  issuances  in the 
near term.  Finally, the PBOC has used communications  to signal support  for the  RMB, 
including  a public statement
 saying that China is “capable  and confident”  of keeping the 
RMB stable.2 
The latest bout of depreciation  and policy responses  by the PBOC is most reminiscent  of an 
episode in June 2018, when the  RMB depreciated  4 percent  within three  weeks following  an 
escalation  of trade tensions with  the United States and weaker‐than ‐expected  Chinese  data 
releases.   At that time, the PBOC also used communications  to signal its intention  to keep 
the RMB stable, fixed the central parity rate  stronger,  and did not draw
 down on its foreign 
exchange  reserves (figure 5). 
Both the current and the June 2018  episodes are very different  from the RMB weakness  in 
2015 and 2016, in that  these more recent sharp depreciations  have not been  accompanied  by 
expectations  of future depreciation  in the forwards market (figure  1) and private capital 
outflows  have been much  more modest (figure 6).  We attribute the  observed  attenuation 
of recent market  swings  to better  PBOC communication  and credibility,  tightened  capital 
controls, and better fundamentals  in the Chinese  economy  relative to the  2015–16 episode.  
Furthermore,  even  though the RMB is still managed,  it is more market  determined  now than 
it was in 2015 and 2016.  
Currently,  market participants  view  7 yuan per dollar  as a soft floor and expect it to be 
defended  at least  until the G‐20 summit at the end of June, as further  depreciation  of the 
RMB could hi
nder trade negotiations.3  Indeed,  we believe that the PBOC would be able to 
defend the value of the RMB if it decided to do  so, using the more powerful  policy tools at 
its disposal.  For example,  it could direct offshore state  banks to sell  the U.S. dollar for yuan  
or use some of its $3 trillion in foreign exchan ge  reserves.   
We think it is unlikely, however,  that the PBOC  would defend the RMB by running down its 
foreign exchange  reserves as much  as it did during  the 2015–16 episode, as the PBOC seems 
to have a higher tolerance  for exchange  rate  flexibility  now than it did in that earlier episode.  
Thus, a breakdown  in trade negotiation
s or further signs of slowing Chinese  growth may 
cause  the RMB to break through the level of 7 yuan per dollar.  
 
                                                 
2 PBOC Vice Governor  Liu Guoqiang  made the remarks in an interview  with Financial News on May  24, 2019. 
3 Of the 25 most recent forecasts  in Bloomberg,  none  expects  the RMB  to trade  weaker  than 7 yuan per 
dollar by the end of the second quarter, and only 4 expect it to trade below that level by the end of the year.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Financing conditions for business es and households were little changed over the 
intermeeting period and , to date, do not appear to have been  significantly affected  by the 
heightened concern in financial markets  about the outlook for the economy.  As such, 
financing conditions remain generally supportive of spending , except perhaps for 
ongoing tight conditions for households with low c redit scores .   
•Corporate bond issuance was strong in May, and the calendar for upcoming
deals appears robust.  However, a few corporations reportedly chose not toissue  as spreads and market volatility increased.
•Business lending overall appeared to decelerate somewhat  in the second
quarter , with the slowdown beginning before the recent market volatility.
Strong issuance of corporate bonds w as counterbalanced  by subdued C&I loan
growth and muted issuance of  new- money institutional lev eraged loans.
•Mortgage rates decreased  notably and now stand at levels last seen in 2017,
facilitating a solid pace of h ome- purchase origin ations.  R efinance
originations increased but  remained  relatively muted .
•Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the first qu arter.  Interest
rates on consumer debt r emained above their levels in late 2015 and appeared
to weigh somewhat on the demand for consumer credit.
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Corporations 
The market volatility over the intermeeting period  has left, so far, little discern ible 
imprint on the flow of credit to corporations, and we judge that financing conditions for 
businesses overall have remained  accommodative , with  yields  having remained  low by 
historical standards.  A few  corporations reportedly chose not to issue bonds in this 
climate , but t he calendar for upcoming deals appears robust.  Early reports also do not 
indicate a significant slowdown  in leveraged loan issuance in May . 
Taking a longer perspective , even before the rise in market  volatility , net debt 
issuance appeared to decelerate somewhat in the second quarter from a very strong  first

  capital expenditures in the next six months held steady at a relatively low level .  Call 
Report data show continued slow growth in large banks’ outstanding balances of small 
loans to businesses in the first quarter of this year. 
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions remained  generally accommodative for commercial real 
estate (CRE) .  Bank CRE lending expanded  in April and May at a slower rate than in the 
first quarter.  In CMBS markets, triple -A spreads widened slightly but remained  near the 
low end of their post- crisis range , and a gency and non- agency CMBS issuance was  solid 
in May .  New commitments from life insurance companies to fund CRE mortgages 
continued to be robust through the first quarter, roughly matching their average pace over 
the past several years.  
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative.  Gross 
issuance of municipal bonds was solid in April and May, with new capital raising accounting for the majority of the issuance.  Municipal bond yields in both the secondary 
and primary markets decreased somewhat, while spreads over comparable- maturity 
Treasury securities widened somewhat in the secondary market .  Moreover, the credit 
quality of general obligation bonds continued to improve as the number of credit rating upgrades strongly outpaced that of downgrades in both April and May. 
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased moderately  over 
the intermeeting period, as the rate on 30-year conforming mortgages moved down 35 basis points, in line with yields on 10- year Treasury securities .  With mortgage rates 
down mor e than 1 full percentage point since last November, home-purchase originations 
have returned to the solid  levels seen in 2017.  In contrast, refinancing volumes moved up 
but remained  fairly low, as many borrowers appear to have locked in financing during 
other low- rate periods in the past few years.   Cash -out refinancing volumes also remained  
low despite sustained increases in aggregate home equity.  Credit availability —as 
measured by our estimate of lenders’ maximum available debt- to-income ratio —for 
residential mortgages  to prime and near- prime borrowers  looked  to be accommodative

  and in line with levels seen in the early 2000s but remained  relatively  tight for borrowers 
with low credit scores.    
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer c redit markets appeared  to remain  generally 
supportive of growth in consumer spending, al though supply conditions continued to be 
tight for subprime credit card borrowers.  Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace 
in the first quarter , with  bank credit d ata pointing to a pickup in April and May.  The 
moderate pace of consumer credit growth may reflect, in part,  a restraint on demand 
brought about by the sustained increases in  the past couple of years in consumer interest 
rates, which tend to be tied to sh orter-term rates .  (The box “Driver s of Recent Changes 
in Credit Card Interest Rates ” provides more information on the change in credit card 
rates since December 2015.)  In recent months, though, a uto interest rates have moved 
sideways , and the share of respondents to the University of Michigan Surveys of 
Consumers reporting favorable financing conditions for auto loans has risen, albeit  from 
subdued levels.  In consumer ABS markets, i ssuance was robust , and spreads were little 
changed  at low levels .   
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL  CONDITIONS INDEXES  
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial 
corporations indicates that financing conditions have tightened slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period but remain ed accommodative relative to historical standards.  The 
tightening in the financi ng conditions index is consistent with  the decline in equity prices 
and widening of corporate spreads over the same period.  As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook section, financial conditions indexes that aggregate large set s of financial 
variables into summary series also generally point ed to tighter but broadly 
accommodative financial conditions.

Drivers of Recent Changes in Credit Card Interest  Rates  
Credit card interest rates , plotted in figure 1, have increased substantially over the past few years  
and have risen as much as 290 basis points since the December 2015 liftoff of the target federal 
funds rate from its effective lower bound .  They now stand at their highest levels since the first 
quarter of 2001.   
Figure 2 plots the spread of credit card interest rates over the prime rate (the top of the target 
range for the federal funds rate plus 300 basis points).  The vast majority of credit cards have variable rates that are linked to prime rates.  The spreads are much flatter than the card interest 
rates, with increases since December 2015 of about 35 to 65 basis points.  Thus, more than 
three- fourths  of the rise in credit card rates since late 2015 reflect increases in the federal funds 
rate.   
The increases in spreads since December 2015 may be related to a greater prevalence of credit 
card rewards payments  and rises in nonprime delinquencies.  Supervisory data (the FR Y -14M) 
show a substantial increase in credit card rewards over the past few years.  The i ncrease in rates 
may help offset greater rewards costs to card issuers.   From the second quarter of 2015 through 
the first quarter of 2019, near -prime and subprime delinquency rates of 30 days or more increased 
about 75 basis points and 200 basis  points, respectively.   
As shown in the t able, t he changes in spreads differ substantially by credit score, with spreads for 
prime accounts falling about 20 basis points, but spreads for near- prime and subprime accounts 
rising about 60 basis points and 85 basis points, respectively.  As subprime and near- prime 
borrowers are more likely to revolve balances and less likely to have cards with rewards than prime borrowers , they are probably bearing the increase in rates more heavily.

Appendix  
Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes  
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes.”  
   
Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)
June 7, 2019
Page 72 of 136
Authorized for Public Release
The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative- grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.  
The second index in the table  measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending 
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices .  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.
2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both  changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy. 
1 This index was first discussed in the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” in the Financing Conditions for 
Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.  
2 This index is an updated version of the  index developed in  William  F. Bassett, Mary Beth Chosak,  
John C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and t he Macroeconomy,” 
Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 62 (March) , pp. 23 –40.  The current index uses a new weighting approach for 
each loan category .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We have become more concerned about downside risks to our economic projection since 
the previous Tealbook  and now consider the risks to our baseline projection as tilted to the 
downside over the next year.  Beyond the next year, we continue to see the risks as skewed to the 
downside.   
Beginning with our assessment for the next year, while uncertaint ies have increased since 
April,  we still view the uncertainty around the staff forecast of economic activity as being 
broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years , the benchmark used by the FOMC ; that  
period includes a number of episodes with elevated un certainty and market volatility .  However, 
we now judge the risks around our baseline projection for real GDP growth to be tilted to the 
downside , with a skew to the upside for the unemployment rate.  An important factor in our 
assessment is that trade pol icies and foreign economic developments, along with financial 
market reactions, seem more likely to move further in directions that would have more 
significant negative effects on U.S . economic activity than to resolve more favorably than 
assumed.  Also, t he soft tone of some recent economic indicators, such as business investment 
and industrial production, could be pointing to a more substantial slowing in economic growth 
than in the baseline.  On the upside, many of the underlying fundamentals for househo ld 
spending and business investment remain solid —bolstered, in part, by  the 2017 tax cuts —with 
strong  labor market conditions, low interest rates, and quite upbeat readings on consumer 
sentiment.  In these circumstances, consumer spending and investment co uld expand at a pace 
that is faster than in the staff projection.  
As shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit, 
the probability estimate of moving into recession over the next year based on a ter m spread 
model has mo ved up to 67  percent, and the estimate from a model -averaging approach, which 
uses a selection of real and financia l variables, has climbed to 51  percent; both estimates are 
higher than in the previous Tealbook and well above the unconditional recession pr obability of 
23 percent.  In contrast, the four -quarter -ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth 
and the unemployment rate, presented in the exhibit “Time -Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year 
Ahead,” are still not unusually wide or skewed.

Beyond  a year ahead, w e continue to be  concerned about downside risks to our economic 
projection , given the historically low unemployment rate  projected over the medium term .  As 
shown in the exhibit “Conditional Distributions of Macro economic Variables 2 Years Ahead ,” 
the estimated distributions  are currently skewed to the upside for the unemployment rate and 
skewed to the downside for GDP growth  two years ahead .1  In addition , as indicated in the 
exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk ,” the e stimate d probability  of returning to the effective 
lower bound  (ELB ) over the next three years  is currently  19 percent , and it  rises further to around 
34 percent by the end of the medium term .  Given the proximity  of the federal funds rate  to the 
ELB, monetary policy  may have less capacity to offset negative economic shocks than positive 
ones, contributing  to a downside skew in  economic outcomes.      
With regard to inflation, the staff still sees average uncertainty around the projection, but 
with the risks to the f orecast for economic activity tilted to the downside , the risks to the inflation 
projection would also tend to have a downward skew.  To the downside, the soft data on 
consumer prices earlier this year could be more persistent than assumed in the baseline.   In 
addition, underlying inflation could currently be even lower than assumed in the baseline.  Also, 
the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more than expected and put downward pressure 
on inflation.  To the upside, an extended period with unus ually tight resource utilization could 
eventually lead to greater upward pressure on wages and prices,  consistent with the predictions 
of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation.  In addition, an 
unexpectedly widespread  and sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to higher inflation.   
Inflation risks would tend to be of relatively modest size as long as inflation expectations 
remained reasonably well anchored.  However, the risks could increase substantially, in  either 
direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such movements in 
expectations could induce changes in inflation to build upon themselves and thus lead inflation to 
deviate more significantly and persistently from 2 percent.  
1 The results shown in the exhibit are consistent with recent research , using quantile regressions,  on the 
distribution of fluctuations  in the unemployment rate and in real GDP growth.  For the unemployment rate, see 
Michael Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018 -067 (Washington:  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067 .  For real  
GDP growth , see Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Nellie Liang, and Sheheryar Malik (2018), “The Term 
Structure of Growth -at-Risk,” Hutchins Center on Fiscal  and Monetary Policy Working Paper 42 (Washington:  
Brookings Institute, August) , https://www.brookings.edu/wp -content/uploads/2018/08/WP42 -NL-updated.pdf .  The 
result s of their research  suggest that the  upside risk to the unemployment rate and downside risk to GDP growth are 
more pronounced in the medium term —specifically, two to three years ahead —particularly w hen the unemployment 
rate is low or credit growth is high.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  We simulate each of these scenarios using one of 
two models maintained by the staff , which  embed different macroeconomic structures and 
dynamics.2  In four of the scenarios , the federal funds rate is governed by the  baseline  policy rule 
introduced in the April  Tealbook , which assumes a smaller coefficient on the output gap.   
However, in the two scenario s that feature  deteriorating  economic conditions , we assume  the 
same parameter values in the policy rule  used in earlier  Tealbooks,  which put s more weight on 
the output gap  than in the new baseline rule specification .  Under the conditions in th ese two 
scenario s, we judge it unlikely that monetary policy would react in the manner embodied in the  
new baseline rule,  because output growth slows  notably.  Finally , the size and composition of the 
SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the baseline paths in all of the scenarios.  
Increased Uncertainty [FRB/US]  
The recent softness in some spending and production indicators may indicate that 
macroeconomic uncertainty is having a more adverse effect on the U.S. economy than assumed 
in the baseline projection.   In this scenario, we assume that uncertainty increases substantially 
more over the coming quarters and that this results in weaker business investment and consumer 
durable outlays both this year and next year.  
All told, GDP growth is 0.7 percent  in the s econd half of this year and 1.6  percent in 
2020 , comparable with the slowing  seen in the 2015 –16 period, and the unemployment rate starts 
rising this year, r eaching 4  percent in the second  half of 2020.  With a more subdued path for 
economic activity, infl ation runs slightly below the baseline  over the projection  period .  In this 
scenario, policymakers begin cutting rates this year , and the federal funds rate edges  down  to 
roughly  2 percent by 2021 , as policymakers respond to the slowdown in economic activity in 
accordance with a policy rule that puts a greater weight on the output gap than in the baseline 
rule.3  
                                                           
2 The two models used are  (1) FRB/US, which is a large -scale macroeconometri c model of the U.S. 
economy, and (2) GEMUS , which is a  calibrated two -country DSGE model.  
3 Specifically, the policy rule used in this scenario assumes a coefficient of 1  on the output gap.  
Alternatively, if we used the baseline policy rule with an output gap coefficient of 0.2, the federal funds rate would 
remain roughly flat.  In this case, the unemployment rate would reach 4.1 percent by the end of 2020.  GDP growth 
would still be 0.7 percent in the second half of this year but a bit lower than in the scenario at 1.5 percent in 2020.

Lower Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]  
Total and core PCE price inflation have, on avera ge, run below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective for most of the past decade.  In addition, some measures of longer -run 
inflation expectations have drifted down in the past several years.  In the baseline projection, 
longer -run inflation expectations rele vant for wage and price setting are assumed to generate an 
underlying inflation trend that remains at 1.8 percent through the medium term.  However, there 
is a risk that actual inflation expectations are anchored at a level somewhat below what is 
assumed i n the baseline.  In this scenario, we consider the possibility that the private sector’s 
longer -run inflation expectations are consistent with underlying trend inflation that has been at 
1.5 percent for a year now and that it will remain at that level for an extended period of time.  
Policymakers are assumed to currently recognize this lower underlying inflation trend.    
Lower inflation expectations lead to actual inflation running below the baseline and 
hovering slightly above 1.5 percent over the projecti on period.  Lower realized inflation implies 
that the federal funds rate stays below the baseline throughout th e projection period and stands 
almost ½ percent below the baseline by 2024.  Real GDP growth as well as the unemployment 
rate are little changed over the projection period , as the nominal federal funds rate evolves in 
tandem with inflation, leaving real interest rates essentially unchanged.   
Stronger Aggregate Supply [FRB/US]  
The unemployment rate is currently ab out 1 percentage point below the st aff’s 
4.6 percent estimate for its natural rate .  Nevertheless, w age gains have remained modest in  
recent years  because , in the staff’s assessment,  underlying  inflation has been below 2 percent  and 
trend productivity growth has been slow.  However, a nother way of reconciling modest wage 
growth with a very low unemployment rate is that resource utilization may be less tight than 
assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, the level of potential output in recent years is assumed 
to have been higher than  judged in the baseline, such that the output gap was close to  zero in the 
middle of last year.  Moreover, this scenario assumes that potential output growth in future years 
is faster than in the baseline.  Specifically, we assume that the natural rate of unemployment has 
been lower in the past several years than in the baseline and continues to fall to 3.75 percent  at 
the end of 2019, more than ¾  percentage point lower than in the baseline.4  We also assume that 
4 A natural rate of 3.75 percent is comparable to the average of the 10 lowest forecasts for the longer -run 
unemployment rate submitted b y respondents in the March 2019 long -range Blue Chip survey.

stronger.  GDP growth is, on average, about  1 percentage point per year  above the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate falls further than in the baseline and declines to just below 2¾ percent by the 
end of 2024, almost 1½ percentage points lower than in the staff projection.  Nevertheless, the 
path for inflation is slightly below  the baseline, on average, reflecting primarily the stronger 
productivity growth in this scenario.  Because policymakers are assumed to recognize the 
supply -side conditions and see the smaller positive output gap persisting for several years, the 
path of t he federal funds rate is about 25 basis points lower, on average, than in the baseline.   
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US]  
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment 
remain solid, including quite upbeat r eadings on  consumer sentiment, strong  labor market 
conditions, and low interest rates.  In this scenario, we assume that consumer spending and, in 
turn, investment expand at a pace faster than in the baseline.  Given the strong cyclical 
improvement in labor force pa rticipation in recent years, we assume that these favorable 
conditions bring about greater labor force participation , a feature that is similar to what is in the 
staff baseline projection .  
Under th ese assumptions, GDP increases 3  percent, on average, in 2 019 and 2020, which 
is a pace comparable with that in 2018.  With a greater -than-typical response from labor force 
participation boosting the supply of available workers, the unemployment rate decli nes to about 
3 percent in 2021 , a smaller decline than what the model’s  Okun’s law relationship would 
suggest.  Inflatio n increases slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2024.  In response to the stronger 
economy, and with inflation little changed, the federal funds rate rises relative t o the baseline, 
reaching about  3 percent in 2022.

Escalation of Trade Tensions [GEMUS]  
Our current baseline assumes a ceasefire in ongoing trade disputes, meaning that the 
United States and its trading partners impose no new tariffs but that existing tariffs , including 
those raised in  May on a sizable tranche of Chinese imports,  remain in place.  However, 
President Trump has also threatened additional tariffs on all remaining imports from China not 
yet subject to tariffs .  In addition, the President announced a plan to impose tariffs o n all Mexican 
imports starting on June 10, with the tariff rate  gradually increasing in the second half of this year.  
While the effects of the tariffs imposed so far ha ve been modest, it is likely that 
widespread and sustained increases in future tariffs would entail sizable adverse effects.  This 
scenario assume s that, in the second half of 2019, tariffs of 25 percent are imposed on about 
$300 billion of imports from Mexico and $275 billion of imports not previously tariffed from 
China and that Mexico and China partially retaliate.  Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports , 
while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies have only a small  effect on the 
trade balance.  However, the higher cost of imported consumption goods depresses househ old 
spending while business spending declines, both as a result of the higher cost of imported capital 
goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing spreads to rise and equity prices 
to fall.  In addition, we assume that the heightened trade tensions cause  a widespread decline in 
global sentiment , which, adding to the pressures previously described , leads to an overall decline 
in equity prices of about 20 percent by the end of 2019.  
All told, these developments result in  a significant slowdown in the U.S. economy that 
lasts through 2020.  Real GDP growth drops to only 0.3 percent in the second half of 2019 and 
rises to only 1. 3 percent in 2020.  Higher import prices boost core PCE inflation to 3. 5 percent in 
the second half  of this year before inflation falls below the baseline as the effect of the new 
tariffs dies out and as the economy slows down.  Because  the jump in inflation  is transitory,  we 
assume that policymakers decide to “see through” it and focus on the weakness in economic 
activity .  Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, 
declining to 1.9 percent by the end of 2020, 0.7 percentage point below the baseline.5 
                                                           
5 This scenario considers a policy rule that assumes a coefficient of 1 on the output gap.  Alternatively, if 
we used the baseline policy rule with an output gap coefficient of 0.2, GD P growth wo uld average about 0.2  percent 
over the next two years, and the unemployment rate would rise to 4.9 percent by the end of 2021.

Favorable Trade Deals [GEMUS]  
On the upside, there could be pos itive news on trade.  In this scenario, we assume not 
only that the United States avoids imposing tariffs on Mexico (as in our baseline), but that it 
reaches a trade deal with China, perhaps as soon as the proposed Trump –Xi summit on the 
sidelines of the G -20 meeting on June 28  and June 29.  In particular, we assume that the 
25 percent tariff imposed by the U nited States on $180 billion in imports from China since 
September 2018, as well as the retaliation to these measures by China, are rolled back.  For the 
case of Mexico, we assume that some manner of resolution reduces uncertainty around trade 
with this country, thus boosting consumer and business confidence.  
Lower tariffs, stronger global confidence, and improved financial conditions boost 
economic activity in the U nited States and abroad.  U.S. real GDP expands  2.1 percent  in the 
second half of 2019 and 2.4 percent i n 2020.  Lower import prices caused by the rollback of the 
previously imposed tariffs cause core PCE inflation to drop to 1.7 percent in the second half of 
this year, before inflation returns to close to the baseline in 2020.  The federal funds rate is onl y 
slightly higher, on average, over the projection horizon.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS  
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, the FRB/US model projects real 
GDP growth to slow from 3 percent in 2018 to about 1 ¾ percent in 2019 and to roughly  
1½ percent in the next two years .6  The forecast of real GDP growth is revised up 0.3  percentage 
point in 2019 compared with the previous Tealbook .  The revision primarily reflects both better -
than-expected  (from the model’s perspective) consumption growth and a downward revision to 
the path of long -term interest rates in the first half  (the model now conditions on the data and the 
staff forecast through the second quarter ).  In terms of contour, the projecte d deceleration in real 
GDP mainly reflects the projection that both consumption  and business investment growth fall  
back from what the model perceives as unusually strong readings in recent years.  In the case of 
consumption, t he model could not explain th ose positive surprises based on fundamentals 
(wealth and income) and hence does not carry that strength forward in the projection ; instead , it 
has consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend.  The model’s assessment that asset 
prices (equity a nd property wealth) are currently above normal valuations and thus will fall or 
6 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projection s for variables from the  U.S. government 
sector, foreign real GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar and oil prices .  The federal funds 
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline.

decelerate over the next year also contributes to the weakening in consumption growth through 
the wealth channel.  The model forecasts the output gap to fall from a current est imate of 
1½ percent to about  ½ percent at the end of 2021.  The unemployment rate rises slightly from 
3.8 percent in 2019 to 4. 1 percent at the end of 2021, still below its estimate of the natural rate of 
4.6 percent.  Core inflation increases from 1. 7 percent in 2019 to 2.0 percent in 2020 and 2021.  
The EDO model projects real GDP growth to average 2¼ percent over the next three 
years,  close  to the model’s estimate of average  potential  growth.   The output gap is currently 
estimated to be negative 0. 2 perce nt, and it remains slightly  negative through 2021.   Core 
inflation hovers around the Committee’s 2 percent objective after 2019.  For a number of years, 
wages have been below the level consistent with the model’s wage Phillips curve, holding down 
marginal costs and depressing inflation over that period.  The model expects these wage shocks 
to fade gradually .

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  Compared with the April Tealbook, the current 
project ion of the output gap is narrower , as GDP growth is now anticipated to  be slower 
this year and next year,  while  the inflation forecast is little changed.   In light of the staff’s 
revisions to  the outlook, the prescribed paths of the strategies over the medium run are 
generally lower than in the April Tealbook, though for most strategies, the differences are small.   
A special exhibit c ompares the stabilization properties of  flexible average 
inflation targeting —a strategy in which  policymakers seek  to offset past inflation misses 
that occur over a fixed -length reference period— with those of flexible price- level 
targeting  (FPLT) , under which policymakers seek  to offset all the inflation misses 
accumulated since a given reference date.   An additional exhibit provides updated 
estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top pa nel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
the Taylor  (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  an FPLT rule .1  These near -term 
prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for the output gap and core inflation , which are shown in the middle panels.
2  The top and middle panel s also  provide 
the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate. 
•Reflecting the  narrower output gap, the near -term prescriptions of the policy
rules are slightly lower  than in the April Tealbook.
1 The appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on these simple policy rules .  
Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use 
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50 basis points in the longer run.  
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook bas eline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection of the output gap.

Tealbook baseline, because it responds more strongly to the positive output
gap than the conditional attenuated rule underlying the Tealbook baselineprojection.
•The Taylor  (1993) rule , which does  not feature an interest rate  smoothing
term, calls for  higher policy r ates than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule.
•The first -difference rule, which responds to the change in the expected output
gap, advises keeping the federal funds rate fairly close to its current level
because of  the projection that  the output gap will remain similar to  its current
size, on balance, over the next year.
•The FPLT rule, in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the core PCE
price index of 2.6 percent  since the end of 2011, prescribes a decrease in the
federal funds rate in the third quarter and a further decline to less than2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019.
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimates of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate ( r*) generated under two baselines:  the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the March  2019 
Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP).3  In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US 
model are used.  This concept of r *, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the 
real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting in the current  
quarter , would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  This 
concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy and 
3 To construct a baseline proj ection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021 (the 
final year reported in the March 2019 SEP), the  economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth 
and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the 
SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP une mployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or 
avoiding sharp changes in the federal funds rate.  
• The current value of the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*, at 1.79 percent,  is 
about 25 basis points lower than its estimate in  the April  Tealbook; the 
difference reflects the staff’s projection of a narrower output gap. 
• At 0.91 percent , the corresponding March SEP -consistent FRB/US r*  remains  
significantly lower than the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r* .  The difference 
stems from the fact that the SEP -consistent projection has output exceeding 
potential by a smaller amount  over the medium term than does the current  
Tealbook forecast , while the path s for the real federal funds rate are broadly 
similar across the two  projections. 
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline and results from dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different federal funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.  The simulations for each rule are carried out under the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and t hat 
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy.  Compared with the previous Tealbook, most simple rules prescribe lower paths for the federal funds rate.   Over the near term, the 
size of the decrease varies by rule,  but by 2023, all the simple rules imply policy rate 
paths that are lower by about 15 to 30 basis points relative to the corres ponding 
prescriptions in the April Tealbook.   
• Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate edges up by about ¼ percentage point over the next few years , leaving the policy rate little changed from  the path in the April  
Tealbook.   
• The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as 
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output

 gap, calls for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace and to reach 
nearly  3½ percent by mid -2021, after which it remain s above the Tealbook 
baseline path for an extended period of time.  The less  accommodative 
monetary conditions also produce an unemployment rate that , unlike in the 
Tealbo ok baseline, rises steadily toward  the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
of unemployment.  As a result, i nflation is lower , and the real 10- year 
Treasury yield is higher, than the corresponding values in the Tealbook 
projection. 
•Similarly, the  Taylor  (1993) rule calls for increases in the federal funds rate
over the rest of this year and early next year .  After that, the federal funds rate
path prescribed by this rule is below the corresponding path under the inertial
Taylor (1999) rule but above the path in the Tealbook baseline.  This initialdifference arises because  the Taylor (1993) rule has no inertial component and
therefore adjusts the path of policy upward immediately in response to thehigh level of the current output gap.  T he magnitude of th e output- gap
response in the Taylor (1993) rule is lower than in the inertial Taylor (1 999)
rule but greater than in  the baseline rule underlying the staff’s projection.  As
a result, the paths for the real 10 -year Treasury yield, unemployment rate, and
inflation rate implied by the Taylor (1993) rule are between the corresponding
paths under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the Tealbook baseline.
•The first-difference rule, which reacts to the expected change in the output
gap rather than its level , prescribes small, gradual increases in the federal
funds rate through 2020, followed by a sequence of reductions when the
output gap is projected to narrow.  Later in the projection, the federal fundsrate path under this rule drops slightly  below its Te albook counterpart .  As a
result, relative to the Tealbook baseline, this prescription generates  a similar
near-term, but lower medium- term, unemployment rate path and somewhat
higher inflation.
•The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate,  the cumula tive shortfall of
the level of core PCE prices  from  a target path for that price level th at grows
at an annual rate of 2  percen t from the end of 2011 onward.  Eliminating the
current 2.6 percent shortfall of the core PCE price index requires inflation torun above 2 percent in coming years.   Because the simulation embeds the
assumptions that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to

 time and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters 
correctly anticipate the ensuing  long period of a low federal funds rate, the 
path of the real 10- year Treasury rate immediately  drops and remains below 
the Tealbook baseline throughout the period shown.  As a result, the unemployment rate is substantially lower than in the Tealbook base line and all 
other simulations, dropping below 3¼ percent  in 2021.  Inflation ex ceeds 
2 percent by nearly ¼ percentage point, on average, over the next decade before slowly return ing to 2 percent.  
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhi bit displays optimal control simulations under two different  
assumptions about policymakers’ preferences captured by different  specifications of the 
loss function.4  The concept of optimal control employed here assumes policymakers are 
able to commit future policymakers to their plans; such a commitment, where feasible,  
may lead to improved economic outcomes.5   
•The first simulation, labeled “Equal weights,” presents the case in whichpolicymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCEinflation close to the Committee’s objective  of 2 percent , on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate ofunemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previousvalue.  Under this strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is significantlyhigher than the Tealbook baseline path, though this path has been reviseddown, relative to the April Tealbook, about 30 to 50 basis points over the nexttwo years .
6  This strategy is designed to counter the pr ojected sizable and
persistent  undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate that
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.    
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  
6 Because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and credible, changes in the 
federal funds rate are not disruptive, regardless of the magnitude of their departure from historical norms.  In practice, however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate extraordin arily abruptly, wage 
and price setters and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate tighter monetary policy than policymakers envision, in which case macroeconomic outcomes 
may be less favorable than woul d otherwise be the case.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 occurs  in the Tealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with the 
equal -weights loss function judge to be undesirable.  The smaller  
unemployment gap generates only moderate downward pressure on inflation 
because, in the FRB/US model,  the response of inflation to the current level of 
resource utilization is small.    
•The second  simulation, labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss
function that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from thenatural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate, but isotherwise identical to the specification with equal weights.  Under thisstrategy, the path for the federal f unds rate is considerably below the path
under equal weights, but it is little changed relative to the April Tealbook andonly slightly  below the current Tealbook baseline path.  Policymakers choose
this slightly  more accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire
to keep  inflation close to 2 percent  is not tempered by an aversion to the
unemployment rate falling below its natural rate .  The tighter labor market
pushes inflation more promptly to ward  2 percent than in the case of
equal  weights.
MAKE UP STRATEGIES IN A DISINFLATION SCENARIO
The exhibit “Makeup Strategies in a Disinflation Scenario” examines  monetary 
policy strategies that aim to undo, in part or in full , past deviations of inflation from its 
2 percent objec tive.  We present  the effects of three makeup strategies:  a version of the 
FPLT rule and t wo parameterizations  of a flexible average inflation targeting ( FAIT) 
rule.7  To illustrate the differences between these strategies, we consider their effects in a 
disinflation scenario.  Under the FPLT rule, policymakers commit to mak ing up all 
inflation misses since the reference date, taken here to be 2011:Q4; inflation misses  since 
that reference date never become bygones.   Under t he FAIT  rules  we consider here, 
policymakers seek to mak e up for the cumulative deviation of inflation  from 2 percent 
over a rolling window of fixed length:  four or eight years .  Specifically , under FAIT  with 
an eight -year window, the reference interval ranges initially from 2011:Q 4 to 2019:Q3, 
then from 2012:Q 1 to 2019:Q4 in the subsequent quarter, and so forth; past inflation 
7 In order to facilitate comparison across rules, the version of the FPLT rule used in this exhibit 
differs from the version used elsewhere in this section of Tealbook A.  The FPLT rule here, as well as the 
FAIT rules used in this exhibit, feature the same coefficient on the output gap as the conditional attenuated 
rule in the Tealbook baseline.  See the appendix to this section for more detail.

 misses that drop out of th e eight -year window are no longer relevant for policy and 
become bygones.  As with the FPLT rule, we assume that the commitment to pursue 
FAIT is viewed as credible.  
• In the disinflation scenario , which is constructed using the conditional 
attenuated rule, persistent downward pressure causes inflation to fall from 
1.6 percent in 2019:Q3 to 1.2 percent  in early 2021 before slowly recovering 
to 2 percent by the end of 2026.8  All three makeup strategies call for notably 
lower paths of the policy rate than the path implied  by the conditional 
attenuated rule (the black line) .  The prescribed decline in the policy rate is 
larger under makeup rules that consider longer windows of past inflation misses, with the prescriptions of the eight- year FAIT  rule and the FPLT rule 
remaining below 1  percent for several years.  
• The path for core PCE inflation is shown in the middle panel of the exhibit.  The shaded areas highlight past deviations of inflation from the 2 percent 
objective over the four- and eight- year intervals  ending in 2019:Q3, the start 
date of the simulation .  Because the initial cumulative inflation gap under the 
eight -year FAIT  rule (shown by the yellow cross- hatched area) i s considerably 
larger than under the four- year FAIT  rule (shown in red), the eight- year FAIT  
rule prescribes a much lower path for the federal funds rate than the four- year 
FAIT  rule.  The shaded areas in the panel translate into the initial values in 
2019:Q3 under the respective FAIT  rules , shown in the lower -right panel , 
“Rule- Specific Cumulative Inflation Gap s.”   
• The differences between FAIT  and FPLT stem from the fact that past inflation 
misses, should they not be offset in a timely fashion by subsequent above-target inflation readings , will eventually become bygones under the FAIT  
rules but not under FPLT.  The “Rule- Specific Cumulative Inflation Gaps”  
panel  reports the value of the cumulative inflation deviation from 2 percent, 
conditional on the relevant window associated with each makeup rule.  Under FPLT, this interval expands over time and, therefore, a negative cumulative inflation gap can only be resolved by periods of inflation exceeding 2 percent, like the one beginning in late 2022.  By contrast, under the FAIT  rules, the 
                                                 
8 The scenario is accomplished through a constant anticipated sequence of small, exogeno us 
shocks to the FRB/US model equation for core inflation from 2019:Q3 through 2027:Q2.

 negative cumulative inflation gap can be ameliorated not just by periods of 
inflation exceeding 2 percent , but also by the passage of time, as previous 
inflation deviations fall out of the relevant window.  Under the e ight-year 
FAIT  rule in this simulation , inflation returns to 2 percent in mid -2024, but 
the cumulative inflation gap moves  up almost two years earlier, when large 
inflation misses that occurred in 2014 and 2015 become bygones.   
• When faced with persistent undershooting or overshooting of the 2 percent 
inflation objective, policy rules that seek to make up for inflation deviations over relatively long periods can be associated with more severe time-inconsistency problems than policy rules with shorter windows.  In particular, in our disinflation scenario, the FPLT rule requires future policymakers in the 
years 2022 to  2026 to keep the federal funds rate down when the 
unemployment rate is extraordinarily low and inflation is running well above 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.   The public may be skeptical about 
whether policymakers would adhere to their price path  target  under such 
circumstances.  The FAIT  rules  return inflation to 2 percent less rapidly, but 
under paths for inflation that the public may perceive as more credible. 
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds 
rate in the longer run, denoted rLR.  This concept is the rate consistent with the economy 
operating at its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated.  
This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer -run level 
of the nominal federal funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and economic models.  In addition, r
LR is also a parameter in many of the simple policy rules, 
including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of Tealbook A.  
• The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of historical values through 2019:Q1 for several model- based time -series estimates of r

 for 2019:Q 1 range from 0.3 to 2 percent, with a mean of roughly 1 percent.  
The range and mean of the 2019:Q1 point estimates are only slightly changed  
from the  corresponding statistics reported for 2018:Q4 in the March  
Tealbook.10 
•Time -series estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as
depicted in the middle panel.  The sources of this uncertainty vary across the
studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach as well
as the uncertainty that exists within each model about the prevailing state ofthe economy and of the model’s parameter  estimates .
•The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer- term forecasts of the real federal
funds rate from selected sources.  The Tealbook baseline assumption, at½ percent , is below the other measures, which range from 0.74 to
1.13 percent.  That said, the evidence presented in this exhibit, taken as awhole, indicates that t he Tealbook baseline assumption is consistent with
time-series and survey estimates, especially in light of the fact that all of these
estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty .
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variab les under the 
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations ” and optimal control 
simulations  shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment. ” 
use time -series methods to infer rLR from the co -movement of eit her macroeconomic series (like inflation, 
interest rates, and output) or both macroeconomic and financial data (like TIPS yields).  
10 For a discussion of time -series estimates of rLR over history, see the Monetary Policy Strategies 
section of the October 2017 Tealbook A.  There are differences in the historical paths of rLR across the 
studies.  The top panel reports the range of one -sided estimates, meaning that the estimates for a particular 
date only condition on data up to that date.  All of the point estimates used to compute the range have 
declined since the early 2000s.  Estimates that condition on all available data generally suggest a slow 
decline of rLR, which is consistent with the importance of secular factors such as changes in demographics 
or a p roductivity growth slowdown.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the 
Tealbook baseline projection .1  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy 
for quarter t;  for quarter s prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the 
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand- side variables of the first four rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four- quarter core PCE price inflatio n for the current

and Outlook section of the April 2019 Tealbook A describes the conditional baseline  rule.

  quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, 
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price- level targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables 
include an unemployment rate gap and  a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is d efined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡∗, 
which currently stands at 4.6 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference 
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 
2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently, 
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate. 
Simp
le Rules  
 
The first rule  in the table was studied by Taylor (1993).  T he inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time compared with  the 
Taylor (1993) rule .  The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap, like the 
FPLT  rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .2  The conditional 
attenuate d rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but places a coefficient of α  
on the output gap that is conditional on economic conditions; in the current Tealbook projection, 
α is set to 0.2.  Where applicable, t he intercepts of the simple rul es, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and 
chosen so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and an 
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking a s given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are s hown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown

above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).  Taylor (1993) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+0.5𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡

 and then conditioned on their simulated lagged fe deral funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged federal funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of  
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r* ” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP-consistent economic projection .  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
3  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations— that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined  solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline p rojection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r* .  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economi c projection,  the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB /US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption tha t market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

of equilibrium interest rates, see Gust and others (2016).

  COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 :

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two 
specifications.  
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The optimal control policy and associated outc omes depend on the relative (rather than the 
absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject 
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’  future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.   Loss Functions

 MAKE UP STRATEGIES IN A DISINFLATION SCENARIO  
The t wo types of simple rules shown in the special exhibit “Makeup Strategies in a 
Disinflation Scenario” have been harmonized to use the same form as the staff’s conditional 
attenuated rule, with an inertial coefficient of 0.85 and a smaller response to the output gap.  The FPLT  rule used in the special exhibit differs from the one used in the “ Simple Policy Rules ” 
section , as it responds to  𝛼𝛼 = 0.2 times the output gap rather than the unemployment gap with a 
coefficient of -1.  The table “Makeup Rules” gives the exact expressions for the two simple 
policy rules used in this exhibit.

in this appendix.  
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the exhibit “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run” shows a range of estimates of  𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch (forthcoming); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, 
and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez-Grande (2019); and Lubik and Matthes (2015).  For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data through 2019:Q1.  Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they make use of historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical movements can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.  
Where possible, the middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each 
model’s point estimate for 2019:Q1.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are specific to each study.   
The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝑟
𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 values from selected forecasters.  These values were 
obtained as follows:  
•“Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real
federal funds rate in the longer r un.
•“Med
ian SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal fund s
r
ate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the
March 2019 SEP .Flexible price -level
