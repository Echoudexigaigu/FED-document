Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The information received since the June Tealbook suggests that economic activity 
expanded at a solid pace of 2¾ percent in the first half of the  year, led by strong gains in 
consumer spending and government purchases.1  In addition, payroll gains rebounded in 
June from a weak May reading and posted solid gains, on average, in the second quarter, 
while the unemployment rate m oved lower, on net, last quarter.  However, growth of 
business investment has slowe d noticeably, and most indicators of investment spending 
remain downbeat.  We expect GDP growth to step down to a 1¾ per cent pace in the 
second half, as government spendi ng moderates and business investment is held down by 
trade tensions and concerns about  global growth.  Relative to t he June Tealbook, GDP 
growth in the first half is re vised up nearly ½ percentage poin t, boosted primarily by 
better-than-expected retail sa les reports, while second-half growth is essentially 
unrevised. 
We expect that real activity will decelerate further after this  year, largely 
reflecting the waning impetus from fiscal policy.  In addition,  we anticipate that concerns 
about trade policy and global growth will continue to weigh on the level of aggregate 
demand throughout the projection pe riod.  Specifically, after s lowing from 3 percent in 
2018 to 2¼ percent this year, GDP growth is projected to be 2 p ercent in 2020 and 
1¾ percent in 2021.  With GDP growt h outpacing its potential ra te through 2020, the 
output gap is projected to widen a bit to nearly 2½ percent by the end of next year and 
then narrow slightly to 2¼ per cent in 2021, when GDP growth sli ps below its potential 
rate.  Accordingly, the unemploym ent rate is projected to edge down from 3.7 percent at 
the end of this year to 3.6 per cent next year, 1 percentage poi nt below our estimate of its 
natural rate, and then to stay at that level through the end of 2021.   
Relative to the June Tealbook, GDP  growth is revised up this year, reflecting the 
incoming spending data.  Our finan cial assumptions are a little  more accommodative than 
in June, and we have revised up our  medium-term growth projecti on slightly in response.  
1 The BEA will release the advan ce estimate of second-quarter GD P growth and five years of 
revised NIPA data on July 26.  We will incorporate the revised data in our usual pre-FOMC forecast 
update.  On the first day of the  FOMC meeting, the BEA will rel ease PCE prices for June.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for GDP growth in 2019 is well aligned with the projections from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Blue Chip consensus, but it is about ½ percentage 
point higher than the Blue Chip in 2020.  Correspondingly, t he staff’s unemployment rate forecast is 
close to the SPF and Blue Chip projections in 2019  but below  the Blue Chip forecast in 2020.   
With regard to core PCE price inflation, the staff projection is 0.2  percentage point above the SPF 
projection in 2019 .  Otherwise, the staff’s inflation projections  are close to those of the Blue Chip and 
the SPF .  
 
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includ es input 
from  about 50  panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both 
surveys.

  On average, the output gap is a bout ¼ percentage point wider th an in our previous 
projection, while the unemployme nt rate is 0.1 percentage point  lower.      
We now estimate that the 12-mont h change in core PCE prices ros e from 
1.5 percent in March to 1.7 percen t in June, consistent with ou r assessment that the weak 
monthly inflation readings see n earlier this year would be tran sitory.  We expect the 
12-month change to rise further and be 1.9 percent at the end o f the year.  These figures 
are 0.1 percentage point higher than in the June Tealbook, refl ecting incoming data that 
were, on balance, a little above our expectations.  For the med ium term, we now expect 
core PCE inflation to rema in at 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2021, as tight resource utilization 
holds inflation slightly above our  estimate of its underlying pace.  Total PCE price 
inflation is forecast to run a bit below core inflation over th e forecast period because of 
the projected downward-sloping path of oil prices.   
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Note:  The financial assumptions underlying the Tealbook projec tion are 
conditioned on financial marke t data through 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, July 17.  The 
effects of any subsequent market moves will be incorporated int o our usual pre-FOMC 
forecast update on July 26. 
Monetary Policy  
 The baseline policy rule calls f or the federal funds rate to ho ld flat at 
2.4 percent this year and then edge up to 2.7 percent by the en d of 2021.  In 
contrast, term-premium-adjuste d market quotes suggest that mark et 
participants expect the feder al funds rate to decline roughly 5 0 basis points by 
the end of 2020, with most of the de cline occurring this year.   
 Our assumptions for the SOMA portfolio, which will be detailed in the 
Balance Sheet and Income Pr ojections section of Tealbook B, imp ly that 
downward pressure on the term prem ium in Treasury yields diminishes over 
time.  
Other Interest Rates  
 We project that the 10-year Treas ury yield will rise from an average of 
2.1 percent this quarter to 2.9 pe rcent by the end of 2021, lar gely reflecting 
our assumption that the term premium will increase toward a mor e normal

 level during the next few years .  On average, the 10-year Treas ury yield is 
15 basis points lower than we ha d projected in June, as we now assume that 
the downward pressure on term premiums from global growth conce rns, 
prospective foreign monetary po licy actions, and uncertainty re garding 
international trade will be more persistent.  
The spread of the triple-B corporate bond yield o ver the 10-yea r Treasury
yield has decreased more than w e had previously assumed, and we  revised
down the path for the triple-B yield by more than the Treasury yield.  By
contrast, mortgage rate spreads have widened, and we revised do wn the path
for mortgage rates by a bit less than the 10-year Treasury rate .
Equity Prices  
Stock prices have increased 5.4 perc ent since the time of the J une Tealbook,
with some of the gains appare ntly supported by expectations of more
accommodative monetary policy.  As market expectations for the federal
funds rate are assumed to converg e toward our policy path, we e xpect
essentially no further apprecia tion in stock prices over the me dium term,
compared with 2 percent per ye ar in our June projection.  All t old, by the end
of 2021, equity prices are little revised.
Trade Policy  
At the G-20 Leaders Summit at the end of June, Presidents Trump and Xi
agreed to restart trade negotia tions and to postpone additional  broad-based
tariff increases indefinitely;  however, they did not alter the tariffs already in
place, including the 15 percentage point tariff increase on $18 0 billion of
imports from China that occurred on May 10.
On Friday, June 7, after the clo se of the June Tealbook, the Un ited States
removed the threat of additional tariffs on imports from Mexico  after the two
countries reached an agreement t o limit migration from Central America.
Notwithstanding these developments, trade policy will likely re main a focus
of attention and a significant source of uncertain ty for the economic outlook.

 Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
We estimate that foreign real  GDP growth stepped up from 1½ percent in the
first quarter to 2 percent in the second quarter, a pace still below our estimate
of potential growth.  Much of the  second-quarter step-up in gro wth comes
from a rebound in Canada and some recovery in Mexico and South America.
However, growth in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and China  slowed,
and our overall estimate of forei gn growth has been revised slightly lower in
the first half of this year.  Although we forecast foreign grow th to pick up to
about 2½ percent by next year, supported by very accommodative monetary
policy, the outlook remains murky.
Since the June Tealbook, the broa d nominal dollar has depreciat ed about
1 percent, with somewhat more depreciation against EME currenci es.  From a
lower starting point, the broad real dollar is projected to app reciate at an
annual rate of 1.2 percent, a bit faster than in the June Tealbook, reflecting our
revised expectations for more accommodative monetary policy in the AFEs.
All told, the broad real dolla r is revised slightly lower by 2021.
 Fiscal Policy  
We assume that fiscal policymakers will lift the discretionary spending caps,
as they have in recent years, so that the current level of disc retionary federal
spending will be maintained in real terms through 2021.  To lif t the caps for
fiscal year 2020, policymakers will need to enact legislation b efore the fiscal
year begins on October 1.2
Under these policy assumptions, the
 direct fiscal impetus from all levels of
government contributes 0.7 percen tage point to the growth rate in aggregate
demand this year—about the same as in 2018—before tapering to0.4 percentage point in 2020 a nd 0.2 percentage point in 2021.
3
2 The federal government is curre ntly in a debt issuance suspens ion period.  Absent additional 
borrowing authority, we expect that the debt limit will most likely be breached in the first week of October, 
although there is a significant risk that the limit could be br eached in early September.  We continue to 
assume that policymakers will raise the statutory debt limit be fore the breach date. 
3 If appropriations were to return to the lower levels of the bu dget caps later this year, we estimate 
that the level of GDP would be a bout ½ percent lower at the end of 2021.

   We expect the federal budget defi cit, which was 4 percent of GD P in fiscal 
2018, to widen to 4½ percent this fiscal year and to remain at about that level 
through the end of the medium term .  Federal debt held by the p ublic is 
projected to rise from 78 pe rcent of GDP in fiscal 2018 to 81 percent of GDP 
by the end of the medium term.         
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil is up about $3 per barrel fro m the June 
Tealbook, closing most recently at  $64 per barrel.  Farther-dated futures prices 
are up by a similar amount, and the f utures curve continues to slope down 
modestly.  Tensions with Iran a nd the nine-month extension of a n OPEC 
agreement to keep production lo w contributed to the higher oil prices.  
However, the upward pressure on p rices has likely been muted by  continued 
concerns about the ou tlook for global growth. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP 
We estimate that real GDP grow th slowed from about 3 percent in  the first quarter 
to 2½ percent in the second, refl ecting a sharp step-down in the growth of business fixed 
investment (BFI) and the reversa l of substantial boosts to first-quarter growth from net 
exports and inventory investment .  These second-quarter drags m ore than offset a strong 
rebound in consumer spending growth and a bounceback in federal  purchases following 
the government shutdown.  Compared with the June Tealbook, we h ave revised up our 
forecast for second-quarter GDP growth ¾ percentage point, prim arily reflecting the 
positive news on consumption.  We project GDP growth to slow fr om 2¾ percent in the 
first half to 1¾ percent in the s econd half, as infrastructure investment by state and local 
governments declines and business investment remains sluggish a mid ongoing concerns 
about trade tensions and global gr owth; in contrast, growth in consumer spending is 
projected to continue at about its first-half pace.4   
 Growth in consumer spending appe ars to have picked up in the second quarter 
by more than we had previously e xpected, as the May and June re adings for 
retail sales and June data for motor vehicl e sales surprised us to the upside.  In 
                                                 
4 We now assume that Midwest flooding has been holding down farm -sector output and will 
reduce GDP growth this year by 0.1 percentage point.  We contin ue to assume that production disruptions 
for the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft will deduct less than 0.1 perce ntage point from GDP growth this year.

  the near term, favorable sentiment and gains in labor income should continue 
to support spending, and we project PCE growth of 2.5 percent i n the second 
half of the year, the same as the  average pace in the first hal f. 
 The outlook for BFI remains weak.  After rising 7 percent last year and at a 4½ percent pace in the first quarter, BFI is expected to be abo ut unchanged 
through the end of this year.  The  box “The Weak Outlook for Business Fixed 
Investment” discusses our forecast for BFI in more detail.   
 We estimate that residential i nvestment continued to contract through the first 
half of 2019, but we anticipate tha t the recent decline in mort gage rates will 
result in a modest upturn in housing activity in the second hal f.  The 
information received since the June Tealbook is generally suppo rtive of this 
projection:  Sales of new and e xisting homes have moved up so far this year, 
and construction permits for single-family houses moved a little higher in May and June after having declined steadily since September of last year.   
 Manufacturing production increased in May and June, led by a rebound in the production of motor vehicles and p arts.  Nevertheless, over the  first half of the 
year, factory output declined at an annual rate  of 2¼ percent o n net.  Looking 
ahead, we expect some further gains in vehicle production; howe ver, 
excluding motor vehicles, we an ticipate that f actory output will remain soft in 
the second half, as indexes of ne w orders from manufacturing su rveys remain 
subdued, BFI has decelerated, and tr ade policy concerns are sti ll elevated.   
 We estimate that, on balance, ne t exports provided a modest pos itive 
contribution to U.S. GDP growth in the first half of the year.  Although export 
growth was depressed by the sus pension of exports of the Boeing  737 MAX 
aircraft, goods imports decline d following substantial strength  in late 2018.  
We expect that net exports will  be neutral for GDP growth in the second half.  
 Growth in government purchases w as unusually strong in the firs t half, partly 
reflecting a blistering 25 percent rate of increase in state an d local government 
infrastructure investment tha t is expected to partially unwind over the

 The Weak  Outlook for Business  Fixed Investment  
Growth of  business  fixed investment  (BFI) slowed from a brisk 7 percent pace  in 2018 to an 
estimated  2 percent annual rate in the first half of this year.  At the  same time, the tenor of a wide 
array of indicators  that inform our investment  outlook has  become decidedly  more downbeat,  
leading us to project no growth  in BFI ove
r the second half of the year.  
As shown in  figure 1, the slowdown  in 2019:H1 is centered  in equipment investment (blue bars),  
which appears to have moved sideways  over this period:  Nominal  shipments  of nondefense  
capital goods (excluding  aircraft) have been  roughly flat since late la st year,  while capital  goods 
imports have turned down.  Moreover,  new orders for capital  goods have gradually  moved down 
and now stand well below  shipments,  indicating  little impetus  to equipment spending  in coming 
months. 
Investment in  drilling and mining structures  (green bars)  has declined  in response  to lower oi l 
prices, and 
we expect it will decline  further, reflecting  the staff’s projected  oil price path.  
Investment in  other nonresidential  structures  (yellow bars) has also been lackluster,  and a recent 
drop in architectural  billings (not shown) points to further weakness ahead.  In  contrast,  
investment  in intellectual  property  (red bars) like software and  R&D has remained  solid. 
We expect BFI to be little changed  in the second half of the year and  then to rise modestly  over 
the medium term.  Some slowing in BFI growth this year would  be consistent  with the staff’s 
outlook for output  growth and interest rates.1  However,  our forecast is weaker than  what is 
implied by those two forces  alone, as it reflects our reaction to a  number of additional  factors.  
Two factors that are modest drags on our projection  for BFI are the delayed  deliveries  of the 
Boeing 737 Max and the direct effect of currently  imposed  tariffs. 
A more significant  factor 
is heightened  concern over  trade policy, which has likely contributed  to 
softer business  sentiment  (figure 2) and a pullback  in capital spending  plans.  The  ISM  
  
                                                 
1 The staff currently  estimates  that the 2017 tax cuts boosted BFI growth about  ¾ percentage  point in 2018 
and will contribute  a similar amount in 2019.  However,  the strength  in BFI last year and the slowdown  this year 
could suggest more front‐ loaded effects  from the tax cuts than we assumed.

 manufacturing  (black line) and  nonmanufacturing  (blue line) composite indexes  are down since 
last year, while the Philadelphia  Fed general activity index (red line) has been volatile, dropping in  
June and popping back up in July.  Most other regional Fed manufacturing  surveys and indicators  
from private sources, such as  the Markit and Duke CFO surveys, have also weakened  somewhat.  
Beige Book  commentary  tying concerns  about trade policy to reduced  investment  plans has 
become increasingly  prevalent.   More anecdotes  in 
business surveys have linked a weaker 
outlook for economic  activity and capital expenditures  to recent  tariff actions and increased  
trade tensions.   And measures  of economic  policy uncertainty  and the staff’s trade policy 
uncertainty  index have  soared.  However, corporate bond  spreads and the VIX— which also 
proxy 
for business  uncertainty—remain historically  low, and  financing  conditions  more generally  still 
appear accommodative  for businesses.2 
Finally, analysts’  expectations  for longer ‐term profits growth, shown in figure 3, have 
deteriorated  sharply and reversed  the run‐up that followed  the enactment  of the 2017 tax cuts.  
Some of the decline could be related to those tax  changes—growth expectations  should slow 
once profits reach a permanently  higher level—but we think such a  slowing would unfold more 
gradually.   Instead,  we think the 
recent deterioration in  profit expectations  more likely reflects 
other factors like the escalation  in trade tensions and concerns  about the global  outlook. 
As shown in  figure 4, including  profit expectations  in our workhorse  investment  model for 
equipment  and intangibles  (E&I) impro ves its  fit and implies a more pessimistic  investment  
outlook this year.3  The model improvement likely  reflects the forward‐ looking nature of profit 
expectations  and their ability to capture  unobserved  “animal spirits,” an influence  that is largely 
absent from our measures  of business  output and the user cost.4  All told, the diverse set of 
factors previously  mentioned  suggest that BFI will remain  anemic this year.

  remainder of the year.5  The anticipated slowing in total government spending 
contributes ½ percentage point to the second-half deceleration in GDP. 
After increasing 2¼ percent this ye ar, real GDP growth is proje cted to slow to 
2 percent in 2020 and 1¾ percent in 2021.  This gradual deceleration reflects the waning 
impetus from fiscal policy and, to a  lesser extent, the lagged effects of the earlier removal 
of monetary accommodation.  Although this forecast is condition ed on slightly lower 
interest rates through 2021 due to a  downward revision to the projected term premium, 
we think that some of the fact ors that have pushed down the ter m premium recently—
most notably, global growth con cerns and uncertainty regarding trade policy—will also 
weigh more persistently on ec onomic activity than we had previo usly expected.  Thus, 
although we have revised up GDP gr owth about ¼ percentage point this year in response 
to incoming data, growth ove r 2020 and 2021 is revised up just a touch. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The labor market has continued to tighten so far this year but at a more gradual 
pace than in 2018.  Job gains have been solid, on average, and the unemployment rate has 
moved lower, on net, from late last year.  Looking ahead, we ex pect payroll gains to slow 
further over the medium term and t he labor market to tighten on ly a little further. 
 Total nonfarm payrolls rose  224,000 in June following gains of 72,000 in May 
and 216,000 in April.  On average, these readings are a little higher than what 
we expected in the June Tealbook a nd well above the monthly gai ns of 90,000 
to 120,000 that we estimate are n eeded to keep labor utilizatio n constant.6  
With GDP projected to decelerate over the medium term, we expec t payroll 
gains to slow from an avera ge monthly pace of 155,000 in the se cond half of 
this year to about 110,000 in 2021.  
o Private nonfarm payrolls, both as reported by the BLS and based  on the 
staff’s measure that is derived f rom microdata from the payroll -processing 
                                                 
5 The increase in infrastructure investment may reflect latent d emand, as these expenditures have 
been quite subdued for many year s.  Moreover, in recent years, a majority of states have legislated 
increases in their motor fuel tax es, which are generally earmar ked for transportati on infrastructure.  
However, in part because infrastructure investment tends to be very volatile, we expect it to drop back 
somewhat over the re st of the year.  
6 This is the range that would be, on average, consistent with n o change in the unemployment rate 
and a decline in the participation rate in line with its trend over the next year.

 firm ADP, have decelerated sin ce last year.  However, the ADP-b ased 
measure was notably weaker than the BLS measure in both May and  June.  
The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7 percent in June from 3.6 percent in
May, but it has nonetheless edged down, on balance, since the e nd of last year.
Looking ahead, we expect the un employment rate to hold steady a t 3.7 percent
through year-end and then to edge do wn to 3.6 percent in early 2020.  In 2020
and 2021, the unemployment rate i s 0.1 percentage point below t he June
Tealbook projection, reflecting the wider output gap in this pr ojection.
The LFPR edged up to 62.9 percent in June from 62.8 percent in the previous
two months.  The LFPR has moved i n a wide range over the past y ear but has
been little changed on net.  Whe n judged against its aging-rela ted downward
trend, an unchanged LFPR represent s a modest tightening in labo r market
utilization.  We expect some fu rther tightening along this marg in, as the LFPR
remains flat through 2020 and the n starts to edge down in 2021.
We estimate that output per hour i n the business sector increas ed at an average
annual rate of 3½ percent in the f irst half of this year after having increased at
a 1¾ percent pace in 2018.  This recent surge likely overstates  the true gains
in productivity, as it re flects in large part a steep decline i n a poorly measured
and volatile component of aggregat e hours.  Moreover, with GDI growth
looking weaker than GDP growth early this year, it is also poss ible that output
growth was overstated.  Given the se factors, we have not yet ta ken much
signal from the strong readings on productivity for our medium- term
projection.7  With productivity expected to post a small decline in the sec ond
half (largely reflecting a parti al reversal of the unusual hour s movements), we
project productivit y to rise about 1½ percent this year, about ¼ percentage
point faster than both our previous  projection and its structur al rate.  We
continue to expect that productivity growth will slow further i n 2020 and 2021
to a pace slightly below its struc tural rate, as the tight labo r market continues
to draw in workers with low er-than-average skills.
7 We will revisit our assumptions  for structural productivity an d other components of the supply 
side in the September Tealbook after we have digested the impli cations of the upcoming NIPA annual 
revisions.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Core PCE inflation is expected  to remain at 1.9 percent through  the medium term, 
a little above our estimate  of its underlying pace of 1.8 perce nt, as the effects of tight 
resource utilization more than o ffset a slight drag from import prices that emerges after 
this year.  (The box “The Unemployment Rate Consistent with 2 P ercent Inflation” 
provides a simple calculation of t he unemployment rate needed t o achieve a 2 percent 
inflation rate given our estim ate of underlying inflation.)  Wi th energy prices expected to 
edge down over the forecast peri od, total PCE inflation is proj ected to run just a little 
below core inflation through 2021.           
 Monthly increases in core PCE  prices stepped up noticeably in t he second 
quarter from their transitorily low first-quarter readings; as a result, the 
12-month change in core PCE pr ices, which had dipped to 1.5 per cent in 
March, is estimated to have m oved up to 1.7 percent in June.  T he 12-month 
change is then expected to ris e to 1.9 percent in August, as la st August’s 
particularly weak reading drops  out of the calculation, and to remain at 
1.9 percent through December.  Core inflation in the second hal f is also 
boosted by the pass-through of this May’s tariff increases. 
o The incoming monthly inflation da ta, including the CPI and PPI for 
May and June and PCE prices through May, were, on balance, a li ttle 
above our expectations in the J une Tealbook.  However, the upside 
surprises were concentrated in the volatile nonmarket category of PCE 
prices, which tends to have littl e signal for fut ure price chan ges.  
Accordingly, we did not materially change our forecast for mont hly 
price increases in the second half  of this year; the resulting 12-month 
changes in core PCE prices are  0.1 percentage point higher than  in the 
June Tealbook. 
o We estimate that total PCE pri ces rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months 
ending in June, and we expect thi s measure of inflation to incr ease to 
1.8 percent in December.  In addition to the anticipated step-u p in core 
inflation, we expect food prices t o rise more rapidly in the se cond half 
of the year, driven by recent in creases in livestock and crop 
commodity prices.

 We estimate that the effective price for imported core goods (w hich includes
the effect of tariffs) rose 0.6 pe rcent in the f irst half of th e year, somewhat less
than we expected in the June Tealbook, as falling prices for im ported foods
and industrial supplies, particu larly metals, partially offset a boost from the
most recent increase in tariffs on imports from China.8  For the second half of
the year, we expect effective co re im
port price inflation to step up to
2.3 percent as tariff effects co ntinue to be felt and the drag from falling metals
prices wanes.  After this year, c ore import price inflation ave rages 0.9 percent,
reflecting moderate foreign inf lation and an appreciating dolla r.
The preliminary July reading of  median long-run i nflation expectations from
the University of Michigan m oved up to 2.6 percent from 2.3 percent in June.
After drifting lower over 2015 and 2016, this measure has moved  sideways
since then, fluctua ting around 2.5 percent.
oIn the current projection, we have  maintained our view that und erlying
inflation is 1.8 percent and that it will hold steady at this l evel over the
medium term.  This assumption is informed by estimates of under lying
inflation obtained from a variet y of statistical models, some o f which
incorporate information on inflation expectations.
We continue to expect increases in hourly compensation to remai n moderate over 
the medium term.  The employmen t cost index (ECI) is projected to rise 2¾ percent per 
year, close to the average pace  over the past couple of years.  In contrast, we project that 
compensation per hour in the business sector, which is more cyc lically sensitive than the 
ECI (and also noisier), will step up from around 3 percent this  year to around 3½ percent 
next year, as this year’s particu larly low first-quarter readin g is not repeated.   
Average hourly earnings rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in June,
about as projected in the June Tealbook, and we expect the 12-m onth change
will remain between 3 and 3¼ percent over the coming months.9
8 The estimated boost to effective import price inflation from t he May 10 increase in tariffs is 
spread over the second and third quarters.   
9 The BLS will release the June est imate of the ECI on the secon d day of the FOMC meeting.

 The Unemployment Rate Consistent with  2 Percent I nflation  
The staff assess es that underlying inflation —the rate  of inflation that will prevail when the 
unemployment rate is equal to its  natural rate, when relative prices of imports and energy remain 
unchanged , and when there are no other price shocks —is currently 1.8  percent.  If  underlying 
inflation were to remain unchanged at this level, what unemployment rate would be consistent 
with PCE price inflation running at  the Committee’s  2 percent  objective ?1   
To ans
wer this question, w e use a stylized Phillips curve model that closely mimics the staff’s 
judgmental inflation framework.  T his framework  is summarized by equation (1), which relates  
core inflation  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡) to its own lag , underlying inf lation  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1∗), the difference between the 
unemployment rate and the natural rate (𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡∗), changes in core import price s and energy 
prices relative to core PCE prices , and other shocks  (εt):  
𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡=  𝛼𝛼𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1+ (1−𝛼𝛼)𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡−1∗− 𝛽𝛽(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡−𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡∗) +  𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟  𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑝𝑝𝑟𝑟 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑟𝑟𝑎𝑎+ εt. (1) 
For any given rate of underlying in flation  (𝜋𝜋∗) and no changes in relative prices  or other shocks , 
we can calculate the unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation  as 
                                                                         𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡∗−1−𝛼𝛼
𝛽𝛽(2−𝜋𝜋∗).                                                                    (2) 
The factors  that determine  the difference between  the unemployment rate consistent with 
2 perce nt and the natural rate are α, which captures the persistence of inflation ; β, the “slope” of 
the Phillips curve; and the wedge between the underlying rate of inflation  and 2 percent.  Setting  
the parameters in equation (2) to be consistent with those in the staff’s judgmental forecast —α 
is 0.3; β is 0.12 —the resulting unemployment rate is  3.4 percent, noticeably below the staff’s 
natural rate of 4.6 percent .2 
Of course, th is estimate must be viewed with caution , given the uncertainty around the true 
inflation process  and the fact that this process could change over time, particularly if 
unemployment were to remain persistently very low .  For example, some model estimates 
suggest that  the Phillips curve could be flatter than  we have assumed .  If we a ssumed  that β were 
0.06, the unemployment rate would need to be even lower—around 2¼ percent —to achieve 
2 percent inflation.  Alternatively, t he Phillips curve could be nonlinear, with a slope at low levels 
of unemployment that is considerably steeper than w e have assumed , which would raise the 
required  unemployment rate.   Or underlying inflation  could move up or down , pushing the 
required unemployment rate up or down at the same time.3 
                                                 
1 In the staff’s projection, underlying inflation holds at 1.8 percent through 2021 but eventually moves up 
to 2 percent. 
2 In the staff projection, import prices are expected to rise more slowly than core PCE prices, on average, 
in 2020 and 2021, exerting about a 0.1 percentage point drag on core PCE  price  inflation.  Thus, in our medium -
term projection , the unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent PCE price  inflation is lower than 3.4 percent.  
3 In fact, if underlying inflation became more sensitive to past inflation, as in an accelerationist Phi llips 
curve, then the inflation objective could be sustainably achieved only with the unemployment rate equal to the 
natural rate , as holding the unemployment rate below the natural rate would lead to persistently rising inflation.

  THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We continue to assume that the natural rate of unemployment wil l remain at 
4.6 percent.  We also still assume  that potential output growth  will slow after 
2021 to 1.7 percent per year in th e longer run, as the boost to  potential growth 
from the 2017 tax cuts wanes.  
 We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equili brium federal 
funds rate will be 0.5 percent.  The nominal yield on 10-year T reasury 
securities is 3.4 percen t in the longer run.  
o We continue to assume that fiscal policymakers will eventually start to 
gradually reduce primary deficits  by an amount sufficient to st abilize 
the debt-to-GDP ratio.  We expect  this ratio to level off at around 
105 percent, 20 percentage points higher than would have occurr ed in 
the absence of the 2017–18 federal  tax and discretionary spending 
changes and our assumption that the spending caps will not go b ack in 
place this year.  We also still assume that this 20 percentage point 
increment to the debt-to-GDP ratio will push up the term premiu m on 
10-year Treasury yields 50 ba sis points in the long run. 
 GDP growth slows from 1.8 percent in 2021 to 1.3 percent in 202 4, as 
monetary policy provides some res traint and the contribution fr om fiscal 
policy fades a little further.  The unemployment rate moves up gradually from 
3.6 percent at the end of 2021 toward its assumed natural rate in subsequent 
years.  Core PCE price infla tion moves up from 1.9 percent in 2021 to 
2.0 percent by 2023. 
 Given the outlook for inflation a nd resource utilization, the n ominal federal 
funds rate remains around 2.7 percent from the end of the mediu m term 
through 2024, and it declines slowl y to its long-run value of 2 .5 percent 
thereafter.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The outlook for the global economy remains murky .  Incoming data are  consistent 
with a pickup in foreign economic growth last quarter from its very subdued pace earlier 
this year, but growth likely remained below its potential pace.  Moreover, activity 
indicators have been a bit weaker than expected, leading us to revise down modestly our estimate of growth in the first half of this year .  Given  concerns about the global outlook 
and little underlying inflation pressure, we expect foreign central banks to pursue more accommodative monetary policies than we had anticipated in the June Tealbook.  
We estimate that growth abroa d increased to an annual rate of 2.0 percent in the 
second quarter from the 1.5 percent pace observed in the previous two quarters but remained below its estimated potential pace of 2 .4 percent.  Nevertheless, we are not sure 
that the global economy has made it out of its soft patch.  The pickup in growth is concentrated in Canada and, to a lesser extent, Mexico (countries that have a particularly large imprint on our trade-weighted measure of foreign growth).  In addition, global manufacturing remains depr essed, with Germany showing particular weakness and only 
sparse positive signs elsewhere.  
We expect foreign growth to edge up to a pace close to its potential by early next 
year, with growth stabilizing in advanced foreign economies (AFEs), being supporte d by 
accommodative monetary policy, and rising in emerging market economies (EMEs) due, in part, to an improvement in the high-tech sector.  However, this outlook is hardly assured.  Most notably, the global slide in the manufacturing sector may extend further, perhaps because the elevated uncertainty around trade policies could weigh on 
investment to a greater degree than we have assumed in our baseline outlook.  Moreover, 
trade tensions could escalate, with the United States imposing additional tariffs on  
imports from China and Mexico and on automobile imports.  We explore both of these scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  We also anticipate a resurfacing of risks 
surrounding a “no deal” Brexit in the fall.  
Foreign inflation is estimated to hav e stepped up in the second quarter, reflecting 
an acceleration in energy prices as well as EME food prices.  In the AFEs, underlying inflation continues to be low, with 12-month core inflation in the euro area and Japan still far below  central bank targets .  Against the backdrop of muted inflation pressures, 
subdued GDP growth, and pronounced risks to the global outlook, we foresee a more

  accommodative foreign monetary policy stance.  We expect the European Central Bank 
(ECB) to cut its deposit rate in September and to resume its large- scale asset purchase 
program later this year.  We also pushed back our assumptions for the timing of further 
rate hikes by the Bank of Canada (BOC) and Bank of England (BOE) and now expect shallower tightening cycles over the forecast period.  In the EMEs, several central banks, including Chile, India, Indonesia, Russia, and South Korea, have cut policy rates, and others have adopted more dovish rhetoric. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
• Euro Area.  Recent i ndicators continue to point to lackluster growth.  Industrial 
production through May and PMIs through June suggest that GDP growth slowed to 1 percent in the second quarter from 1.6 percent in the first.  The slowdown partly reflected the tapering of temporary fact ors that had boosted growth earlier, such as a 
partial payback in car production from the slump in the second half of 2018, but also 
continuing weakness in German manufacturing.  Given the weak underlying momentum , we expect growth to  edge up only slightly later this year and to pick up a 
bit more appreciably thereafter, rising to 1.8 percent (above potential) in 2021.  Relative to the June Tealbook, we revised down our estimate for the second quarter 0.2 percentage point in light of modestly disappointing data but marked up our forecast for 2020 and 2021 a touch , in line with our assumption for more 
accommodative monetary policy. 
Headline inflation on a 12-month basis was 1.3 percent in June, while core inflation 
was 1.1 percent.  Going forward, w e expect inflation to reach only 1.4 percent in 
2021, even as the output gap closes .  Given the subdued outlook for inflation and lack 
of momentum in growth, we now expect the ECB to cut its deposit rate by 20 basis points in September (to negative 0.6 percent) and to restart its asset purchase program 
in the fourth quarter, purchasing €30 billion per month through the end of 2020.  We 
also project that the d eposit rate will remain negative throughout the forecast period, 
ending 2021 at negative 0.5 percent , 0.5 percentage point lower than assumed in the 
June Tealbook.  
• United Kingdom.  Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on economic activity .  We 
estimate that r eal GDP contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter, f ollowing a 
2 percent expansion in the first.  This estimate is 0.9 percentage point weaker than in 
the June Tealbook, reflecting a larger- than-expected reversal from the pre- Brexit

 stockpiling th at had boosted growth in the first quarter as well as temporary 
shutdowns by several car manufacturers.  Amid elevated political uncertainties, 
growth should remain relatively subdued, averaging a modest 1.3 percent in the second half of the year.  Although the risk of a no- deal Brexit has materially 
increased  (and other outcomes, such as another extension or a reversal of Brexit, are 
still on the table ), our outlook assumes an orderly Brexit in the fourth quarter, 
followed by a long transition period.  Accordingly, with uncertainty gradually fading 
and monetary policy remaining accommodative, we project that growth will pick up a 
bit and settle at 1.6 percent in 2020 and 2021, about its potential rate .  
Headline 12 -month inflation stayed at 2 percent in June, while core inflation was only 
1.7 percent.  With the BOE’s recent communications citing elevated downside risks to the growth outlook, we now assume a more accommodative path for monetary policy.  We expect the policy rate to rise from its current ra te of 0.75 percent to only 
1 percent by early 2021 and stay at that level thereafter, 0.5 percentage point lower 
than in the June Tealbook.  
•Japan.  A fter strong growth in the first quarter, indicators  suggest that real GDP was
about flat in the second, as  a surge  in private consumption was offset by a rebound in
imports.   Looking through the volatility from the consumption tax hike scheduled for
October, we expect GDP growth to be near zero in the second half of the year.  Overthe next two years , we see GDP growth slightly above its potential pace of
0.7 percent, supported by additional spending related to the 2020 Tok yo Olympics
and very accommodative monetary policy.
The 12-month changes in total and core CPI edged down to 0.8 percent and
0.3 percent, r espectively, in May.  After the boost provided by the upcoming tax hike,
we expect total inflation to stabilize at 1 percent in  2021.  With underlying inflation
still quite far from the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) 2 percent inflation target, we expect theBOJ to  keep its deposit rate at negative 0.1 percent  and to continue to purchase assets
to keep the 10-year sovereign yield around the current target of zero percentthroughout the forecast period.
•Canada.  After a soft patch  around the turn of the year due to temporary cutbacks in
oil production, we estimate that growth picked up in the second quarter as oilproduction rebounded.  Recent data, notably monthly GDP for April, suggest that realGDP growth was 2.6 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 0.4 percent pace

  in the first.  We expect growth to average 1.7 percent over the forecast period .  
Relative to the June Tealbook, we revised up a touch our outlook in the second and 
third quarters because of better -than-expected incoming data.   
In June, 12- month inflation slowed to the BOC’s  2 percent target, and we expect it to 
hover around that rate over the remainder of the forecast period .  At its July meeting, 
the BOC  kept its policy rate unchanged at 1.75 percent but highlighted downside 
risks, including elevated trade tensions.  Accordingly, we now expect the next rate 
hike to occur in mid -2021, compared with late 2020 in our June forecast. 
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
• China .  China’s GDP growth slowed sharply to 5.6 percent in the second quarter, 
from 7.3 percent in the first.  Much of this slowdown was expected and reflected 
payback from a spike in industrial production in the first quarter, which may have been related to ch anges in tax policy.  But c ontractions in exports and imports and a 
manufacturing PMI below 50 also portray an economy facing lackluster demand, possibly as a result of the trade tensions with the United States.  Although retail sales 
for June strengthened, that pickup was boosted by a one- off surge in auto sales as car 
dealers discounted prices ahead of a change in auto emission standards.  A pickup in credit growth in June, however, suggests that the authorities are cautiously stepping up policy support, and we see growth edging up to 5.8 percent  in the second half of 
the year.  For 2019 as a whole, year-on-year growth is expected to be 6.2 percent, 
within the government’s target range of 6 to 6.5 percent, and also about in line with our admittedly tenuous estimates of potential growth.  
• Other Emerging Asia.  Incoming data point to a softer- than-expected recovery in the 
second quarter.  We now estimate that real GDP growth picked up from 2.4 percent in the first quarter to 2.8 percent in the second, 0.3 percentage point less than our June forecast.  Industrial production weakened in May following April’s strong print, manufacturing PMIs fell across the region in June, and Singapore’s real GDP unexpectedly contracted in the s econd quarter.  On the positive side, exports in the 
region holding steady in the second quarter following contractions in the previous two 
quarters, and high-tech indicators suggest a recovery, albeit a sluggish one, for the 
industry.  Recovery in manufacturing, together with support from fiscal policy in some countries, should boost growth to 3.5 percent by the end of the year, about its

  potential pace, and it should remain at about that level  over the remainder of the 
forecast period.  
• Mexico.   Recent  data have been mixed but, on balance, suggest that GDP expanded 
modestly in the second quarter after contracti ng in the first.  Manufacturing 
production growth increased , boosted by strong exports, and private consumption 
rebounded.  However, plunging construction activity and weak ness in  services have 
weighed on growth .  We now expect the economy to grow at a sluggish 0.5 percent 
pace in the second quarter, about 1 percentage point below our June Tealbook 
forecast.  Growth should then pick up gradually to a still-unimpressive 2.5 percent by 
the end  of 2020, supported by stronger  U.S. manufacturing production and some 
monetary policy easing by the Bank of Mexico (BOM) .  However, the recent 
resignation of the f inance minister, who decried the administration’ s erratic economic 
policies , has increased policy uncertainty, and a potential loss of investor confidence 
poses a material downside risk to our forecast.  
Twelve-month inflation fell to 3.9 percent in June, pulled down by energy prices .  
Citing still-ongoing pressures from wage growth and core inflation, the B OM left its 
policy rate unchanged at 8.25 percent in June.  However, it changed its assessment of 
inflation risks to neutral from tilted to the upside, with one member of the monetary policy committee voting for a rate cut.  We continue to expect the BOM to begin cutting its policy rate in the fourth quarter of this year. 
• Brazil .  Incoming data provide little basis for optimism about the Brazilian economy.   
The unemployment rate remai ned in double digits, retail sales were weak, and 
industrial production stayed depressed, partially reflecting a dam disaster earlier this year.  We estimate that GDP growth in the second quarter was barely positive, avoiding a technical recession.  On the bright side, the pension reform cleared a major hurdle when it was approved by the lower house of Congress.  Assuming the passage of the reform this year, diminished uncertainty and increases in business confidence should boost growth gradually to 2.5 percent by next year .  We now expect that 
authorities will loosen monetary policy in the fourth quarter amid inflation close to its 
target of 4 percent and lackluster domestic demand. 
• Turkey.  The independence of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) 
was dealt another blow after President Erdogan ousted Governor Murat Cetinkaya.  He was  replaced by Murat Uysal, formerly one of the CBRT’s deputy governors.

  President Erdogan, an ardent critic of high interest rates, reportedly warned Cetin kaya 
multiple times to cut policy rates —which were  raised last August in response to 
financial volatility and rising inflation —and fired him when he did not oblige.  The 
firing dashed  hopes of a return to a more orthodox approach to macroeconomic 
policymak ing after Erdogan’s party fared worse than expected in recent local 
elections.  Turkish asset prices fell in the aftermath of the firing  of Cetinkaya— with 
the lira depreciating and bond yields and credit spreads rising—although the market 
reaction was relatively muted.

 Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, finan cial market developments ref lected noticeable 
shifts in expectations for monet ary policy in response to Federal Reserve communications 
and economic data releases, and t he expected path of policy mov ed down slightly, on net, 
over the period.  Currently, both m arket- and survey-based evid ence suggest that market 
participants see a 25 basis point  reduction in the target range as the most likely outcome 
at the July meeting, but that they also place some weight on a 50 basis point reduction.  
Federal Reserve communications w ere generally regarded as more accommodative than 
had been anticipated, exerting dow nward pressure on measures of  the expected path for 
the federal funds rate.  However , some better-than-expected economic data releases and a 
slight improvement in the outlook regarding trade partially off set these declines.  Yields 
on nominal Treasury securitie s also edged down on net.  Equity prices increased over the 
period, with notable gains on Federal Reserve communications an d announcements 
related to trade negotiations .  Corporate bond spreads narrowed .  The more-
accommodative-than-expected Federal Reserve communications, inc reased oil prices, and 
higher-than-expected inflati on data contributed to a rebound in  inflation compensation.  
 Measures of the expected level of  the federal funds rate at the  end of this year 
and beyond moved down a bit on net.  A straight read of OIS quo tes suggests 
a cumulative decline of 80 basis points this year, while a mode l that adjusts 
for term premiums suggests a reduction of 49 basis points.   
 Nominal Treasury yields fell 9 ba sis points and 4 basis points,  respectively, at 
the 2- and 10-year maturities.   
 Inflation compensation m oved up 16 basis points and 12 basis po ints, 
respectively, for the 5-year a nd the 5-to-10-year horizons to 1 .65 percent and 
1.83 percent, respectively. 
 The S&P 500 index increased 2.7 percent and its option-implied volatility—
the VIX—decreased somewhat.  Inve stment-grade and high-yield co rporate 
bond spreads narrowed 13 basis poi nts and 17 basis points, respectively.  
 Global equity indexes increased s lightly and the exchange value  of the dollar 
decreased modestly on balance.

 DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Measures of expectations for near-term domestic monetary policy  exhibited 
notable shifts and reversals ove r the intermee ting period and e nded the period down 
slightly, on net, with market participants appe aring to continu e to attach the greatest 
weight to a 25 basis point reducti on in the target range for th e federal funds rate at the 
July meeting.  Investors also c ontinue to place some weight on a 50 basis point reduction.  
The June FOMC statement and pre ss conference, as well as the Ch air’s remarks during 
his July Monetary Policy Report testimony, were inter preted as being more 
accommodative than had been expected, exerting downward pressur e on market-based 
measures of policy expectations .  However, expectations for mon etary policy also reacted 
noticeably to better-than-expected economic data releases, such  as the June employment 
report, and to a slight easing of n ear-term trade tensions at t he G-20 meeting, which 
exerted partially offset ting upward pressure. 
Consistent with significant vari ation in near-term expectations  for monetary 
policy, market-based indicators of  interest rate uncertainty re mained somewhat elevated.  
The option-implied volatility for six-month-ahead one-year swap  rates hovered near the 
top of its range since 2010.     
Market-based expecta tions for the federal funds rate for the en d of this year and 
beyond moved down a bit on net.  A straight read of OIS forward  rates implies that the 
federal funds rate will declin e about 80 basis points in 2019 a nd about 30 basis points in 
2020.  In contrast, a staff model th at adjusts for term premium s indicates only a 49 basis 
point decline in the rate by y ear-end 2019 and is consistent with a flat path for the federal 
funds rate in 2020.     
The nominal U.S. Treasury yield c urve declined and steepened sl ightly, on net, 
over the intermeeting period.  Nomin al Treasury yields at the 2 - and 10-year maturities 
fell 9 basis points and 4 basis poi nts, respectively.  Both the  near-term forward spread 
and the spread between 10-year a nd three-month Treasury yields are still i n the bottom 
decile of their respectiv e distributions since 1971.1  On net, since the June FOMC 
meeting, 5-year and 5-to-10-year T IPS-based inflation compensat ion moved up 16 basis 
points and 12 basis points, respectively, and now stand at 1.65  percent and 1.83 percent.  
1 Some research suggests that the  near-term forward spread is a bit more informative in terms of 
predicting a transition to recession in the subsequent four qua rters, compared with some popular measures 
such as the spread between 10-y ear and 2-year Treasury yields.

 More-accommodative-than-expected Federal Reserve communications , stronger-than-
expected inflation data releases, and rising oil prices—amid increased geopolitical 
tensions with Iran—contribute d to the upward pressure on inflat ion compensation. 
 Broad stock price indexes in creased 2.7 percent, on net, over the intermeeting 
period, with notable increases fo llowing the June FOMC communic ations, the Chair’s 
July Monetary Policy Report  testimony, and announcements regarding trade negotiations 
following the G-20 meeting.  Equity  price increases were broad based across major 
sectors, with technology, consumer  staples, and consumer discretionary firms 
outperforming broad indexes.  Sto ck prices of firms with high e xposure to China reacted 
more positively than stock prices  of firms with low exposure to  the announcement that 
China and the United States ag reed at the G-20 meeting to hold off on imposing new 
tariffs.  One-month option-implie d volatility on the S&P 500 index (the VIX) decreased 
somewhat, on net, and now stands near the 24th percentile of it s historical range. 
Yields on corporate bonds decrease d a touch, approaching historic lows.  Spreads 
on investment-grade and specula tive-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity 
Treasury yields narrowed 13 basi s points and 17 basis points, r espectively.  Corporate 
bond spreads are somewhat low by his torical standards but remai n above the very low 
levels that prevailed in early 2018. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Accommodative central bank comm unications, both in the United S tates and 
abroad, and some easing of tra de tensions supported global risk  assets over the 
intermeeting period.  On balance,  these developments weighed on  the exchange value of 
the dollar, which ended the period slightly weaker. 
Expectations for further policy accommodation i n the euro area firmed following 
the nomination of Christine Lagar de as the next president of th e European Central Bank 
(ECB).  This development, al ong with ongoing reaction to ECB Pr esident Draghi’s mid-
June speech suggesting that the ECB would respond to a deterior ation in the inflation 
outlook, pushed euro-area yields to record lows.  Notably, the 10-year German bund yield 
briefly fell below the ECB’s deposit facility rate of negative 40 basis points.  However, 
core euro-area yields retraced t heir earlier declines following  stronger-than-expected 
industrial production data for Ma y released later in the period .  Euro-area peripheral 
spreads narrowed significantl y, including a 57 basis point drop  in Italian spreads as the

 government passed some fiscal consolidation measures.  Extremely low yields continue 
to weigh on the profitability of European banks (see the box “I nterest Rate Expectations 
and Market Performance of European Banks”).  In Canada, strong consumer price and 
wage data releases pushed up long-term yields.  These moves were partially offset by 
Bank of Canada communications e mphasizing downside risks to the outlook, leaving the 
10-year Canadian yield 8 basis  points higher, on net, over the intermeeting period.
Global equity indexes increase d slightly over the intermeeting period, supported 
by expectations for further monetary accommodation by major cen tral banks and some 
lessening of trade uncertainty.  A t the G-20 meeting, the Unite d States and China agreed 
to restart trade negotiations and to indefinitely postpone tari ffs on the remaining 
$300 billion of Chinese imports.  T he U.S. Adminis tration also announced an easing of 
restrictions on U.S. firms’ sales to Huawei, which boosted global technology stocks.  
The broad dollar index declined a bout 1 percent since the June FOMC meeting, in 
part as a result of narrowing yiel d differentials between the U nited States and AFEs.  
Reduced trade uncertainty contri buted to the dollar depreciatio n against EME currencies.  
Expected policy accommodation by a dvanced-economy central banks  supported EME 
asset prices, and EME bond flows were positive in recent weeks.   Turkish assets came 
under pressure following the une xpected replacement of the head  of the Turkish central 
bank; there was no evidence of s pillovers into other markets. 
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Conditions in domestic short-term  funding markets remained stab le.  The EFFR 
averaged 2.40 percent over the i ntermeeting period but reached a high of 2.42 percent, its 
highest spread to IOER yet but sti ll well within the target range.  Secured rates were also 
elevated, with the SOFR averag ing 2.44 percent.  Rates on overn ight CP changed little 
since the previous FOMC mee ting, while rates on longer-term uns ecured instruments 
such as three-month negotiable CD s declined on net.  ON RRP take-up increased 
somewhat over the intermeeting period, averaging about $12 bill ion per day, reflecting 
the attractiveness of the ON RR P relative to low Treasury bill rates.  Assets under 
management of government MMFs con tinued to increase over the period.

 Interest Rate  Expectations and  
Market Performance of European Banks  
Disappointing data and dovish communication s from the European Central Bank 
(ECB) over the past several months , stressing a weaker growth outlook , have  
contribut ed to a further  decline in the expected path of ECB policy rates  and 
raised concerns about the earnings outlook for European banks .  Since mid -April, 
the broad index of European corporate share prices is li ttle changed, but  
European bank share prices have  declined  notably.  Over the same period, 
market participants  have  not pric ed in additional default risk  for financial firms 
compared  to corporates .  This fact suggests market participants assess that 
lower -for-longer interest rates will not have significant  effects on the safety and 
soundness of large European banks  and, by implication, on financial stability . 
A weaker European economy would  likely depress profits at both  European 
corporates and banks ; however, banks  would  bear the brunt of lower -for-longer 
interest rate policies , which have been shown to compress banks’ net interest 
margins .1  Indeed, we see a notable divergence of stock  performance of 
European corporates and banks.   As shown in  figure 1, coinciding with the steep 
decline in expected ECB policy rates  implied by overnight index swaps  (the red 
line) , the European bank stock index (the black  line) has underperformed the 
broad European stock index  (the blue line) .

The underperformance of European banks relative to the broader market is not 
new.  For example, t he right  panel of figure 1 shows  that the divergence in 
corporate and bank stock prices  largely coincides  with  the overall downward 
trend in ECB policy expectations  since late 2018 .  The declines in the bank index 
are broad  based and influenced only slightly by the roughly 50  percent decline  
since January 1, 2018 , in Deutsche Bank’s stock price .  Deutsche Bank’s stock price  
has been  adversely affected  by chronically low profitability, legacy problems , 
market pessimism about its newest, drastic restructuring plan , and the recent 
step -down in interest rate expectations . 
The market does not appear to be inferring any implications of the changes in the 
euro -area economic outlook and ECB policy rates for  financial stability because , 
on net, the cost of protection against default risk of European financials has 
fallen and has not changed relative to that of European corporates , as illustrated 
in figure 2.  Credit default swap ( CDS ) indexes  of senior debt of European 
financials  (the black  line) and European investment -grade corporates (the blue  
line) have both declined in recent weeks to their lowest levels  since early 2018 .2  
Average CDS premiums of European financials’ s ubordinated deb t (not shown) , 
which is more sensitive to default risk than senior debt,  are also  little changed .  
These trends  impl y that the factors driving corporate default risk —mainly the 
economic outlook —are also driving the default risk of European financials, and 
that expectations of lower-for-long er rates do not appear to be have added to 
default risk of  European banks.  
Figure 2:  European CDS Indexes
2 The European financials index includes banks (roughly 75 percent weight) and insurance 
companies (roughly 25 percent weight) .

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Financing conditions for businesses and households were little changed over the 
intermeeting period and  remained generally supportive of spending.  Net debt financing 
for businesses slowed  somewhat  from Ma y’s brisk pace but nonetheless posted solid 
gains in June.  Credit standards for loans to households generally remained  favorable for 
all but the riskiest borrowers.    
• Corporate bond issuance moderated  in June from the rapid  pace in May , 
though speculativ e-grade bond issuance increased strongly and yields near ed 
historical lows .  Institutional leveraged loan issuance picked up in May before 
returning  to a moderate pace in June.  
• Banks in the July 2019 SLOOS reported that standards for commercial and 
industr ial (C&I ) loans to large and middle -market firms  eased , on net, in  the 
second quarter.  Even so, C&I loan growth was fairly modest over the quarter 
as a whole.  
• Mortgage rates remained  near  their lowest level in two years , and credit 
standards continued to  be generally accommodative.    
• Consumer credit continued to expand at a moderate pace, with borrowing rates either flat or easing .  
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Businesses  
Financing conditions for businesses remained accommodative, with net d ebt 
financing  expanding in June at a pace in line with the average for recent years.   Total 
gross corporate bond issuance, while down from its outsize d pace in May, remained  
robust in June, with speculative -grade issuance increasing strongly and yields on 
corporate bonds slipping further  to near historic al lows.  Gross institutional leveraged 
loan issuance increased notably in May but subsequently returned to the more moderate 
pace observed earlier this year.   
Responses to the July 2019 SLOOS indicated that, on net, banks continued to eas e 
standards and terms on C&I loans to large and middle- market firms  in the second quarter, 
with many citing aggressive competition from other bank or nonbank lenders as the reason for doing so.  Standards for loans to small firms  changed little on net.  Consistent

 with the sustained trend of easing, banks reported that t he current level of standards for 
C&I loans was on the easier end of the range of standards that have prevailed since 2005.  
Apparently, easy supply conditions were offset by slackening demand, as  C&I loan 
growth was weak overall in the second quarter despite a modest pickup in June.   
Public equity issuance has been strong in recent months.  Very high levels of 
equity issuance through both initial and seasone d offerings  in May were followed up with 
solid numbers in June.  Overall, the market volatility in May left no discernible imprint 
on corporate fundraising. 
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of 
stabilization in June, f ollowing some deterioration earlier in the year .  Although the six-
month trailing nonfinancial bond default rate edged up in May, June saw few credit ratings changes while t he KMV expected year -ahead default rate ticked down during the 
intermeeting period to its lowest level since last September .  Meanwhile, expectations of 
year-ahead earnings per share for S& P 500 firms have been revised down only a touch in 
recent months after sharp downward revisions around the turn of the year.  
Small Businesses  
Availab le data suggest that the supply of credit to small businesses remained 
accommodative, while  demand continued to be somewhat weak.  Small business loan 
originations, as measured by the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index , continued to rise in May.  In addition, in the June National Federation of 
Independent Business (NFIB) survey, the net percent of respondents reporting that it was harder to obtain credit now than three months ago  was near post- crisis lows .  At the same 
time, the demand for credit  by small businesses appears to have remained muted .  Over 
half of small business owners in the June NFIB  poll continued to report that they were 
not interested in a loan, and a significant net share of SLOOS respondents reported 
weaker demand for C& I loans from small firms  in the second quarter.   
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions remained generally accommodative for commercial real 
estate (CRE)  despite a modest deceleration in bank loan growth.  Banks in the July 
SLOOS reported that standards were about unchanged, on net, in the second quarter for 
most CRE loan categories, although standards we re reportedly a bit tighter for 
multifamily loans—the slowest -growing CRE category at banks for that period.  A gency

 and non- agency commercial mortga ge-backed securities  issuance was strong in the 
second quarter, as yield  spreads ticked down.   
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions for state and local governments in municipal bond markets 
remained accommodative on balance.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds was robust in 
May and June, with new capital raising accounting for the majority of the issuance.  
Municipal bond yields, and spreads over comparable -maturity Treasury securities, 
decreased a touch in both secondary and primary markets .  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative 
over the intermeeting period .  Mortgage rates rose 18 basis points since the June FOMC  
meeting  but remain ed abou t 1 full percentage point below their late-2018 level.  
Underwriting standards—as measured by both SLOOS responses and maximum allowable debt -to-income ratio s—were little changed over the second quarter, although 
they remain tight for borrowers with low cr edit scores .  These conditions  have supported 
a modest increase in origination volume in recent months , with  home- purchase 
originations having  returned to around the solid levels seen in 2017. 
Refinance originations  have risen  as well  but remain near historic al lows.   
Although many borrowers look like they could benefit from refinancing at the current 
rate, refinancing activity is likely to remain muted .  Staff calculation s indicate that most 
of the borrowers who could benefit from refinancing previously re frained from doing so 
during periods with  similar ly low  rates.   These borrowers may be unaware of the 
potential savings or may be unable or unwilling to refinance for other reasons. 
Consumer Credit 
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed  in recent 
months and remained  generally supportive of consumer spending.  Growth in consumer 
credit in April and May was up a bit from earlier in the year due to a pickup in credit card 
balances.  Meanwhile, interest rates on credit card  account s were little  changed in the 
second quarter, while rates on auto loans continued to slip lower , on net, from highs 
observed earlier this year.

  Banks in the July SLOOS continued to report tightened standards for credit cards 
over the second quarter, tightening  that was  likely  concentrated on  individuals with low 
credit scores.  Indeed, SLOOS respondents also indicated that the level of standards  for 
subprime credit cards continued to be on the tighter end of the ir post- 2005 range , while 
standards for prime c redit cards  remained around the midpoint of their range.  
Nonetheless, another indicator of credit card supply— the mail volume of credit card 
offers —rose notably for nonprime borrowers in the second quarter.   
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL  CONDITIONS INDEXES  
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial 
corporations indicates that financing conditions have eased slightly over the intermeeting 
period and remain accommodative relative to historical standards. The modest easing in 
the index is consistent with the recent increase in equity prices and narrowing of 
corporate spreads over the same period.  As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook section, other publicly available financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set of financial variables into a summary series,  also pointed to either roughly unchanged or 
slightly more accommodative financial conditions .  Overall, these indexes indicate that 
broad financial conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical standards.

Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes 
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes .”  
Financing Conditions

July 19, 2019

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative -grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than inv estment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.   
The second index in the table  measures  the net share of domestic banks reporting tig hter lending 
standards across all core loan categories  in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices .  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial 
market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both  changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy.

John C. Driscoll , and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “ Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,” 
Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 62  (March) , pp. 23–40.  The current index  uses a new weighting approach for 
each loan category .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to view the uncertainty around our forecast of economic activity as being 
broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a 
period that includes  the most recent  two recession s along with  a number of other episodes with 
elevated un certainty and mark et volatility .  Moreover , in line with our assessment in the June 
Tealbook, we still judge the risks around our baseline projection for real GDP growth to be tilted 
to the downside  over the next year as well as further out , with a corresponding skew to the  
upside for the unemployment rate.  I mportant factor s in our assessmen t are that trade policie s, 
foreign economic developments,  and federal policies for budget appropriations and the debt 
limit —along with financial market reactions —are more likely to  move in directions that would 
have significant negative effects on U.S . economic activity than to resolve more favorably than 
assumed.  Also,  the soft ness in  business investment and manufacturing  production  so far this 
year could be pointing to a more subs tantial slowing in economic growth than in the baseline.  Of 
course , there are risks to the upside as well.  M any of the underlying fundamentals for household 
spending and business investment remain solid —bolstered, in part, by  the 2017 tax cuts —with a 
strong labor market, favorable financial conditions , and upbeat readings on consumer (but not 
business) sentiment.  In these circumstances, consumer spending could expand at a pace that is 
faster than in the staff projection , which, in turn, could help boost business investment .  
As shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit, 
the estimated probability of moving into recession over the next year based on a term spread 
model remains elevated at 6 5 percent .1  The recession pr obability estimate from a model -
averaging framework  that uses a selection of real and financial variables is 36 percent , which is 
abov e the unconditional recession probability of 23  percent  but lower than in the previous 
Tealbook .2  Also , as indicated in t he exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk  Estimate ,” the 
estimate d probability  of returning to the effective lower bound  (ELB ) over the next three years  is 
currently 1 6 percent and rises to above 30 percent by the end of the medium term .  Given the 
1 This estimate should be interpreted with some caution given the long sample period over which the model 
is estimated and secular trends —particularly declining term premiums —that may materially affect its predictions .  
2 Since the previous Tealbook, the decline in corporate bond spreads and the VIX, along with the strong 
recent gains for real PCE and payroll employment, contributed significantly to the downward revision in this 
recession probability estimate.  (The se t of financial variables used in this estimation framework includes the  
term spread.)

proximity of the federal funds rate to the ELB, monetary policy may have less capacity to offset 
significant negative economic shocks than positive ones, contributing to a downside skew in 
economic outcomes.   In addition,  as shown in the exhibit “Condition al Distributions of 
Macro economic Variables 2 Years Ahead ,” the estimated distributions  are currently skewed to 
the upside for the unemployment rate and skewed to the downside for GDP growth  two years 
ahead .3  In contrast  to these two-year-ahead estimates and our judgmental assessment of overall 
risks , the four -quarter -ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the 
unemployment rate, presented in the exhibit “Time -Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year 
Ahead,” are not unusually wide or skewed.      
With regard to inflation, we continue to see  average uncertainty around the projection, 
but with the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside , the risks to the 
inflation projection would also tend to have at least some  downward  skew.  Moreover,  even 
though the latest monthly  data on consumer prices  have been firmer than the readings from  early  
this year , inflation so far has still been below our expectations from the beginning of this year .  
In addition, underlying  trend  inflation, and thus longer -run inflation expectations , could currently 
be lower than assumed in the baseline.  Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate 
more than expected and put downward pressure on inflation.  Of course, there are also risks to  
the upside .  For example, an extended period with unusually tight resource utilization could 
eventually lead to greater upward pressure on wages and prices,  consistent with the predictions 
of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization o n inflation.  In addition, an 
unexpectedly widespread and sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to temporarily 
higher inflation.   
All of these i nflation risks would tend to be of relatively modest size as long as inflation 
expectations remained reasonably well anchored.  However, the risks could increase 
substantially, in either direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such 
3 The results shown in the exhibit are consistent with recent research , using quantile regressions,  on the 
distribution of fluctuations in the unemployment rate and in real GDP growth.  For the unemployment rate, see 
Michael Kiley (2018), “Unemployment Risk,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2018 -067 (Washington:  
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2018.067 .  For real  
GDP growth , see Tobias Adrian, Federico Grinberg, Nellie Liang, and Sheheryar Malik (2018), “The Term 
Structure of Growth -at-Risk,” Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy Working Pape r 42 (Washington:  
Brookings Institute, August) , https://www.brookings.edu/wp -content/uploads/2018/08/WP42 -NL-updated.pdf .  The 
results of their research  suggest that the  upside risk to the unemployment rate and the downside risk to GDP growth 
are more pronounced in the medium term —specifically, two to three years ahead —when the unemployment rate is 
low or credit growth is high.

movements in expectations could induce changes in inflation to build upon themselves and thus  
lead inflation to deviate more significantly and persistently from 2 percent.  
Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s latest 
quantitati ve surveillance assessment, where  the staff continue s to judge  overall financi al 
vulnerabilities in the U. S. financial system to be at a moderate  level .  On the one hand, asset 
valuation pressures have increased somewhat since our previous assessment, as equity and 
corporate bond prices recovered much of their losses  at the end of 2018  and have reached the top 
end of the “notable ” range .  Additionally , borrowing by nonfinancial businesses , as a ratio to 
nominal  GDP , has reached  new highs  recently .  On the other hand, growth in household -sector 
borrowing remains well below trend GDP grow th, and underwriting standards  in this sector  are 
generally strong.   In addition, the largest U.S. banks continue to have strong capital positions , 
and funding risks in the financial system are low.  Reflecting this assessment, current financial 
vulnerabilities do not appear likely to intensify  shocks to an unusual degree through strains 
within the financial sector, although a deterioration in the balance sheet of the nonfinancial 
corporate sector could amplify shocks from both dom estic and foreig n developments.  
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.  We simulate each of these scenarios using one of 
three  models maintained by the s taff, which  embed different macroeconomic structures and 
dynamics.4  In the first three  scenarios , the federal funds rate is governed by the  baseline  policy 
rule, which assumes a coefficient  of 0.2  on the output gap.   In contrast , the last two scenarios 
(“Global Investment Slump ” and “Escalation of Trade Tensions ”) assume  a parameter value  of 
1.0 on the output gap  in the policy rule , as we judge it is unlikely that monetary policy would 
react in the manner embodied in the  baseline rule  when  output growth sl ows notably.  The fourth 
scenario  (“Recession with Financial Amplification ”) allows for a n even  more aggressive 
monetary policy response that is consistent with the historical re action  of the FOMC  to a 
recession .  Finally , the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed to follow the 
baseline paths in all of the scenarios.  
4 The three models used are  (1) FRB/US, which is a large -scale macroeconometri c model of the U.S. 
economy; (2) SIGMA, which is a calibrated multicounty DSGE model; and (3) GEMUS , which is a  calibrated two -
country DSGE model.

 Lower Inflation Expectations [FRB/US]  
Total and core PCE price inflation have, on average, run below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective for most of the past decade.  In addition, some measures of longer -run 
inflation expectations have drifted down in the past several years.  In the baseline projection, 
longer -run inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting are assumed to generate an 
underlying inflation trend that remains at 1.8 percent through the medium term.  However, there 
is a risk that actual inflation expectations are anchored at a level somewhat below what is 
assumed in the baseline.  In this scenari o, we consider the possibility that the private sector’s 
longer -run inflation expectations are consistent with underlying trend inflation that has been at 
1.5 percent for a year now and that it will remain at that level for an extended period of time.  
Policymakers are assumed to currently recognize this lower underlying inflation trend.    
Lower inflation expectations lead to actual inflation running below the baseline and 
hovering around  1.7 percent  over the projection period.  Lower realized inflation imp lies that the 
federal funds rate stays below the baseline throughout the projection period and is about 3 5 basis 
points lower  by 2024.  Real GDP growth and the unemployment rate are little affected , as the 
nominal federal funds rate evolves in tandem with inflation, leaving real interest rates essentially 
unchanged.    
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US]  
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment 
remain solid, including quite upbeat r eadings on consumer sentiment, stron g labor market 
conditions, and low interest rates.   Indeed, PCE is estimated to have increased at a robust pace in 
the second quarter.   In this scenario, we assume that consumer spending and, in turn, investment 
expand at a pace faster than in the baseline .  We also assume that these favorable conditions  
result in a larger cyclical response in labor force participation than has typically been the case .  
Under th ese assumptions, GDP increases 3 .1 percent, on average, in 2019 and 2020, 
which is a pace comparable with that in 2018.  With a greater -than-typical cyclical response in 
labor force participation , the unemployment rate decli nes to 3  percent at the beginning of 2021 , a 
smaller decline than what the model’s  Okun’s law relationship would suggest.  Inflatio n 
increases slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2024.  In response to the stronger economy, and with 
inflation little changed, the federal funds rate rises relative t o the baseline, reaching  3¼ percent  
in 2024 .

Stronger Aggregate Supply [FRB/US]  
The unemployment rate is currently 0.9 percentage point below the staff’s  4.6 percent 
estimate for its natural rate .  Nevertheless, w age gains have remained modest in  recent years  
largely because , in the  staff’s assessment,  trend productivity growth has been slow.  However, 
another way of reconciling modest wage growth with a very low unemployment rate is that 
resource utilization may be less tight than assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, the leve l of 
potential output in recent years is assumed to have been higher than judged in the baseline, such 
that the output gap was close to zero in the middle of last year.  Moreover, this scenario assumes 
that potential output growth in future years is faster  than in the baseline.  Specifically, we assume 
that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past several years than in the 
baseline and continues to fall to 3.75  percent at the end of 2019, more than ¾  percentage point 
lower than in the baseline.5  We also assume that the trend labor force participation rate has been 
decreasing at a slower pace than in the baseline for the past several years and continues to do so 
going forward.  In addition, structural productivity is assumed to grow ¼  percentage point faster 
than in the baseline in the past several years and going forward.  
Because we assume that households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential 
growth and its implications for income and profits, consumer spending and investm ent are 
stronger.  GDP growth is, on average, about  1 percentage point per year above the baseline.  The 
unemployment rate falls to about  3 percent by the end of 2024, around  ¾ percentage point  lower 
than in the staff projection.  Even so, given the lower natural rate in this scenario, resource 
utilization is less tight than in the baseline over the next several years .  The path for inflation is 
slightly below the baseline, on average, primarily  reflecting  the stronger productivity growth in 
this scenario.  Because policymakers are assumed to recognize the se more favorable  supply -side 
conditions , the path of the federal funds rate is about 35 basis points lower, on average, than in 
the baseline.    
Recession with Financial Amplification  [FRB/US]  
The softness in business investment and manufacturing production  so far  this year and 
the continued flatness in the yield curve could be pointing to  a substantial deterioration in 
economic activity.  As noted earlier , a statistical model  based on the term spread in Treasury 
5 A natural rate of 3.75 percent is comparable with the av erage of the 10 lowest forecasts for the longer -run 
unemployment rate submitted by respondents in the March 2019 long -range Blue Chip survey.

 yields indicate s that the probability of a recession over the next year is elevated .  Moreover , 
leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is elevated.  In this scenario, a recession is assumed 
to be amplified by high ly indebted businesses  that reduc e their  hiring and investment by more 
than they would if their debt was lower .6  We also assume that monetary policymakers 
aggressively respond to the sharp and sustained increase in the unemployment rate , consistent  
with t he FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions.  
Real GDP starts to decline later this year and the unemployment rate starts to rise sharp ly.  
The federal funds rate declines s ignificant ly but becomes constrained by the ELB in the third 
quarter of 2020, thereby prolonging the downturn.  GDP only begins to recover in 2021 , and t he 
unemployment rate peaks at 7 .1 percent in 2022, an increase of more than 3 ½ percentage points 
from the start of the recession.  With substantial  slack in  resource utilization, in flation falls to 
1.5 percent in  2021.  
Global Investment Slump  [SIGMA ] 
The growth of goods trade, manufacturing, and investment has slowed  significantly  in 
many areas of the global economy since 2017.  By our assessment , recent tariff increases and 
heightened uncertainty about trade policy likely  played a significant  role in this slowdown, as 
have  other factors such as the downturn in the global tech cycle —a synchronized pattern of 
production and trade in electronics acro ss economies —and country -specific developments  that 
lowered global demand.  As these other factors fade, in our baseline we expect trade, 
manufacturing, and investment to stabilize .  However , recent surveys of business attitudes and 
intentions —not only in the United States, but globally —continu e to flag concerns about trade 
policy , and measures of trade policy uncertainty are at historically high levels .7  Trade policy 
uncertaint y may have played a larger role in the recent manufacturing slowdown than we ha ve 
assessed , and its adverse effects on the global outlook may have  yet to play out fully .    
In this scenario , we assume that  global investment remains more sensitive  to the 
unprecedented level of trade policy uncertainty than  we envision in the baseline , which  sets in 
                                                           
6 Specifically, we assume shocks that are somewhat more severe than those consistent with the recession in 
the ear ly 1990s.

 motion a global investment slump .  As firms in the United States and abroad wait for these 
uncertainties to be resolved , lower capital accumulation reduces labor productivity and impairs 
the efficient allocation of capital and labor , with ad verse effects on structural productivity , and 
business and consumer confidence  is depressed .8  Concerns about the global outlook cause 
flight -to-safety flows into dollar -denominated assets, contributing  to a 5  percent appreciation of 
the dollar.  All told,  the level of foreign GDP is 1.5  percent below  the baseline through 2021.  
Weaker aggregate demand in the United States and abroad and the stronger dollar cause a 
substantial slowdown in U.S. economic activity.  In particular, real  GDP growth falls to 
0.2 percent in the second half of 2019, 1.5 percentage point s below the baseline , and the 
unemployment rate rises above 4.0 percent in 2020 .  Core PCE inflation remains below 2  percent 
until 2024 .  Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline , 
falling to 1. 7 percent in 2021 . 
Escalation of Trade Tensions  [GEMUS]  
Our current baseline assumes a ceasefire in ongoing trade disputes, meaning that the 
United States and its trading partners impose no new tariffs , but existing tarif fs, including those 
raised on May 10 on a sizable tranche of Chinese imports, remain in place.  While  the current 
process of trade negotiations could ultimately lead to lower trade barriers, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that trade tensions escalate  further , resulting in a sizable  increase in trade barriers that 
would entail profoundly adverse effects . 
This scenario assumes that, in the second half of 2019, additional tariffs are imposed on 
imports not previously tariffed from China  and on vehicle  impor ts from most countries .  In 
addition, tariffs are imposed on all Mexican imports , notwithstanding the June 7 agreement that 
reduced the threat  of such an action .  In particular, we assume that, throughout the second half of 
2019, tariffs of 25  percent are imposed on $275 billion of imports from China, tariffs of 
20 percent are imposed on $160 billion of vehicle imports, and tariffs of 25 percent are imposed 
on $314  billion of imports from Mexico .  In our scenario, Mexico and China partially reta liate 
against the U.S. actions, while tariffs on vehicles trigger a fully proportionate  response.  Because 
higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. exports, these policies 
have little effect on the trade balance.  However , the higher cost of imported consumption goods

depresses household spending , while  business demand for investment  declines as a result of the 
higher cost of imported capital goods and as lower expected profits cause corporate borrowing 
spreads to rise  and equity prices to fall .  In addition, the escalation of trade tensions lead s to a 
widespread decline in global sentiment and asset prices, with global equity prices falling about 
20 percent.  
These developments lead to a significant and protracted slowdown in the U.S. economy.  
Real GDP growth drops to only 0. 3 percent in the second half of 2019 and rises to only 
1.2 percent in 2020, almost 1 percentage point below the baseline.   Higher import prices boost 
total PCE inflation to 3.5 percent in  the second half of this year before inflation falls below the 
baseline as the effect of the new tariffs dies out and as the economy slows down.  Despite  the 
initial  jump in inflation , policymakers decide to “ look through” the temporary increase in prices.   
Accordingly, the federal funds rate follows a shallower path than in the baseline, declining  to 
1.9 percent by the end of 2020, 0. 7 percentage point below the baseline.
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS  
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, t he FRB/US model projects real 
GDP growth to slow from 3  percent in 2018 to 2 .1 percent in 2019 and to about 1½ percent in 
the next two years —a modestly weaker path than in the Tealbook baseline .9  The model’s 
forecast of real GDP growth ha s revised up about 35 basis points  in 2019 compared with the 
previous Tealbook , primarily reflect ing better -than-expected  consumption growth from the 
model’s perspective.  In terms of  the contour  of the model’s forecast , the projected deceleration 
in real GDP mainly re flects the projection that both consumption and business investment  
growth will move down  from what the model perceives as unusually strong readings in recent 
years.  In the case of consumption, t he model could not explain those earlier positive surprises 
based on fundamentals (wealth and income) and hence does not carry that strength forward in the 
projection; instead, it has consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend.  The model’s 
assessment that asset prices (equity and property wealth) are  currently above normal valuations 
and thus will fall or decelerate over the next year also contributes to the weakening in 
consumption growth through the wealth channel.   With slowing overall output, business 
investment also decelerates.   Given that relat ively weak outlook, t he model forecasts the output 
9 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projection s for variables from the  U.S. government 
sector, foreign real GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar and oil prices .  The federal funds 
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline.  The model forecast starts in the 
third quarter of this year, taking as give n key macroeconomic variables from the judgmental forecast for the  
second quarter.

 gap to decline  from a current estimate of 1½  percent to about ½  percent at the end of 2021 , and 
the unemployment rate rises to 4.2  percent at the end of 2021, still below its estimate of the 
natural rate o f 4.7 percent.  Core inflation increases from 1.8  percent in 2019 to about 2.0 percent 
in 2020 and 2021.  
The EDO model projects real GDP growth to average 2¼ percent over the next three 
years,  close to the model’s estimate of average potential growth.   In contrast to both the 
Tealbook and FRB/US assessments, the EDO model estimates t he output gap to be negative 
0.2 percent  currently  and projects it to remain slightly negative through 2021.   Core inflation 
gradually converges to  the FOMC ’s 2 percent objective by the end of 2020 .  For a number of 
years, wages have been below the level consistent with the model’s wage Phillips curve, holding 
down marginal costs and depressing inflation over that period , and t he model expects these wage 
shocks to fade gradually .

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projection.  Compared with the June Tealbook, the inflation 
project ion is a bit higher in the next few quarters and little changed thereafter, whereas 
the output gap is seen as modestly more positive over the medium term and beyond.  
Consequently, the policy rate paths prescribed by  the strategies are generally slightly 
higher than in the June Tealbook.  In a special exhibit,  we examine optimal control 
simulations when the underlying baseline projection is consistent with the median 
responses to the June 2019 Summary of Economic Projections ( SEP) rather than the 
staff forecast . 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near -term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the inertial version of the Taylor  (1999) rule , 
the Taylor  (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible price -level targeting  (FPLT ) 
rule.1  These near -term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation , which are shown in the middle panels .2  The top and 
middle panel s also  provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate. 
•Reflecting slightly higher inflation and the somewhat  wider output gap, the
near-term prescriptions of the policy rules are slightly  higher  than those in the
June Tealbook.
•The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule prescribes higher policy rates than the
Tealbook baseline because it responds more strongly to the positive output
gap than the conditional attenuated rule underlying the Tealbook baselineprojection.
1 The appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on these simple polic y rules .  
Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined here use 
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50  basis points in the longer run.  
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook bas eline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection of the output gap.

    1. The lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for
inflation and resource slack. Rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable are conditional on thecurrent−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the June 2019 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

 •The Taylor  (1993) rule , which does  not feature an interest rate  smoothing
term, calls for  higher policy r ates than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and the
Tealbook baseline rule.
•The first -difference rule, which responds to the change in the expected output
gap, prescribes a policy rate path that is  slightly  higher than the Tealbook
baseline path.
•The FPLT rule  calls for cutting the federal funds rate to about 2 percent  by the
fourth quarter of 2019 in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the
core PCE price index of 2½ percent  since the end of 2011.
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL  FEDERAL
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports estimates of a medium- term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate ( r*) generat ed under two baselines:  the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2019 SEP .3  
In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used.  This concept of r*, labeled 
“FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period starting in the current quarter , would bring the output gap to zero 
in the final quarter of that period.  This concept of r* is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sha rp changes in the federal 
funds rate. 
•At 1.97 percent , the current value of the Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  is
about 25 basis points higher than its est imate for the same quarter in  the June
Tealbook because of the wider output gap projected by the staff  in the
medium term.
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median  SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021 (the 
final year reported in the June 2019 SEP), the  economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth and 
monot onic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.  
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of 
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median  SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 • At 0.65 percent , the June 2019 SEP -consistent FRB/US r*  is somewhat lower 
than the current -quarter estimate based on the March 2019 S EP projection, at 
0.89 percent  (not shown).  The downward revision mainly stems from a 
decline in the median projected path for the federal funds rate over the 
medium term  without much change in the output gap projection. 
• The Tealbook- consistent FRB/US r*  is higher than the SEP -consistent 
FRB/US r*  because the Tealbook projection features a wider  output gap over 
the medium term despite its somewhat higher path for the real federal funds rate.  
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline and results from dynamic 
simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, the Taylor (1993) 
rule, the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different federal funds 
rate paths implied by the policy rules.  The simulations for each rule are carried out under 
the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and that financial market participants,  price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that 
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the implications for interest rates and the economy. 
• Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook baseline, the federal funds rate is flat at 2.4 percent this year and edges up to 2.7 percent  by the end of 2021.  The prescribed path for the policy rate is 
revised up only a bit compared with the June Tealbook because the baseline rule responds modes tly and gradually to the wider output gap. 
• The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as 
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output 
gap, calls for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace and to slightly 
exceed  3½ percent by  2021.  Thereafter , the path remain s above the Tealbook 
baseline path for several years .  The less accommodative monetary conditions 
produce an unemployment rate that , in contrast to  the Tealbook baseline, rises  
steadily toward  the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.

 Inflation is lower  and the real 10- year Treasury yield is  higher than the 
corresponding values in the Tealbook baseline. 
• The Taylor  (1993) rule calls for increases in the federal f unds rate in the near 
term,  to 3½ percent by early 2020, after which the rule calls for slight 
declines .  The federal funds rate path prescribed by this rule is at first above 
the corresponding paths under both the inertial Taylor (1999) rule  and the 
Tealb ook baseline rule.  Later, however, it is below the path under the inertial 
Taylor  (1999) rule and above the path in the Tealbook baseline.  Th e 
relatively high initial values arise because the Taylor (1993) rule has no 
inertial component and thus calls for an immediate upward adjustment in the path of the policy rate in response to the high level of the current output gap. 
• The first-difference rule, which reacts to the expected change in the output 
gap rather than its level, prescribes small, gradual increases in the federal funds rate through the end of 2020, followed by a sequence of slight 
reductions during the period in which the output gap is projected to narrow.  
The federal funds rate path edges down to 2¾ percent  by 2024, in line with 
the prescripti ons of the conditional attenuated rule that year .  The resulting 
path for the real 10- year Treasury yield is  similar to the baseline projection in 
the near term  and lower  than that projection in the medium term.  As a result, 
this strategy  generates  higher inflation and eventually  a lower  unemployment 
rate than the staff projection. 
• The FPLT rule responds to, and seeks to eliminate,  the cumulative shortfall of 
the level of core PCE prices  from  a target path defined by the growth of that 
price level at an annual rate of 2  percen t from the end of 2011 onward.  
Eliminating the current 2½  percent shortfall requires inflation to run above 
2 percent in coming years.   Because the simulation embeds the assumptions 
that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly 
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the 
real 10 -year Treasury rate immediately  drops to negative 0.4 percent and 
remai ns below the corresponding Tealbook baseline path throughout the 
period shown.  T he unemployment rate is substantially lower under the FPLT 
rule than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping to near

•Over the projection period shown, the simple rules ’ policy rate  prescriptions
are as much as 40 basis points higher than the corresponding prescriptions in

OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations conditional on the Tealbook 
baseline under two different assumptions about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by alternative specifications of the loss function.
4  The concept of optimal control 
employed here is one in which policymakers are able to commit future policymakers to their plans; such a commitment, where feasible, may  lead to improved economic 
outcomes.
5 
•The simulation labeled “Equal weights” presents the case in whichpolicymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCEinflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2  percent, on keeping the
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate ofunemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previousvalue.  Under this strategy, the federal funds rate runs significantly higher than
the Tealbook baseline path and reaches a peak of  5 percent  in late 2021.
6  This
strategy is designed to counter the projected sizable and persistent
undershooting by the unemployment rate of its natural rate that occurs in theTealbook baseline—an outcome that policymakers with the equal- weights loss
function judge to be undes irable.  The smaller  unemployment gap implies
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides tech nical details on the optimal control simulations.  
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.  
6 Because monetary policy actions are assumed to be understood and credible, changes in the 
federal funds rate are not disruptive, regardless of the magnitude of their departure from historical norms.  
In practice, however, if the FOMC were to raise the real federal funds rate abruptly, wage and price setters 
and financial market participants could misinterpret policymakers’ intentions and may anticipate tighter 
monetary policy than policymakers envision, in which case macroeconomic outcomes may be less 
favorable than would otherwise be the case.

 only a modestly lower path of inflation because, in the FRB/US model, the 
response of inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.  
• The simulation labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap” uses a loss func tion 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but is otherwise 
identical to the specification with equal weights.  Under this strategy, the path 
for the federal funds rate is considerably below the path under equal weights 
because policymakers’ desire to keep  inflation close to 2 percent  is not 
tempered by an aversion to the unemployment rate falling below its natural rate.  Moreover, the policy rate path and outc omes under this strategy are 
similar to those under the Tealbook baseline because, with inflation running near 2  percent over the next several  years and with policymakers attaching no 
loss to unemployment undershooting its natural rate, the current policy rate 
path already delivers outcomes that are close to  optimal, based on this 
loss function. 
• The federal funds rate projection s from  the equal -weight s and asymmetric 
specifications conditional on the current Tealbook projection are as much as 
45 basis points and 30 basis points higher, respectively, than their corresponding prescriptions based on the June Tealbook projection.  The revisions to the asymmetric specification are somewhat smaller than those for 
the equal -weight s specification because policy in t he former specification is 
only affected by revisions to the unemployment gap when the unemployment rate is above the estimate of its natural rate .

 consistent baseline.  However, the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, at 4.6 percent , is higher than the median estimate of the 
longer-run unemployment rate in the June 2019 SEP, which stands at 4.2 percent .  Accordingly, the Tealbook projection features greater labor

•Under the equal -weight s specification, t he path of the federal funds rate peaks
at 3.4 percen t in 2021 when we condition on the SEP-consistent base line,
about 1½ percentage points less  than prescribed under this loss function when
we condition on the Tealbook baseline.  This lower path for the policy ratearises because, under the SEP-consistent baseline, the unemployment gap thatpolicymakers aim to  close is smaller than in the Tealbook baseline.
•Under the asymmetric specification  and conditioning on the SEP -consistent
baseline, the prescriptions for the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate,and the inflation rate are near those in the SEP -consi stent baseline.  This
similarity  arises because the asymmetric specification  attaches  no loss to
unemployment undershooting its natural rate and sees inflation near or at
2 percent over the next several years ; thus, from the perspective of this loss
function, the baseline policy rate path is already near optimal.   However, this
similarity  does not imply that policymakers are acting according to an
asymmetric loss function.  In particular, policymakers ’ assessments of
appropriate policy may factor in  element s that are not captured by our perfect -
foresight analysis , such as uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment
in a low- r* environment.

7 In the construction o f the SEP -consistent baseline, we assume that the natural rate of 
unemployment over the projection period coincides with the median SEP estimate of the unemployment 
rate in the lon ger run.  
8 More generally, i n constructing the SEP -consistent baseline as well as in performing the 
simulations, the staff makes assumptions about the underlying economic relationships that need not 
coincide with the perceived economic tradeoffs of SEP respondents.

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations embed the assum ption that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on policies under commitment, optimal control policies can more generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the 
Tealbook baseline projection .1  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy 
for quarter t;  for quarter s prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑅 𝑡𝑡 corresponds to the 
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand- side variables of the first four rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four- quarter core PCE price inflatio n for the current 
                                                 
1 The box “A New Conditional Baseline Policy Rule” in the Domestic Economic Developments 
and Outlook section of the April 2019 Tealbook A describes the conditional baseline  rule.

 quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡), and the forecast of the three-quarter- ahead an nual change in the output gap 
(𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡−𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, 
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price- level targeting rule , the right -hand- side variables 
include an unemployment rate gap and  a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is d efined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑢 𝑡𝑡∗, 
which currently stands at 4.6 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference 
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, and the log of the target price- level path, 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗.  The 
2011:Q4 value of 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently, 
𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate. 
Simpl
e Rules  
T
he first rule  in the table was studied by Taylor (1993).  T he inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time compared with  the 
Taylor (1993) rule .  The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap, like the 
FPLT  rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .2  The conditional 
attenuated rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but responds less strongly to 
the output gap.  Where applicable, the intercepts of the simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant 
and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n 
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer-run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides (2003). 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “Near -Term P rescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published earl y in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarters.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand- side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
2 For applications, see , for example , Erceg and others ( 2012).  An FPLT rule similar to the one 
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2014).  Taylor (1993) rule  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 =𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+0.5𝑦𝑦𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡

  To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic proj ections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged fede ral funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimates of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate  that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with  median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r* ” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period, given either the Tealbook or the SEP -
consistent economic projection .  This measure depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.
3  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR- based 
expectations— that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook b aseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel are  the corresponding averages of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP- consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as th e Tealbook- consistent and SEP- consistent 
FRB/US r* .  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rates and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period, whereas, in the economic projection, the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as price and  wage setters form  model- consistent expectations and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

 COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit tha t policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squ ared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate .  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor, 𝛽𝛽= 0. 9963 : 
𝑳𝑳𝒕𝒕=� 𝜷𝜷𝝉𝝉𝑇𝑇

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two 
specifications.  
T
he first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses the same weights as the equal- weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The optimal control policy and associated outc omes depend on the relative (rather than the 
absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject 
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’  future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.   Loss Functions

3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.
4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial
offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
