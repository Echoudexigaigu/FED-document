Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Although the escalation of trade  tensions and rising concerns a bout global growth 
have roiled financial markets  both here and abroad in recent we eks, the domestic data 
releases have been relativel y anodyne and continue to suggest e conomic activity is 
expanding at a solid pace this year.  GDP increased 2.5 percent  in the first half, and the 
latest readings on consumer spendi ng and the labor market shore up our expectation of 
moderate output gains in the sec ond half—despite anticipated de clines in business 
investment.  We are currentl y writing down average growth of 1. 8 percent in the second 
half as our baseline projecti on.  That said, when we tote up th e risks that seem the most 
salient—including further worse ning of trade tensions and adverse political and economic 
developments abroad—they are cle arly slanted to the downside. 
Although these downside risks extend beyond this year, our moda l projection 
continues to call for only a m odest further deceleration in economic activity that largely 
reflects a waning impetus from fiscal policy.  After increasing  2.1 percent this year, GDP 
growth is expected to slow stead ily over the forecast period to  1.7 percent in 2022.  We 
project essentially no further lab or market tightening after 20 19, with the unemployment 
rate holding steady at 3.6 percen t over the next few years.  
Relative to the July Tealbook, GDP growth is revised somewhat lower in 
response to weaker data on net exports, our outlook for foreign growth, a stronger dollar, 
and lower readings on expected longer-run profits.  The cumulative effect of these factors 
was only partly offset by a lower  path for inter est rates and a large upward revision to 
disposable personal income in recent quarters.  Combined with s ome updates to our 
aggregate supply assumptions for the past few years—namely, a r eduction in our natural 
rate of unemployment and a higher level of structural productiv ity—these changes to the 
forecast led to a sizable reduction in our assessment of the ec onomy’s tightness.  All told, 
we now project that the output gap will be 1.4 percent by the e nd of the projection period, 
0.7 percentage point narrower than our earlier estimate. 
Monthly readings on core PCE pric es were higher over the April to July period 
than in the first quarter, and we continue to anticipate that t he 12-month change in core 
prices will move up from the la test reading of 1.6 percent in J uly to 1.8 percent by the 
end of 2019.  We now expect core in flation to remain at 1.8 per cent through the medium

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the June  FOMC meeting.  The following table compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the June  Tealbook.  
Trade tensions, global growth concerns, and financial market conditions  have fluctuated 
notably since the June forecast , but  our projection s for slowing GDP growth  and an 
unemployment rate  that essentially moves sideways  over the medium term are quite similar .  
On balance , GDP at the end of 2022 is slightly  higher and the unemployment rate is a bit 
lower than in June .  Even so , the output gap  is now projec ted to roughly flatten out at a 
lower level , as we have revised up our assumption for potential output —largely reflecting a 
downward revision to our assumed natural rate of unemployment from 4.6 percent to 
4.4 percent —in the current projection . 
The less -tight resource utilization shows through to slightly lower projected inflation over 
the medium  term relative to  the June  Tealbook .  Core inflation is forecast  to move sideways 
at 1.8 percent —equal to our estimate of un derlying inflation —as the eff ects  of still-tight 
resource utilization are offset by an appreciating dollar.  Total inflation is forecast to run in 
line with core  inflation  after this year, because energy prices are projected to become less of 
a drag on inflation.   
The assumed path for  the federal funds rate is  currently  a bit lower than in June , reflecting 
the FOMC’s decision to reduce the federal funds rate  target in July , along with  the smaller 
output gap  and lower inflation  in the current projection .

  term.  This projection is slightl y lower than in the July Tealb ook, reflecting downwardly 
revised data on nonmarket prices t his year, a higher dollar, an d a smaller boost from 
resource utilization.  Total PCE  inflation is expected to be in  line with core inflation after 
this year, as energy prices are not  expected to fall as rapidly . 
KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 The baseline policy rule calls f or the federal funds rate to ho ld steady this year 
at 2.2 percent and then to edge up gradually, reaching 2.5 percent by the end 
of 2022.  In contrast, term-premium- adjusted market quotes suggest market 
participants expect the feder al funds rate to decline roughly 5 0 basis points by 
the end of 2020, with most of the de cline occurring this year.   
 Our assumptions for the SOMA portfolio, which will be detailed in Tealbook 
B, imply that downward pressure on t he term premium in Treasury  yields 
diminishes over time.  
Other Interest Rates and Equity Prices 
 The 10-year Treasury yield droppe d sharply over the intermeetin g period.  
Staff models attribute much of t he decline to a decrease in the  term premium 
to a level that is quite low historically.  In our projection, we continue to 
assume that the term premium will rise to a more normal level o ver the next 
few years.  However, we are assu ming that the increase will hap pen more 
slowly in this projection becau se of more persistent downward pressure 
coming from global growth concer ns, foreign monetary policy, and 
uncertainty regarding intern ational trade.  By the end of 2022,  we look for the 
10-year rate to be around 2.8 percent.   
 The spreads of both the triple- B corporate bond yield and mortg age rates over 
the 10-year Treasury yield have w idened in recent weeks.  We ex pect the 
wider spreads to persist thr ough the beginning of next year and so have 
revised down these rates by less th an the Treasury yield for th e next few 
quarters.   
 Stock prices have declined 2 percen t since the time of the July Tealbook.  We 
now expect stock prices to appreciate a bit more over the forec ast than we did

 in July, based on lower projected i nterest rates and the recent modest 
reduction in valuation pressures .  Relative to the July Tealboo k, equity prices 
are slightly lower for m ost of the projection. 
Trade Policy  
On September 1, the United State s imposed a new tariff of 15 pe rcent on
about $100 billion of imports from China.  These particular cat egories of
goods had not been previously affect ed by the tariff increases that had been
implemented over the past two years.  Also, on September 1, Chi na boosted
tariffs on nearly $30 billion of U.S . exports.  Most of these t ariff increases
were applied to goods that had alr eady experienced tariff hikes in 2018 or
2019.  The tariffs on U.S. exports will likely be accompanied b y additional
nontariff barriers to trade.
By themselves, this latest round of tariffs should reduce the l evel of U.S. GDP
by the end of 2021 by 5 basis points and boost U.S. core PCE pr ices by a
similar amount.  We estimate that the cumulative effect of thes e and past tariff
changes will lower the level  of U.S. GDP 30 basis points by the end of 2021
and boost the level of core PCE prices 30 basis points.  These estimated
effects reflect only the dire ct effects of higher tariffs and d o not include any
indirect effects arising from gr eater trade policy uncertainty.
As usual, the current Tealbook forecast conditions only on tari ff increases that
have already been implemented.  The United States has also anno unced plans
for additional tariff increases in the coming months:  On Octob er 1, the tariffs
already in place on $230 billion of im ports from China are sche duled to rise
from 25 to 30 percent.  On Dece mber 15, about $150 billion of p reviously
unaffected imports are scheduled  to receive a 15 percent tariff , effectively
extending the recent tariff hikes to almost all imports from Ch ina.  Likewise,
China plans to boost tariffs on $45 billion of goods on December 15.
Foreign Economic Activity and the Dollar 
Foreign GDP increased about 2 perc ent at an annual rate in the second quarter
and is expected to remain near this below-potential pace throughout the
second half of this year.  The near-term outlook has been revis ed down,
reflecting disappointing data in several economies.  We expect foreign growth

  to pick up to 2.5 percent by the end o f next year, as the drag from elevated 
trade policy uncertainty eases against a backdrop of continued very 
accommodative monetary policy and some fiscal stimulus.  Howeve r, the 
global outlook remains unusually u ncertain, with substantial do wnside risks. 
 Since the July Tealbook, the dolla r appreciated 3. 5 percent against EME 
currencies and 1.2 percent against AFE currencies.  We continue  to expect 
that, as market expectations for  the federal funds rate move up  toward the staff 
forecast, the broad real dollar will appreciate at an annual ra te of about 
1 percent through 2022.  All told, the path of the dollar is about 2 percent 
higher than in the July Tealbook.  
 Fiscal Policy  
 As we had expected, federal fiscal  policymakers recently enacte d legislation 
to increase the discretionary s pending caps for fiscal years 20 20 and 
2021.  See the box “The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019” for addi tional details. 
 Under our fiscal policy assumptions, the direct fiscal impetus from all levels 
of government contributes 0.7 percen tage point to aggregate dem and growth 
this year—about the same as i n 2018—before tapering to 0.4 perc entage point 
in 2020 and to a little less than 0.2 percentage point in 2021 and 2022.  This 
contour is little changed re lative to the July Tealbook. 
Oil and Other Commodity Prices 
 Oil prices are little changed in this projection, as the drag o n prices from 
concerns about global growth and trade tensions has been about offset by 
upward pressure from a sharp declin e in Iranian oil exports com bined with 
continued production declines in other OPEC nations.  
 Agricultural prices have fallen 9 percent since the previous Te albook to their 
lowest level in a decade, driven largely by a USDA report indic ating that U.S. 
crop production may be better tha n previously expected despite remaining 
depressed due to poor weather ear lier in the year.  Ongoing tra de tensions 
between the United States and Chi na have also depressed agricultural prices 
and U.S. exports.  (The box “Develo pments in the U.S. Agricultu ral Sector” 
provides additional background.)

 The Bipartisan Budget Act of 201 9 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (BBA 2019) was signed into law on August 2 .  The legislation  
increased  the caps that constrain federal discretionary budget authority in both fiscal years 2020 
and 2021 to about $1.37 trillion.1  Notably, the agreement eliminated  the risk that budget authority 
in fiscal 2020 and 2021 would  be constrained by the caps  agreed to under the Budget Control Act 
of 2011 , which w ere about $150 billion lower.   In addition to increasing  the caps  for the next two 
years , the BBA 2019 suspended  the statutory federal debt limit through July 31, 2021.  
Although the BBA 2019 set  higher nominal caps on budget levels, the spending is not aut horized 
until legislators pass , and the President signs, fiscal 2020 and 2021 appropriation s bills .  Should the 
Congress and the Administration fail to reach an agreement on the necessary appropriations  bills 
by the beginning of fiscal 2020 (October 1), they will need to pass a continuing resolution that 
temporarily extends funding in order to avoid a government shutdown.2   
The new budget caps are about $25 billion  higher relative to  the fiscal 2019  caps and support  
aggregate demand through their effect on government purchases.  If enacted budget authority is 
set at the cap levels—as  we expect  and as has been the case in recent years —then we project 
that federal discretionary spending will rise a little faster than inflation, on average, over the next 
couple of years .3  Specifically, the staff  now expect s that real federal purchases will increase 
1.2 percent in 2020 and move roughly sideways in 2021 ( table, line 1).  In terms of contribution s to 
real GDP growth , the staff estimates that the direct first -round effect of federal purchases  on 
aggregate demand will be about 0. 3 percentage point in 2019, step down to 0.1  percentage point 
in 2020, and be roughly neutral in 2021  (line 3), close to the previous Tealbook  (line 4) .4    
 
                                                 
1 Some funding for discretionary spending is not subject to the caps , including appropriations designated 
for overseas contingency operations (such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq) and disaster relief.  In fiscal 2019, 
those categories totaled $ 116 billion  in budget authority. 
2 Recall that the partial federal government shutdown last December and January began when the 
Congress and the Administration were unable to pass appropriations bills for fiscal 2019 despite having already agreed to budget caps in th e Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  
3 Within a fiscal year, government agencies generally sign contracts for goods and services that commit 
to spending that year’s budget authority.  However, a significant share of the purchases of goods and services typicall y occurs in subsequent fiscal years.  To estimate the timing of purchases, we rely on estimates of budget 
authority spendout rates from the Congressional Budget Office and the Department of Defense.    
4 To place these projected aggregate demand effects in  a historical context, since 1979 the average 
annual contribution of federal purchases to the rate of change in real GDP is about 0.15  percentage point .

 Metals prices are also down somew hat, due to concerns about glo bal
manufacturing growth that are  discussed in the box “Weakness in  the Global
Manufacturing Sector” in the International Economic Developments and
Outlook section.
THE OUTLOOK FOR GDP 
The contrast we observed in the f irst half of the year—between strong consumer 
spending and slowing business i nvestment—looks likely to be more pronounced in the 
second half of the year:  We are forecasting that consumption g rowth will remain strong, 
but we are penciling in an outrigh t decline in business investm ent.  These patterns, along 
with the waning of an anomalous  first-half boost in government spending, point to a 
slowdown in GDP growth from a healthy 2.5 percent pace in the f irst half to a more 
moderate 1.8 percent incr ease in the second half.  
Recent data 
on consumer spending have been positive, with perso nal
consumption expenditures posting a solid gain in July after ris ing at a nearly
3 percent pace in the first half.  We expect growth in consumer spending to
average 2.7 percent in the second half, reflecting recent stron g readings on
retail sales and light vehicle  sales, as well as the support of  continued solid
gains in labor income.1  We took only a small negative signal from the recent
decline in the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment, a s the
Conference Board’s measure remains elevated.  If the lower level of the
Michigan measure persists, we ar e likely to further temper our forecast for
spending.
After having declined for six consecutive quarter s, residential investment is
expected to increase in the s econd half at a rate of 4 percent,  boosted by the
decline in mortgage rates sin ce late 2018.  The expected increase is
corroborated by measures of builder and homebuyer sentiment, wh ich have
rebounded from their lows around the turn of the year, and by single-familypermits and pending sales, whic h have moved up, on net, in rece nt months.
1 The growth of personal income i n the first quarter was revised  up substantially in the BEA’s 
recent annual revision.  Wage da ta from ADP indicate that the upward revision reflected  large increases in 
bonuses and exercised stock op tions.  Because these are receive d by high-income consumers who tend to 
have a low marginal propensity to consume, we responded only wi th a small boost to consumption in the 
forecast period.

 Developments in the U.S. Agricultural Sector  
The performance of the U.S. agricultural sector has been relatively subdued  in 
recent years against a backdrop of fairly strong GDP growth .  As shown in figure 1, 
nominal farm income was elevated from  2011 to 2013, reflecting strong export  
demand  and elevated prices for agricultural commodities.  Beginning in 2014, 
however, prices for major agricultural commodities  dropped sharply and led to 
declines in farm income over the next few years .  With prices for farm commodities 
having remained low, farm income is projected to rise only modestly this year, even 
after accounting for the increased support from direct governm ent payments 
related to trade policies .  The farm income figures for 2019 are USDA projections.  
Some private- sector analysts have indicated that the 2019 forecast appears  overly 
optimistic and is likely to be marked down as more complete data become available.  
Over  2000 to 2014, U.S. agricultural exports increased almost 200 percent, with 
significant increases in exports to China ( figure 2).  Since then , however, U.S. 
agricultural exports have weakened, on average, as foreign production has risen  
strongly.  Moreover, amid ongoing trade tensions, exports to China dropped 
sharply in 2018 and have fallen further so far this year.  For example, the value of 
U.S. soybean exports to China dropped approximately 75 percent in 2018 compared 
with the previous year, and the pace in the first half of 2019 has remained unchanged from a year ago.  Given recent trade tensions, China now buys most of 
its soybeans from Brazil, a pattern that some industry analysts suggest  may become 
permanen t and  have  long -lasting negative implications for U.S. producers.

The low prices for agricultural products , which have been holding down farm 
income, have persisted this year as global supplies of agricultural commodities have 
continued to outpace demand and inventories of agricultural commodities carried 
over from previous  seasons are expected to remain high.  At the same time, 
adverse weather conditions have led to domestic production disturbances.  Most notably, an unusually wet spring and severe flooding across large portions of the 
Midwest this year led to significant planting delays and prospects of reduced U.S. 
crop production, which we currently estimate will hold down GDP growth by 
0.1 percentage point this year.  Recent data suggest that more than 10 percent of 
planned U.S. corn and soybean acreage may have gone unplanted in 2019 because 
of weather- related disruptions.  
Reduced incomes and cash flow shortages have led to weaker financial conditions 
in the agricultural sector in recent years, although the situation appears less dire 
than in the 1980s, a period often referred to as the U.S. Farm Crisis.  Agricultural 
borrowing from various lending institutions has increased, though the rise in 
delinquency rates on agricultural loans thus far has been modest.  Relative strength 
in the value of farm real estate has also provided support to producers’ balance 
sheets, as farmland accounts for more than 80 percent of total assets in the U.S. 
farm sector.  That said, farmers’ liquidity appears exceptionally low by historical 
standards, raising concerns about their ability to withstand a potential downturn in 
demand.  
In the coming years, U.S. farm income growth is projected to remain subdued.  The 
U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that farm income will rise at an average annual rate of just 0.2 percent over the next 10 years, with the price of major 
agricultural commodities generally remaining flat because of  limited prospects for 
signific ant demand growth and persistently high global production.  C limate change 
is often cited as a primary risk to global agricultural production and could lead to 
more volatile swings in commodity prices in the future.  
Amid these ongoing economic and financial challenges, productivity growth in the 
U.S. farm sector has remained high.  From 2007 to 2017, multifactor productivity 
increased at an average annual pace of 1.2  percent in the U.S. crop and livestock 
industries, compared with 0.3  percent in the nonfarm U.S. economy.  The strength 
in productivity has continued to encourage investment and expansion among 
agribusinesses, agricultural service firms, and businesses specializing in 
transportation and logistics.

 After posting robust gains last y ear, business fixed investment (BFI)
decelerated to a 1.5 percent rate of  increase in the first half , perhaps partly in
response to uncertainty and lower expected longer-term profit g rowth.  In the
second half, these influences wil l probably intensify, as trade  tensions have
ratcheted up, analysts’ expectations of longer-run profit growt h have declined
further, and business sentiment  has weakened further.  As a consequence, we
now expect BFI to contract in th e second half of the year, and indicators are so
far consistent with that expectation.
Manufacturing production moved down f urther in July after decli ning at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent in the first half.  We estimate that  a substantial share
of the downturn in factory output thi s year is due to the direct effects of tariffs
imposed over the past year.  The drag from tariffs is likely to  persist, and
national indexes of new export or ders turned markedly negative in August.
Even so, we project that overall  manufacturing output will be l ittle changed
through year-end, as the sector i s supported, in part, by higher production of
motor vehicles than in t he first half of the year.
Exports continued to decline in the first half of this year, co nsistent with the
stronger dollar, tepid foreign grow th, retaliatory tariffs agai nst the United
States, and delayed aircraft e xports.  We project that the incr eased tariffs that
have already been implemented by the United States and its trad ing partners
will continue to depress both export and import growth through the near term.
In addition, both the strong dolla r and weak foreign growth sho uld weigh on
exports.  Hence, after having bee n a neutral influence on GDP g rowth in the
first half of the year, net expor ts will likely be a slight drag on growth in the
second half.
The key question for our medium-te rm projection is how the recent escalation in 
trade tensions, as well as signs  of more persistent weakness in foreign growth, will affect 
economic activity.  As a starti ng point, we have taken on board  the stronger dollar and 
weaker foreign growth (which are  negatives for the outlook) as well as the lower interest 
rates (a positive) as we typi cally do, on an other-things-equal basis.  But we also need to 
make sure our projection has a ppropriately taken on board the f actors driving the 
financial market changes in the first place.  With that in mind , and influenced by a further 
reduction in analysts’ longer-run profit expectations, we took down our projection a bit 
more than the other-things-equa l calculation above would call f or.  However, our

 assumptions that trade tensions  and uncertainty do not rise fur ther and that foreign 
growth recovers limit the downwar d revision to the level of GDP by the end of the 
medium term to ¼ percent.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY  
The labor market has tightened a  bit further so far this year b ut at a slower pace 
than last year.  Although published payroll gains have been slo wing, the unemployment 
rate has edged down, on net, fro m the end of 2018, and the empl oyment-to-population 
ratio has moved up a little.  Howev er, we project essentially n o further tightening of the 
labor market after this year.     
After rising at an average  monthly pace of 163,000 during the f irst half, total
nonfarm payrolls rose 159,000 in July and 130,000 in August.2  These latest
readings were below our expect ations in the July Tealbook but above the
monthly gains of 95,000 to 125,000 that we estimate are needed to keep labor
utilization constant.3  We expect payroll gains to average 131,000 from
September through December and to continue to step down over the medium
term, reaching a pace of 65,000 in 2022, as GDP growth slows.  Compared
with the July Tealbook, monthly payr oll growth is revised down by 20,000 to
30,000 throughout the medium term.
oBased on the BLS’s preliminary estimate of the benchmark revisi on to
payroll employment released las t month, we anticipate that next
February’s annual payroll revisions will reduce payroll gains f rom
April 2018 to March 2019 by an average of about 42,000 per mont h.4
As a result, we expect that th e average m
onthly gain in payroll
employment for 2018 will be revised down from 223,000 per month ,
as currently published, to about 190,000 per month, a pace that  is
similar to the average for  2017.  In addition, we anticipate th at revised
2 Temporary hiring by the Census Bureau added 25,000 to the gain  in nonfarm payrolls in August. 
3 This is the range that would be, on average, consistent with n o change in the unemployment rate 
and a decline in the participation rate in line with its trend over the next year.    
4 Each year, the BLS benchmarks its  sample-based estimate of the  level of payroll employment in 
March to the level of employment based on the universe of firms  reporting to their states’ unemployment 
insurance systems.  The universe- based count fully captures the  employment effects of firm births and 
deaths, while the currently published monthly employment change s since the previous benchmark in March 
2018 are based on a statistical  model of births and deaths.

 first-quarter payroll gains will be about 130,000 per month, co mpared 
with the currently publishe d 174,000 per month, and that the BL S will 
likely revise down published (or t o be published) employment ga ins 
from April through December of this year by an average of 15,00 0 per 
month (with a wide confidence  band around this estimate).  Afte r the 
annual revision, we expect that employment gains will be report ed to 
have slowed from an average  of 134,000 in the first half of thi s year to 
120,000 in the second half. 
oGains in private payrolls derived from microdata from the payro ll-
processing firm ADP have also s lowed since last year, and to a
somewhat larger extent than i n the published BLS data, on average, so
far this year.
oInitial claims for unemployment in surance, which are a reliable  early
indicator of a downturn, have b een little changed in recent mon ths at a
very low level.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent in August.  We expect
the unemployment rate to remain at this level through the end o f 2019 and
then to edge down to 3.6 percent, staying at that level through 2022, a path
that is similar to our proj ection in the July Tealbook.
The LFPR rose to 63.2 percent in A ugust from 63.0 percent in July, boosted
by a jump in prime-age female participation.  We expect that th e LFPR will
decline over the projection pe riod, as the ongoing aging of the  working-age
population is no longer offset by cyclical improvement in parti cipation.
We estimate that output per hour i n the business sector increas ed at a
2.9 percent rate in the first half of this year, well above its  pace in 2018.  This
recent surge likely overstates the true gains in productivity, as it reflects, in
large part, a steep decline i n self-employed hours, which are a  poorly
measured and volatile component of  aggregate hours; indeed, sel f-employed
hours increased in both July and A ugust.  We expect productivit y to grow
around 1¼ percent through the medium term.

   The box “Platform Gig Workers i n the U.S. Economy” discusses 
characteristics of the portion of the workforce using new techn ologies to 
supply labor and earn income.   
We have reevaluated our aggregate supply assumptions this round .   
 In particular, we now assume that the natural rate of unemploym ent declined 
to 4.4 percent by the end of 2018, 0. 2 percentage point lower t han in the July 
Tealbook.  To be clear, the information we use to pin down the natural rate of 
unemployment—residuals from our w age and price inflation equati ons, data 
on the demographic and educational composition of the workforce , and 
various measures of labor marke t efficiency and tightness—canno t neatly 
distinguish between 4.4 percent and 4.6 percent.  With this change, we have 
judged that a balanced assessment is one that puts a little mor e weight on the 
indicators calling for a  lower natural rate. 
 We also raised our estimate of str uctural productivity growth i n recent years, 
and the level at the end of 2018 is ¼ percent higher than in th e July 
Tealbook.  In the past, actual pr oductivity has tended to fall below trend in a 
tight economy, possibly reflecting individuals with below-average human 
capital being drawn into the labo r force.  With the higher tren d in this forecast, 
actual productivity in recent years now appears more consistent with past 
experience.   
 With these changes, we have addr essed some tensions that have a risen over 
the past year between our view  of resource utilization and data  on the labor 
market and productivity.  All told, we now estimate the level o f potential 
output at the end of 2018 to stand 0.5 percent higher than in t he July 
Tealbook, a revision that contributed meaningfully to the lower  output gap 
mentioned in the introduction. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Core PCE inflation is projected to move up to 1.8 percent by the end of this year.  
We project core inflation to sta y at that level through the med ium term—equal to our 
estimate of underlying inflation—as the effects of tight resource utilization are offset by

 an appreciating dollar.  Total PC E inflation is expected to be in line with core inflation 
after this year, as energy prices become less of a drag on the inflation projection.        
Core PCE prices rose 1.6 percen t over the 12 months ending in J uly.  This
figure is a little below that in the July Tealbook due to downw ardly revised
monthly readings on nonmarket pric es in the first  part of the y ear.  As we
anticipated, low monthly readings  on core infla tion from early in the year
have proven transitory.  We exp ect core inflation to move up to  1.7 percent in
August and to increase to 1.8 percen t later this year, as core inflation is
boosted by tariff increases.
oAlternative measures of inflati on also indicate that the weakne ss
earlier this year was transitor y.  The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mea n
measure of inflation rose 2.0 percent in the 12 months ending i n July,
similar to readings recorded late last year.  In addition, a st aff estimate
of core PCE inflation excluding idiosyncrati c price changes was
1.7 percent in July, also little c hanged from its level late la st year.
We estimate that the effective price for imported core goods (w hich includes
the effects of tariffs) was about unchanged in the first half of the year,
somewhat less than we expected  in the July Tealbook, as falling  prices for
imported foods and metals offset a  boost from the increased tar iffs on imports
from China.  For the second half of  the year, we expect effecti ve core import
price inflation to step up to 1.6 pe rcent, as the higher tariff s more than offset
the effects of the appreciati ng dollar and lower commodity pric es.  After this
year, core import price inflati on is expected to be subdued—ref lecting an
appreciating dollar and the fadi ng effects of the recent tariff  increases—and to
hold down domestic prices.
Median long-run inflatio n expectations from the Michigan survey  edged up to
2.6 percent in August.  This measure has moved roughly sideways since 2016despite fluctuating within a somewhat wider range in 2019 than in previous
years.  By contrast, the FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of
median three-year-ahead expect ed inflation edged down, as did T IPS-based
measures of longer-term i nflation compensation.

 Platform  Gig Workers in the U .S. Economy  
Over the past decade, the use of online platforms to match workers to short -term jobs , 
or “gigs ,” has grown rapidly.  Workers on these platforms provide labor to generate 
income and might also use their own capital —for example, by driving their own cars for 
delivery or chauffer services or by renting their propert ies to travelers.  Although 
informal work has been  a long -standing characteristic of the labor market , gig platforms 
have expanded because they are easy for workers to join and provide efficient and 
flexible ways of locating and transacting with customers .  At the same time, platform  gig 
work has raised concerns because it is thought to be associated with little job security 
and a lack of employer -provided benefits.   Here we describe  recent  findings about the 
size of the platform gig workforce and the characteristics of such work and workers.   
Currently , because of its small  size, platform  gig work appears to have a limited influence 
on the overall labor market, but its prevalence will likely increase in the future as new 
platforms enter and existing ones expand.   
Although gig platforms are widely available , only a small fra ction of U .S. workers 
currently engage s in platform -related  gig work ; estimates range from 1 to 5  percent of 
the U .S. workforce.1  Notably, since individuals  participate in gig work sporadically over 
time, the number of platform gig workers  is higher on an  annual basis than at shorter 
frequencies.  For example, a study of Chase checking account holders finds that the 
majority of platform gig participants earn gig income in only a few months out of the 
year.2   
For most platform participants, gig work appear s to be a secondary source of income.  
For instance , a study of IRS personal income tax data shows that for the majority of gig 
platform participants , earnings reported on W -2 forms are much greater than  those from 
gig work reported on 1099 forms .3  Similarly, in the 2018 Survey of Household Econ omics 
and Decisionmaking (SHED) , respondents more commonly report that gig  work  provide s 
a supplemental rather than a primary source of income.4  While gigs tend  to be a small 
                                                 
1 Some other research has focused on contingent workers, defined as workers who do not expect 
their jobs to last.  The B ureau of Labor Statistics  reports that these workers, some of whom may work 
platform gigs, accounted for 4 percent of employment in its 2017 survey , similar to the  share in 2005.

2017,” press release, June 7, https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/conemp.pdf .

share of income on an annual basi s, a 2018 study found that platform gig work provides 
about half of workers’ household income in the months they work on these gigs .5   
Platform gig workers differ in several respects from the typical U.S. employee.  First, the 
workplaces, hours, and earni ngs of gig workers are generally more variable than those of 
wage and salary employees.  This flexibility has some advantages:  Gig workers typically 
set their own schedules and can work more on a given day or opt out for weeks or 
months at a time.  Howeve r, as independent contractors, platform gig workers do not 
receive employer -provided medical insurance or paid sick leave and are not covered by  
unemployment insurance, have no guarantee of minimum wage or overtime pay, and 
limited protection from discrimi nation  or other unfair practices .  Second, platform gig 
workers tend to be younger than the overall workforce; male and black workers are also 
overrepresented among  platform work ers.  In addition, some evidence suggests that 
workers with college degrees are overrepresented in platform work ers, although the 
2018 SHED finds that less -educated workers are more likely to rely on gigs as their 
primary source of income.6  Finally, transportation platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, 
account for a large share of platf orm  gig employment and income, and these gigs are 
concentrated in large cities and tourist destinations.  On the whole, platform gigs are 
more prevalent in densely  populated areas , whereas small cities and rural areas have less 
platform gig work.   
Future growth in platforms would likely make platform work increasingly available to 
individuals looking to work more hours.  As a result , even though platform gig work may 
be more unstable than traditional employment, the ability to substitute platform gigs for 
traditional work could make individual income and spending more resilient to temporary, 
idiosyncratic reductions in income from traditional jobs.  However, some types of 
workers will likely continue to face higher barriers to participating in platform gig work.  
For example, it seems likely that older individuals and those in rural areas will continue to 
be underrepresented in platform gig work , at least  for the foreseeable future , and less 
able to use it to ensure  against reductions in other sources of inc ome.7  Moreover, we do 
not know how the availability of platform gig work would change in an economic 
downturn.   If demand for platform gigs  decline s along with the demand for traditional 
jobs , then platform  gig work may be unable to offset reductions in traditional 
employment during  recessions to the same extent as in expansions.     
5 See Farrell, Greig, and Hamoudi, Online Platform Economy in 2018  in note 2.  
6 For data on participation in electronically mediated work by education level, see Bureau of Labor 
Statistics  (2018),  “Electronically Mediated Work:  New Questions in the Contingent Worker 
Supplement ,” Monthly Labor Review , September , https://doi.org/10.21916/mlr.2018.24 .  
7 In the 2019 paper “Is Gig Work Replacing Traditional Employment?” (see note 3), Collins and 
others show that, relative to the total workforce, older individuals and those in rural areas are 
underrepresented in platform gigs but overrepresented in nonplatform gigs, which suggests that these 
types of individuals have less access to platform gigs.

  o In the current projection, we have  maintained our view that und erlying 
inflation is 1.8 percent and that it will hold steady at this l evel over the 
medium term.  This assumption i s informed by a variety of stati stical 
models, some of which incorporate information on inflation 
expectations.  
We project that hourly compensation will increase moderately ov er the medium 
term.     
 Compensation per hour, which is mo re cyclically sensitive and m uch noisier 
than other measures of compensa tion, surged in the first half o f this year.  
However, we believe this jump is transitory, in part because wa ge data from 
ADP suggest gains in compensation in the first quarter were driven by 
bonuses and stock option exercises.  As a result, we expect com pensation per 
hour to rise 5.3 percent this year  but to increas e 3.5 percent per year, on 
average, over the medium term. 
 The employment cost index (ECI),  which excludes stock options, rose 
2.6 percent in the 12 months ending in June, down a bit from th ree months 
earlier.  We expect the ECI to maintain this pace through the e nd of the 
projection period. 
 Average hourly earnings rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months end ing in 
August, the same as over the preceding 12 months.  We expect gr owth in 
average hourly earnings to be near this pace through the near t erm. 
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 We assume that the natural rate of unemployment is 4.4 percent over the 
longer run, 0.2 percentage point low er than in the July Tealboo k.  We 
continue to assume that potential output growth will slow after  2021 to 
1.7 percent per year in the longe r run, as the boost to potential growth from 
the 2017 tax cuts wanes.  
 We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equili brium federal 
funds rate will be 0.5 percent.  The nominal yield on 10-year T reasury 
securities is 3.4 percen t in the longer run.

  o We continue to assume that fiscal policymakers will eventually reduce 
primary deficits by an amount suffi cient to stabilize the debt- to-GDP 
ratio.  We expect this ratio to settle around 105 percent in th e longer 
run, 20 percentage points higher th an would have occurred in th e 
absence of the 2017–18 federal t ax and discretionary spending c hanges 
and the recently approved incre ase in spending caps.  We also still 
assume that this 20 percentage poi nt increase in the debt-to-GD P ratio 
will push up the term premium  on 10-year Treasury yields 50 bas is 
points in the long run. 
 GDP growth averages slightly below its long-run value of 1.7 pe rcent from 
2023 through 2025 and rises graduall y to its long-run value thereafter.  The 
unemployment rate moves up gradua lly from 3.6 percent at the en d of 2022 
toward its assumed natural rate  in subsequent years.  Core PCE price inflation 
remains at 1.9 percent for many y ears before converging eventua lly to its 
long-run value of 2.0 percent. 
 Given the outlook for inflation a nd resource utilization, the n ominal federal 
funds rate remains close to its long-run value of 2.5 percent f rom the end of 
the medium term onward.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Despite the buzz about a global recession, we do not see one around the corner.  
Notwithstanding the trade tensions and a continued slump in manufacturing, services—
which account for the largest share of activity in most advanced economies—are holding 
up relatively better, and most economies are set for further expansion.  But there is hardly 
cause to be sanguine.  We have revised down our foreign outlook yet again and now see economic growth abroad holding steady below potential in the second half of the y ear 
rather than picking up modestly as projected in the July Tealbook.  Moreover, downside risks have increased noticeably amid another escalation of trade tensions, despite some 
abatement of the political turmoil in Hong Kong and Italy.  The prospects for Brexit 
remain highly uncertain.   
Incoming GDP data put foreign growth in the second quarter at 2.1 percent at an 
annual rate, a touch higher than we were expecting in the July Tealbook.  Growth in Brazil, Canada, and Japan was stronger than expected, but this positive surprise was 
largely offset by downward surprises in Germany, Hong Kong, and the United 
Kingdom—where output contracted— and in several other emerging market economies 
(EMEs).  Third -quarter indicators have generally disappointed, including for much-
watched Germany and China as well as for Canada.  We now see aggregate foreign growth remaining at about 2  percent in the second half of the year (0.3 percentage point 
lower than in the July Tealbook) as some recovery in the EMEs is roughly offset by 
slower growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs).  Moreover, the pickup in 
EMEs is predicated on sustained recoveries in Brazil and Mexico, which are hardly assured at this point.   
We expect foreign growth to edge up to about 2.5 percent next yea r, close to 
potential, and remain about there over the forecast period.  We assume that the drag from several factors that have weighed on foreign growth, including trade policy uncertainty and the global manufacturing slump (the latter is discussed in the box “Weakness in the Global Manufacturing Sector”), will ease, consistent with the recent industrial production strength in emerging Asia ex cluding China.  Highly accommodative monetary policies 
should also provide support.

 Weakness in the Global Manufacturing Sector  
Global manufacturing activity has been weakening since 2018 (red line in figure 1).  Moreover, this 
weakness has become increasingly widespread, with manufacturing purchasing managers index es 
(PMIs) indicating co ntractions (below 50) in the majority of countries for which we have data.  In 
contrast, the service sector has performed relatively better (blue line in figure 1), with service PMIs 
indicating contractions in only a few countries.  Because movements in the manufacturing PMI can be followed by more generalized downturns in economic activity, the manufacturing slowdown warrants close attention.
 1  In this discussion, we present evidence that a global investment 
slowdown —perhaps triggered by the surge in trade policy uncertainty —is  an important 
contributor to th e weakness in the global manufacturing sector.2 
The downturn in global manufacturing activity has coincided with a global investment slowdown.  
Both industrial production (IP) (red line in figure 2) and  investment growth (blue line in figure 2) 
have trended down since 2018, with the latter reaching its lowest level since the Global Financial Crisis.  This investment downturn has also been widespread, with more than three- fourths  of the 
economies in our s ample— among them China, Germany , and the United Kingdom —experiencing 
a deceleration.  Moreover, as shown in figure 3, the contribution of capital goods (green bars) to 
growth of global IP has fallen markedly since 2017, which provides further evidence of t he 
importance of investment in dragging down global manufacturing activity.  
What accounts for this manufacturing and investment slowdown?  A likely explanation is that trade tensions, although concentrated in  the United States and China, have had wider 
international spillovers .  For instance, recently imposed tariffs and uncertainty about future tariffs 
could be weighing on global manufacturing activity through supply chain  connection s, and 
                                                 
1 For example, manufacturing PMIs tend to lead services PMIs.           
2 A recent memo by the Board staff finds that the direct effect of tariff increases accounts for about half of 
the recent deceleration in U.S. manufacturing industrial production.  See Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce  (2019), 
“Effects of Recent Tariffs on Manufacturing Output,” memorandum, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System, Division of Research and Statistics, August 2 6.

heightene d uncertainty about future tariffs is likely depressing  investment.  Both investment and 
manufacturing started to turn down in 2018 when trade tensions intensified.  Figure 4 shows that 
decreases in manufacturing PMIs have been larger in those countries with higher trade openness, 
consistent with the hypothesis  that trade tensions are weighing on manufacturing activity and 
investment.  The IEDO box “The Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty on Global Economic Activity,” attempts to quantify the drag of trade policy uncertainty on global activity.  
Besides trade ten sions, other more idiosyncratic factors have likely contributed to the weakness 
of manufacturing as well.  First, European auto production remains sluggish, as German 
manufacturers have failed to bounce back from the introduction of more stringent emission  
standards in the summer of 2018.  Second, Chinese domestic demand has weakened, in part because of the country’s deleveraging campaign, leading to knock -on effects for its major trade 
partners.  For example, weak global demand for electronic products, driven in large part by China, has caused a sharp slowdown in emerging Asia’s technology sector.  Finally, it is possible that 
some still unidentified factor is weighing on global manufacturing.

  However, downside risks around this outlook have increased.  First, trade policy 
uncertainty (TPU) ratcheted up again as the United States and China implemented further 
tariff increases in September and threatened even more later in the year.  Our econometric estimates of the effects of  TPU on global growth suggest that the most 
recent spike in TPU would reduce global growth about 0.1 percentage point, which is broadly consistent with the size of our downward revision to foreign growth ( see the box 
“The Effects of Trade Policy Uncertaint y on Global Growth”).  Consistent with our 
standard practice, we are assuming no further increases in tariffs and, with negotiations resuming in October between China and the United States, this outcome may even come true.  However, a further escalation of trade tensions is quite plausible, as we explore in our “Escalation of Trade Tensions” alternative scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
The United Kingdom continues to struggle with Brexit.  The political 
developments of the past few weeks have made it clear that no consensus around a Brexit deal is likely to emerge any time in the next few months.  Therefore, the assumption in our previous forecasts that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union (EU) with a deal in place by the end of the year is no longer tenable.  Instead, we assume that there will be another extension and that it will take an additional year to reach consensus on a 
Brexit deal.  Meanwhile, the continued uncertainty will weigh on the U.K. economy, with 
some adverse spill overs to the euro area but a more limited effect on the rest of the world.  
However, a no-deal Brexit by the October 31 deadline could still happen.  As discussed in our alternative scenario “No-Deal Brexit,” given the substantial preparation for this possible outcome and markets having internalized some likelihood of such an event, there will likely not be large disruptions to global financial markets.  As such, a no- deal Brexit 
would probably push foreign growth only slightly below our new baseline.  That said, we cannot rule out more severe and disruptive outcomes. 
Foreign inflation stepped up in the second quarter, broadly in line with 
expectations , due to earlier increases in oil prices and, in some key EMEs, food prices.  
Incoming data show little sign  of underlying inflationary pressures, however, with 12-
month core inflation in July for the euro area and Japan remaining subdued—at 0.9 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively —and oil prices falling.  Against the backdrop of 
subdued inflation and faltering growth, we expect the European Central Bank (ECB) will soon announce further stimulus.  AFE policy rates, more generally, are set to remain low for long, and we have revised down the policy rate path for Canada a bit on the weaker

 outlook.  There was a plethora of policy rate cuts in EMEs, including Brazil, Chile, India, 
Indonesia, Russia, Mexico, Thailand, and the Philippines, with central banks citing weak 
domestic activity, concerns about global growth, and trade uncertainty. 
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
•United Kingdom.  Real GDP contracted 0.8 percent in the second quarter, held backby the reversal of the stockpiling ahead of the original Brexit deadline, temporary
shutdowns by several car producers, and a sharp decline in investment.  This reading
is 0.6 percentage point lower than our July Tealbook estimate and, with PMI datathrough August also coming in surprisingly weak, we have revised down ourprojection for growth in the current quarter to only 0.4 percent.
Given the recent approval of a bill by the House of Commons that intends to block an
exit from the EU without a deal , as well as  the failed attempt by Prime Minister
Johnson to consolidate his power by calling elections for October 15, we are
moderately comfortable that the United Kingdom will not crash out of the EU by the
October 31 deadline.  That said, the political turbulence of recent weeks convinces usthat we can no longer assume that the United Kingdom will leave the EU with a  deal
in place by year -end.  Instead, we assume that the United Kingdom will take an
additional year to come up with an orderly way to execute Brexit as approved by theEU.  With elevated Brexit -related uncertainty persisting for much longer, we marked
down growth 0.6 percentage point for 2020 to 1 percent.  That said, as Prime MinisterJohnson plans to repeat his call for a snap election for October, the risk of a no- deal
Brexit on October 31 remains, though it is somewhat diminished.  Acknowledging thehuge uncertainty around this  possibility , we see a no -deal Brexit as depressing U.K.
growth a further 0.7 percentage point to near zero next year, while euro -area growth
is lowered 0.3 percentage point to about 1 percent.  (See the scenario “No -Deal
Brexit ” in the Risks and Uncertainty section for details.)
•Euro Area.  GDP growth slowed from 1.7 percent in the first quarter to a below-potential pace of 0.8 percent in the second, mainly reflecting a slump in net exportsand ongoing weakness in the manufacturing sector.  The slowdown was especiallymarked in Germany, with output contracting 0.3 percent at an annual rate.  Economicindicators, such as July retail sales as well as PMIs and economic sentiment throughAugust, suggest that euro- area growth will rem ain at 0.8 percent in the third quarter, a
touch weaker than our July Tealbook forecast.  Going forward, we expect growth to

 The Effects of Trade Policy Uncertainty on Global Economic Activity  
The outlook for trade remains highly uncertain .  Figure 1  shows the staff ’s index of trade policy uncertainty 
(TPU), which is constructed by counting the frequency of joint occurrences of trade policy and uncertainty 
terms in  major newspapers.  The TPU index, which had fallen in July, rose again in August amid renewed trade 
tensions between the United States and China, which included the announcement of additional tariffs, the designation of China as a “currency manipulator,” and mutual threats of further tariff hikes.   The August 
increase marks the third wave of pronounced increases in TPU in recent years , following a first wave of 
increases in  early 2018 —when initial tariffs were announced and then imposed on steel, aluminum, and some 
imports from China —and  a second wave of increases in May and June of this year , when additional tariffs were 
imposed on China and threatened on Mexico.  
While it is possible that trade negotiations will eventually lead to a more open and fair global competitive landscape, heightened uncertainty  about trade policies is  likely weigh ing on economic activity in the United 
States and aroun d the world through a variety of channels.
1  In particular, higher uncertainty may delay  or 
deter  firms’ investment and hiring, lower consumer confidence and spending, and depress investors’ 
sentiment while  boost ing flight -to-safety flows that appreciate the dollar , thus reducing U.S. net exports.   
To quantify the economic effects of increased trade tensions, we estimate a monthly vector auto -regression 
(VAR ) model  that  include s the staff ’s index of  TPU ; manufacturing industrial production in the United States, in 
the AFEs, and in the EMEs ; the broad real dollar index ; world imports ; U.S. stock prices ; U.S. credit spreads ; and 
U.S. import tariffs .2  The inclusion of tariffs in the VAR model allows us to isolate movements in TPU that reflect 
variation in genuine trade uncertainty from those that reflect implemented trade policy actions.3 
According to the  VAR estimate s, an increase in TPU lowers industrial production in the United States and 
abroad , boosts the dollar,  reduces the price of risky assets, and  lower s world imports.  These effects build over 
time —the maximum decline in industrial production occurs  after six months—and die out slowly.  We convert 
the effects on industrial production into GDP effects using the historical elasticity of GDP growth to industrial 
production growth.  
Our estimates imply that  the three waves of trade tensions combined  should subtract  about 1  percent  from the 
level of GDP  in both the United States and the foreign economies by early 2020  (the black lines in figure 2).  The 
first wave  of increased uncertainty  (red lines) accounts for the largest effects and is estimated to have 
subtracted about 0.7 percent from the level of GDP.   Had trade tensions not escalated further in May and agai n 
more recently, the drag on GDP would have started to ease in the second half of 2019 .  In particular, t he second 
wave  that started in May  (blue lines) ha s exerted  an additional drag on the level of global GDP of about 
0.2 percent , while the third wave  since  August 2019  should subtract an additional 0.1  percent .

2 Our sample runs from 1985:M1 through 2019:M6.  The VAR model, estimation details, and estimated impulse 
responses are described in Dario Caldara, Matteo Iacoviello, Patrick Molligo, Andrea Prestipino, and Andrea Raffo (2019), 
“Does Trade Policy Uncertainty Affect Global Economic Activity? ” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System, September 4 ), https://doi.org/10.17016/2573 -2129.47 .  The VAR results are similar when we truncate 
the estimation sample for the VAR in 2015, thus excluding the spikes in trade uncertainty in the last part of the sample.  
3 Like many news -based uncertainty indicators, our measure of trade uncertainty may also capture news about future 
changes in tariffs regardless of whether they are realized or not.

 This analysis represents an attempt to quantify the all- in effects of increased TPU  on global economic activity .  
Our empirical model predicts material  effects of trade tensions that will only begin to ease in the second half of 
2020.   That said, the  confidence intervals around the se estimates point to some degree of uncertainty,  
especially  given the  lack of historical experience with increases in TPU of the magnitude that we have seen 
recently.  For  the United S tates, the estimate d adverse effects  are somewhat larger than  the drag we have 
built into the Tealbook baseline and so represent a downside risk to that baseline projection.  For foreign 
economies, the estimate d adverse effects  are more in line with the downward revisions to our forecast since 
last year, hinting that trade tensions may keep weighing on the outlook going forward .

  gradually rise amid highly accommodative monetary policy, reaching 1.8 percent by 
the first half of 2021, and hover around this pace through 2022.  The outlook for next 
year is down a bit, as we now expect Brexit uncertainty to persist for longer, causing adverse spillovers to the euro area.  
Headline 12 -month inflation edged down from 1.3 percent in May to 1 percent in July 
and August.  With core inflation at just 0.9 percent, we have inflation remaining 
subdued in the second half of this year before rising gradually to 1.6 percent at the 
end of the forecast period.  In light of the weak outlook for inflation and growth, we 
expect the ECB to cut its deposit rate 20 basis points to negative 60 ba sis points at its 
September 12 meeting and restart its asset purchase program in October, as we assumed in July. 
• Japan.  GDP growth was puzzlingly strong in the first half of this year, given declines in industrial production and exports.  After expanding at an annual rate of 
2.8 percent in the first quarter, real GDP increased 1.8 percent in the second as a sharp pickup in domestic demand offset the drag from net exports.  That said, 
consumer confidence declined further in July, and the manufacturing PMI remained 
in contractionary territory in August, leaving us more pessimistic about future 
growth.  Smoothing through the volatility induced by the scheduled October consumption tax hike, we see growth declining to about zero in the second half of the year.  Over the next two years, we expect growth to be slightly above its potential pace of 0.7 percent, supported by additional spending related to the 2020 Tokyo 
Olympics and very accommodative monetary policy.  
Both total and core 12-month inflation remained subdued in July at 0.6 percent and 
0.4 percent, respectively.  The upcoming consumption tax hike will provide only a modest temporary boost to inflation, as its effect will be largely offset by stimulative fiscal policies that will cut costs for households , including free public early childhood 
education and higher education support.  We expect total inflation to rise to about 
1 percent by 2021.  With inflation still well below the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) 
2 percent inflation target, we anticipate that the BOJ  will keep its deposit rate at 
negative 0.1 percent through 2021.  The BOJ continued its purchases of Japanese government bonds but reduced the purchase size in the 5- to 10- year tenures, as the 
10-year sovereign yield fell below the lower end of its targeted range of negative 
0.2 percent to positive 0.2 percent.  The BOJ also announced that it will further cut purchase amounts in this sector in September.

 •Canada.  Real GDP growth picked up from a meager 0.5 percent in the first quarter
to 3.7 percent in the second, 1.1 percentage points higher than in the July Tealbook,
reflecting rebounds in oil production and exports.  That said, weak investment i n the
second quarter and subdued manufacturing PMIs through August point to a step-
down in growth to 1.2 percent this quarter.  We expect growth to edge up to itspotential pace of 1.7 percent by the second half of 2020 and remain about there overthe forecast period.  The projection for 2020 is a bit lower than in the July Tealbook,reflecting lower oil prices and the weaker U.S. outlook.  We expect the weakness
over the next several quarters to lead the Bank of Canada to cut its policy rate
25 basis p oints early next year to 1.5 percent.
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
•China .  After slowing sharply to 5.6 percent in the second quarter, we expect similar
growth in the current quarter.  Industrial production contracted and retail sales growthslowed in July.  Much of this weakness was anticipated and reflected a slowing ofauto sales and production following a surge in June ahead of a tightening of autoemissions standards.  In contrast, July exports held up relatively well, as a rebound insales to Asia and the EU more than offset falling exports to the United States.   All
told, we have revised down the outlook a touch for the second half, but growth thisyear should still come in within the Chinese authorities’ target range of 6 to6½ percent.
We expect the recently implemented 15 percentage point tariff hike on about
$100 billion of Chinese goods (t ogether with China’s retaliation on about $30 billion
of U.S. goods ), the uncertainty effects of the recent increase in trade tensions , and
some offsetting further policy stimulus to take about 0.1 percentage point, on net, offChina’s growth over the forecast period.  With this small downward revision, we seegrowth holding steady at about 5.7 percent through the end of the forecast period.
•Other Emer ging Asia.  India’s GDP growth stepped down to an unexpectedly low
2.7 percent last quarter, as manufacturing activity contracted.  This  step-down ,
together with a contraction of output in Hong Kong driven by a collapse ininvestment, pushed down overall growth in the region to 2.5 percent in the secondquarter, 0.3 percentage point below our July Tealbook estimate.  We now expect real
GDP growth to rise to only 2.7 percent in the current quarter, 0.5 percentage point
below our July forecast.  The markdown, in large part, is due to substantial downward

  revision to Hong Kong’s near-term outlook as a consequence of political unrest, 
which is weighing especially hard on tourism and retail sales.  These disruptions 
should abate following the announcement by Hong Kong’s government that it will formally withdraw the extradition bill, but the situation remains quite uncertain .  
Elsewhere in the region, incoming data continue to point to a recovery in the second half of the year.  Exports bounced back in July after a very weak end to the second quarter, and industrial production grew strongly in July in Taiwan, Korea, and 
Singapore.  Recovery in manufacturing, together with support from fiscal policy in 
some countries, should boost growth in the region to its potentia l pace of 3.5 percent 
by the beginning of next year.  
• Mexico.   Real GDP stagnated in the second quarter following a 1 percent drop in the 
first, weighed down by weak domestic demand, particularly investment.  However, with relatively strong manufacturing exports, together with a projected pickup in U.S. manufacturing , growth should recover somewhat in the second half of the year, albeit 
to a still lackluster 1.5 percent.  Inflation has moved down in recent months to 
3.8 percent on a 12-month basis, below the 4 percent upper limit of the tolerance 
range, reflecting low er energy prices.  Amid lessened inflationary pressures and 
responding to the weak economy, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) lowered its policy rate 25 basis points to 8 percent in mid -August—its first cut in five years.  With the BOM 
easing monetary policy, we ex pect growth to move up gradually to a trend- like pace 
of 2.5 percent by 2021.  However, the downbeat tone of the incoming data, 
particularly in investment, prompted us to lower our path for growth over the forecast 
period about 0.2 percentage point.  
• Brazi l.  Real GDP grew 1.8 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter after 
contracting in the first quarter, printing well above our July Tealbook estimate.  The surge was led by investment, but growth was also boosted by the dissipation of the drag from temporary factors, including the Brumadinho dam collapse.  The central bank of Brazil surprised markets with a 50 basis point cut in interest rates, and, with inflation running below target at just over 3 percent, we expect further monetary 
easing.  In addition, progress on the long-awaited pension reform, which is expected 
to be approved in October, should improve business confidence.  All told, we expect growth to pick up to 2.3 percent next year and to 2.8 percent in 2021.  If this forecast materializes,  it will mean that, after several years of faltering recovery, Brazil will 
finally climb out of the deepest recession in its history.

 •Argentina.  Financial turmoil again intensified in Argentina, this time triggered by
President Macri’s resounding defeat  in the August 11 primaries.  The result makes it
highly likely that opposition challenger Alberto Fernández  (no relation to Fernández ’s
running mate, former P resident Cristina Fernández de Kirchner) will win in the
October  27 presidential election.  Concerns about the policies of a potential
Fernández  administration fueled a currency crash and rendered the government
unable to roll over its short-term debt.  As a result, on August 28, the Macrigovernment announced that it would unilaterally extend the mat urities of Treasury
bills and seek a voluntary “reprofiling” of about $100 billion in longer- term public
debt, about half of which is owed to the IMF under Argentina’s Stand-B y
Arrangement.  These announcements only intensified downward pressures on thecurrency, prompting the Macri government to impose capital controls on
September  1.  The risk of further deterioration in the country’s financial and
economic situation is pronounced.

Financial Market Developments 
Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were  driven by an 
escalation in interna tional trade tensions, growing concerns ab out the global growth 
outlook, and the prospect of more policy accommodation by centr al banks.1  Nominal 
Treasury yields posted very large  declines, with the 30-year yi eld reaching historical lows 
at one point.  The declines in Tre asury yields were likely due in part to typical flight-to-
safety demands triggered by the  uptick in concerns about the do mestic economic outlook.  
In addition, global demands for s afe U.S. assets may have increased markedly over the 
period, perhaps due in part to somewhat greater concerns about the foreign outlook than 
the domestic outlook and to the inc reasing share of sovereign d ebt with very low and 
negative yields in AFEs.  The mar ket-implied path of the federa l funds rate shifted down 
notably, showing particular sensi tivity to trade-related news.  A straight read of options 
quotes suggests that market par ticipants see a 25 basis point r eduction in the target range 
as the most likely outcome at the  September FOMC meeting.  Broad equity price indexes 
were down as much as 6 percent in early August but are down only about 1.5 percent, on 
net, over the intermeeting peri od as a whole.  Corporate bond s preads widened modestly.     
Nominal Treasury yields fe ll 28, 47, and 53 basis points, respectively, at the
2-, 10-, and 30-year maturities .  The spread between 2- and 10- year tenors
turned negative in mid-August for the first time since 2007 and  has since
remained near zero.
Measures of the expected level of  the federal funds rate at the  end of this year
and beyond moved down.  A straight rea d of OIS forward rates su ggests that
investors expect the federal  funds rate to decline about 60 bas is points by the
end of this year, while a model th at adjusts for term premiums implies a
decline of about 35 basis points.
1 The analysis in this section re flects market data through clos e of business on September 5.  On 
the morning of September 6, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publ ished the August Employment Situation 
report.  In the report, payrolls growth was slightly below expe ctations, the unemployment rate was in line 
with expectations, and hourly earnings and labor force participation printed above expectations.  Nominal 
Treasury yields were down 3 basis points at both the 2- and 10- year maturities in the first 10 minutes of 
trading subsequent to the releas e.  Equity index futures were l ittle changed on net.

respectively.

DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Nominal U.S. Treasury yields d ecreased markedly across the curv e, on net, over 
the intermeeting period, with the yields on 2-, 10- and 30-year  Treasury securities 
dropping 28, 47, and 53 basis points, respectively.  These moves are quite significant, 
with the decline in the 10-y ear yield falling within the 6th pe rcentile of intermeeting 
changes since 1994, while the decline in the 30-year yield is t he largest since 2008 and 
the third largest since 1994.   
While it is difficult to fully account for the magnitudes of these yield movements, 
market participants cited sever al factors that may help explain  the recent declines in 
longer-term yields.  These factor s included the escalation in t rade tensions between the 
United States and China, concerns  about the global growth outlook, and the relative 
attractiveness of longer-term U.S. Treasury securities due to t he very low levels of 
sovereign yields in many AFEs.  U .S. economic data releases were mixed and, on 
balance, had only modest effects  on financial markets.  Staff m odels attribute about half 
of the declines in nominal longer-t erm Treasury yields to lower term premiums, with an 
estimate of the 10-year term pr emium currently standing near it s lowest historical level at 
around negative 71 basis points.  (The box “Drivers of Recent M ovements in Treasury 
Yields” provides additional anal ysis on these yield movements.)  
Expectations of near- and medium -term domestic monetary policy shifted down 
over the period and were particularly sensitive to news about U .S.–China trade tensions.  
Overall, FOMC communications  had only modest effects on policy expectations.  The 
July FOMC statement and press c onference were seen as slightly less accommodative

 Drivers of Recent Movements  in Treasury  Yields 
Yields on  nominal Treasury  securities  have declined  dramatically,  on net, across the curve since the 
July FOMC meeting.   Our analysis  suggests  that the decline in short‐term Treasury  yields largely  
reflected  heightened  trade tensions  between  the United States and China that lowered investors’  
expectations  for the near ‐term path of monetary  policy.  The declines  in longer‐term yields are  not 
as closely linked to trade‐related news.  Instead,  a
 larger share  of the fall in long ‐term yields 
appears to be related to investors’  concern about  the downside  risks to the foreign outlook.   In 
addition, investor demand for long‐term U.S. Treasury securities  reportedly  increased  as the share 
of sovereign  debt with negative  yields  has risen. 
Yields
 on short‐term  U.S. Treasury  securities  responded  to escalating  trade tensions  between  the 
United States and China.  As shown by  the red dots in the lower‐ left quadrant  of figure 1, declines  in 
two‐year  Treasury  yields i mmediately  after adverse  news on U.S.–China  trade tensions  were large.  
On net, taking into account negative  and positive trade news that occurred  in either daytime or 
after‐hours trading, the  change in the two‐year Treasury  yield in narrow windows  after these 
announcements  explains 18 basis points of the 28 basis point intermeeting  decline (see  figure 2).  In 
addition, staff term structure models  ascribe a majority  of the decline of short‐term  Treasury  yields 
over the period to declines  in the expected  path of short‐terms rates.  Taken  together,  these 
results suggest that investors  expect monetary  policy to respond  to the perceived  drag on  growth 
related to the U.S.–China  trade tensions.   
In contrast,  the immediate  response  of longer‐term yields to both  negative  and positive news 
about trade developments  account,  on net, for only 10 basis points  of the total 53 basis point

decline in 30‐year Treasury  yields (see figure  2).1  However, we  can  attribute 18  basis points of the 
decline to negative news  emanating  from abroad (which includes  foreign economic  data releases 
and some after‐hours news related to U.S.–China  trade tensions)  (see figure  3).2  This inference 
relies on the assumption  that most of the news about foreign  economic  developments  occurred  
after domestic trading  hours.  In stark contrast,  overnight  moves in the two‐year  Treasury yield 
were, on balance, slightly positive.   These findings  suggest that concerns  about downside  risks to 
the foreign growth outlook had a greater  effect on long‐term yields  than short‐term  yields.  
Long‐term U.S. Treasury  yields were  likely 
also depressed  by increasing  demand for positive ‐
yielding long‐dated U.S. Treasury  securities  from investors  globally.   Over the intermeeting  period, 
the share of euro‐area sovereign  debt with a negative  yield and maturity  greater than 10 years 
increased  17 
percentage points  and accounts  for about  40 percent of the total outstanding  
sovereign  debt with maturities  greater than 10 years (not shown).  Similarly,  the duration of the 
global stock of debt with negative  yields has  moved up from 5.2 years to 6.3 years over  the same 
period, the largest intermeeting  increase
 in duration  in the past few years (see figure  4). 
Anecdotal  reports support the  reach‐for ‐yield factor behind falling long‐term yields.  The  demand 
for positive ‐yielding long‐dated U.S. Treasury  securities,  notably from pensions  and insurers, was  
reportedly  very strong.  In addition, foreign  investors  were reporte d ly increasingly  willing to add such 
exposure  without hedging the FX risk, while U.S. pensions  were influenced  by a mid‐September  
deadline that  allowed them to mitigate  tax liabilities  associated  with portfolio rebalancing.3  
1 Intermeeting  negative trade‐related news was associated  with gross  declines in the 30‐year yield of roughly 
27 basis points, based on the immediate  response  of yields, but positive  news on trade that emerged  mainly during 
the overnight  trading session offset a large  part of this decline. 
2 Overnight  yield changes are the change in yields between  8 a.m. and 5 p.m. of the previous business day.  For 
a historical  perspective  of the overnight  vis‐à‐vis daytime contributions  to long‐term Treasury yield changes, see

 than expected, but subsequent co mmunications—including the Chair’s Jackson Hole 
remarks—were seen as pointing to a slightly more accommodative outlook on the 
margin.  
A straight read of the option-implied probability distribution of the federal funds 
rate suggests that the odds investors attach to a 25 basis poin t or larger reduction in the 
target range of the federal funds  rate at the September meeting  increased to around 
85 percent, while the odds attach ed to the target range remaini ng unchanged fell to about 
15 percent.  In addition, market-i mplied policy expectations by year-end and beyond 
moved down notably since the previous FOMC meeting.  A straight  read of OIS forward 
rates suggests that investors expect the federal funds rate to decline about 60 basis points 
by year-end, to a level 25 basis poi nts lower than was expected  at the time of the July 
FOMC meeting, and roughly an addi tional 55 basis points by the end of 2020.  However, 
a staff model that adjusts for term premiums implies only about  a 35 basis point decline 
in the federal funds rate by year-end 2019 and, approximately, an additional 10 basis 
point decline in 2020.  
The near-term forward spread on T reasury securities—defined as the difference 
between the six-quarter-ahead f orward rate and the three-month Treasury bill yield—has 
moved down further since the July FOMC meeting and, at one point, reached its lowest level since the beginning of  2008.  The 10-year to 3-month Trea sury spread also slipped 
deeper into negative territory  and has now been negative or nea r zero since the end of 
May 2019.  In addition, the 10-year t o 2-year Treasury spread t urned negative for the first 
time since 2007 and fluctuated around zero over most of the intermeeting period.  Staff 
models that use term spreads t o forecast recessi ons but also co rrect for term premiums 
suggest that the implied probability of recession within the ne xt 12 months has increased 
a touch over the intermeeting pe riod.  These prob abilities now stand at roughly 40 to 
50 percent, levels that are substa ntially lower than what is im plied by models using term 
spreads alone.   
Uncertainty about short- and long- term rates implied by swaptio ns increased, with 
the implied volatility on the 10- year swap rate remaining near levels not seen since 
February 2018.  Despite the notable  increase in volatility and associated reduction in 
Treasury market depth, trading cond itions were described as ord erly, and liquidity was 
noted as less of a fact or compared with the period of heightened market volatility in late 
2018.

Since the July FOMC meeting, 5-y ear and 5-to-10-year TIPS-based inflation 
compensation declined notably, by 24 basis points and 17 basis points, on net, to 
1.41 percent and 1.64 percent, resp ectively, reaching their low est levels since the end of 
last year.  The staff’s term structure models suggest that abou t half of the decline in 
inflation compensation is explai ned by a decrease in the inflation risk premium.  Surveys 
generally continue to point to sta ble longer-term inflation exp ectations. 
Broad stock price indexes d ecreased about 1.5 percent, on net, over the 
intermeeting period amid heightened  volatility.  The escalation  of trade tensions between 
China and the United States we ighed on equity prices, as stock prices of high-China-
exposure firms notably underperfo rmed the broader market.  Cons istent with the sizable 
decline in yields and the inversion of the yield curve, bank eq uity prices also 
underperformed, and bank earnings forecasts for the next few qu arters were revised 
down.  Conversely, the stock prices of utilities and real estat e firms increased, reportedly 
benefiting from demand by investors reaching for less cyclical and higher-yielding assets.  
The VIX increased 2 percentage points, on net, but remained wel l below the high levels 
reached in December 2018.  
Yields on investment- and specula tive-grade corporate bonds decreased notably, 
reaching historical lows at one poi nt.  Spreads on corporate bonds over comparable-
maturity Treasury yields widened by 13 basis points and 22 basis points, respectively, 
and are currently a bit below th e midpoints of their historical  ranges. 
The observed declines in equity p rices and the increases in cor porate bond spreads 
were relatively modest given the l arge declines in longer-term Treasury yields.  Shifts in 
investors’ expectations towar d more accommodative monetary poli cies, both 
domestically and abroad, as we ll as some reassuring second-quar ter corporate earnings 
and retail-sector data, may ha ve partially supported corporate asset prices.  Another 
possibility is that, while incr eased uncertainty about the U.S.  outlook weighed on both 
domestic corporate assets and Tr easury securities, the global d emand for safe U.S. assets 
may have been boosted by even greater investor concerns about t he foreign outlook and 
by the reach-for-yiel d behavior stemming fr om very low or negat ive yields abroad.

 price moves in foreign financial  markets.  On balance, foreign equity indexes fell, the 
dollar and other safe-haven cur rencies appreciated, and AFE sovereign yields declined 
notably, in part as central bank communications abroad remained  quite accommodative.  
On balance, the broad dollar i ndex rose about 1.7 9 percent over the intermeeting 
period as investor demand for safe assets led to large outflows from dedicated emerging 
market funds and declines in emerg ing market currencies.  The d ollar initially moved 
higher amid the strong risk-off market reaction following the A ugust 1 announcement by 
the U.S. Administration of a dditional tariffs on Chinese goods.   The dollar continued its 
rise over the next week as the People’s Bank of China allowed the renminbi to depreciate 
through the psychologically impor tant threshold of 7 CNY/USD, w hich prompted the 
U.S. Administration to label C hina a “currency manipulator.”2  Later in the period, the 
announcement by Chinese authorit ies of additional tariffs on U.S. goods and retaliatory 
measures by the U.S. Administration renewed pressure on the ren minbi, which fell by 
almost 4 percent to 7.15 CNY/USD, its lowest level since 2008.  The dollar also 
strengthened notably against La tin American currencies, includi ng about 3.5 percent 
against the Mexican peso, 8.5 perc ent against the Brazilian real, and 27.5 percent against 
the Argentine peso.  The Argentin e peso depreciated sharply and  Argentine sovereign 
yields soared following the defeat of the current pro-market president in Argentina’s presidential election primary a nd subsequent announcement of plans for a debt 
restructuring and the imposition of capital controls.   
The dollar was little changed aga inst the aggregate of AFE currencies. The dollar 
rose modestly against the euro a nd the Canadian dollar but fell against the Japanese yen 
and the Swiss franc, both traditional safe-haven currencies vis -à-vis the U.S. dollar.  The 
Swiss franc ended the period abou t 0.5 percent stronger against the dollar, and the Swiss 
National Bank reportedly intervene d to limit further appreciati on.  The British pound was 
sensitive to Brexit headlines and appreciated on developments that made a no-deal 
outcome less likely; on net, the pound was up about 1.5 percent against the dollar over 
the period.  
The risk-off sentiment and prospect of more accommodative monet ary policy 
abroad led to significant declines in AFE yields, which reached  record low levels in 
2 The Treasury Secretary cited China as a “currency manipulator”  under the Omnibus Trade and 
Competitiveness Act of 1988.  Und er the act, the Treasury Secre tary is directed to “initiate negotiations 
with such countries in the International Monetary Fund or bilat erally to ensure that they regularly adjust 
exchange rates between their cur rencies and the U.S. dollar.”

points to negative 0.59 percen t.  The Italian 10-year yield also reached a record low of 
0.95 percent as a new coalition gove rnment was formed, thus avoiding the need for new 
elections.  Amid evolving Brexit -related headlines, the 10-year  U.K. yield was volatile, 
initially falling to a record low  of 0.41 percent, but is little changed on net.  Staff models 
suggest around half of the declin e in long-term AFE yields was in the term premium 
component, implying that both exp ectations of lower future shor t rates and uncertainty 
about future growth contributed m aterially to th e declines.   
The risk-off sentiment weighed on foreign equity prices over mo st of the period. 
However, foreign equity indexes were supported both by expectat ions for more monetary 
and fiscal stimulus in the euro area and China and by political  developments in the 
United Kingdom and Italy late in t he period that were viewed as reducing near-term risks.  
On balance, foreign equity indexe s are slightly lower, and banks and automobile 
manufacturers declined notab ly.  Equity markets in Hong Kong un derperformed amid 
ongoing protests, but some of the lo sses retraced as political tensions abated somewhat.  
Measures of implied volatility increased, but volatility levels  remain near their long-term 
historical averages.  Emergi ng market sovereign bond spreads wi dened by 70 basis 
points.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Despite the volatility in many domestic and global financial ma rkets over the 
intermeeting period, conditions in domestic short-term funding markets remained stable.  
The EFFR averaged 2.13 percent, w ith its spread to IOER down a bit relative to the 
previous intermeeting period.  
Assets under management of government and prime MMFs increased about 
3 percent over the intermeeti ng period, extendi ng a trend seen since before the previous 
FOMC meeting.  These inflows wer e reportedly due in part to the  increased attractiveness 
of MMFs amid the flattening of t he yield curve, although the deterioration in risk

 sentiment may also have contributed.  MMF inflows helped offset  some of the upward 
pressure on money market rates coming from increased Treasury b ill issuance following 
the resolution of the debt ceiling.  On net, overnight secured spreads to IOER narrowed 
somewhat, while spreads to OIS for Treasury bills and for unsecured private instruments 
at tenors of a month or more widened.  Take-up at the Federal R eserve’s ON RRP 
operations averaged about $6 billio n during the intermeeting pe riod.3 
As a result of the July FOMC d ecision to cease balance sheet ru noff, the Federal 
Reserve will purchase an additional $68 billion in Treasury sec urities—including 
Treasury bills—through the end of  the year.  Most of these purc hases, which began in 
August, will be conducted in the s econdary market.  This is the  first time Treasury 
purchases have been conducted in the secondary market since 201 4.  
3 On August 22, 2019, the Federal  Reserve conducted the second a nd last TDF test operation for 
2019.  The Fed offered seven-day term deposits at a rate of 1 b asis point over IOER.  The take-up and 
participation were in line with that seen in recent similarly p arameterized tests; take-up totaled $1.7 billion, 
with 18 banks participating and five max bids.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Financing conditions for businesses and households appear to have been little 
affected  by recent turbulence in financial markets.  As such, financing conditions remain 
generally supportive of spending and economic activity.   
• Corporate bond issuance was solid in August, driven by resilient 
investment- grade issuance, while speculative -grade issuance was somewhat  
weaker than average.  G rowth  of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on 
banks’ books picked up in July and August. 
• Mortgage rates declined roughly 30 basis points, and originations have moved 
up in recent months for both purchases and refinancing. 
• Consumer credit conditions continued to be generally supportive of spending.  Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter, and consumer loan growth at banks remained robust  in July and August.   
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Businesses 
The market volatility over the intermeeting period has, so far, left little imprint on  
financing conditions for corporations.  In particular , while spreads on corporate bonds 
relative to comparable- maturity Treasury securities widened  over the intermeeting period, 
yields on corporate bonds decreased notably, reaching historic al lows.   
Against this backdrop, overall issuance of corporate bonds was solid in August, 
driven by resilient investment- grade issuance.  While speculative- grade  corporate bond 
issuance was somewhat subdued in August, it was  comparable to  that seen over the same 
period in 2018.  Corporate bond issuance exhibited the usual slowdown in late  August; 
however, investors reportedly expect issuance to  pick  up in September.    
Preliminary data suggest that institutional leveraged loan issuance in August was 
moderate, partly due to seasonal patterns, with a small number of riskier leveraged loan 
offerings reportedly withdrawn amid greater investor scrutiny .  July issuance was 
somewhat larger and exceeded  the average monthly pace for the first half of 2019, as 
strong new- money issuance offset weak refinancing volumes.  Meanwhile, C&I loan 
growth at banks ticked up in July and August , driven by faster growth at large domestic

 banks.  I nterest rates on fixed -rate nonsyndicated C&I loans declined in July, while 
interest rates  on floating- rate loans  remained little changed from their June levels . 
Public equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings slowed in July 
but remained  roughly in line with July issuance levels over the past few years .  Amid 
increased market volatility, there were no initial public equity offerings by domestic 
firms in August; however, several deals are reportedly expected to be completed over the next few months. 
On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations weakened  slightly over 
the intermeeting period.  In particular, t he volume of nonfinancial corporate bond 
downgrades modestly outpaced that of upgrades in July and August.  T he six -month 
trailing nonfinancial bond default rate edged down, while the KMV expected year -ahead 
default rate ticked up ; both measures currently stand at roughly the midpoints of their  
historical distributions .  Expectations of year -ahead earnings per share for S&P 500 firms 
were revised down in July and August, although by  much  less than the sharp downgrades 
around the turn of the year.  A nalyst e stimates for long -term earnings growth have 
continued to decline and are currently slightly below their median since 2000 . 
Small Businesses  
Available data suggest that the supply of credit to small businesses remained 
accommodative, while demand continued to be somewhat weak.  Small business loan originations—as measured by the Thomson Reuters/PayNet Small Business Lending Index —ticked down in June but remained  approximately 2 percent higher than their  year-
ago level .  In the August  National Federation of I ndependent Business (NFIB) survey, the 
net percent of respondents reporting that it was harder to obtain credit now compared 
with three months ago inched down further to near its post- crisis low.  At the same time, 
the demand for credit by small businesses appears to have remained muted , with over 
half of small business owners in the August  NFIB poll continuing to report that they were 
not interested in a loan.  Recent i ndicators of small business loan performance have also 
been  strong , as delinquencies have stay ed low relative to historical levels . 
Commercial Real Estate 
Financing conditions remained generally accommodative for commercial real 
estate (CRE) .  Bank CRE loan growth has decelerated moderately since the second 
quarter , driven by slower growth in loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties.  
New commitments from life insurance companies to fund CRE mortgages decreased a bit 
in the second quar ter but remained close to their  average level over the past four years.

 The volume of agency and non- agency commercial mortgage -backed  securities  issuance 
was slightly weaker in July and August than the same period last year, though industry 
analysts reportedly anticipate  that issuance will pick up in September in response to 
recent declines in interest  rates.    
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions for state and local governments in municipal bond markets 
remained accommodative on balance.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds was solid  in 
July and robust in August , with new capital raising accounting for the majority of the 
issuance.  Municipal bond yields in both the primary and secondary markets declined notably over the intermeeting period but less so than the yields on comparable- maturity 
Treasury securities, leaving yield  ratios notably higher.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased over the 
intermeeting period .  Residential  mortgage rates declined  but less than long- term 
Treasury yields, as the increas e in prepayment risk and the rise in implied interest rate 
volatility reportedly reduced the appeal of mortgage- backed securities .  Since their recent 
peak last  November, m ortgage rates have fallen about 150 basis points and now stand 
near their lowest lev el since mid -2016.  Home- purchase originations moved up to near 
their solid  2017 levels.  R efinancing originations rose in July, although they remained  
fairly low compared  with the refinancing wave seen in 2011  and 2012, when a larger 
share of borrowers had more to gain from refinancing.  Staff analysis suggests that 
refinancing volumes are not likely to rise much further given the expected path of 
mortgage rates , as the share of borrowers who potentially stand to benefit from 
refinancing  remains low .  Mortgage credit standards —as measured by staff  estimates of 
lenders’ maximum available debt -to-income ratios —have been  stable since late 2018 
and, after several years of easing , appear to have settled at somewhat tighter levels than 
in the early 2000s.  
Consumer Credit  
Financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained  generally supportive 
of growth in consumer spending, although supply conditions continued to be tight for subprime credit card borrowers.  C onsumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in t he

  second quarter  overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through July 
and August.  The moderate pace of overall consumer credit growth in the second quarter 
may reflect, in part, a restraint on demand brought about by increases in the past couple of years in consumer interest rates.  However, interest rates on existing credit card balances leveled off in the second quarter and are expected to fall in August with the recent decline in the prime rate.  In addition, since the beginning of the year , auto  loan  
interest rates have decreased on net.  In consumer ABS markets, issuance was solid , and 
spreads remained  at relatively low levels, though somewhat above their post- crisis 
averages . 
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL  CONDITIONS INDEXES  
A staff ind ex that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial 
corporations indicates that financing conditions have tightened  modestly over the 
intermeeting period  but remain accommodative relative to historical standards.  The 
tightening in the inde x is consistent with the decline in equity prices and the widening of 
corporate bond spreads over the same period.  As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook section, other publicly available financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set of fin ancial variables into a summary series,  also pointed to either roughly unchanged or 
modestly tighter financial conditions.  Overall, these indexes indicate that broad financial 
conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical 
standards.

Appendix  
Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes  
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes .”

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative -grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than inv estment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.   
The second index in the table  measures  the net share of domestic banks reporting tig hter lending 
standards across all core loan categories  in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices .  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial 
market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both  changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy.

John C. Driscoll , and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “ Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,” 
Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 62  (March) , pp. 23–40.  The current index  uses a new weighting approach for 
each loan category .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
In our assessment, the risks around our baseline projection for GDP are  tilted to the 
downside, both over the next year and  further out , and we see a corresponding upward skew for 
the unemployment rate.  Among the most salient risks,  trade policies and foreign economic 
developments seem  more likely to move in directions that would create a significant drag  on 
domestic  activity than to res olve more favorably than assumed.  In addition, the softness in 
business investment and manufacturing production so far this year could be pointing to a much 
more substantial slowing in economic growth than we currently recognize.  Of course, there are risks to the upside as well.  Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and 
business investment remain solid —bolstered, in part, by the 2017 tax cuts—and financial 
conditions , despite recent volatility, remain  favorable.  In these circumstanc es, spending could 
expand at a pace that is faster than in the staff projection.  Although we view the current circumstances as quite uncertain, we judge the overall degree of uncertainty as being broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC) because that period includes the most recent two recessions along with a number of other episodes with 
elevated uncertainty and market volatility.   
Recession risks have likely increased.  As shown in the bottom table of the “ Assessment 
of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit, the estimated probability of moving into recession over 
the next year based on a term -spread model has moved up further to 66 percen t.  This estimate 
should be interpreted with some caution given the long sample period over which the model is estimated and secular trends —particularly declining term premiums —that may materially affect 
its predictions.   The recession probability estimate fro m a model -averaging framework that uses 
a selection of both real and financial variables is 45 percent .  This figure is above the 
unconditional recession probability of 23 percent  and has also  moved up since the July Tealbook, 
mainly because of the decline in the term spread  and the increase in the VIX .
1   
As indicated in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the estimate d 
probability of returning to the effective lower bound ( ELB ) over the next three years  has moved 
1 The probability from the model -averaging framework (MAF) is likely also boosted because of the same 
factors affecting the term -spread model, although to a smaller extent because the MAF model also considers 
other  factors.

 up to 23 percent and rises to about 37 percent by the end of the medium term.  Given the 
proximity of the federal funds rate to the ELB, monetary policy may have less capacity to offset significant negative economic shocks than positive ones, contributing to the downside skew in economic outcomes.  Similarly, the estimated distributions in the exhibit “ Conditional 
Distributions of Macroeconomic Variables 2  Years Ahead” have become increasingly skewed to 
the downside since last year, with the probability of very high unemployment rate s two years 
from now reaching levels previously attained only just prior to the onset of a recession.  In 
contrast, as shown in t he exhibit “Time -Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year Ahead ,” four-
quarter -ahead estimates of forecast risks around GDP growth and the unemployment rate, based 
on historic al staff forecast errors , are not unusually wide or skewed.  One reason the estimates in 
these two exhibits differ may be that the asymmetries associated with recessions are more prominent at longer horizons, as the consequences of adverse shocks accumulate.   
With regard to inflation, we view  the risks to the inflation projection as slanted to the 
downside—in part because of the downside risks to economic activity.  Moreover, inflation has 
been running low this year , and longer -run inflation expectations could currently be lower than 
we recognize.  Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more than expected and 
put downward pressure on inflation.  There are also risks to the upside.  For example, an extended period with unusually tight resource utilization could lead to greater upward pressure 
on wages and prices,
 consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects 
of resource utilization on inflation.  In addition, a widespread and sustained increase in trade barriers could lead to temporarily higher inflation.     
All of these inflation risks would tend to be of modest size as long as inflation 
expectations remained reasonably well anchored.  However, the risks could increase substantially, in either direction, if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such movements in expectations could induce changes in inflation to build on themselves and thus 
lead inflation to deviate significantly and persistently from 2 p ercent.   Notwithstanding all of 
these concerns, the overall degree of uncertainty is probably about the same as over the past 
20 years.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS
No-Deal Brexit [SIGMA model ] 
Our current baseline assumes that negotiations between the United Kingdom and the 
European Union will extend beyond the current deadline of October 31 and result in an orderly 
Brexit sometime in 2020.  However, the political developments of the past few weeks  point to 
contentious negotiations ahead and a higher risk of a no- deal Brexit.  In this scenario, we assume 
that the United Kingdom rejects the current withdrawal proposal and leaves the European Union on October 31 without a deal, creating a range of economic disruptions despite current efforts by the authorities to prepare for such an event.  Financial conditions in the United Kingdom and, to 
a lesser extent, in the rest of Europe tighten , while household and business confidence 
deteriorate.  All told, the levels of U.K. and EU (excluding the United Kingdom) GDP decline 
1.1 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, by the end of 2021.  F light-to-safety flows into dollar-
denominated assets cause the dollar to appreciate 3 percent , and global equity prices decline 
3 percent.  
Weaker foreign activity, the stronger dollar, and some tightening of U.S. financial 
conditions lead U.S. GDP growth to moderate to 1.6 percent in 2020, about 0.4 percentage point 
below the baseline.  The U.S. unemployment rate rises about 0.2 percentage point above the baseline over the forecast period.  Core PCE inflation runs at 1.6 percent in 2020, before gradually i ncreasing to 1.9 percent in 2024.  The inertial Taylor rule with a parameter value of 
1.0 on the output gap—which is a more responsive specification than in the baseline policy rule—prescribes a path for the federal funds rate that is about 25 basis points below the 
baseline.
2 
The relatively modest effect  of a no- deal Brexit in th is scenario , compared with other, 
more pessimistic assessments of a no -deal Brexit being bandied about, is predicated on the 
assumption that the safeguards that European governments and financial institutions have put in place since the 2016 Brexit referendum are effective in containing most economic and financial disruptions and that financial markets have by no w discounted much of this event .  However, 
given the unp recedented nature of Brexit , more-adverse outcomes are entirely possible.   
2 In addition, the size and compo sition of the SOMA portfolio are assumed t o follow the baseline paths in 
all scenario s.

 Escalation of Trade Tensions [GEMUS model ] 
Our current baseline assumes that the United States and its trading partners impose no 
new tariffs , but existing tariffs —including those raised on September 1 on a sizable tranche of 
Chinese imports—remain in place.  The United States, however, has threatened additional tariffs 
on Chinese imports that, absent successful negotiations, would be levied later this year, causing the average tariff rate on Chinese imports to rise from its current level of about 17 percent to 
25 percent.
3  While the current process of trade negotiations could ultimately lead to lower trade 
barriers, we cannot exclude the possibility that trade tensions with China and other trading 
partners escalate further, resulting in a sizable increase in trade barriers that would entail profoundly adverse effects. 
This scenario assumes that trade tensions between the United States and China escalate, 
causing tariffs on all Chinese imports to increase to 33 percent by the end of 2019.  In addition, tariffs of 25 percent are imp osed on $314 billion of imports from Mexico, and tariffs of 
20 percent are levied on $160 billion of vehicle imports.
4  In our scenario, Mexico and China 
partially retaliate against the U.S. actions, while tariffs on vehicles trigger a fully proportional 
response.  Because higher U.S. tariffs reduce imports while higher foreign tariffs reduce U.S. 
exports, these policies have little effect on the trade balance.  However, the higher cos t of 
imported consumption goods depresses household spending, while business demand for 
investment declines as a result of the higher cost of imported capital goods and lower expected profits.  In addition, the escalation of trade tensions leads to a widespread decline in global sentiment, with corporate borrowing spreads widening and global equity prices falling about 20 percent.  
These developments lead to a signific ant and protracted slowdown in U.S. growth .  GDP 
growth drops to 0.4 percent in the second half of 2019 and rises only to 1 percent in 2020, 1 percentage point below the baseline.  Higher import prices boost total PCE inflation to 3.4 percent in the second half of this year before inflation slows down to 1.4 percent in 2020 as 
                                                           
3 The average tariff rate on Chinese imports was around 3 percent in 2017.  The current average level of 
17 percent is  the result of an average tariff increase of 14 percentage points.  This increase is  computed by averaging 
the 25 percent tariff rate on $230 billion of imports levied  starting in 2018 ; the 15 percent tariff rate on $100 billion  
of imports levied on Septem ber 1 , 2019; and the 0 percent tariff rate on the remaining $175  billion of imports that 
have not been tariffed to date.  The additional measures that have been threatened include a further  5 percentage 
point hike on the $230 billion  of imports that are currently taxed at 25 percent and tariffs of 15 percen t on the 
remaining $175 billion of  imports from China that have not been taxed so far.  
4 Most of these tariffs would be levied on imports from the European Union, Japan, and South Korea.

the effect of the new tariffs dies out and the economy slows down.  Despite the initial jump in 
inflation, we assume policymakers “see through” the temporary increase in prices.  Accordingly, the federal funds rate declines  to 1.7 percent by the end o f 2020, 0.7 percen tage point below the 
baseline.

Recession with Financial Amplification [FRB/US model] 
The softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far  this year and 
the recent inversions in the yield curve could be pointing to  a substantial deterioration in 
economic activity , and , as noted earlier, a number of statistical models indicate that the 
probability of a recession over the next year is above average.  Moreover, leverage in the nonfinancial business sector is elevated.  In this scenario, a recession is assumed to be amplified 
by the high levels of business indebtedness, which lead firms to reduce hiring and investment by 
more than they would if their debt were  lower.   We also assume that monetary policymakers 
aggressively respond to the sharp and sustained increase in the unemployment rate consistent with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions. 
Real GDP growth starts to decline later this year , and the unemployment rate rises .  The 
federal funds rate drops sharply but becomes constrained by the ELB in the third quarter of 2020, thereby prolonging the downturn in the absence of unconventional monetary policy actions .  
GDP only begins to recover in 2022, and the unemployment rate peaks at 6.8 percent , an 
increase of 3 .1 percentage points from the start of the recession.
6  With substantial slack in 
resource utilization, inflation falls to 1.5  percent in 2021.  
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate [FRB/US model ] 
While there is substantial uncertainty around the empirical estimates of the long -run 
equilibrium federal funds rate, most estimates suggest that it has declined in recent decades.  Long -term yields have been mostly below 3 percent in recent  years , and their pronounced 
declines since the b eginning of the year raise the possibility that the long -run equilibrium rate 
might be even lower than we are currently assuming.  If this were the case, monetary policy 
would currently be restrictive.  In this scenario, we assume that the real long-run equilibrium rate 
5 As in the previ ous scenario, the federal funds rate evolves following an inertial Taylor rule with a

6 If the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates w ere not a constraint, the  policy rate would fall to 
negative 2¼ percent, w hich would shave ½  percentage point off the increase in the unemployment rate.  
Alternatively, unconventional monetary policy actions could conceivably achieve that same amount of easing .

 is negative 0.5 percent and  that policymakers only come to recognize the lower level gradually 
over the next five years . 
Because of this gradual recognition, and because of inertia in the baseline policy rule, the 
federal funds rate does not fall enough to fully offset the weaker aggregate demand implied by 
the lower real long-run equilibrium rate.  As a result, output expands more slowly than in the baseline, and the path for the unemployment rate is slightly higher.  GDP growth through 2020 and 2021 is , on average, about ½ percentage point lower than in the baseline projection; the 
unemployment rate is between ¼ and ½ percentage point higher from 2020 to 2025.  With 
resource utilization only slightly weaker, inflation remains clos e to the bas eline .   
In the longer run, monetary policy fully responds to the lower equilibrium rate.  By 2025, 
the federal funds rate is  about 1 percentage point lower than in the baseline, allowing GDP 
growth to recover to near its potential pace and helping keep the unemployment rate near its longer-run value.
7  Although the outcomes over the next few years are not particularly bad, the 
fact that policymakers take a while to recognize the lower real long- run equilibrium rate  may 
represent a lost opportunity to sustain a very strong labor market for longer.  In the long run, 
once policymakers have recognized the situation, they will realize that they have substantially less space to ease in case of an adverse shock. 
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US model ] 
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment 
remain solid, including strong labor market conditions and low interest rates.  Indeed, consumer spending is estimated to have increased at a stron g pace through July.  In this scenario, we 
assume that consumer spending and, in turn, investment expand at a faster pace than in the baseline.  We also assume that these favorable conditions  result in a larger cyclical response in 
labor force participatio n than is  typical , which attenuates somewhat the decline in the 
unemployment rate . 
Under these assumptions, GDP increases about 3 percent, on average, in 2019 and 2020, 
and the unemployment rate declines to 2.9 percent by the end  of 2021.  Inflation increases 
                                                           
7 In the current and two remaining scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the  baseline policy rule, 
which assumes a coefficient of just 0.2 on the output gap.

slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2025.  In response to the stronger economy, and with inflation 
little changed, the federal funds rate rises relative to the baseline, reaching 3  percent in 2024.  
Stronger Aggregate Supply [FRB/US model ] 
While the staff revised down its estimate of the natural rate of unemployment this round, 
the updated estimate remains about 0.7 percentage point above the actual unemployment rate .  
Despite that unemployment gap, w age gains by most measures have remained modest in  recent 
years , in line with the staff’s assessment  of trend productivity growth and underlying inflation.  
However, another way of reconciling modest wage growth with a very low unemployment rate is that resource utilization may be less tight than  assumed in the baseline.  In this scenario, we 
assume that the natural rate of unemployment has been lower in the past several years and 
continues to fall to 3.75 percent at the end of 2019, nearly ¾  percentage point lower than in the 
baseline.
8  We also assume that the trend labor force participation rate has been decreasing at a 
slower pace for the past several years and continues to do so going forward.  In addition, 
structural productivity is assumed to grow ¼ percentage point faster than in the baseline in the past several years and going forward.  
We assume that households and businesses fully recognize the higher potential growth 
and its implications for income  and profits ; thus, consumer spending and investment are 
commensurately stronger.  GDP growt h is, on average, about 1 percentage point above the 
baseline.  The unemployment rate falls to 3.2  percent by 2024, around ¾ percentage point lower 
than in the staff projection.  Even so, given the lower natural rate of unemployment , resource 
utilization is, on average, less tight than in the baseline.  The path for inflation is slightly lower , 
primarily reflecting the stronger productivity growth in this scenario.  Because policymakers are assumed to recognize these more favorable s upply-side conditions, the path of the federal funds 
rate is about ¼ percentage point lower, on average, than in the baseline.   
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS  
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, the FRB/US model projects real 
GDP growth to slow from about 2¼ percent in 2019 to about 1½ percent in the next three 
8 A natural rate of 3.75 percent is comparable with the average of the 10 lowest forecasts for the longer -run 
unemployment rate submitted by respondents in the March 2019 long -range Blue Chip survey.

years —a modestly weaker path than in the Tealbook baseline.9  The projected deceleration in 
GDP mainly reflects both consumption and business investment growth moving down from what 
the model perceives as unusually strong readings in recent years.  In the case of consumption, the model could not explain those earlier positive surprises based on fundamentals (wealth and 
income) and , hence, does not carry that strength forward in the projection; instead, it has 
consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend.  The model’s assess ment that asset 
prices (equity and property wealth) are currently above normal valuations and thus will fall or 
decelerate over the next year also contributes to the weakening in consumption growth through the wealth channel.  With slowing overall output g rowth , business investment decelerates.  
Marked negative contributions from net exports also weigh on the model’s forecast of real GDP 
growth.  Given a projection of output growing slightly below that of potential, the output gap 
declines from the model’s current estimate of a bit more than  1½ percent to about ¼ percent  at 
the end of 2022, and the unemployment rate rises to 4½ percent at the end of 2022, slightly below the model’s estimate of the natural rate of 4. 7 percent.  Core inflation increases from 
1.8 percent in 2019 to about 2.0 percent, on average, over the next three years.  
The EDO model projects GDP growth to fall to 1.9 percent, on average, over the next 
three years, about the same as the Tealbook projection, as favorable risk premium shocks (the main driver of aggregate demand in this model) and the effects of previously accommodative monetary policy fade.  Because this pace is below the EDO model’s estimate of potential growth and because this model already assesses that the output gap is near zero, t he model projects the 
gap to  fall below zero in the near term and reach negative ½ percent by the end of 2021.  
Nevertheless, b y next year, the model predicts that core inflation will modestly overshoot the 
FOMC’s 2 percent objective, driven by persistent adverse shocks to investment, which lower productivity and raise costs. 
9 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projection s for variables from the U.S. government 
sector, foreign real GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar and oil p rices .  The federal funds 
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline.  The model forecast starts in the 
fourth quarter of this year, taking as given key macroeconomic variables from the judgmental forecast for the third quarter.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projecti on.  The staff’s current projection incorporates  
significantly less tightness in resource utilization  than in the July Tealbook , reflecting 
both a downward revision to the forecast for real GDP and a higher trajectory for 
potential output .  Additionally, the staff revised down slig htly its forecast of core PCE 
inflation for this year and the next .  As a consequence of these revisions , the policy rate 
paths discussed  herein  are notably  lower  than in the Ju ly Tealbook .  An additional exhibit  
provides updated estimates of the equilibri um real federal funds rate in the longer run.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED  SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the inertial version of the Taylor (1999)  rule, 
the Taylor  (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible price -level targeting  (FPLT ) 
rule.1  These near-term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation , which are shown in t he middle panels .2  On average , 
over the projection period shown, t he staff lowered its projection for  the output gap 
0.7 percentage point  and marked down its core inflation forecast a bit .  The top and 
middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate . 
Reflecting the smaller  output gap  and slightly lower core inflation , the near-
term prescriptions of the policy rules are lower  than those in the July
Tealbook .
The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule prescribes  higher  policy rates than the
Tealbook baseline  in the next two quarters because  it responds more strongly
1 The appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on the se simple policy ru les.  
Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined herein use 
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50  basis points in the longer run.  
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the g ap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection for the output gap.

    1. The lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for
inflation and resource slack. Rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable are conditional on thecurrent−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the June 2019 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline

 to the positive output gap than the conditional attenuated rule underlying the 
Tealbook baseline projection.  
 The Taylor  (1993) rule, which do es not feature an interest rate  smoothing 
term, calls for  higher policy r ates than the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and  the 
Tealbook baseline  rule.      
 The first -difference rule , which responds to the change in the expected output 
gap, prescribes a fairly flat policy rate path in the near term—one that is 
similar to the Tealbook baseline  path.  
 The FPLT rule  calls for cutting the federal funds rate to below 1¾ percent by 
the first quarter of 2020  in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the 
core PCE price index of 2¾ percent  since  the end of 2011 . 
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM  REAL  FEDERAL  
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium -term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*) generated under two baselines:  the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the June 2019 SEP.3  
In both cases, simulations of the FRB/US model are used.  This concept of r*, labeled 
“FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained 
over a 12 -quarter period starting in the current quarter , would bring the output gap to zero 
in the final quarter of that period.  This concept of r* is a summary of the projected 
underlying strength of the real economy and does not take into account consider ations 
such as achieving the inflation objective or avoiding sha rp changes in the federal 
funds  rate. 
 At 1. 40 percent, the current value of the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* is 
about 60  basis points lower than the value consistent with the July Tealbook .  
                                                 
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2021  (the 
final year reported in the June 2019 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a smooth and 
monoto nic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered in the SEP.  
For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the deviation of 
the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 This reduction reflects the smaller output gap projected by the staff in the 
medium term.  
 At 0.65 percent, the June 2019 SEP -consistent FRB/US r* is lower than the 
Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r*, even though the two projections contain  
similar policy rate paths.  This difference in FRB/US r* arises because, even 
after the staff ’s downward revision to the output gap, the current Tealbook 
projection embeds more resource tightness than does the SEP -consistent 
projection.   
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The sec ond exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline projection and results from 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, the 
Taylor  (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect 
the endoge nous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.  The simulations for each rule are carried out 
under the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future a nd 
that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that 
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the 
implications for interest rates and the economy.  
 Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook 
baseline , the federal funds rate hold s steady this year at 2.2 percent and then 
edge s up gradually, reaching 2.5 percent in late 2021.   
 The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as 
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output 
gap, calls for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace and to peak 
slightly above 3 percent in 2021.  There after, the path remain s above the 
Tealbook baseline path for several years .  The less accommodative monetary 
conditions result in an unemployment rate path that, in contrast to  the 
Tealbook baseline,  holds fairly steady at 3.7 percent next year before rising 
toward  the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemploy ment.   Under this 
rule, inflation is lower  and the real 10 -year Treasury yield is higher  than the 
corresponding values in the Tealbook  baseline .

 Because the Taylor  (1993) rule  has no interest rate  smoothing term , it calls for
increas ing the federal funds r ate to a bit above 3 percent by early 2020 , after
which the rule calls for slight declines .  The federal funds rate path prescribed
by this rule  is above the corresponding path  of the Tealbook baseline  rule, but
the rates prescribed by the two rules move c loser together in 2020  and beyond .
The first-difference rule , which  reacts to the expected change in the output
gap rather than its level, prescribes small, gradual increases in the federal
funds rate through the beginning of 2021 , followed by a sequence of slight
reductions during the period in which  the output gap is projected to narrow.
The resulting federal funds rate path edges below  the prescriptions of the
conditional attenuated rule in 2023 and subsequently remains slightly more
accommodative  than the baseline  funds rate path  for several  years .  As a
result, this strategy generates higher inflation and a lower unemployment rate
than the staff projection and a path of the real 10-year Treasury yield that runs
below the trajectory under  the baseline rule.
The FPLT rule responds to , and seeks to eliminate,  the cumulative shortfall of
the level of core PCE prices  from  a target path defined by the growth of  that
price level at an annual rate of 2  percen t from the end of 2011 onward .
Eliminating the cu rrent 2¾ percent shortfall re quires inflation to run above
2 percent in coming years.   Because the simulation embeds the assumptions
that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the
real 10 -year Treasury rate  immediately  drops to negative 0.85 percent and
remains below the corresponding Tealbook baseline path throughout the
perio d shown .  The unemployment rate is substantially lower under the FPLT
rule than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping to
3 percent  in late 2021 .  Inflation ex ceeds 2  percent by about 20 basis points ,
on average, over the next decade .
The policy rate  prescriptions from the simple policy rules are lower than those
in the July Tealbook by an average of 35 to 50  basis points  over the projection
period shown .  This change reflects  a lower  projection for the degree of
resource utilizatio n and a slightly weaker outlook for inflation .  As a result of

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to

 the smaller output gap, the re is somewhat  less dispersion  in prescribed policy 
rates  across rules over the projection period than was the case in the July 
Tealbook.   
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control  simulations conditional on the Tealbook 
baseline under two different assumptions about policymakers’ preferences, as captured 
by alternative specifications of the loss function.4  The concept of opt imal control 
employed here is one in which  current policymakers are able to commit future 
policymakers to th eir plans; such a commitment, when feasible, may  lead to improve d 
economic outcomes .5 
 The simulation labeled “Equal weights” presents the case in wh ich 
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2  percent, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the fe deral funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the federal funds rate runs significantly higher than 
the Tealbook baseline path , reaching  a peak of  4.4 percent  at the end of 2021.  
This strategy is designed to counter the projected per sistent undershooting by 
the unemployment  rate of its natural rate that occurs in the Tealbook 
baseline —an outcome that policymakers with the equal -weights loss function 
judge to be undesirable.  The less negative  unemployment gap implies  only a 
modestly l ower path of inflation because , in the FRB/US model, the response 
of inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.  
 The simulation labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap ” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rat e from the natural 
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate , but is otherwise 
identical to the specification with equal weights.  Under this strategy, the path 
                                                 
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides techn ical details on the optimal control simulations.  
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of tho se future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 for the federal funds rate is essentially flat over the medium term  and only 
slightly below the current Tealbook baseline path.  Policymakers choose this 
slightly m ore accommodative path for the policy rate because their desire to 
keep inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the 
unemployment rate falling below its natural rate.  The tighter labor market 
pushes inflation more promptly toward 2 percent than under the baseline .  
Over the projection period shown, t he federal funds rate prescriptions from  the
equal -weight s and asymmetric specifications conditional on the current
Tealbook  projection  are, on average , about 70 basis points and 3 5 basis points
lower , respectively, than their corresponding prescriptions based on the Ju ly
Tealbook.6  The revisions to the asymmetric specification are somewhat
smaller than those for the equal -weight s specification because policy in the
former specification is only affected by revisions to the unemployment gap
when the unemployment rate is above the estimate of its natural rate .
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds 
rate in the longer run, denoted rLR.  This concept is the rate consistent with the economy 
operating at its potential once the transitory effects of eco nomic shocks have abated.  
This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer -run level 
of the nominal federal funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and 
economic models.  In addition, rLR is also a para meter in many of the simple policy rules, 
including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of 
Tealbook A.  
The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of historical values through
2019:Q 2 for several model -based time -serie s estimates of rLR.7  The estimates
6 After these downward revisions, the current -Tealbook optimal co ntrol policy prescriptions under 
the equal -weights loss function remain above the corresponding prescriptions using a baseline consistent 
with the June 2019 SEP (shown in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of the July 2019 Tealbook A).  
The policy rate  prescriptions under the asymmetric loss function using current -Tealbook projections are 
similar to those derived using the SEP -consistent baseline.  
7 See the appendix to this section for sources and methodology.  Although the modeling 
approaches and econo metric techniques differ across models, the studies have the common feature that they 
use time -series methods to infer rLR from the co -movement of either macroeconomic series (like inflation,

The range and mean  of the 2019:Q 2 point estimates are similar to  the 
corresponding statistics reported for 201 9:Q1 in the June Tealbook.  
Time -series estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as
depicted in the middle panel.  The sources of this uncertainty vary across the
studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach as well
as the uncertainty that exist s within each model about the prevailing state of

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption  that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications  of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on p olicies under commitment, optimal control policies can more 
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model.  
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives.  
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the 
Tealbook baseline projection .1  𝑅𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy
for quarter  t; for quarter s prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑡 corresponds to the
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand -side variables of the first four rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE price inflatio n for the current

and Outlook section of the April 2019 Tealbook A describes the conditional baseline  rule.

 quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡+3|𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period
(𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter -ahead an nual change in the output gap
(𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡+3|𝑡−𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝐿𝑅,
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price -level targeting rule , the right -hand -side variables 
include an unemployment rate gap  and a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is d efined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑡∗,
which currently stands at 4. 4 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference  
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑝𝑡, and the log of the target price -level path, 𝑝𝑡∗.  The
2011:Q4 value of 𝑝𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently,
𝑝𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.
Simple Rules  
The first rule  in the table was studied by Taylor (1993 ).  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time  compared with the 
Taylor (1993) rule .  The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap , like the 
FPLT  rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .2  The conditional 
attenuate d rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but responds less strongly to 
the output gap .  Where applicable, t he intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝐿𝑅, are constant
and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n 
equilibrium  real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides  (2003).  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “ Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections  for inflation and the output gap.  When the 
Tealbook is published earl y in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarter s.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand -side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
2 For applications, see, for example , Erceg and others ( 2012 ).  An FPLT rule similar to the one 
above is also analyzed by Chung and others (2015).  Taylor (1993) rule  𝑅𝑡 =𝑟𝐿𝑅+𝜋𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝑡− 𝜋𝐿𝑅)+0.5𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡

  To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic proj ections on the prescriptions of these 
inertial rules, the lines labeled “Previous Tealbook  projection” report prescriptions  that are 
conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap but that use the 
value of the lagged fede ral funds rate in the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.  
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimate s of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate  that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period , given either th e Tealbook or the SEP -
consistent economic projection .  This measure  depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables .3  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR -based 
expectations —that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook b aseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding  average s of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP -consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as th e Tealbook -consistent and SEP -consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rate s and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period , whereas , in the economic projection,  the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and  wage setters form  model -consistent expectations  and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a qua rter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

  COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit tha t policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝑡𝑃𝐶𝐸, and the Committee’s 
2 percent objective), squ ared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡, measured as the difference between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the as sumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor , 𝛽=0.9963 : 
𝑳𝒕=∑ 𝜷𝝉𝑇
𝝉=𝟎{𝜆𝜋 (𝜋𝑡+𝜏𝑃𝐶𝐸−𝜋𝐿𝑅)𝟐+𝜆𝑢,𝑡+𝜏(𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡+𝜏)𝟐+𝜆𝑅(𝑅𝑡+𝝉−𝑅𝑡+𝝉−𝟏)𝟐}. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment  gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B  provides motivations for the 
specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two 
specifications.  
 
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second  specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the same  weights as the 
equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate , but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The optimal control policy and associated outc omes depend on the relative (rather than the 
absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject 
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates .  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public  sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’  future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy 
decisions made prior to the simulation period.   Loss Functions

  ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE I N THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the exhibit “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run ” shows a range of estimates of  𝑟𝐿𝑅 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch ( forthcomin g); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, 
and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Johannsen and Mertens (2016); 
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez -Grande (2019); and Lubik and 
Matthes (2015).  For comparability, all  computations use the latest vintage of historical data 
through 2019:Q 2.  Moreover, the estimates are “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they 
make use of historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical movements 
can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.  
The middle panel reports 68 percent uncertainty bands around each model’s point 
estimate for 2019:Q 2.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are specific to 
each study.   
The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝐿𝑅 values from selected forecasters.  These values were 
obtained as follows:  
 “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run.  
 “Median SEP” is the media n of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal funds 
rate in the longer run minus the corresponding projection of PCE inflation as of the 
June 2019 SEP.  
 “Median Survey of Primary Dealers” equals the long -run median dealer forecast for 
the target rate minus the longer -run median dealer forecast of PCE inflation as of the 
July 2019 survey.  
 “Median Blue Chip (6 -to-10-year)” equals the consensus five -year average (202 6–
30) forecast for the three -month Treasury bill rate minus the consensus five -year 
averag e (202 6–30) forecast for the annual change in the GDP chained price index as 
of the March 2019  Blue Chip Economic Indicators  survey.  
 “Congressional Budget Office (10 -year)” equals the federal funds rate at the end of 
2029 minus the annualized change in the PCE index at the end of 2029 as of 
August  2019.

Annual values refer to the change from fourth quarter of previous year to fourth quarter of year indicated.    3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.    4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial         offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
        the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)
        is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
