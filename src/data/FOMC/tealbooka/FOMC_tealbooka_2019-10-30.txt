Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
Incoming information continues to suggest that economic activit y is expanding at 
a moderate pace, albeit slower t han in the first half of the ye ar.  Although elevated trade 
tensions and uncertainty over gl obal growth prospects are weigh ing on business 
investment, exports, and manuf acturing production, household sp ending appears to be 
rising at a solid clip, buoyed by continued job gains and solid  income growth.  Overall, 
we see the available spending and production data as pointing t oward GDP decelerating 
from a 2.6 percent rise in the f irst half of the year to a 1.6 percent increase in the second 
half, held down almost 0.2 percen tage point by the effects of t he strike at General Motors 
(GM).  All of this said, storm  clouds still lurk on the horizon , and we continue to view the 
risks to our projection as havi ng a pronounced tilt to the down side.  
In our modal projection, real activity decelerates modestly ove r the medium term, 
mostly because of a waning boost from fiscal policy.  In additi on, we anticipate that 
already enacted tariff increases , as well as uncertainty over f uture trade policy and 
concerns over global growth, will continue to restrain aggregat e demand over this period.  
All told, GDP growth is projected to slip from 2.1 percent this year to 1.7 percent by 
2022.  This projection is unchanged from the September Tealbook , as revisions to 
financial and other conditioning factors were small and offsett ing.  We continue to 
project no further labor market tightening after this year, wit h the unemployment rate 
holding constant at 3.6 percent over the projection period. 
The available data on inflation s uggest that core PCE prices ro se 1.7 percent over 
the 12 months ending in September, a few tenths higher than ear lier this year.  We expect 
core inflation to hold at this pace through December before tem porarily popping up to 
2 percent by the end of the first quarter, as the low readings from the start of this year drop out of the 12-month change before the high readings from t he middle of the year do.  
Thereafter, we expect core consumer inflation to move back down  to 1.8 percent, in line 
with our estimate of its underlyi ng trend, as the boost to infl ation from high resource 
utilization is offset by weak im port prices due to a rising dol lar.  Total PCE price 
inflation is forecast to run below core inflation this year and  next owing to falling energy 
prices and then to move in line with core over the remainder of  the medium term.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for GDP grow th in 2019 is well aligned  with the projections from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the B lue Chip consensus but is nearly  ½ percentage 
point higher than the Blue Chip in 2020.   The staff’s unem ployment rate forecast is the same as the 
SPF and Blue Chip projections in 2019 and close to  the Blue Chip f orecast in 2020.   
With regard to headline PCE price inflation, the staff projection is 0.2  percentage point below the 
SPF projection in 2019  and 2020 .  Moreover, the staff’s projection for core PCE price inflation is 
0.2 percentage point below the SPF for ecast in 2020.  Otherwise, the staff’s inflation projections are 
close to those of the Blue Chip and the SPF.  
 
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includ es input 
from  about 50  panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both 
surveys.

   KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Monetary Policy  
 The baseline policy rule still calls for the federal funds rate  to move up 
gradually to 2.5 percent by the end of 2022.  However, this pat h starts from a 
lower level than in the September Tealbook, reflecting  the FOMC’s decision 
at the September meeting to lower  the target range.  In contras t to our baseline 
path, term-premium-adjusted market quotes suggest that market p articipants 
expect the federal funds rate to decline roughly 20 basis point s by the end of 
this year and then to move b ack up over the course of 2020.   
Other Interest Rates 
 We project that the 10-year Treas ury yield will rise from an average of 
1.7 percent this quarter to 2.8 pe rcent by the end of 2022, ref lecting our 
assumption that the term premium will move up to a more normal level over 
the next few years.  This path for the 10-year Treasury yield is essentially 
unrevised from the projecti on in the September Tealbook.1   
 Both corporate bond yields and mortg age rates increase about in  line with 
comparable Treasury securitie s over the medium term.   
Equity and House Prices 
 Stock prices have increased about  1½ percent, on net, since the  time of the 
September Tealbook, about the same as we expected.  Going forwa rd, we 
project equity prices to appreci ate only about 1 percent per ye ar, on average, 
over the medium term, as the equity premium remains a bit below  its 
historical norm.  All told, the pa th for stock prices is the sa me as in the 
September Tealbook.  
 We project that house prices w ill rise at a rate of about 3¾ pe rcent per year 
over the medium term, a small upward revision relative to our p revious 
projection but still a bit slower than last year’s pace of 4½ p ercent.   
                                                 
1 Ten-year Treasury yields rose no tably between the close of the  September Tealbook and the 
September FOMC meeting and, as noted in the Financial Market De velopments section, have edged back 
down a bit since then .  On net, Treasury yi elds have risen about 25 basis points si nce the previous 
Tealbook, very close to our expectation.

 Trade Policy  
Last week, President Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He anno unced a
“phase one” agreement, which inc ludes a suspension of the 5 per centage point
U.S. tariff increase on $230 billi on of Chinese imports that was scheduled for
October 15, a Chinese pledge to pur chase U.S. agricultural prod ucts, and
agreements on currency and financi al services issues.  The lang uage of the
actual agreement is expected to b e finalized over the next few weeks and to be
formally signed by Presidents Tr ump and Xi in November.  Negoti ations will
begin soon on some of the more di fficult issues, including the status of
Huawei as a supplier to U.S. c ompanies, forced technology transfer, and other
tariffs.  As of now, a 15 percentage  point U.S. tariff increase  on $150 billion
of Chinese imports is still scheduled for December 15.2
Although neither the postponed Octob
er nor scheduled December t ariff hikes
have been incorporated in our proj ection, the tariff changes im plemented since
2018 have left a notable imprint on economic activity and our projection.
oWe estimate that implemented tariffs will collectively boost th e level
of core PCE prices 30 basis point s and directly lower the level  of U.S.
GDP 30 basis points by the end of 2021.  The drag on output growth
caused by the tariff hikes opera tes through several channels.  An
erosion in household purchasing power slows the rise in PCE a little,and higher prices for importe d capital goods and lower profit
expectations impose noticeable  restraint on business investment .
These negative effects on domestic demand are only partially offset bya boost to net exports, as our assumption of less-than-full retaliation byU.S. trading partners implies th at exports will be suppressed b y foreign
tariffs to a lesser degree tha n imports are restrained by U.S. tariffs.
oIn addition to these direct channe ls, over the course of this y ear we
have further marked down our  GDP projection through 2021 by
40 basis points to reflect busine ss uncertainty over the trade
2 In addition, the United States imposed tariffs on about $7.5 b illion of imports from the European 
Union (EU) on October 18 in response to a favorable ruling from  the World Trade Organization concerning 
EU subsidies of the company Air bus.  Although these tariffs sho uld not have a significant macroeconomic 
effect, they add further stress to U.S.–EU trade relations alre ady strained by the pros pects of potential auto 
tariffs in coming months.

environment, as well as concer ns regarding global growth.  Fina lly, 
trade tensions are also affec ting our forecast to the extent th at they are 
reflected in equity prices and the value of the dollar. 
oWe estimate that the tariffs a re imposing a particularly notable drag on
manufacturing output.  See the box “The Effect of Recent Tariff s on
the Manufacturing Sector”  for more discussion.
Foreign Economic Acti vity and the Dollar 
Foreign real GDP is projected to i ncrease at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in
the second half of 2019, a pace equa l to the first half and well below our
estimate of potential growth.  Rel ative to the September Tealbo ok, we again
marked down the foreign growt h outlook in the near term, with a  relatively
larger negative revision for the emerging market economies (EME s).  The
revision to EME growth reflects  disappointing data in China and  Hong Kong,
continued weakness in Mexico, and increased turmoil in Argentin a.  The euro-
area forecast has also been marked down some in response to wea ker-than-
expected data—most notably the PMIs for September.  Supported by
accommodative monetary policies in  the advanced foreign economies and an
expectation that the drag from global manufacturing will ease, growth abroad
is projected to pick up to 2.4 percent—a pace near potential—by  late 2020.
Since the September Tealbook, the  broad dollar index is modestl y lower on
net.  We continue to expect the broad real dollar to appreciate  somewhat
through 2022 as market expectations  for the federal funds rate move up
toward the staff forecast.
Fiscal Policy  
Our fiscal policy assumptions are  little changed:  The direct f iscal impetus
from all levels of the government contributes 0.7 percentage po int to the
growth rate in aggregate demand t his year—roughly the same as i n 2018.
After this year, with the boost from the 2017 tax cuts waning a nd federal
purchases flattening out, the impetus from fiscal policy tapers  to
0.4 percentage point in 2020 and t o a little less than 0.2 perc entage point in
2021 and 2022.

The  Effect  of Recent Tariffs on the Manufacturing  Sector 
As activity in the manufacturing  sector has slowed this year, industry  anecdotes—from  the Beige 
Book, surveys, and numerous  media reports—have  pointed to trade policy as a potential  culprit.  
The timing  of the current slump in the U.S. manufacturing  sector lends some credence to this  idea, 
as the solid gains in 2017 and 2018  were followed  by lackluster  performance in  the wake  of the 
tariffs imposed  by the United States and its trading partners.   Indeed, as  shown in  figure 1, 
manufacturing  IP (the solid blue line) has stepped down noticeably  since the end  of 2018, while  the 
trajectory  of manufacturing  employment (the  red dashed line)  has flattened.  
A recent memo explored  the effects of tariffs on manufacturing  output.1  This discussion  expands  
on that memo to update the  tariff effects on output and to examine the  effects on manufacturing  
employment.   To be clear, this analysis  seeks to identify  the effects of changes in actual trade 
policy, rather than uncertainty  about future trade policy.2  
The approach  exploits industry‐level variation in  three distinct channels  through which tariffs could 
affect output  or employment  using the published  lists of products  subject to tariffs  and detailed 
data on industry output, employment,  imports, and  exports. 
1.Import protection:   U.S. tariffs on industries’  products  protect them  from foreign competition,
which may boost U.S. outp ut and employment;  this channel is measured  as the import value of
an industry’s  products  subject to tariffs divided by  absorption  (output + imports – exports).
2.Rising input costs:  U.S. tariffs raise input costs for some  industries,  which may lower domestic
output and employment; this  channel is measured  as the import value of an industry’s  inputs
subject to tariffs  divided by  the 
cost of production,  based on the BEA’s input‐ output tables.
3.Foreign retaliation:  U.S.  trade partners  retaliate by imposing  tariffs on exports of some U.S.
industries,  which may lower domestic  output and employment;  this channel is measured  as the
value of an
 industry’s  exports subject to retaliatory  tariffs divided by  overall output.
The analysis  estimates  the relationship  between detailed  industry‐level changes  in growth rates 
and the measures  for each  of the three channels  previously  noted in a simple ordinary least‐squares

regression.   The dependent  variable is the change in the average monthly growth rate  of either 
manufacturing  IP or employment  across  two  periods:  July 2017 to June 2018, when the 
manufacturing  sector was expanding, and  December  2018  to August  2019, when manufacturing  IP 
contracted  on net.  In addition, the regression  includes controls for the  export share of each 
industry’s  output and the
 import share  of domestic  absorption  to account for general  exposure  to 
international  conditions  such  as changes in the value of the dollar  and foreign GDP growth (these 
controls may also serve as a coarse proxy for exposure  to trade policy uncertainty).  
The black lines in figure 2 report the estimated  effects of each tariff channel on the change in 
average monthly growth rates for 
manufacturing  IP (light bars) and employment  (dark bars) within 
their 90 percent  confidence  intervals (height of bars).  As shown in the figure, higher exposure  to 
rising input costs (green  bars) and foreign retaliation  (orange bars)  is associated  with  statistically  
significantly  lower IP growth.3 
Figure 2 also reveals a link between  tariffs and manufacturing  employment  growth, but the 
relationship  thus far is not as strong.  While  higher exposure  to rising input costs is associated  with 
lower  employment  growth, the effect is somewhat  smaller  in magnitude  than for IP, and there  is 
no effect of retaliatory  tariffs.4  Finally, there  is no statistically  significant  relationship  between 
import  protection  (blue bars) and either manufacturing  IP or employment  growth.   
All told, the estimates  indicate that the new tariffs account for about  two‐thirds of  the change in 
manufacturing  IP growth since December  2018  and for about  40 percent  of the change in 
employment  growth.5  This analysis, therefore,  still leaves room for other  factors cited in the Beige 
Book and elsewhere—such as  effects from trade policy uncertainty,  weak global growth, and the 
recent slowdown  in business investment—to  play a role in the manufacturing  downturn.  
Figure 2.  Tariff  Effects on Change in Average Growth in Manufacturing:   IP and Employment  
3 The negative relationship  between  rising input costs and manufacturing  production  is supported  by other 
research findings that tariffs on inputs  have  lowered export growth by U.S. firms; see Ryan Monarch  (2019), 
“Recent Weakness  in U.S. Exports:  Supply Chain  Effects of the 2018–2019  Tariffs,” briefing delivered  to the Board 
of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve System ,  Division of International  Finance, October 7. 
4 In results not reported  here, the analysis indicates  that tariffs do not explain meaningful  portions of the 
declines  in other  labor market measures  such as production  worker employment  and hours  worked, though data 
for these  measures  are not as detailed as data  for IP and manufacturing  employment  for all workers.  
5 Estimates  based on alternative  time periods are qualitatively  similar but tend to be less precise,  and they can 
be larger or smaller in magnitude  depending  on the time periods considered.

Oil Prices 
The spot price of Brent crude oil, at $59 per barrel, is down a lmost $2 per
barrel since the September Teal book.  Farther-dated futures pri ces are also
down.  The decline in oil prices r eflects concerns about the ou tlook for global
growth and has occurred despit e the September 14 attack on Saud i oil
facilities, which disrupted supplies and triggered a price spik e that
subsequently faded, as Saudi Ara bia was able to restore product ion fairly
quickly.  Though some analysts ha d speculated that the attack m ight add a
lasting geopolitical risk premium to prices, any effect apparen tly has been
more than offset by worries  about global activity.
THE OUTLOOK FOR GDP 
We expect GDP growth to moderate  from 2.6 percent in the first half of the year 
to 1.6 percent in the second half .  A further weakening in business fixed investment (BFI) 
makes an important contribution t o this deceleration; in additi on, a substantial portion is 
attributable to a waning of government purchases, as a first-ha lf surge in state and local 
infrastructure investment part ially unwinds and growth in federal purchases slows (in part 
because of a delay in enacting fiscal 2020 appropriations).  Th e strike at GM also plays a 
role in the deceleration.  Looking ahead to early next year, we  project that GDP growth 
will rebound to 2.2 percent in the first quarter as GM’s production rebounds.  Throughout 
the near term, projected household spending growth is well main tained, as consumption 
rises moderately and residentia l investment turns up following an extended period of 
weakness. 
Data through September on auto sales and retail sales—from both  the Census
Bureau and First Data—suggest that household consumption is con tinuing to
rise at a healthy clip.  Over th e second half, we expect PCE gr owth will
average 2.6 percent, just a bit  below its pace in the first hal f, supported by the
ongoing gains in the labor market and solid income growth.  Mor eover,
consumer sentiment remains positive:  The preliminary October r eading from
the Michigan survey retraced mos t of the slump it experienced i n August, and
the Conference Board measure re mains at a favorable level.
We expect residential investment  to rise about 5 percent in the  second half
following six consecutive quarters  of contraction.  This projec ted rebound is
consistent with the rise seen in single-family building permits  and home sales

 in recent months and suggests th at the decline in mortgage rates since late 
2018 is finally showing through to r esidential construction.  A n improvement 
in the housing market is also evident in builder sentiment and equity prices of 
major homebuilding companies , both of which have moved up of la te. 
Growth in BFI slowed from a br isk 6 percent pace in 2018 to a tepid
1.7 percent in the first half of  this year.  In the second half , we project BFI to
decline 1.1 percent.
oEquipment and intangibles invest ment is expected to decelerate further
in the second half, as shipment s of capital goods have been rou ghly
flat for some time and new orders have been running below shipm ents.
In addition, uncertainty over tr ade and global growth remains e levated,
and an array of indicators that i nform our outlook are notably
downbeat, including analysts’ expe ctations for longer-term prof it
growth.
oRecent indicators of investment  in nonresidential structures po int to a
steeper decline in the second half of this year than in the fir st half.
Monthly construction outlays f or nondrilling structures have been
moving down, readings from the Arch itecture Billings Index are
gloomy, and the number of drilli ng rigs in operation has fallen  sharply
amid declining energy prices.
Production at GM halted in mid-September because of a work stop page by the
United Auto Workers (UAW).  We estimate that the strike is like ly to have
reduced third-quarter GDP by ¼ percentage point through a drawd own of
vehicle inventories.  We expect  little net eff ect on GDP growth in the fourth

below potential. The change in the output gap is equal to real GDP growth less the contribution of measurement error less the growth rate of
potential output. For quarterly figures, the growth rates are at an annual rate, and this calculation needs to be multiplied by 1/4 to obtain

  and the drag from tariff incr eases continuing to weigh on the m anufacturing 
sector, we expect factory output  to be roughly flat in coming m onths 
(abstracting from strike-induce d fluctuations in motor vehicle production). 
 Net exports, after being about neutral for U.S. GDP growth in t he first half of 
the year, are expected to be a  drag in the second half.  Export  and import 
growth both remain weak, weighed down at least in part by the t ariffs 
previously implemented by the Uni ted States and its trading par tners.  We 
have revised export growth down i n the second half partly in re sponse to the 
ISM new export orders index, whi ch points to weak exports in co ming 
months.   
As noted earlier, the projected g radual decline in GDP growth f rom 2.1 percent 
this year to 1.7 percent in 2022 lar gely reflects waning support from fiscal policy.  This 
outlook for medium-term growth i s unchanged from the September Tealbook, as the 
revisions due to incoming data, as well as the implications of the changes to our 
conditioning assumptions, are small and offsetting.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The labor market continues to improve, but by most measures at a slower pace 
than in 2018.  Most prominently, gr owth in payroll employment h as stepped down 
noticeably this year.  At the same time, the unemployment rate has declined only 
modestly.  With output growth runn ing in the vicinity of its po tential rate over the 
medium term, we expect no further  tightening of the labor market.    
 According to currently publis hed data, after rising 223,000 per  month in 2018, 
nonfarm payroll employment ros e at an average monthly clip of 1 61,000 this 
year through September. 
o As indicated in the table below, we expect the BLS benchmark 
revision early next year will lowe r total payroll employment gr owth by 
42,000 per month from the sec ond quarter of 2018 through the first

  quarter of this year and by 16,000 per month through the end of  this 
year.3     
 
 Total payroll growth in the published data this year has been r elatively 
constant across the first thr ee quarters.  In contrast, private payrolls have 
stepped down further in recent months—from an average monthly p ace of 
156,000 in the first half to a pace of 119,000 in the third qua rter.4    
o Our measure of private nonfarm pa yrolls based on the microdata from 
the payroll-processing firm ADP has decelerated even more 
pronouncedly:  This measure indica tes that private employment r ose at 
an average monthly clip of 134,000 i n the first half of this year, but 
only 61,000 per month in the third qu arter.  These data raise t he 
possibility that the underlying pace of employment gains may be  
weaker than the revision-adjuste d BLS payroll figures indicate.  
 Job openings have come down from their highs over the course of  the year, 
consistent with some softening in labor demand.  That said, ini tial claims for 
unemployment insurance, which ha ve been a reliable early indica tor of a 
downturn in the past, have held s teady at a very low level. 
 Looking ahead, we expect total pa yroll employment to rise 124,0 00 per 
month, on average, in the fourt h quarter and then to decelerate  gradually to a 
monthly rate of 68,000 in 2022 as output  growth slows; this tra jectory is 
similar to that in the previous Tealbook. 
                                                 
3 These anticipated revisions, w hich will be published in Februa ry 2020, are based on the BLS’s 
preliminary estimate of the benchmark revision to payroll emplo yment and our expect ation that the BLS 
will use these revised payroll es timates in the re-estimation of its firm birth–death model.  We caution that 
there is a wide confidence band a round our estimate of the revi sions after March 2019.  (The exhibits 
elsewhere in the Tealbook are bas ed on the published BLS data.)  
4 Total payroll employment rose at a faster rate than private em ployment in the third quarter, in 
part because of a boost in federal hiring associated with prepa rations for the 2020 census.

  o We project that the GM strike will push down reported payroll g rowth 
by 62,000 in October and bump it up by 62,000 in November, leav ing 
no imprint on average monthly ga ins in the fourth quarter.5     
 The unemployment rate unexpect edly moved down from 3.7 percent in 
August to a 50-year low of 3.5 perc ent in September, yielding a n average of 
3.6 percent for the third quart er.  With projected output growth near potential 
thereafter, our projec tion calls for the unemployment rate to h old steady 
through 2022. 
 The LFPR held steady at 63.2 percen t in September, whereas we h ad expected 
it to edge down 0.1 percentage point.  We continue to expect the LFPR to drift 
lower over the next several years , as the cyclical improvement in participation 
stalls and the aging of the populat ion exerts a downward pull.  Owing to its 
surprising recent strength, however, we nudged up our forecast for the LFPR in 2020.  
 Combining information from the unemployment rate and the LFPR, the 
employment-to-population rati o ticked up to 61.0 percent in Sep tember—
0.2 percentage point above our projection in the previous Tealb ook.  
However, we expect the rati o to fall back t o 60.7 percent by the end of the 
year and then to drift lower over the medium term because of de clining labor 
force participation. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
With September CPI and PPI data in hand, we estimate that core PCE prices rose 
1.7 percent in September relative to a year earlier.  We expect  the 12-month change in 
core prices to move sideways through the remainder of the year and then temporarily pick up to 2 percent by March of next year , as the weak readings fro m early this year drop out 
of the calculation and the tran sitorily high read ings from the spring and summer remain.  
Looking further ahead, we expect c ore PCE price inflation to ru n at 1.8 percent—equal to 
our estimate of its underlying t rend—through the medium term, a s a boost from tight 
                                                 
5 This estimate is based on our assumption that production at GM  will resume in late October; it 
incorporates a 50,000 r eduction in employment directly from str iking UAW workers at GM and an 
additional 12,000 reduction fro m layoffs at suppliers to GM.  B y contrast, striking workers are counted as 
employed in the household survey; thus, the strike should have no material effect on the unemployment 
rate.

 resource utilization is offset by a drag from the rising dollar .  With energy prices 
projected to fall further next ye ar, total PCE inflation is exp ected to run a bit below core 
inflation in 2020.  Thereafter, as energy prices become less of  a drag, total consumer 
inflation is projected to be i n line with core inflation throug h 2022.     
We expect that the effective pr ice for imported core goods—whic h includes
the effects of tariffs—will rise 2.3 percent in the second half  of this year,
boosted by past tariff increases.  Thi s increase is slightly la rger than we
anticipated in the September T ealbook, reflecting the recent re bound in
agricultural commodity prices.  Aft er this year, core import pr ice inflation is
expected to be subdued—reflecti ng an appreciating dollar and th e fading
effects of the recent tariff  increases—and to hold down domesti c inflation.
The preliminary October readi ng of median long-run inflation ex pectations
from the Michigan survey s tepped down to 2.2 percent, 0.2 perce ntage point
below its September value; this  value would be a new historical  low if
confirmed by the final reading later this month.  In addition, the FRBNY
Survey of Consumer Expectations m easure of median three-year-ah ead
expected inflation edged down fur ther in September, reaching a new historical
low.  However, TIPS-based measures of longer-term inflation com pensation
are little changed since the time of the previous Tealbook.
oA new staff index, which synthesi zes these and other measures o f
inflation expectations, views expectations as having held stead y since
2016; see the box “An Index of Comm on Inflation Expectations.”
oWe continue to assume that underlying inflation is 1.8 percent and that
it will hold at this value through the medium term—a view infor med
by statistical models, some of w hich use measures of inflation
expectations.
We have received little new i nformation on hourly labor compensation since the 
September Tealbook, and, consistent  with no further labor marke t tightening, we project 
a continuation of moderate wage growth over the medium term.  T he employment cost 
index (ECI) is projected to rise a little over 2½ percent per y ear, close to the average pace 
over the past couple of years.  We expect that growth in compen sation per hour in the

 An Index of Common Inflation Expectations  
Indicators that measure inflation expectations, based largely on information from 
surveys and financial instruments , have grown in number in recent years .  We closely 
monitor many of the long er-running measures, but the large number of available 
indicators and the inherent differences between them make it difficult to evaluate co-
movement s across the entire set.  In this discussion , we  present an index of common 
inflation expectations  (CIE)  as one way  to summarize the information in these measures . 
The CIE index is constructed from inflation expectation  indicators  that represent the 
views of  households, firms, professional forecasters, and f inancial market participants.  
The indicators include both “short horizon” and “long horizon” inflation expectations , 
and while some are denominated in terms of a specific inflation measure , such as the 
personal consumption expenditures  (PCE) price index, others are described only in terms  
of “prices in general .”  Good evidence of interr elationship s among many of these 
indicators  exists , but there are also notable differences . 
Figure 1 presents four indicat ors that  we closely track and that are representative of the 
overall trends across many of the other indicators.  A broad decline in  the three long -
horizon indicators  over the sample period is evident, and it is this co -movement that the 
CIE index exploits .  However,  the short -horizon indicator  increases over much of the 
sample , and the long -horizon indicators exhibit differences in their overall level s and in 
the timing and dynamics of the ir decline s. 
The CIE index , shown in figure 2,  is constructed by applying a dynamic factor model to 
21 inflation expectation indicators , including those in figure 1 .1  The index  suggests that 
inflation expectations were relatively stable between 1999 and 2012, edged down 
between 2012 and 2016, and have since fluctuated around that lower level.2  Because the 
decline in this measure is small and occurred several years ago, it does not appear to  
 
 
 
 
                                                 
1 The sample period for the CIE index begins in 1999 , as the current regime of anchored inflation 
expectations is thought to have begun at about that time.  
2 The decline potentially coincides  with the announcement of an explicit inflation target by the 
FOMC  in 2012, the perceived deterioration of the global economic outlook (as signaled by the European 
Central Bank’s ( ECB ) adoption of quantitative easing  policies), a sharp drop in oil prices, and the ECB and 
the Bank of Japan implementing negative policy rat es. Figure 1:  Evolution of Selected Inflation Expectation  Indicator s

 support concerns that expectations may have more recently become unanchored to the 
downside.   
Mechanically, the CIE index can be thought of as a weighted average of the included 
indicators , where i ndicators that tend to co-move more with other s receive  more 
weight.3  It is derived from an estimated dynamic factor that has no natural level or scale 
but that can be interpreted in terms of any of the included indicators.  The baseline CIE 
index , presented  as the blue line  in figure 2 , interprets the factor by “projecting” it onto 
the 10 -year PCE inflation expectation s from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).4  
For comparison, we also present an alternative measure that interprets the factor in 
terms of expected price ch anges over the next 5  to 10 years from the Michigan survey  
(orange line) , which has both a higher mean and a higher variance than the SPF .  In each 
case, we interpret the factor using a long -run inflation expectation indicator , as these  
measures  are affected less by transitory factors and may be more appealing  in 
constructing a measu re of underlying inflation expectations that may be most interesting 
to monetary policy makers . 
Overall, the CIE  index  captures the general trajectory of many of the long -horizon 
inflation expectation indicators  well .  However, as it is derived from a single  factor, it 
cannot capture all relevant features  of the data —even of just the four series illustrated in 
figure  1.  This observation yields several caveats to the interpretation of the index . 
First, the level of the index is determined by the mean of the indicator used to interpret 
the underlying factor ; while the  baseline  CIE index ends the sam ple slightly below 
2 percent, the  alternative index ends at 2.6 percent .  Second, short -horizon inflation 
expect ation indicators tend to exhibit a different trend over this sample from long -
horizon indicators  so that including relatively more short -horizon indicators in the 
exercise could yield an alternative index of inflation expectations with different 
dynamics.  Finally, although many of the various l ong -horizon indicators decline over the 
sample period, the differences in timing and dynamics allow the possibility that different 
economic events triggered each decline, so future co -movement is not guaranteed.  
                                                 
3 The use of an alternative method, principal components analysis, results in a similar index.  
4 We project the estimated factor onto that indicator by multiplying the factor by the indicator’s 
standard deviation and adding its mean.  Figure 2:  Estimated Index of Common Inflation Expectations

 business sector will be 3½ percen t per year over the medium ter m, below the 
anomalously fast rate seen so far this year. 
Growth in average hourly earnings has edged down, on net, over the course of
this year, and the pace of increase in the ECI has also eased a  bit through the
middle of the year.  Although the de celeration in these measures of
compensation could simply be stati stical noise, it could also r eflect the
slowing in job growth this year, as is suggested by some staff models of
compensation.
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
As in the September Tealbook, we assume that the natural rate o f
unemployment fell to 4.4 percent in 2018 and will remain at thi s level going
forward.  We continue to assume t hat potential output growth will slow after
2021 to 1.7 percent per year in th e longer run, as the boost to  potential growth
from the 2017 tax cuts wanes.
We have maintained our assumption that the real long-run equili brium federal
funds rate is 0.5 percent.  The nom inal yield on 10-year Treasu ry securities is
3.0 percent in the longer run, revised down by 40 basis points from the
September Tealbook.  This change r eflects a downward revision to our
estimate of the term premium.6
oW
e continue to assume that fiscal policymakers will eventually start to
gradually reduce primary deficits  by an amount sufficient to st abilize
the debt-to-GDP ratio.  We expect  this ratio to eventually settle around
105 percent, 20 percentage points higher than would have occurr ed in
the absence of the 2017–18 federal  tax and discretionary spending
changes.  We also still assume that this 20 percentage point in crement
to the debt-to-GDP ratio will pus h up the term premium on 10-year
Treasury yields 50 basis points in the long run.
6 We lowered our assumption for th e 10-year term premium in the long run from about 90 basis 
points to 50 basis points to take on board more of the persiste nt decline in term premiums over the past 
several years.  Those lower term premiums are likely due in par t to an environment of relatively low and 
stable inflation, a condition in  which Treasury securities are perceived as less risky during downturns in 
economic activity and in investor wealth.

   GDP growth slows from 1.7 percent in 2022 to 1.4 percent in 202 5 and rises 
gradually to its long-run value thereafter.  The unemployment r ate moves up 
gradually from 3.6 percent at t he end of 2022 toward its assume d natural rate 
in subsequent years.  Core PCE price inflation remains at 1.9 p ercent for many 
years as it converg es to its long-run va lue of 2 percent. 
 Given the outlook for inflation a nd resource utilization, the n ominal federal 
funds rate remains close to 2.5 pe rcent after the end of the me dium term.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
The global manufacturing and trade slowdown has yet to relent, and we see 
economic growth abroad remaining subpar  through the end of this year before starting to 
pick up early next year.  Continued weakness in the data has led us to  yet another modest 
downward revision to the foreign outlook .  Even so , we do not believe a global recession  
is imminent .  At present , very few economies around the globe appear to be in or near  
recession , and our estimated models show a slightly lower probability of a global 
recession  over the next 12 months than at the time of the September Tealbook.  That said, 
predict ing recessions  is no economist’s strong suit , and plenty of downside risks remain .         
We now see aggregate f oreign growth of 1. 8 percent at an annual rate in the 
second half of this year, significantly below potential —which we estimate at 
2.3 percent —and similar to its first-half pace.  This projection is a touch  lower than in the 
September Tealbook, reflecting weaker -than-expected data  from a number of economies, 
including the euro area, Mexico, China, and Hong Kong.  We expect a pickup in growth 
abroad to 2.3  percent next year and further to 2.6 percent in 2021 and 2022 .  This 
projection assumes that , even if all the recently imposed tariffs remain in place, some of 
the heat surrounding trade tensions will dissipate , and the  drag on investment and 
manufacturing will eventually fade , helping to ease the global manufacturing slump.  The 
projected pickup abroad depend s also on strengthening recoveries in Latin America, a 
prospect that , as we have highlighted in previous Tealbooks,  remains highly uncertain.             
With current global growth prospects being fragile and major  foreign central 
banks having  limited policy space , negative shocks could prove especially deleterious.  
Even so, we  have  received some good news lately.  Talks on Brexit have reached a 
turning point , as the European Union (EU) and the U.K. government have agreed on a 
new deal.  Howev er, as of this writing , it is uncertain whether the U.K. Parliament  will 
ratify the deal , and our baseline assum ption  continues to be  that the deadline  will be 
extended and uncertainty around Brexit will remain elevated for some time  before an 
agreement is finalized .  That said, other outcomes are possible, including either  
ratifi cation of  an agreement or  even a no-deal Brexit.  Even with a no -deal Brexit , global 
spillovers would likely be limited on account of the substantial prepara tion for this event, 
as discussed in our “No -Deal Brexit” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section .

  Another bit of good news was the recent agreement in principle on a  partial U.S. –
China trade deal  (the so -called Phase 1 agreement ), which has eased trade tensions  for the 
moment .  However, details of the deal are yet to be worked out , and, as we know from 
past experience, trade policy uncertainty could suddenly ratchet up again, prolonging the 
weakness in investment and reinforcing the slowdown in glo bal growth.  Moreover, even 
without a heightening of trade tensions, the global manufacturing slump could deepen 
and bleed into the services sector, thereby depressing sentiment and consumption as well.  
As we discuss in our “Global Slowdown” alternative s cenario, th is outcome could entail a 
significant hit to the global economy.  (The box in this section of the Tealbook provides 
some color on the downturn in the global automobile industry , which has contributed  to 
worldwide weakness in manufacturing. ) 
Foreign inflation remains low and is estimated to have eased in the third quarter.  
Declines in energy prices  are contributing  to the low inflation , but underlying inflation 
continues to be weak  in many economies ; 12-mont h core inflation in the euro area a nd 
Japan c ame in at 1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively, in  September .  Measures of 
inflation expectations , including readings of inflation compensation,  in the euro area have 
also moved down.  Amid growth concerns and subdued inflation, we continue to  see 
monetary policies being very accommodative in the advanced foreign economie s.  
Monetary policy was also eased in a number of emerging market economie s, including 
Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, 
Turkey, and Vietnam.        
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro Area.   Economic indicators, such as PMIs  through September and industrial 
production through August, suggest that growth slowed to 0.4 percent  in the third 
quarter .  Manufacturing output  contract ed further , and activity  in the service sector , 
which had previously held up surprisingly well,  appears to have slow ed.  We project 
growth to increase to 0.8 percent in the fourth  quarter and to 1.8  percent (above 
potential)  by 2021 as external demand regains momentum  and monetary policy 
remains highly  accommodative .  Relative to the September Tealbook, our growth 
forecast is down about ¼  percentage point in the second half of this year on 
disappointing data .     
Twelve -month headline inflation declined from 1.4 percent in the spring  to 
0.8 percent in September , mainly on declin ing energy prices.  Core inflation was

 1 percent , little changed over the past two years .  We expect headline inflation to stay 
weak for the re mainder of the year before rising gradually to 1.6 percent by end -2022 .  
Given the weak economic outlook, we expect the European Central Bank to run its 
asset purchase program until the second quarter of 2021 and maintain the deposit rate 
at the current record -low level of negative 0.5 percent until the last quarter of 2021.  
Japan.   Recent consumption indicators point to  some front -running  of demand before
the October 1 consumption tax increase , and we expect another solid reading on GDP
growth in the third quarter .  That said, consumer confidence declined further in recent
months , and the manufacturing PMI remain ed in contractionary territory.  Smoothing
through the volatility induced by the tax hike and accounting for the typhoon -related
flooding this month , we expect GDP to fall 0. 6 percent  at an annual rate in the second
half of the year.  Beyond the near  term, we have growth in line with or slightly above
its potential pace of 0.7  percent, supported by spending related to the 2020 Tokyo
Olympics and highly accommodative monetary policy.
Twelve -month total consumer price index ( CPI) inflation slowed to 0.2  percent in
September , mainly reflecting a sharp deceleration in energy and fresh food prices  but
also a step -down in core CPI inflation , which slipped back t o 0.3  percent.   The
October consumption tax hike should provide only a temporary boost to inflation , and
its effect will be largely offset by a reduction in education  fees.  Thereafter, we see
total inflation rising to about 1  percent by the end of 2021.   At its September meeting,
the Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept its deposit rate unchanged at negative  0.1 percent , and
the meeting minutes showed that Board members called for further examination of
the need to ease.   The BOJ also reduced its planned purchases of long-term Japanese
government bonds, consistent with comments in favor of a steeper yield curve to
mitigate the negative effect of stimulus on financial institutions.  Our baseline
forecast still calls for no cuts to the deposit rate, but we do think the p robability of a
rate cut by the end of the year has increased.
United Kingdom.   Incoming data, including monthly GDP through August and PMIs
through September, suggest that Brexit uncertainty continued to weigh on economic
activity, with real GDP expandi ng a modest 1 percent  in the third  quarter after a
0.9 percent  contraction  in the second.   Even though the U.K. government and the EU
have agreed on a new Brexit deal, we think that it will not be ratified by the U.K.
Parliament.  Therefore, we continue to assum e that an extension to the October 31
Brexit deadline will be granted , and it will take as long as another year for an orderly

 The Downturn in the Global Automobile Industry  
Global production of motor vehicles , the blue line in figure 1 , declined  last year for the first time since 
the Global Financial Crisis  and is projected to contract  even more sharply this year , contributing to the 
observed weakness in global manufacturing (the red line).  V ehicles account for 9 percent of global 
manufacturing , which  implies  that the (expected) decline in motor vehicle production  over 2018 and 
2019 is directly lowering  global manufacturing output  by about 0.6 percent.  Moreover, declines  in 
motor vehicle production  have large, negative spillovers to other manufacturing sectors, including 
motor vehicle parts, primary metals (for example, steel and aluminum ), and fabricated metals .  In this 
discussion, we argue that  three key factors appear to be behind the downturn in the global 
automobile industry:  regulatory factors that have limited production in Europe, cyclical factors 
reflecting the slowing of global GDP, and China- specific cr edit and tax policies . 
In Europe, as reported in past Tealbooks, t he production of vehicle s has been , in part, depressed by 
regulatory  factors.  In September 2018, the European Union (EU) implemented new emissions tests  
with tougher standards .  The large number of models subjected to the new tests led to bottlenecks at 
testing agencies  and caused  manufacturer s to cut production to avoid unwanted inventory 
accumulation.  
Broader cyclical factors have also likely played a role in the production decline.  Give n that durable 
goods, such as motor vehicles, tend to be more cyclical than other expenditure components of GDP, 
the falloff in vehicle production also  reflect s the overall slowing in global growth since the beginning 
of 2018.  Indeed, as illustrated in figure 2, global vehicle sales (the black line) declined nearly 5 percent 
over 2018 and 2019, with China, the world’s largest market for automobiles, account ing for the bulk of 
this contraction (the red portion of bars ).  Sales have also been declining in  Europe (blue portion), in 
the United States (green portion), and in the rest of the world (gray portion).

Figure 3 reports, for the United States, the EU, and China, the growth rate of vehicle sales in 2019 (full 
bars)  and the rate  predicted by a model that relates sales to real GDP growth  (striped  bars) .1  For the 
United States, although sales have edged down a bit , they have held up well relative to the prediction 
of the model, consistent with the assessment in this and recent  Tealbook s that the level of U.S. auto 
sales  has been st rong .  For the EU, the observed  decline in  sales is only a touch lower than that 
predicted by the model, suggesting that  the region’s  economic malaise may well account for the bulk 
of the weakness in sales .  For Chin a, in contrast, the model can explain only half of the plunge in sales, 
indicating that other factors have been  at work.  
The exceptional weakness in Chinese  sales likely reflects , in part, t he authorities ’ deleveraging 
campaign , which  tightened credit conditions and  weighed substantially on household spending for 
durable goods .  In addition, as shown in figure 4, the introduction in late 2015 and subsequent removal 
in 2017 and 20 18 of tax breaks  for the purchase of small and medium cars brought sales forward and 
contributed to a slump in demand when the tax breaks lapsed .2   
What has been the role of tariffs?  A lthough autos  have not yet been directly hit  by new tariffs , the 
automobile industry has likely  been depressed  by higher tariffs on some inputs  as well as by the 
aggregate negative effects of rising  trade policy uncertainty .  For example, a recent paper showed that 
the incidence of Chinese retaliatory  tariffs  across U.S. counties has been associated with a relative 
decline in vehicle sales.3  More over, as early as mid -November, the A dministration could decide to 
impose national security tariffs on auto imports , exerting a further drag on the automobile industry.  
All in all, the downturn in the automobile industry  appears to reflect a mix of persistent and temporary 
headwinds, and , as some of these wane, we expect the auto industry to stabilize, supporting the 
broader global manufacturing sector. 
1 Specifically, we fit for each country a second -order autoregressive process on the quarterly log of vehicle sales by 
regressing it on its own lags and contemporaneous real GDP growth.  This model fits the data well , and the estimated 
elasticity of sales relative to growth is larger than one.  
2 The latest I nternational Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook reports that the temporary tax breaks  boosted 
sales by as much as 7 million units in 2016  and 2017 and then lowered  sales  by a similar amount in 2018  and 20 19.

War,” NBER W orking Paper Series 26353 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, October ),

  deal.  Thus , Brexit -related uncertainties will likely persist  for some time , and we 
project real GDP growth to average only 0. 7 percent  through 2020 , a pace 
significantly below our potential growth estimate of  1.4 percent.  With a deal in place , 
growth should pick up to a tad above its potential in early 2021 and hold there  over 
the remainder  of the forecast period .  That said, other outcomes remain  possible , 
including either  the approval of the new Brexit agreement  or a no-deal Brexit  on 
Halloween .   
We expect inflation to linger around the Bank of England’s (BOE) 2 percent target 
through the forecast horizon.   With inflation under control and a gloomy growth 
outlook, we assume that the BOE will cut the Bank Rate from  0.75 percent to 
0.5 percent in the  first quarter  of 2020.  Thereafter, we expect the BOE to resume 
hiking rates in 2021, gradually bringing the Bank Rate to 1.25  percent by the end of 
the forecast period .   
 Canada .  After rebound ing in the second quarter , supported by  a recovery of oil 
production, we e stimate  that growth fell back  to a modest 1.4 percent last quarter.  
With recent indicators —such as monthly GDP for July and manufacturing PMI 
through September —pointing to subdued momentum, we project only modest growth 
in the current quarter  as well .  Thereafter, we expect GDP growth to edge up to its 
poten tial pace of 1.7 percent by early 2021 and to remain around there through the 
forecast period.  With subdued growth and inflation near target , we expect the Bank 
of Canada to cut its policy rate 25 basis points early next year to 1.5 percen t before 
resumin g its normalization process in mid -2021.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 China. Real GDP growth slowed to 5. 5 percent in the third quarter, a notable step -
down from the 6. 4 percent pace in the first half of the year.  The step -down was due 
in part to temporary factory shutdowns in August and September to ensure clear skies 
for the celebration of the 70th National Day on October 1 .  However , several other  
factors also weighed on growth .  First, elevated trade tensions were a drag on Chinese 
exports to the United States, which contracted in the third quarter  and were only 
partially offset by increases in Chinese exports to the rest of the world .  Second, the 
property market started to cool as Chinese authorities tightened credit flowing to the 
property sector to cu rb housing -related  risks.  Third, d omestic consumption 
indicators, including auto sales , remain weak .  That said, the September activity

 indicators were a bit stronger than anticipated, driven by strong production in the 
high-tech sector, which could refle ct front -loaded production ahead of the scheduled 
U.S. tariff hike of 15 percentage points on about $150 billion of Chinese goods.  In 
the current quarter,  we see growth edging up to 5.7 percent as factory activity 
resumes following the temporary shutdowns  and then holding steady at about that 
pace as modest policy easing offsets the drag from trade tensions  and a cooling 
property market .  Our outlook assumes no further escalation  of trade tariffs . 
Other Emerging Asia.   A notable resurgence in high -tech pro duction in the region’s
main exporters —Taiwan and Korea —is a rare bright spot in the global manufacturing
sector.  Although the resurgence has yet to translate into a convincing rebound in
exports, rising production and inventories suggest stronger future demand.  Even so,
we estimate that real GDP growth in the region edged down to  a subdued  2.5 percent
pace in the third quarter.  This estimate reflects, in part , a projected contraction of
output  in Hong Kong, where retail sales and tourist arrivals have p lummeted amid
continued large -scale protests .  In several other economies , growth appears to have
picked up in the third quarter but at a more subdued pace than we were expecting .  A
further recovery in manufacturing, more accommodative monetary policy throughout
the region, and support from fiscal policy in some countries should boost growth in
the region to its potential pace of 3.5 percent in the next year and beyond.  Third -
quart er growth for the region has been marked down significantly, largely reflect ing a
substantial downward revision to Hong Kong ; even so , there is still a risk that our
forecast  for Hong Kong  may prove too optimistic .
Mexico.   Demand -side components behind the second  quarter’s flat GDP reading
indicated an alarming weakness in investment, which fell almost 10 percent at an
annual rate and is back to its 2015 level.  I ndicators for the third quarter were mixed,
with monthly GDP contracting in July but industr ial production picking up in August.
The recent weakness appears to reflect  the new administration’s crackdown on
corruption, which has resulted in heightened scrutiny of public investment projects , as
well as concerns about the government’s market -unfrie ndly policies, which are
weighing on private investment and construction.  Consequently, we revised down
our outlook by 0.4 percentage point  in the second half of this year and now see real
GDP growth at a tepid 1 .1 percent.  We also expect a more gradual pickup  than in our
September forecast , with growth remaining under 2 percent next year before rising to

  2.5 percent by the end of 2021, supported by monetary easing and a gradual 
turnaround in public spending.   
Twelve-month headline inflation continued to decline in September, pulled down by 
food and energy prices ; meanwhile, core inflation remains  elevated at  3.8 percent.  
Responding to the weak economic backdrop and falling headline inflation, the B ank 
of Mexico  lowered its policy rate 25 basis points to a still -high 7.75 percent in late 
September  following an earlier rate cut in mid -August . 
 Brazil.   Recent data have been mixed , with retail sales and industrial production 
picking up in August  while services activit y contracted .  Even so, we remain cautious 
about the recovery  and expect GDP growth to step down to 1.1 percent in the third 
quarter from 1.8  percent in the second .  (Second -quarter growth had been boosted 
because of mining production c oming back online following the c ollapse  of the dam 
of a major mining company early in the year .)  Twelve -month inflation fell to 
3 percent in August, well below the central bank’s 4 ¼ percent target for this year.  
Given lackluster growth and little inflationary pressure, t he Central Bank of Brazil cut 
its policy rate another 50 basis points in September, to 5.5 percent, and signaled 
further cuts ahead.  We expect monetary easing and the approval of the long -awaited 
pension reform by the end of October to support  a pickup in  growth, albeit to a still -
mediocre 2½ percent by the second half of 2020.

Financial Market Developments 
Over the early part of the int ermeeting period, asset price mov ements were driven 
by a few weaker-than-expected dom estic data releases and, to a lesser extent, downbeat 
political and global developments .  These movements were largely reversed later on, as 
an increase in optimism regardi ng trade negotiations between th e United States and China 
contributed to a partial rebound i n market sentiment.  On net, nominal Treasury yields 
posted modest declines, with large r decreases at the front end of the curve, and the near-
term market-implied path of  policy edged down.  Broad equity price indexes and 
corporate bond spreads were l ittle changed on balance.   
 Nominal Treasury yields fell  16, 7, and 4 basis points, respectively, at the 2-, 
10-, and 30-year maturities.  Infla tion compensation for the 5-year and 5-to-
10-year horizons declined 8 basis points and 10 basis points, r espectively, to 
near multiyear low levels. 
 A straight read of OIS forward rates suggests that investors ex pect the federal 
funds rate to decline 34 basis  points by the end of this year, about a 15 basis 
point larger decrease  than was expected at the start of the int ermeeting period.   
Options quotes currently imply a 25 basis point reduction in th e target range at 
the October meeting as the most likely outcome, with modest odd s on no 
change and on a 50 basis point reduction. 
 Global equity indexes, soverei gn yields, and the exchange value of the dollar 
ended the period about unchanged on net.  
 Domestic short-term funding mar kets were notably volatile in mi d-September 
and exhibited additional, albeit more modest, pressures around the September 
quarter-end and the mid-October Tr easury settlement date.  Thes e pressures 
have been alleviated in part by D esk operations that began on S eptember 17.1

   DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Early in the intermeeting peri od, weaker-than-expected domestic  data releases 
weighed on investor sentiment aga inst a backdrop of continuing global growth concerns.  
These developments, together wi th negative U.S. political headl ines and ongoing trade 
uncertainty between the Unite d States and both China and the eu ro area, led to sizable 
declines in Treasury y ields and a further shift down in the mar ket-implied path of the 
expected federal funds rate.  L ater in the period, however, inc reasing optimism regarding 
trade negotiations between the U nited States and China contribu ted to a rebound in 
sentiment, largely reversing the  earlier declines.  Headlines r egarding Brexit negotiations 
also appeared to have contributed positively to risk sentiment but left little imprint on 
domestic asset prices. 
FOMC communications had only modest effects on Treasury yields and policy 
expectations on net.  The Septemb er FOMC communications were vi ewed as slightly less 
accommodative than expected, with investors reportedly focusing  on the fact that a 
majority of SEP rate projections  indicated no further easing this year.  Investors also were 
reportedly attentive to the disse nts in favor of no change in t he target range, and short-
dated Treasury yields rose followi ng the release of the stateme nt.    
At the start of the intermeeting period, a straight read of the option-implied 
probability distribution of the federal funds rate indicated th at market participants 
considered no change in the target  range at the October meeting  as the most likely 
outcome.  However, the market-im plied path of the policy rate shifted down noticeably 
on the ISM manufacturing data and d eclined further following th e ISM 
nonmanufacturing data a couple of days later.  Later in the per iod, the declines partially 
retraced as investors grew mor e optimistic over the possibility  of a limited trade deal 
between China and the United Sta tes.  Currently, options quotes  imply a 25 basis point 
reduction in the target range at the October meeting as the most likely outcome, with 
modest odds on no change and on a 50 ba sis point reduction.  A straight read of forward 
rates derived from overnight ind ex swaps suggests that investor s expect the federal funds 
rate to decline 34 basis points  by year-end and an additional 27 basis points by the end of 
next year.2  In contrast, a staff model that adjusts for term premiums imp lies a 22 basis 
                                                 
2 In view of the volatility of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) over the intermeeting period, 
this calculation assumes that, currently, the EFFR is at the mi dpoint of the range.

 point decline in the federal  funds rate by the end of 2019 and a 17 basis point rise in 
2020.3 
Consistent with the changes i n the market-implied policy path, nominal U.S. 
Treasury yields moved down substa ntially in the early part of the intermeeting period 
before partially retracing their declines.  The yield curve ste epened, with yields on 2-, 
10-, and 30-year Treasury secu rities declining 16, 7, and 4 bas is points, respectively, on 
net.  TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation over the ne xt 5 years and 5 to 10 
years ahead declined 8 basis poi nts and 10 basis points to 1.46 percent and 1.61 percent, 
respectively, to near multiyear  low levels.  According to the s taff’s term structure models, 
more than half of the decrease in the longer-horizon inflation compensation over the past 
few months reflects a declin e in inflation expectations. 
Uncertainty about short- and long- term rates implied by swaptio ns remained 
elevated over the intermeeting period.  Trading conditions in T reasury markets appeared 
stable.  Measures of market f unctioning in the off-the-run segm ent of the Treasury 
market, which had deteriorated fo llowing the increased stresses  in funding markets in 
mid-September, recovered after t he Fed’s announcement of its re po operations.  
Broad stock price indexes were  little changed, on net, over the  intermeeting 
period.  Prices fell by as much a s 4 percent during the first half of the intermeeting period 
but recovered soon afterward.  The one-month option-implied vol atility on the S&P 500 
index—the VIX— declined sligh tly, on net, and ended the period below the middle of its 
historical distribution sin ce 1990.  Spreads on investment- and  speculative-grade 
corporate bonds were also lit tle changed.  Spreads on both type s of corporate bonds 
remain somewhat below the midpoints of their respective historical ranges, while yields 
on corporate bonds stayed near historical lows. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Early in the period, weak incomi ng U.S. and euro-area manufactu ring data 
weighed on AFE long-term yields a nd global risky asset prices. Later on, positive 
developments in both Brexit and U .S.–China trade negotiations b oosted sentiment, and 
these asset prices retraced the ir earlier falls, leaving them broadly unchanged.  
3 An alternative macro-finance m odel of term premiums implies a policy path that lies closer to the 
unadjusted path.

  Movements in the dollar exchange r ate against most currencies w ere relatively modest, 
and the dollar ended the period little cha nged on net.   
Reports of progress toward a Brexit agreement had a noticeable effect on 
European asset prices.  U.K. a nd EU negotiations intensified du ring Brexit talks in mid-
October and sparked optimism that  they were nearing an agreemen t on how to manage 
the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  A deal was fi nally struck between the 
United Kingdom and the Europea n Union on October 17 and received unanimous 
approval by EU leaders.  The U.K. Parliament is set to vote on the deal on October 19, 
and a close vote is expected.  These positive developments in B rexit negotiations and, to 
a lesser extent, optimism toward trade developments more than retraced earlier losses in 
U.K. and euro-area asset prices  that followed weak U.S. and eur o-area manufacturing 
data.  European equity prices e nded the intermeeting period abo ut 2 percent higher, and 
the British pound about 2.5 percent stronger against the dollar.  Long-term yields in 
Germany rose 7 basis points, and eu ro-area peripheral spreads n arrowed 10 to 20 basis 
points, on net, while U.K. yields  were little changed.  Long-te rm inflation compensation 
in the euro area, which had reached historical lows amid weaker -than-expected economic 
data and concerns about the in flation outlook, also picked up a s investor sentiment 
improved, but ended the period 9 basi s points lower at 1.22 percent.   
Outside of Europe, sovereign yields also retraced their early p eriod declines, and 
net changes were modest.  Japanes e yields declined slightly fol lowing accommodative 
monetary policy communications  by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) and a djustments to the 
BOJ’s asset purchase operations, but subsequently increased as global sentiment 
improved.  A strong employment report in Canada contributed to the 10 basis point rise 
in Canadian long-term yields.     
Reflecting the mild risk-off tone  that characterized the early part of the 
intermeeting period, funds dedicate d to assets of emerging mark et economies (EMEs) 
experienced slight outflows.  EME  asset prices initially declin ed but reversed when 
positive news regarding U.S.–China trade boosted sentiment.  
 The mid-September increases in the U.S. Treasury repo rates spilled over to 
borrowing rates in the internati onal dollar funding market.  However, the measures taken 
to address repo market funding a lso calmed dollar funding condi tions in the FX swap 
market.

 SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Domestic money market rates sp iked amid notable volatility in m id-September, 
and more modest pressures emer ged around the September quarter- end and the mid-
October Treasury settlement date.  The most severe mid-Septembe r pressures eased 
relatively quickly, in part because of Desk operations that beg an on September 17.  (The 
box “Desk Repurchase Operations in September” provides addition al analysis on the 
effects of the Desk’s repo operations.)   
Smoothing through rate vol atility over the period, interest rat es for overnight 
unsecured and secured funding fell roughly in line with the 30 basis point decrease in the 
IOER rate that was announced aft er the September FOMC meeting.  The EFFR averaged 
1.88 percent over the intermeeti ng period, leaving its spread t o IOER at 8 basis points, 
4 basis points wider than during the previous intermeeting peri od.  The EFFR was more 
volatile than usual over the in termeeting period, with the EFFR –IOER spread ranging 
between 2 basis points and 10 basis points. 
Soon after the initial rou nd of desk operations, rates on overn ight commercial 
paper (CP) and short-term nego tiable certificates of deposit fe ll fairly quickly from their 
highly elevated levels see n on September 17, although some CP rates only returned to 
more typical levels relative t o other rates by mid-October.  After experiencing moderate 
outflows associated with September tax payments, government mon ey market funds 
attracted robust inflows over the intermeeting period, extendin g the trend seen over the 
past few months.  
Market conditions remained relativ ely calm over the September q uarter-end, in 
part because of Desk term repo opera tions that spanned the quar ter-end date.  On that 
day, the EFFR increased 7 basis points, and the Secured Overnig ht Financing Rate 
(SOFR) increased 53 basis points.  T he increase in SOFR was lar ger than on recent 
quarter-end dates but smaller than the increase around the 2018  year-end.   
More recently, the Chair’s speech on October 8 and the FOMC’s October 11 
announcement of Treasury bill purchases to commence on October 15 reportedly further 
strengthened the expectati on of stable funding throughout the r emainder of the year.  
Since the Chair’s speech, the six-month Treasury bill–OIS sprea d has narrowed about 
10 basis points, on net, likely re flecting in part the expectations of bill purchases.  These

 Desk Repurchase Operations  in September  
Following unexpected market volatility on  September 16 and 17, t he Desk began  
repurchase (repo)  operations  to help  stabilize money markets  and keep the 
effective federal funds rate with in the target range.  The left panel of f igure 1  
displays the overnight and  cumulative term repo outstanding from  September 17 , 
the first day that operations took place, through September quarter-end .  The 
Desk offered daily , overnight repos for an aggregate amount of at least 
$75 billion  with a minimum bid rate equal to the interest on excess reserves 
(IOER) rate.  In addition to overnight repo operations, the Desk offered three 
two -week term operations  covering the September quarter- end on 
September 24, 26, and 27 for an aggregate operation limit of $30 billion, 
$60 billion, and $60  billion, respectively.1 
The right panel of figure 1  describes the overall dealer demand for the Desk’s 
repo operations by display ing the bid -to-cover ratio, defined as the total amount 
submitted to the operation divided by the total amount made available by the 
Desk.  A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the operation was oversubscribed, 
while a ratio less than 1 indicates th at primary dealers bid less in total than the 
amount made available.  The majority of term and overnight repo operations 
were oversubscribed through September 26.  By September 27,  three days 
before the quarter- end date, dealers had positioned themselves by participating 
in the term operations and reducing their overnight repo borrowing in the 
Treasury triparty general collateral repo market  (henceforth referred to as 
“triparty repo”).  Since quarter- end, overnight operations were undersubscribed, 
indicatin g less demand for overnight funding  than in mid -September (not 
shown) . 
 
  
 
  
                                                 
1 The Desk will conduct overnight and term repo operations at least through January of 
next year.  Term repo operations will generally be conducted twice per week, initially in an 
offering amount of at least $35 billion per operation.  Overnight repo operations will be 
conducted daily, initially in an offering amount of at least $75 billion per operation.

igure 1:  Repo Operations by Maturity and Bid -to-Cover Ratios  
O
n September 17, the Desk announced and conducted its first repo operation 
after most repo trading had ended in the triparty market.  While the operation 
reportedly improved market conditions, some funding pressures persisted.  
Subsequent operations were conducted earlier in the day.  P rimary dealers that 
participated in the September 17 Fed operation paid, on av erage, 5.16 percent  for 
funding  in the triparty repo market, 14  basis points  less than  nonprimary  dealers .  
On September 18, primary dealers still paid an average of 7 basis points less for funding in triparty repo than did nonprimary dealers, in compariso n with an 
average difference of 1 basis point over the previous six months.  By September 19 and all dates after, the repo operation rate and the triparty repo 
market rate were essentially equal.

  communications reportedly did not  materially affect yields on l onger-term Treasury 
securities.     
Over the intermeeting period as a whole, aggregate reserve bala nces declined to a 
post-2011 low of $1.37 trillion around t he time of the Septembe r FOMC meeting, but 
subsequent open market opera tions added, on average, about $150  billion in reserves.  
The fraction of surveyed banks w ith reserve balances falling ne ar or below their own 
reported lowest comfortable leve l of reserve balances reached a recent high of 31 percent 
on September 16.  With the subsequent increase in reserves, the  share has fallen back to 
its previous average range of around 15 to 20 percent.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households  
Information received over the intermeeting period suggests that financing 
conditions for businesses and households remained supportive of spending and economic 
activity  on balance.   
•Gross issuance of investment- and specul ative -grade corporate bonds was
strong in September, and new money institutional leveraged loan issuance was
solid.
•Growth  of C&I loans on banks’ books was modest in  the third quarter,
apparently reflecting a decline in borrower demand.  Banks reported  in the
October 2019 SLOOS that borrower demand for C&I loans weakened overthe same period , while lending standards on C&I loans were about unchanged.
•CMBS issuance in  September was strong, in part supported by recent declines
in interest rates.  Bank s’ CRE loan growth was moderate, and banks reported
tighter lending standards for all types of CRE loans.
•Home mortgage interest rates declined by 11 basis points over theintermeeting period .  Home-purchase originations remained at solid  levels  in
August, and refinancing originations jumped in September to  a multiyear high
volume.
•Consumer credit conditions remained generally supportive of spending.However, in the c redit card market, supply conditions continued to be tight for
nonprime borrowers .
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Businesses 
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative on balance.  
Gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds was strong in September .  Over the intermeeting period, yields on corporate bonds were slightly lower 
and remain near historical lows, while corporate bond spreads were, in general , little 
changed on net .

  New money institutional leveraged loan issuance in September  was solid but 
slightly below 2019 monthly averages, with the majority of issuance driven by 
acquisition activity.  Interest rate spreads for newly issued, high er-rated institutional 
loans were roughly unchanged, while spreads for lower -rated loans increas ed slightly.    
Growth of C&I loans on banks’ books was modest in the third quarter as a whole, 
pulled down by a decline  in loans outstanding in September.   In the October SLOOS , 
banks reported that borrower demand weakened for C&I loans over the third quarter, while  lending standards on C&I loans were reported to be basically unchanged , on 
balance, and remained near the easier end of the range of standards that have prevailed since 2005. 
 Gross equity issuance th rough both initial and seasoned offerings picked up to a 
strong pace in September.  S trong initial public offerings activity in September more than 
offset very low activity in August, leading to issuance in the third quarter in line with the 
average pace i n recent years.   
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations has deteriorated slightly  in recent 
months but remained  solid  overall .  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond 
downgrades somewhat outpaced that of upgrades in September, and the KMV expected year-ahead default rate stay ed within a narrow r ange  and stands near the midpoint of its 
historical distribution.   The third- quarter earnings -reporting  season  began this period, and 
private- sector analysts’ projections adjusted for seasonal effects suggest that earnings per 
share grew robustly in the third quarter but will remain fairly flat in coming quarters.   
Small Businesses  
Loan volumes to small businesses have fallen, and originations in August  ticked 
down to slightly below their levels at this time last year .  The decline in originations 
appeared to be largely due to demand factors , with s urvey evidence indicat ing that small 
business optimism ticked down in September and is well below levels from a year ago.  
Meanwhile, c redit supply to small businesses was little changed and remained relatively 
accommodative, with respondents to the October 2019 SLOOS reporting li ttle change, on 
net, in standards on loans to small businesses in the previous three months.  Indicators of 
recent loan performance remained strong .

Information received over the intermeeting period suggests that f inancing 
conditions were little changed , on balance,  and remained generally accommodative for

supported by recent declines in interest rates.  CMBS spreads widened slightly over the

Growth of CRE loan s on banks’ books was little changed  in the third quarter.  T he 
October SLOOS banks reported tighter lending standards for all types of CRE loans, while they reported weaker  demand for construction lending and stronger demand for the 
remaining CRE lending categories . 
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative on 
balance.  Gross issuance of municipal bonds was strong in September, with new capital 
raising accounting for  the majority  of the issuance.  Municipal bond yields in both the 
secondary and primary markets declined  somewhat more than long- term Treasury yields .  
The credit quality of general obligation bonds has improved in recent months, with the number of credit rating upgrades continuing to outpace that of downgrades .  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate 
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed, on 
balance,  over the intermeeting period.  Home  mortgage interest rates moved down 
11 basis points s ince the September FOMC meeting , roughly in line with yields on 
agency MBS and 10- year Treasury securities .  Since their recent peak last November, 
mortgage rates  have fallen about 140 basis points and now stand near their lowest level 
since mid -2016.  The volume of home mortgage originations  ticked down in August but 
remained near their solid  2017 levels, while r efinancing originations jumped in 
September to their  highest level since late 2012.  Mortgage credit standards—as 
measured by staff estimates of lenders’ maximum available debt- to-income ratios —were 
little changed at somewhat tighter levels than in the early 2000s.

In the October SLOOS, banks reported tighter credit standards for agency and 
non-agency mortgages over the third quarter, while in the Fannie Mae Mortgage Lender 
Sentiment Survey, nonbank l enders reported a bit tighter  credit standards for agency 
mortgages but looser credit standards for non- agency mortgages .1  
Consumer Credit 
Overall consumer credit rose at a moderate pace through August, as financing 
conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally supportive of growth in 
consumer spending.  Interest rates on auto loans have fallen , on net, since the beginning 
of the year—stimulating the demand for credit—and banks in the October SLOOS 
report ed easing their standards on auto loans in recent months.  I nterest rates on new 
credit card offers and rates on existing credit ca rd accounts , on balance, leveled off 
through August, while  supply conditions continued to be tight for nonprime credit card 
borrowers.  Indicators of changes in underwriting standards for these borrowers in recent 
quarters have been  mixed, with banks’ responses in the October SLOOS pointing to 
further tightening and the Mintel mail offerings, among other data sources, pointing to 
little change or gradual easing.  
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL  CONDITIONS INDEXES
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial 
corporations indicates that financing conditions are roughly unchanged and  remain 
accommodative relative to historical standards , as equity prices and corporate bond 
spreads were little changed over the intermeeting period .  As shown in the appendix to 
this Tealbook section, the average reading of other publicly available financial conditio ns 
indexes , which  aggregate a large set of financial variables into  a summary series, also 
points to roughly unchanged financial co nditions.  Overall , these indexes indicate that 
broad financial conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical standards. 
1 The Fannie Mae Mortgage Lender Sentiment Survey, whose framework is similar to that of the 
SLOOS,  reports changes in credit standards among nonbanks that are approved to sell loans to Fannie Mae.

Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes 
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes.”

The first index in the table, the staff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative- grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.  
The second index in the table  measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending 
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices .  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.
2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both  changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy. 
1 This index was first discussed in the box “Financial Conditions Indexes” in the Financing Conditions for 
Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.  
2 This index is an updated version of the  index developed in  William  F. Bassett, Mary Beth Chosak,      
John C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,” 
Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 62 (March) , pp. 23 –40.  The current index uses a new weighting approach for 
each loan category .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS  
We assess the risks around our baseline projection for GDP to be tilted to the downside, 
both over the next year and further out, and we see a corresponding upward skew for the 
unemployment rate.  Among the most salient risks, trade policies and foreign economic developments seem more likely to move in directions that would create a significant drag on 
domestic activity than to resolve more favorably than assumed.  In addition, the softness in 
business investment and manufacturing production so far this year could be pointing to a more substantial slowing in economic growth than we currently recognize.  Among risks to the upside, many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain solid , and financial conditions remain favorable.  In these circumstances, spending could expand 
at a pac e that is faster than in the staff projection.  Although we view the current circumstances 
as quite uncertain, we judge the overall degree of uncertainty as being broadly in line with the 
average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC); not ably,  that period includes 
the most recent two recessions along with a number of other episodes with elevated uncertainty 
and market volatility.  
 
Recession risks appear to have fallen since the September Tealbook.  As shown in the 
bottom table of the “Ass essment of Key Macroeconomic Risks” exhibit, the estimated 
probability of moving into recession over the next year based on a term- spread model has fallen 
to 57 percen t.  This estimate should be interpreted with some caution given the long sample 
period over which the model is estimated and secular trends —particularly declining term 
premiums —that may materially affect its predictions.   The recession probability estimate from a 
model-averaging framework that uses a selection of both real and financial variab les is 
22 percent , compared with 45 percent in the September Tealbook, and is about the same as  the 
unconditional probability .  The rise in the term spread  is an important factor behind the decline 
in the recession risk for both models.  In addition, the model-averaging framework takes positive 
signal from  the strength in housing permits.

 The exhibits on the next two pages provide alternative perspectives on the chance of an 
adverse outcome in the period ahead.  According to t he exhibit “Time -Varying Ma croeconomic 
Risk 1 Year Ahead ,” the risks to the Tealbook forecast over the next four quarters do not appear 
particularly wide or skewed.  In contrast, the exhibit “Conditional Distributions of 
Macro economic Variables 2 Years Ahead ” shows that, at the two-year horizon, the risks are 
skewed to the downside for GDP growth and to the upside for the unemployment rate.  In part, 
these difference s reflect the differing horizons , with the asymmetries associated with recessions 
becoming more prominent at longer horizons as the consequences of adverse shocks accumulate.  Just as important, the empirical model underlying the two -year exhibit includes a term -spread -
based recession probability as an input, and so this distribution inherits important features of that 
recession probability model.   
As indicated in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the estimate d 
probability of returning to the effective lower bound ( ELB ) over the next three years  has moved 
up to 25 percent , consistent with the lower path for the federal funds rate.  The probability rises 
to 38 percent by the end of the medium term.  A return of the federal funds rate to the ELB may 
leave monetary policy with less capacity to offset significant negative econ omic shocks than 
positive ones, contributing to the downside skew in economic outcomes.   
With regard to inflation, we view  the risks to the projection as slanted to the downside—
in part because of the downside risks to economic activity.  Moreover, inflation has been running low over the past year, and longer-run inflation expectations could currently be lower than we 
recognize.  Also, the exchange value of the dollar could appreciate more than expected and put downward pressure on inflation.  T here are al so risks to the upside.  For example, an extended 
period with unusually tight resource utilization could lead to greater upward pressure on wages and prices,
 consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of resource 
utilization  on inflation, a possibility we consider in the a lternative scenarios that follow.  In 
addition, further increase s in trade barriers could lead to temporarily higher inflation.     
All of these inflation risks would tend to be of modest size as long as inflation 
expectations remained reasonably well anchored.  However, the risks could increase substantially in either direction if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such 
movements in expectations could induce changes in inflation to build on themselves and thus 
lead inflation to deviate significantly and persistently from 2 percent.   Notwithstanding these 
concerns , the overall degree of uncertainty is probably about the same as over the past 20 years.

Our view of the risks to the economic outlook is informed by the staff’s latest 
quantitative surveillance assessment, where the staff continues to judge overall financial 
vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to be at a moderate level.  Asset valuation pressures are at notable levels,  primarily in riskier segments of corporate debt and commercial real estate 
markets.  Additionally, borrowing by nonfinancial businesses, as a ratio to nominal GDP, has remained elevated amid continued indications of weak loan underwriting in leveraged loan markets.  These vulnerabilities are counterbalanced by favorable conditions elsewhere.  Household-sector borrowing remains moderate relative to the size of the economy , and 
underwriting standards in this sector are generally strong.  In addition, the largest U.S. banks continue to have strong capital positions—although their plans to inc rease leverage point to the 
potential for a decline in resilience, especially if economic growth were to weaken sharply.  Putting these factors together, current financial vulnerabilities do not appear likely to magnify  
shocks to an unusual degree through strains within the financial sector, although a deterioration in the balance sheet of the nonfinancial corporate sector could amplify shocks from both domestic and foreign developments. 
ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS  
To illustrate  some of the risks to the outlook, we construct alternatives to t he baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.1

2018.2  By our assessment , trade tensions have played a significant role in this slowdown, as 
have idiosyncratic  developments  in specific economies.3  In our baseline,  these factors fade, and

trade, manufacturing, and investment pick up.  However , recent surveys of business attitudes and 
intentions—not only in the United States, but also globally—continue to flag concerns about 
trade policy, and measures of trade policy uncertainty remain elevated .  More generally, the 
sources of the global manufacturing slump may be greater and more persistent than we envision 
in the baseline projection, eventually generating negative spillovers to the service sector  and 
ultimately triggering a sharp declin e in global GDP growth. 
In this scenario, we assume that the unprecedented increase in trade policy uncertainty 
that has accumulated over the past year causes a deep  and persistent slowdown in economic 
activity.  A s firms in the United States and abroad limit investment because of these 
uncertainties , the resulting lower capital accumulation reduces labor productivity, and business 
and consumer confidence is depressed.4  The resulting downturn is particularly severe in Europe, 
where limited monetary policy space result s in a sharpe r downturn than in the United States .  
Concerns about the global outlook cause flight- to-safety flows into dollar- denominated assets, 
contributing to a 5  percent appreciation of the dollar.  All told, the level of foreign GDP is 
1.9 percent below the baseline through 2021. 
Weaker aggregate demand in the United States and abroad and the stronger dollar cause a 
substantial slowdown in U.S. economic activity.  In particular, GDP barely rises  in 2020, and the 
unemployment rate reaches  4.2 percent in 2021.  Core PCE inflation remains below the baseline 
over the forecast horizon.  The federal funds rate falls to 1.3  percent in 2021, about 1 percentage 
point below the baseline path.5  
No-Deal Brexit [SIGMA model ] 
Brexit developments have been front and center over the intermeeting period.  On 
October 17, the U.K . government  and the European Union (EU) announced an agreement on the 
draft of a revised  Brexit deal , significantly lowering the possibility of a no- deal Brexit on 
October 31.  Tha t said, t he deal  still requires approval by the U.K. P arliament.  At  the time of 
this writing, i t is uncertain whether the U.K. P arliament will ratify the deal.  I f it does not, the 
United Kingdom and the EU will still need to agree to a third Brexit exten sion to avoid a no- deal 
Brexit at the end of the month.  And, if an extension is granted, that does not rule out a no- deal

 Brexit at a later date.   In particular , Prime M inister  Johnson will likely push for general elections 
if the Brexit date is extended , and a victory could bolster his case to take the United Kingdom 
out of the EU without a deal.  Therefore, a no-deal Brexit remains a risk to our baseline, though 
with a lower probability than in the previous Tealbook. 
To assess the implications of this risk, in this scenario, we assume that the United 
Kingdom leaves the EU  around the turn of the year without a deal, creating a range of 
disruptions, including interruptions to international trade due to the introduction of customs and regulatory checks and i ncreased financial costs due to the loss of financial passporting for U.K. 
firms.   Financial conditions in the United Kingdom and, to a lesser extent, in the rest of Europe 
tighten while household and business confidence deteriorate.  All told, the levels of U.K. and euro-area GDP decline 1.2 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, by the end of 2021.  F light-to-
safety flows into dollar- denominated assets  cause the dollar to appreciate 3 percent and global 
equity prices to decline 3 percent . 
Weaker foreign activity, the stronger dollar, and some tightening of U.S. financial 
conditions lead U.S. GDP growth to moderate to 1.6 percent in 2020, 0.4 percentage point below the baseline.  The U.S. unemployment rate r ises 0.2 percentage point above the baseline over the 
forecast period.  Core PCE inflation runs at 1.7 percent in 2020 and 2021.  T he path for the 
federal funds rate is about 30 basis points below the baseline.
6 
The relatively modest effect  of a no- deal Brexit in th is scenario —compared with other, 
more pessimistic assessments of a no -deal Brexit being bandied about—is  predicated on the 
assumption that the safeguards European governments and financial institutions have put in place since the 2016 Brexit referendum will be  effective in containing most econ omic and financial 
disruptions and that financial markets have by now priced in  much of this event.  However, given 
the unprecedented nature of Brexit, more -adverse outcomes are entirely possible.   
Recession [DGS  model] 
The softness in business investment and manufacturing indicators so  far this year and the 
recent flatness in the yield curve could be pointing to a substantial deterioration in economic activity ; for example, the term -spread model noted earlier indicate s that the probability of a 
recession over the next year is above average.  Moreover, leverage in the nonfinancial business

coefficient of 1.0 on the output gap.

 sector is elevated.  In this scenario, we assume a recession start s in the middle of next year and is 
amplified by the high levels of business indebtedness, which lead firms to reduc e hiring and 
investment by more than they would if their debt were lower.   We also assume that monetary 
policymakers aggressively respond to the sharp and sustained increase in the unemployment rate 
in a manner consistent with the FOMC’s typical reaction in previous recessions. 
GDP contracts in  mid-2020, and the four-quarter change in GDP turns negative in early  
2021.  The federal funds rate drops sharply but becomes constrained by the ELB in the last 
quarter  of 2020, thereby prolonging the downturn in the assumed absence of unconventional 
monetary policy actions .  GDP only begins to recover in 2022, and the unemployment rate peaks 
at 6.3 percent, an increase of 2.6 percentage points from the start of the recession .7  With 
substantial slack in resource utilization, inflation falls to 1.4 percent in 2020.  
Recession with Lower Interest Rate Sensitivity [DGS model ] 
There has always been a great deal of uncertainty about the responsive ness of  the 
economy to interest rates, and the current situation is no different.  For example, some recent 
research  suggest s that the economy is currently less sensitive to further monetary stimulus after 
many years of low interest rates.8  In this scenario, we assume the recession considered in the 
previous scenario takes place in an environment where the economy is less sensitive to policy 
stimulus.   As before,  we assume that monetary policymakers  respond to the sharp and sustained 
increase in the unemployment rate in  a manner consistent with the FOMC’s typical reaction in 
previous recessions. 
GDP starts to fall  in mid -2020.  However, with the lower interest sensitivity, monetary 
policy is even less able to stabilize the economy  than in the previous scenario.  Accordin gly, the 
                                                           
7 If the ELB  on nominal interest rates w ere not a constraint, the  policy rate would fall to negative 
1.1 percent, which would shave 1.4  percentage points off the increase in the unemployment rate.  Altern atively, 
unconventional monetary policy actions could potentially achieve that same amount of easing .

 decline in GDP is more ac ute, and unemployment peaks at 7.3 percent, 1 percentag e point higher 
than in the case with  a baseline interest rate sensitivity .9  Given the ample amount of slack in the 
labor market , inflation falls to 1.3 percent in 2020.  With weaker economic activity and  lower 
inflation, the federal funds rate is  at the ELB for a longer period than in the previous scenario.  
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate [SW  model ] 
While the staff assumes that the long-run equilibrium r eal federal funds rate has declined  
over the past two decades, some estimates suggest it may be even lower than currently assumed .  
Competing explanations for the decline in the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate have 
different implications for the baseline projection.   In this scenario, we posit that struc tural 
productivity growth is 0.5 percent age point below the baseline over the projection period, which, 
according to the Smets -Wouters model we use for this scenario, will result in a 70 basis point 
decline in the equilibrium real interest rate.   We also assume that policymakers only gradually 
recognize that the long -run equilibrium federal funds rate is lower.10 
The initial effects of the assumed productivity slowdown are fairly benign.  Because 
businesses are less productive, they have to hire more workers to meet demand, and  the 
unemployment rate declines to 3.4 percent by  the end of 2021.  The fall in productivity growth 
also puts upward pressure on firms’ marginal costs, and inflation is slightly above the baseline; it 
averages 2 percent in 2020 and 1.9 percent in 2021.  Eventually, however, the higher prices begin to crimp demand , and GDP growth slows to 1.7 percent in 2021 and 1. 6 percent in  2022.  
The unemployment rate remains below the baseline, but wages are lower.  Despite the 70 basis 
point decline in the long-run equilibrium federal funds rate, t he federal funds rate path is only 
25 basis points below the baseline in 2022, both because policymakers do not yet fully recognize 
the tightness of their policy stance  and because inflation is higher and the unemployment ra te 
lower than in the baseline.  
By 2025, GDP growth is 0.5 percentage point below the baseline and monetary 
policymakers have fully learned about the lower real long-run equilibrium rate.  However, both 
inflation and the output gap have not yet returned to the baseline.  Because of this drawn-out 
adjustment process, the federal funds rate is still 45  basis points above its long-run value at that 
                                                           
9 If the ELB  on nominal interest rates w ere not a co nstraint, the  policy rate would fall to negative 
1.4 percent, which would shave 2.3  percentage points off the increase in the unemployment rate.  
10 In the current and two remaining scenarios, the federal funds rate is governed by the baseline policy rule.  
In this scenario, the intercept in the baseline rule moves gradually as policymakers learn about the new value of the 
long-run equilibrium real rate.

 time.  In the longer run, the economy converges to its new less -favorable steady state, where 
households have a lower standard of living and policymakers have less space to ease in the event 
of an adverse shock.  
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US model ] 
Many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending remain solid, including 
strong labor market cond itions , low interest rates , and high levels of net wealth.  Moreover, it is 
possible that the recent weakness in business investment, which can be quite volatile from quarter to quarter, will turn out to be more transitory than projected .  In this scenario, we assume 
that consumer spending and, in turn, investment expand at a faster pace than in the baseline.  We also assume that these favorable conditions result in a larger cyclical improvement in labor force 
participation than is  typical , which attenuates somewhat the decline in the unemployment rate . 
Under these assumptions, GDP increases 2.8 percent , on average, in 2019 and 2020, a 
pace comparable with that in 2017 and 2018, and the unemployment rate declines to 2.8 percent 
by the middle  of 2022.  Inflati on increases slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2025.  In response to 
the stronger economy, and with inflation little changed, the federal funds rate rises relative to the 
baseline, reaching 3  percent in 2024.  
Steeper Phillips Curve with More -Sensitive Inflation Expectations [FRB/US model ] 
The extended period of low unemployment assumed in the baseline could cause inflation 
to rise faster than projected .  In particular, s ome research suggests that the wage Phillips curve 
may be steepe r whe n the labor market is very tight.11  Moreover, past episodes of elevated 
inflation have been associated with a heightened sensitivity of longer-run inflation expectations to realized inflation.   This scenario captures these risks by boosting the response of wages to 
tight labor utilization and by  assuming that longer -run inflation expectations become more

sensitive to realized price inflation.12  The se two assumptions interact to produce a marked 
increase in price inflation.  
In
flation reaches 2.9 percent by the end of 2022, compared with 1.8 percent in the 
baseline.13  In response to the higher path of inflation, the federal funds rate increases  more  
steeply  and is  3.3 percent at the end of 2022.  As a result, GDP rises a bit more s lowly, and the 
unemployment rate is slightly above the baseline.  
ALTERNATIVE MODEL  FORECASTS
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, the FRB/US model projects GDP 
growth to slow from 2.1 percent in 2019 to 1.5 percent per year , on average, in the next three 
years —a modestly weaker path than in the Tealbook baseline.14  The projected deceleration in 
GDP mainly reflects both consumption and business investment growth continuing to move 
down from what the model perceives as unusually strong readings in 2017 and 2018.  In the case of consumption, the model could not explain those earlier positive surprises based on fundamentals (wealth and income) and , hence, does not carry that strength forward in the 
projection; instead, it has consumption rising at a rate closer to the model’s trend.  The model’s 
assessment that asset prices (equity and property wealth) are currently above normal valuations 
and thus will fall or decelerate over the next year also contributes to the weakening in consumption growth through the wealth channel.  Marked negative contributions from net exports also weigh on the model’s forecast of GDP growth.  Given a projection of output growing somewhat below th e pace of potential growth , the output gap declines from the model’s 
current estimate of 1 .5 percent to 0.3 percent  at the end of 2022.  T he unemployment rate rises to 
4.5 percent at the end of 2022, slightly below  the model’s estimate of the natural rate of 
4.7 percent.  Core inflation increases from 1.8 percent in 2019 to 2.0 percent, on average, over the next three years.  
12 In the calibration of this scenario, we assume that  both the slope of the wage Phillips curve  and the 
sensitivity o f long- run inflation expectations to realized inflation  are four times larger than in the current version of 
the FRB/US model.  The magnitude of the se increase s reflects a comparison between estimates of the recent past 
and those from a sample that covers the late 1980s to the late 1990s.  Nevertheless, the magnitudes of the 
coefficients used in this scenario are well below those characterizing inflation dynamics in the 1970s.  
13 With a steeper Phillips curve, but no increase in the sensitivity of inflation expectations, inflation would 
average 2.4 percent in 2022.  
14 The FRB/US forecast is conditioned on the staff projection s for federal government spending and tax 
policies , foreign GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar and oil price s.  The federal funds 
rate is governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline.  The model forecast starts in the fourth quarter of this year, taking as given key macroeconomic variables from the judgmental forecast for the third  quarter.

The EDO model projects GDP growth to fall to 1.9 percent, on average, over the next 
three years, about the same as the Tealbook projection and 0.3 percentage point below growth in 
potential output.  Favorable risk premiums and accommodative monetary policy have been boosting the level of aggregate demand over the p ast few years .  The waning support from those 
factors causes growth to fall below potential growth .   
The EDO model predicts that core inflation  will accelerate to 2. 6 percent in 2020 and 
remain above the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the following  two years.  From the model’ s 
perspective, inflation has been held down by persistently low wage growth, which has been 
surprisingly weak given the strength of aggregate demand.  In the forecast, the model predicts 
wage growth to step up, causing inflation to rise.  Over the medium term , inflation remains 
above the FOMC’s 2 percent objective due to the previously mentioned supportive aggregate demand conditions as well as  negative shocks to productivity.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes  with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projecti on.  The staff’s current outlook for economic activity  
and inflation is little changed, on balance, from the projection in the September Tealbook.  
As a consequence, the policy prescriptions described below are close  to those in the 
previous Tealbook.   
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED  SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the inertial version of the Taylor  (1999)  rule, 
the Taylor  (1993) rule, a first -difference rule, and  a flexible price -level targeting  (FPLT ) 
rule.1  These near-term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for 
the output gap and core inflation , which are shown in the middle panels .2  The top and 
middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate . 
 The near-term prescriptions of the policy rules are little changed from  those in 
the September  Tealbook . 
 The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule prescribe s higher  policy rates than the 
Tealbook baseline  in the next two quarters .  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
also calls for a  larger increase  in the policy rate next quarter  because this 
policy rule responds more strongly to the positive output gap than the 
conditional attenuated rule used in the Tealbook baseline projection.  
 The Taylor  (1993) rule, which do es not feature an interest rate  smoothing 
term, calls for  higher  policy r ates than all of the other simple policy  rules and 
the Tealbook baseline  projection . 
                                                 
1 The appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on the se simple policy rules .  
Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined herein use 
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50  basis points in the longer run.  
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap between the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection for the output gap.

    1. The lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for
inflation and resource slack. Rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable are conditional on thecurrent−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
    2. The "FRB/US r*" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning in the
current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period given either the
Tealbook or SEP−consistent projection. The SEP−consistent baseline corresponds to the September 2019 median SEP
responses. The "Average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook and SEP−consistent baseline
projections over the same 12−quarter period as FRB/US r *.

 The first -difference rule , which responds to the expected change  in the output
gap, prescribes a fairly  flat policy rate path in the near term  because resource
utilization increases only slightly  over the next year in the staff projection.
The FPLT rule  calls for holding the federal funds rate well below the other
rules  in an effort to eliminate a cumulative shortfall in the core PCE price
index of 2¾ percent  since the end of 2011 .
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM  REAL  FEDERAL
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium -term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*) generated under two baselines:  the 
Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians in the September  
2019  SEP.3  This concept of r*, labeled “FRB/US r*,” corresponds to the level of the real 
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period starting in the current 
quarter , would bring the output gap to zero in the final quarter of that period  in the 
FRB/US model .  This measure is a summary of the projected underlying strength of the 
real economy and does not take into account considerations such as achieving the 
inflation objective or avoiding sha rp changes in the federal funds  rate. 
At 1. 28 percent, t he current value of the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* is
about 1 0 basis points lower than the value consistent with the September
Tealbook  projection .  The small downward revision indicates that, through the
lens of FRB/US r*, the outlook  for real activity  has slightly weakened.
Though the staff forecast modestly higher levels of resource utilization
relative to the September Tealbook, in the FRB/US model this increase can be
more than accounted for by the lower path for the federal funds rate under the
staff’s conditionally attenuated interest rate rule.
At 0. 33 percent, the September  2019 SEP -consistent FRB/US r* is lower than
the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* because, even though the two projections
3 To construct a bas eline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2022  (the 
final year reported in the September 2019 SEP), the economy transitions to  the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap from the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

 contain  similar policy rate paths, the staff’ s outlook for the level of resource 
utilization over the coming years is higher than that associated with the 
September SEP.  The SEP-consistent FRB/US r* is about ¼  percentage point 
less than the corresponding value under the June 2019 SEP baseline  (not 
shown)  because the projected appropriate path for the federal funds rate 
shifted downward , while the outlook for re source slack  was little changed.  
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline projection and results from 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, the 
Taylor  (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect 
the endogenous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different f ederal 
funds rate paths implied by the policy rules.  The simulations for each rule are carried out 
under the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and 
that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that 
monetary policy will follow through on this commitment and are aware of the 
implications for interest rates and the economy.   
 Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook 
baseline , the federal funds  rate edge s up from its current level gradually, 
reaching almost  2½ percent by the end of  2022.4   
 The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as 
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the positive output 
gap, calls for the federal funds  rate to increase at a faster pace and then plateau 
at about 3  percent beginning in 2021 .  This federal funds rate path is above the 
Tealbook baseline path over the entire simulation period shown .  These less 
accommodative monetary conditions result in an unemployment rate path that 
rises more quickly than the Tealbook baseline path .  Under this rule , inflation 
                                                 
4  In the staff’s construction of the baseline forecast for the federal funds rate, the level of the 
federal funds rate in the current quarter is a weighted average of the q uarter -to-date realized values and 
expected values, inferred from financial market quotes, over the remainder of the quarter.  Thereafter, the 
conditionally attenuated rule is used to project the path of the federal funds rate.  By contrast, the 
prescripti ons of the other simple policy rules here are derived from simulations that begin in the 
current  quarter.

 is lower  and the real 10 -year Treasury yield is higher  than the corresponding 
values in the Tealbook  baseline  projection . 
 Because the Taylor  (1993) rule  has no interest rate  smoothing term , it calls for 
increas ing the federal funds  rate quickly, reaching  above  3 percent by early 
2020 .  Thereafter, the federal funds rate falls somewhat, though the prescribed 
path remains  above the corresponding path  of the Tealbook baseline  rule 
through 2024 .  
 The first-difference rule , which  reacts to the expected change in the output 
gap rather than its level, calls f or a roughly  flat path for the federal funds rate 
through  the middle of the next decade .  Starting in the middle of 2023 , the 
path for the federal funds rate runs below  the one in the Tealbook baseline for 
an extended period.  Because of the forward -looking nature of financial 
market participants, price setters, and wage setters , this strategy generates —
even in the early years of the simulation —higher  inflation  and, eventually,  a 
lower unemployment rate than  in the staff projection .   
 The FPLT rule responds to , and seeks to eliminate,  the cumulative  shortfall of 
the level of core PCE prices  from  a target path defined by the growth of  that 
price level at an annual rate of 2  percen t from the end of 2011 onward .  
Eliminating the current 2¾ percent shortfall re quires inflation to run above 
2 percent in c oming years.   Because the simulation embeds the assumptions 
that policymakers can credibly commit to closing this gap over time and that 
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly 
anticipate the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate, the path of the 
real 10 -year Treasury rate  immediately  drops to about negative 0.75 percent 
and remains below the corresponding Tealbook baseline path throughout the 
period shown .  The unemployment rate is substantially lower under the FPLT 
rule than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping below  
3 percent  in late 202 2.  Inflation ex ceeds 2  percent by about 20 basis points , 
on average, from 2021 through 2024 . 
 The policy rate  prescriptions from all the  simple policy rules are very similar 
to those in the September  Tealbook , as the outlook for real activity is little 
changed since then .

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core
inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

 OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control  simulations conditional on the  Tealbook 
baseline under two different assumptions about policymakers’ preferences, as captured 
by alternative specifications of the loss function.5  The concept of optimal control 
employed here is one in which  current policymakers are able to commit futur e 
policymakers to th eir plans; such a commitment, when feasible, may  lead to improve d 
economic outcomes .6 
 The simulation labeled “Equal weights” presents the case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation cl ose to the Committee’s objective of 2  percent, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close  to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on keeping the federal funds rate close to its previous 
value.  Under this strategy, the federal funds ra te runs significantly higher than 
the Tealbook baseline path , reaching  a peak of  about 4½ percent  in 2022 .  
This strategy is designed to counter the projected persistent undershooting by 
the unemployment  rate of its natural rate that occurs in the Tealbook 
baseline —an outcome that policymakers with the equal -weights loss function 
judge to be undesirable.  The less negative  unemployment gap implies  only a 
modestly lower path of inflation because , in the FRB /US model, the response 
of inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.  
 The simulation labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap ” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural 
rate when the unemploym ent rate is below the natural rate , but is otherwise 
identical to the specification with equal weights.  Under this strategy, the path 
for the federal funds rate is essen tially flat —slightly below the current 
Tealbook baseline path —over much of the simulat ion.  Policymakers choose 
this modestly  more accommodative path for the policy rate because their 
desire to keep inflation close to 2 percent is not tempered by an aversion to the 
                                                 
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these specifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.  
6 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as cre dible by wage and price setters and by financial market participants.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control
and the Loss Function" in the June 2016 Tealbook B for a motivation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

 unemployment rate falling below its natural rate.  The tighter labor market 
pushes inflation more promptly toward 2 percent than under the baseline .  
Because the outlook in the October Tealbook is little changed  from
September , the federal  funds rate prescriptions from  the equal -weight s and
asymmetric specifications conditional on the current Tealbook  projection  are
similar to corresponding prescriptions based on the September  Tealbook.
The current  Tealbook optimal control policy prescriptions under the equal -
weights loss function are well above the corresponding prescriptions us ing a
baseline consistent with the September 2019 SEP  (not shown) .  The main
reason for this difference is that unemployment gaps in the SEP -consistent
baseline are about half as large as those in the Tealbook baseline.  Hence, the
federal funds rate does not need to rise as much under the SEP baseline to
close those gaps.   Conversely, t he policy rate prescriptions under the
asymmetric loss function —which does not seek to offset undershooting of
unemployment from its natural rate —using current  Tealbook proj ections are
more similar to those derived using the SEP -consistent baseline.
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the  
policy rules shown in the exhibit “Simple Policy Rule Simulations ” and optimal control 
simulat ions shown in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment. ”

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption  that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications  of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on p olicies under commitment, optimal control policies can more 
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model.  
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives.  
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the 
Tealbook baseline projection .1  𝑅𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy
1  In constructing the baseline projection, the level of the federal funds rate in the current quarter is 
a weighted average of the quarter -to-date realized values and  expe cted values, inferr ed from financial 
market quotes , over the remainder of the quarter .  Thereafter, th e conditionally attenuated rule is used to 
project the path of the federal funds rate.  The box “A New Conditional Baseline Policy Rule” in the

  for quarter  t; for quarter s prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑡 corresponds to the 
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand -side variables of the first four rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE price inflatio n for the current 
quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡+3|𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter -ahead an nual change in the output gap 
(𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡+3|𝑡−𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝐿𝑅, 
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price -level targeting rule , the right -hand -side variables 
include an unemployment rate gap  and a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is d efined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑡∗, 
which currently stands at 4. 6 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference  
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑝𝑡, and the log of the target price -level path, 𝑝𝑡∗.  The 
2011:Q4 value of 𝑝𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently, 
𝑝𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.  
Simple Rules  
 
The first rule  in the table was studied by Taylor (1993 ).  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time  compared with the 
Taylor (1993) rule .  The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap , like the 
FPLT  rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .2  The conditional 
attenuate d rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but responds less strongly to 
the output gap.  Where applicable, t he intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝐿𝑅, are constant 
and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n 
equilibrium  real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides  (2003).  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “ Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections  for inflation and the output gap.  When the

  Tealbook is published earl y in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarter s.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand -side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
To isolate the effects of changes in macroeconomic proj ections on the prescriptions of these

A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimate s of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate  that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median responses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12 -quarter period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period , given either th e Tealbook or the SEP -
consistent economic projection .  This measure  depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of which take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables .3  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR -based 
expectations —that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of future 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook b aseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding  average s of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP -consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as th e Tealbook -consistent and SEP -consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal funds rate s and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period , whereas , in the economic projection,  the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and  wage setters form  model -consistent expectations  and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s

 large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a qua rter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.  
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit tha t policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝑡𝑃𝐶𝐸, and the Committee’s
2 percent objective), squ ared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡, measured as the difference between
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the as sumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor , 𝛽=0.9963 : 
𝑳𝒕=∑ 𝜷𝝉𝑇
𝝉=𝟎{𝜆𝜋 (𝜋𝑡+𝜏𝑃𝐶𝐸−𝜋𝐿𝑅)𝟐+𝜆𝑢,𝑡+𝜏(𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡+𝜏)𝟐+𝜆𝑅(𝑅𝑡+𝝉−𝑅𝑡+𝝉−𝟏)𝟐}. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment  gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B  provides motivations for the 
specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two 
specifications.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second  specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the same  weights as the 
equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate , but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The optimal control policy and associated outc omes depend on the relative (rather than the 
absolute) values of the weights.   
For each of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject 
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates .  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public  sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’  future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy 
decisions made prior to the simulation period.   Loss Functions

3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.
4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial
offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
