Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook 
The data released during this short intermeeting period continu e to suggest that 
economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate in the second half of this year.  
Growth has been slower than in the first half of the year, in p art because trade 
developments and concerns over gl obal economic prospects have w eighed more heavily 
on business investment and exports .  Household spending rose at  a strong clip through 
the third quarter, buoyed by solid j ob gains and income growth, although recent data 
indicate some deceleration in s pending this quarter.  Overall, we expect GDP growth to 
slow from 2.6 percent in the first half of the year to 1.7 perc ent in the second half.  
Although we continue to view the r isks to our projection as til ting to the downside, trade 
policy developments and a more favorable employment report sugg est that the downside 
risks have eased a bit.  
We expect economic activity to pick back up next year from its second-half pace 
but to decelerate modestly over th e medium term, mostly reflect ing the waning boost 
from fiscal policy.  We anticipate that already enacted tariff increases, uncertainty over 
future trade policy, and concerns over global growth will conti nue to restrain economic 
growth next year and, to a le sser extent, in 2021.  All told, G DP growth is projected to 
decline from 2.1 percent this ye ar and next to 1.7 percent in 2 022.  This projection is a 
touch stronger than in the October Tealbook, largely reflecting  a higher projected path for 
equity prices.  Accordingly, we  now project the labor market to  tighten just a little 
further, with the unemployment rate edging down to 3.5 percent next year and remaining 
there over the medium term. 
The available data on inflation s uggest that core PCE prices ro se 1.6 percent over 
the 12 months ending in October, a  bit higher than earlier this year but slightly lower than 
we expected in the October Teal book.  We expect core inflation to hold at this level 
through December and to move  up to 1.9 percent by the end of th e first quarter of next 
year.  Core PCE inflation is projected to remain near 1.9 perce nt over the medium term—
a pace that is slightly above our estimate of its underlying tr end—as the boost to inflation 
from high resource utilization is not completely offset by the drag on import prices from 
a rising dollar.  Total PCE price inflation is projected to run  below core infl ation this year 
and next owing to falling ener gy prices and then to move in lin e with core over the 
remainder of the medium term.

 Comparing the Staff Projection with Other Forecasts  
The staff’s projection for GDP grow th in 2019 is well aligned  with the projections from both the 
Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the B lue Chip consensus , but it is a few tenths of a 
percentage point higher than each  in 2020.   The staff’s unem ployment rate forecast is the same as 
the SPF and Blue Chip projections in 2019 , but it is 0.2 percentage point below them i n 2020.   
The staff’s forecast of headline  CPI inflation for 2019 is a little higher than the Blue Chip and SPF 
forecasts but well  aligned with them for 2020.  With regard to headline PCE price inflation, the staff 
projection is the same as the SPF consensus projec tion in 2019  but 0.2 percentage point below it in 
2020 .  The staff’s projection for core PCE price inflation is below the SPF forecast in 2019 and 2020.   
 
     Note:  SPF is the Survey of Professional Forecasters, CPI is the consumer price index, 
and PCE is personal consumption expenditures.  Blue Chip does not provide results for 
overall and core PCE price inflation.  The Blue Chip consensus forecast includ es input 
from  about 50  panelists, and the SPF about 40.  Roughly 20 panelists contribute to both 
surveys.

 Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP  
The FOMC most recently published its Summary of Economic Projections, or SEP, following 
the September  FOMC meeting.  The following table compares the staff’s current economic 
projection with the one we presented in the September  Tealbook.  
The current projection is very similar to that in the September Teabook.  In particular, our 
projection of slowing GDP growth and an unemp loyment rate that essentially moves 
sideways over the medium term remains the same.   
Looking more closely at the differences relative to September, i n the second half of this 
year —while both data  on GDP and the unemployment rate have c ome in close to what  we 
expected  in September —core PCE inflat ion has surprised us somewhat to the downside .  
Beyond this year, output growth is projected to be slightly stronger, the unemployment rate 
a touch lower , and core PCE inflation a bit higher than in the September  Tealbook.  
The federal funds rate assumed in our projection is revised lower in the near term to reflect 
the Committee’s recent decision s to lower the federal funds rate target , but that revision 
fades over time , as the  policy rule that we use in our baselin e projection calls for the funds 
rate to increase to about its assumed long -run value by the end of  2022.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS  
Although the news on trade developm ents has not led us to make any changes to 
our trade policy assumptions, sentiment in financial markets fluctuated in recent weeks 
amid varying reports about U.S.–China trade talks.  On net, dom estic equity prices are 
higher, but market-based expecta tions for U.S. monetary policy and yields on Treasury 
securities and corporate bonds are  little changed from the time  of the October Tealbook.  
All told, our projections for int erest rates and the dollar are very little revised, but the 
higher projected path for stock pr ices provides a little more i mpetus to aggregate demand 
in the current forecast.  
Monetary Policy  
The baseline policy rule calls f or the federal funds rate to mo ve up gradually
to 2.5 percent by the end of 2022.  Howe ver, this path starts f rom a lower
level than in the October Tealbook, reflecting  the FOMC’s decision at the
October meeting to lower the t arget range.  Term-premium-adjust ed market
quotes suggest that market partic ipants expect the federal fund s rate to move
up by roughly 25 basis points per year through the medium term,  a slightly
more gradual increase than implied by our baseline path.  (See the box “How
Sensitive Is the Economy to Interest Rates?” for a discussion o f the response
of the economy to changes i n the federal funds rate.)
Other Interest Rates 
We project that the 10-year Treas ury yield will rise from an average of
1.8 percent this quarter to 2.8 pe rcent by the end of 2022, ref lecting our
assumption that the term premium will move up to a more normal level over
the next few years.  This path for the 10-year Treasury yield i s nearly
unchanged from the projecti on in the October Tealbook.
Both corporate bond yields and mortg age rates increase about in  line with
comparable Treasury securitie s over the medium term.
Equity and House Prices 
Stock prices have increased about 4 percent since the time of the OctoberTealbook, noticeably above our exp ectations.  We expect equity prices to rise
only 0.2 percent per year, on avera ge, over the medium term, 0.7 percentage

How Sensitive  Is the Economy  to Interest Rates?  
Despite the importance of the question and decades of research, a great deal of uncertainty still 
surrounds the sensitivity of economic activity to changes in the federal funds rate.   This uncertainty 
is illustrated in the figure by  the range of model estimates of the response  of the unemployment 
rate to a reduction in the federal funds rate.  Specifically, the figure shows the impulse response of 
the unemployment rate to an immediate 100 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate that 
then fades over the next several quarters  from  four estimated structural models and a time -series 
structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model.1  The c hoice of the model matters a lot for the 
speed and magnitude of the response:  Across models, the peak response of the unemployment rate range s between negative 0.1 and negative 0.4 percentage point , with very different timing .  
The blue shaded area denote s the 90 percent  confidence interval from the time- series  model, 
which is very wide.  The staff’s judgmental projection embeds an overall interest rate sensitivity 
that is derived from the FRB/US model with VAR expec tations .  The staff’s  analysis of moneta ry 
strategies such as framework memos and the Monetary Policy Strategies section uses the FRB/US 
model under model- consistent expectations (MCE).  
These models provide a sense of the average reaction of economic activity to interest rates over the sample used in estimation.  However, s ome research  has suggested that the economy might 
have become less interest sensitive over time or that the sensitivity may depend  on the state of the 
economy .
2  For example, s ecular declines in interest sensit ivity could result  from declines  in the 
1 The models used are FRB/US  (a version with model -consistent expectations, MCE, and a version with 
VAR -based expectations);  the Smets and Wouters (2007) model ; the Del Negro, Giannoni, and Schorfheide (2015) 
model ; and a Bayesian SVAR model from Caldara and Herbst (2019).

relative size of sectors such as durable goods manufacturing , which are typically particularly 
responsive to interest rates .  In addition, Tenreyro and Thwaites (2016) have found empirically that 
monetary policy is less powerful in recessions than in expansions , as durable goods expenditures 
appear to be less responsive when output is low.3  They argue that standard estimates of the 
monetary transmission mechanism like those in the figure are mostly picking  up the effects of  
monetary policy during  expansions.  Thus,  accommodative monetary policy could possibly be less 
powerful in a weak economy than our typical empirical estimates  indicate.  These empirical findings  
are consistent with  some recent theoretical work.  According to this research, monetary policy 
easing might  shift forward  the timing  of lumpy durable good s spending  and the refinancing of 
mortgages .4  If policy easing in the past has already brought forward a large chunk of spending on 
durables  and mortgage refinancing , additional stimulus will likely have a smaller effect .  Finally, 
other research suggests that businesses may be less sensitive to fundamentals, such as interest 
rates, in times of heightened uncertainty.5 
Determining whether policy may be attenuat ed currently  is difficult.  R elative to the December 
2018 SEP , the federal funds  rate  shifted down about 1.25 percentage points by the end of 2019, 
pointing to an increase in GDP growth of  about 0.1  percentage point over the course of 2019, 
according to FRB /US under VAR expectations .  FRB/US predicts that the effects would be 
considerably larger in 2020 and 2021.  Because there are many factors influencing the economy, 
isolating the effect  of policy rates  is quite  challenging .    
One way to gauge  the effects is to focus on sectors that are typically most sensitive to interest 
rates.  According to the FRB/US model, the lower federal funds rate path would have boosted  
residential investment  by 0.5 percent  and the stock market  by about  10 percent.  Qualitatively, it 
appears that residential construction and equity prices are behaving in line with the model’s 
predictions:  The stock market is up considerably  since the December 2018 FOMC  meeting , and 
residential construction  rebounded  with the  decline in mortgage interest rates  over the past year. 
In addition, mortgage- refinancing activity  has increased markedly since the beginning of the year.  
Of course, factors other than a change in the expected funds rate path are also influencing these 
variables.  Overall, the staff judges that the transmission of lower rates to consumption and residential investment appears to have played out in pretty much  the same way that staff models 
for these sectors  and the FRB/US model would suggest.

  point less per year than in the  October Tealbook.  The softer p ace of stock 
price appreciation reflects some what higher valuation pressures , as the equity 
premium has dropped further bel ow its median.  All told, we pro ject that stock 
prices will be about 2 percen t higher at the end of 2022 than i n the October 
Tealbook. 
 We project that house prices w ill rise 3.7 percent per year ove r the medium 
term, noticeably slower than the a verage of the past several ye ars.       
Trade Policy  
 Discussions continue between the United States and China on a p hase-one 
trade agreement.  The specific de tails of the agreement are sti ll in play, but 
they are believed to include a f urther suspension of the 5 perc entage point 
U.S. tariff increase on $230 billi on of Chinese imports that was scheduled for 
October 15, a Chinese pledge to pur chase U.S. agricultural prod ucts, and 
agreements on currency and finan cial services issues.  Such an agreement 
would likely also entail susp ending both the 15 p ercentage poin t U.S. tariff 
increase on $150 billion of Chinese imports that is still sched uled for 
December 15 and China’s plan to i ncrease retaliatory tariffs on  $45 billion of 
U.S. exports.  Though initially the  two sides had hoped to sign an agreement 
in mid-November, the timeline has slipped as disagreements have arisen 
concerning the amount of agricult ural purchases China would make and 
whether the United Sta tes would roll back e xisting tariffs.  In spite of this 
delay, market participants appe ar cautiously optimistic about a  partial 
agreement being reached relatively soon. 
 Although neither the postponed Octob er tariff hikes nor those scheduled for 
December are incorporated in our  projection, the tariff changes  implemented 
since the start of 2018 have left a notable imprint on economic  activity and 
our forecast.    
o We continue to estimate that implemented tariffs will collectiv ely 
boost the level of core PCE pr ices 30 basis points and directly  lower 
the level of U.S. GDP 30 basi s points by the end of 2021.  The drag on 
output growth operates through several channels.  An erosion in 
household purchasing power slows the rise in PCE a little, and higher 
prices for imported capital goods  and lower profit expectations  impose

  noticeable restraint on business investment.  These negative ef fects on 
domestic demand are only partia lly offset by a boost to net exp orts, as 
our assumption of less-than-fu ll retaliation by U.S. trading pa rtners 
implies that exports will be  suppressed by foreign tariffs to a  lesser 
degree than imports are r estrained by U.S. tariffs.   
o In addition to these direct channe ls, over the course of this y ear, we 
have further marked down our GDP p rojection, mainly this year a nd 
next year, by 40 basis points to reflect business uncertainty o ver both 
the trade environment and global growth.  Finally, trade tensio ns are 
also informing our forecast indire ctly to the extent that they affect 
equity prices and the value of the dollar. 
Foreign Economic Acti vity and the Dollar 
 We now see foreign real GDP growth stepping down to an annual r ate of 
1.3 percent in the second half of  2019, well below our estimate  of potential 
growth and a downward revisi on of 0.5 percentage point from the  October 
Tealbook.  Although much of the rev ision results from a double- digit 
contraction in third-quarter  GDP in Hong Kong, growth in the se cond half 
appears to have remained weak i n many economies.  Foreign growth has been 
held down this year by a number of  factors, including the global 
manufacturing slump, political unrest, and trade tensions.  We expect the drag 
from these factors to ease a nd growth abroad to pick up to a near-potential 
pace of 2.4 percent by late next y ear.  Indeed, in China and th e euro area, 
growth already appears to be stabilizing.   
 We continue to expect that the broad real dollar will appreciat e at an annual 
rate of 1 percent through the f orecast horizon as market expect ations for the 
federal funds rate move up toward the staff forecast.     
Fiscal Policy  
 Our fiscal policy assumptions a re unchanged.  We continue to pr oject that the 
direct fiscal impetus from all levels of government will contri bute 
0.7 percentage point to aggregate  demand growth this year—rough ly the same 
as in 2018.  After this year, with the boost from the 2017 tax cuts waning and

  federal purchases flattening out, the impetus from fiscal polic y tapers to 
0.4 percentage point in 2020 and t o 0.1 percentage point in 202 1 and 2022. 
Oil Prices 
 The spot price of Brent crude  oil, which peaked at almost $75 per barrel in 
April, is currently $63 per barr el, up $3 per barrel since the time of the 
October Tealbook.  Oil prices moved up in recent weeks on gener ally positive 
news about U.S.–China trade devel opments and were also supporte d by 
expectations that U.S. production growth will slow and that OPE C and its 
partners are likely to exte nd production cuts.  Consistent with  futures prices, 
the price of imported oil is expected to edge lower over the me dium term. 
THE OUTLOOK FOR GDP 
GDP growth in the second half of t his year appears to be modera ting relative to 
the first half, roughly as exp ected in the October Tealbook.1  A decline in business fixed 
investment (BFI) and a deceleration in PCE contribute to the st ep-down, but the slowing 
is exaggerated by a sharp pullback in the pace of government sp ending and by the 
recently concluded strike at GM.2  Indeed, private domestic fin al purchases, which we 
think provide a better signal  of underlying economic momentum t han GDP, look to be 
decelerating less—from a 2.4 percen t growth rate in the first half to 2.1 percent in the 
second.   
Although GDP growth over the seco nd half as a whole is coming i n largely as 
expected, the quarter ly pattern is less s mooth, with third-quar ter growth stronger and 
fourth-quarter growth, at just 1.3 percent, softer than in the October Tealbook.  The 
sharper slowing this quarter main ly reflects a larger step-down  in inventory investment 
and a greater moderation in PCE growth.  We forecast GDP growth  to rebound to 
2.3 percent in the fir st quarter as GM’s production recovers.   
                                                 
1 This Tealbook reflects data through Monday, November 25, and t hus excludes the GDP, 
personal income, and prices data published on Wednesday, Novemb er 27. 
2 We estimate that the GM strike from mid-September to late Octo ber reduced GDP growth 
around 0.2 percentage point in the third quarter and another 0. 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter.  GM 
resumed production in the final week of October, and we expect the return to normal production (plus some 
makeup production) will boost GDP gr owth about 0.5 percentage p oint in the first quarter as GM rebuilds 
its inventories.

  Note:  The output gap is the percent difference between actual and potential output; a negative number indicates that the economy is operating
below potential. The change in the output gap is equal to real GDP growth less the contribution of measurement error less the growth rate of
potential output. For quarterly figures, the growth rates are at an annual rate, and this calculation needs to be multiplied by 1/4 to obtain
the quarterly change in the output gap.

   We estimate that PCE increase d at a strong rate of 3 percent in  the third 
quarter, a touch faster than i n our October projection.  Howeve r, for the 
current quarter, incoming data on October retail sales and motor vehicle sales 
point to a somewhat larger step -down in PCE growth than we had previously 
projected.3  On the whole, low unemployment, moderate income growth, high 
household net worth, and low inter est rates provide support for consumer 
spending and point to soli d PCE growth going forward. 
 Residential investment increas ed about 5 percent in the third q uarter, its first 
increase after six consecutive quarters of declines.  We expect  residential 
investment to rise at a simila r pace this quarter and next:  Pe rmits for single-
family homes have climbed to post- housing-crash highs in recent months, 
starts increased for the fift h consecutive month in October, an d both pending 
and existing home sales have moved up after bottoming out earlier this year.  
We primarily attribute the rec overy in housing to the decline in mortgage rates 
since late 2018.   
 After increasing just 1.7 percent in the first half of this year, BFI is projected 
to decline about 1 percent i n the second half and to edge down further in the 
first quarter of 2020.   
o E&I is expected to only edge up in the second half.  Shipments of 
capital goods, which were roughl y flat for most of the year, ha ve 
declined recently.  Moreover, ne w orders for capital goods continue to 
run below shipments, and an array of indicators that inform our  
outlook (such as analysts’ expe ctations for longer-term profit growth) 
remain notably downbeat.  While t he deceleration in the first h alf of 
the year was concentrated in t ransportation investment, the slo wdown 
in E&I growth in the second half is widespread across investmen t 
categories, and we largely attri bute this broad-based weakness to 
heightened concerns about  trade and global growth.     
o Investment in nonresidential stru ctures fell 14 percent in the third 
quarter.  About half of the decline was due to the continued re sponse 
                                                 
3 Soft vehicle sales in  October may have pa rtly reflected shortages of some GM vehicles resulting 
from the UAW strike.

  of drilling and mining to the drop in oil prices since the spri ng.  
However, investment in other types of structures also decreased  last 
quarter (as it has in all but two quarters since the end of 201 6).  The 
latest indicators point to a sizable decline in building this q uarter and 
next, and we expect declines to continue through the rest of 20 20, 
though at a more moderate pace. 
 Net exports are expected to be a slight drag for U.S. GDP growt h in the 
second half of this year.  Export and import growth both remain  weak, 
weighed down, at least in part, by the tariffs previously imple mented by the 
United States and its trading pa rtners.  After flattening out i n the third quarter, 
exports are expected to resume th eir decline this quarter.  How ever, relative to 
the October Tealbook, exports wer e revised up slightly in the c urrent and next 
quarters, as the ISM new export  orders index (which had weighed  on our 
previous Tealbook forecas t) rebounded in October.   
 Manufacturing production fell 0.6 pe rcent in October and was 2. 2 percent 
below its level at the end of  2018.  The decline last month mai nly reflected the 
strike at GM, but factory output e xcluding motor vehicles and p arts also edged 
down.  Although output growth is antic ipated to temporarily pop  up as GM 
makes up some of the lost pr oduction, factory output outside mo tor vehicles is 
forecast to only edge up in coming months.  The measures of new  orders from 
national and regional manufacturi ng surveys are, for the most p art, consistent 
with little change in factory out put.  Comments in those surveys and in the 
Beige Book continue to point to p ast tariff increases, trade po licy uncertainty, 
soft growth abroad, and weak BFI a s the principal drags on manu facturing 
activity.  (See the box “Manufacturing Recessions and the Globa l Economy” 
in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section for 
historical evidence that the spillovers from manu facturing to the rest of the 
economy may be limited.) 
The projected gradual decline in GDP growth from 2.1 percent this year and next 
to 1.7 percent in 2022 is largely due to the waning support fro m fiscal policy.  This 
outlook for medium-term growth is a little more positive than t he October Tealbook, 
largely reflecting the higher projected path for equity prices.  As a result, the output gap widens into the middle of next  year and generally moves sideway s thereafter such that it 
is 0.2 percentage point wider a t the end of 2022 than in the Oc tober Tealbook.

  THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET  
The labor market remains ti ght.  Although the pace of payroll growth has softened 
this year, it continues to be above the pace consistent with no  change in resource 
utilization.  The unemployment ra te remains near half-century lows, and the labor force 
participation rate has continued to increase modestly against the backdrop of its declining 
trend.  Looking ahead, with output gr owth rising a little faste r than its potential rate next 
year and hovering around its  potential rate in 2021 and 2022, w e expect just a little 
further tightening of the labor market in this projection. 
 According to currently publis hed data, after rising 223,000 per  month in 2018, 
nonfarm payroll employment ros e at an average monthly clip of 1 67,000 this 
year through October.4  The pace of total payroll ga ins in the published data 
has increased over the past three months relative to the first half of the year 
and came in notably stronger than we had been expecting.    
o As indicated in the table below, w e expect that the BLS benchma rk 
revision early next year will lowe r total payroll employment gr owth by 
42,000 per month from the sec ond quarter of 2018 through the first 
quarter of this year, and we e stimate that it will hold down pa yroll 
growth by 16,000 per month through t he end of this year.  (The 
exhibits elsewhere in the T ealbook are based on the published B LS 
data.)  
  
 
 In contrast to the BLS estimate that private payrolls have increased about 
150,000 per month throughout the year, our in-house measure of private 
nonfarm payrolls based on microdata from the payroll-processing  firm ADP 
(which we call ADP-FRB) has shown a marked deceleration recently.  This 
                                                 
4 The strike of UAW workers against GM held down payroll growth by 46,000 in October, and we 
expect it to boost payroll growth by 46,000 in November. Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 2018

 measure indicates that private payrolls have risen only about 4 0,000 per 
month from August to October.

alternative view that both t he BLS methodology for incorporatin g firm
births and deaths and the softness in the recent ADP-FRB data i mply

Job openings have come down from their highs over the course of  the year,
and survey measures of hiring conditions have shown signs of we akening
relative to last year.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain at very
low levels (though they have e dged up in the past couple of wee ks).
Looking ahead, we expect total pa yroll employment gains to move  down to
156,000 per month, on average, in the  fourth quarter and then to step down
gradually, reaching 74,000 per month in 2022 as output decelera tes; this
trajectory is similar to tha t in the previous Tealbook.
The unemployment rate, which has hovered near 50-year lows sinc e the
spring, stood at 3.6 percent in O ctober.  With projected output  growth a bit
above potential in 2020, we expect t he unemployment rate to inc h down to
3.5 percent by the middle of next ye ar and to remain there thro ugh the end of
2022; this forecast is 0.1 percenta ge point lower than in the O ctober Tealbook.
The LFPR moved up further to 63.3 percent in October and has ri sen
0.5 percentage point the past six months.  Owing to the surprising ongoing
strength in the LFPR, we rais ed our forecast, but we continue to expect the
LFPR to drift lower over the next  several years, as the cyclica l improvement
in participation slows and the  aging of the popul ation continues to exert a
downward pull. 
oIn response to the string of une xpectedly strong LFPR readings,  we
revised up our estim
ate of the t rend level of participation by
0.2 percentage point in 2019 and ove r the projection period.  H owever,

 Alternative View:  The Labor Market Is in a Precarious Position 
Recent employment gains, as measured by the B ureau of Labor Statistics  Current Employment 
Statistics (CES), have been strong.  In this discussion , we argue that those published readings 
significantly overstate the health of the labor market  and that t he true pace of private employment 
gains is likely close to 70,000 jobs per month; this  number  is at the bottom of the range of plausible 
estima tes of the pace needed to absorb the trend increase in labor market entrants.  With 
employment gains having slowed sooner  than in the staff’s baseline forecast, the labor market is in a 
precarious position, as the economy has  less room  to weather a negative demand shock without going 
into a recession.  
We make two arguments  to support this alternative view .  First, independent data from the payroll 
provider Automatic Data Processing , Inc.  (ADP ), covering roughly one -fifth of pr ivate employment, 
suggest that job growth has slowed more than indicated by the CES data.  We might expect the ADP 
data to identify a slowdown in job growth more quickly and accurately than the CES, as the growth of 
new and young firms tends to weaken subs tantially during slowdowns, and new firms can appear 
immediately in the ADP data but not in the CES for at least one year.  This  difference  might be why 
real-time ADP -FRB would have been  closer to  the final CES data than were  real-time CES estimates  
during the plunge in employment in 2008 .1 
Second, CES estimates might miss a sharp slowing in employment growth  in real time  because of the 
way the CES series is constructed.  The CES estimate  combines job growth information from a sample 
of continuing es tablishments with a model forecast of net job creation from newly formed 
establishment s (birth s) and closing establishments ( death s) based on data from 10 to 12 months 
earlier ; this forecast component introduces lagged data into the CES series .  Figure 1 r eports annual 
preliminary birth –death model forecasts  (in blue) and actual  net birth –death job creation ( in brown); 
all values are expressed as monthly averages, and a given year represents forecast and actual birth –
death job creation in the 12 months lead ing up to March of that year ( for example , the bars for 200 8 
refer to data f rom  April 200 7 to March 200 8).  Birth –death forecasts show  notable persistence, making 
it considerably more difficult for the  CES to capture labor market turning points  in real time .2 
In the 12 months leading up to March 2019, birth –death forecasts  implied a contribution of 89,000 jobs 
per month (solid blue bar for 2019 in figure 1).  However, the preliminary benchmark revision reduced 
the March 2019 employment level by 514,000  jobs , suggesting that forecast jobs did not materialize.  If 
the revision was due entirely to birth –death errors, then the actual  contribution of net birth s and 
death s from April 2018 to March 2019 was about 46,000 jobs per month (dashed brown bar) .3 
What has happened since March?  We estimat e that birth –death forecasts have  been contributing 
82,000 jobs per month in the published CES data (dashed blue bar  in figure 1 ), just below the previous 
year’s contribution.   But if actual  birth –death contrib utions since March 2019 have been similar to the 
actual pace of 46,000 we have inferred for the previous 12 months —an assumption supported by 
Census Bureau data on business registrations (not shown) —then post -benchmark CES estimates

3 Birth –death errors often compose a large share of benchmark revi sions, but our assumption that the entire 2019 
revision is due to birth –death error is intentionally  strong.

 overstate job growth by  about  36,000 jobs per month.  Our proposed adjustment of 36,000 is larger 
than the staff’s post -benchmark “guesstimate,” which assumes job growth is overstated by just 
16,000 jobs per month.   
Our alternative view of underlying job growth is informed by the CES preliminary benchmark revision, 
ADP -FRB data, and the likely revisions to CES data arising from overestimation of birth –death job 
creation —that is, downward revisions of roughly 36,000 jobs per month sin ce March 2019.  Figure 2 
shows this alternative view.  The black line shows published CES private job growth , adjusted for the 
October G eneral Motors  strike .  The dashed  red line shows  our adjusted CES series , where the March 
preliminary benchmark revision  is taken on board and the data for April through October are reduced 
by 36,000 per month based on our previously discussed estimates  (note that the staff’s preliminary 
benchmark guesstimate would lie  between the black and dashed red lines) .  The dashed green line is 
an adjusted version of the staff’s ADP -FRB series, where we have taken on board the preliminary 
benchmark revision according to routine staff methods  rather than waiting for the official  release . 
Elsewhere in the Tealbook , the staff reports a “ pooled estimate ,” combining signal s from the CES and 
ADP -FRB without accounting for the preliminary benchmark revision.  The blue line in figure 2 is an 
alternative pooled estimate based on the adjusted CES and ADP -FRB data  depicted by the dashed 
lines .  Combining these adjusted signals, we estimate that underlying private employment growth is 
71,000 jobs per month (blue line).4 
Other evidence that the re has been a pronounced slowing in  job growth is provided by the leisure and 
hospitality sector, which  made the largest contribution to the preliminary benchmark revision .  This 
sector , which  is often  heavily reliant on birth –death contributions, has been weaker in the ADP data 
than in the CES data in recent months and has seen a large decline in job openi ngs this year.  
At first glance, recent readings on the unemployment rate and initial unemployment claims suggest a 
more optimistic view, but these indicators are not dispositive.  The unemployment rate is low, but it 
has been roughly flat for some time —consistent with payroll growth that has not exceeded  a 
breakeven pace.  Claims may remain low because employers are acting first on the hiring  margin : job 
openings, although at high levels, have declined markedly in recent months , and hiring has leveled off.  
The labor market is in a precarious position:  True employment growth is barely  sufficient to 
accommodate trend labor force growth, and a negative aggregate demand shock during the next year 
could swiftly raise unemployment and create significant recessio n risk.

the labor market, see Cajner and ot hers (2019) cited in footnote 1.

  unemployment rate gap, we opted t o leave our assumptions for 
potential output unrevised.5   
 After having surged anomalously in the first half of the year, productivity 
growth in the business sector sta lled in the third quarter—largely as expected.  
Over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, productivit y rose 
1.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent in the year-earlier period.  W e expect 
productivity to rise 1.3 percent pe r year over the next few yea rs.   
THE OUTLOOK FOR INFLATION  
Incoming data on price inflation, including PCE prices through September and the 
October CPI and PPI, were slight ly below our expectations.  We now estimate that core 
PCE prices rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in Octobe r, a tenth lower than in 
the October Tealbook.  The downwar d surprise in September PCE prices and much of the 
miss in the October CPI were in categories from which we take l ittle signal for our 
monthly near-term forecast.  We expect the 12-month change in c ore prices to hover 
around 1.6 percent over the rest of  the year and then to pick u p to 1.9 percent by March 
of next year, as the weak readi ngs from early this year drop ou t of the 12-month 
calculation.  This projection i s 0.1 percentage point lower tha n in the October forecast.   
Over the next few years, we expect  core PCE price inflation to run at 
1.9 percent—a touch higher than bo th our estimate of its underl ying trend of 1.8 percent 
and our previous forecast—as the  boost to inflation from tight resource utilization in this 
projection is not fully offset  by a drag on import prices from the rising dollar.  With 
energy prices projected to fall further next year, total PCE in flation runs a bit below core 
inflation in 2020 and then is proj ected to be in line with core  inflation through 2022.     
 We expect that the effective pr ice for imported core goods—whic h includes 
the effects of tariffs—will rise about 1.9 percent in the secon d half of this 
year, boosted by past tariff increases.6  This increase is 0.4 percentage point 
less than projected in the Octobe r Tealbook, reflecting larger- than-expected 
declines in prices for importe d foods and industrial supplies.  As a result of an 
                                                 
5 We lowered our estimate of the trend in weekly hours by an amo unt that offsets the implications 
of the higher trend LFPR, as the workweek has been somewhat low er than we could explain over the past 
several quarters.  
6 The middle-right panel of the exhibit “Inflation Developments and Outlook (2)” now shows both 
core import prices and our estim ate of effective core import pr ices.

 appreciating dollar a nd no further assumed tariff increases, ef fective core 
import price inflation after this year is expected to be subdue d, running at just 
1 percent. 
Median long-run inflatio n expectations from the Michigan survey  rose
0.2 percentage point to 2.5 percent in November, the middle of the narrow
band it has traversed the past year.  TIPS-based measures of lo nger-term
inflation compensation also m oved up a bit since the time of th e previous
Tealbook.  The FRBNY Survey of Consumer Expectations measure of  median
three-year-ahead expected infla tion was unchanged in October at  its historical
low.
oThe new staff common inflation expectations (CIE) index, which
synthesizes these and other measur es of inflation expectations,  points
to expectations as having he ld fairly steady since 2016.  Two v ariants
of the CIE index are now include d in the “Survey Measures of Lo nger-
Term Inflation Expectati ons” Tealbook exhibit.
The incoming data suggest that la bor compensation continues to rise
moderately and roughly in line with what we expected in the Oct ober
Tealbook.  Consistent with no mater ial tightening in the labor market over the
forecast period, we project furthe r moderate wage growth over t he medium
term.
oThe employment cost index (ECI) rose 2.7 percent over the 12 mo nths
ending in September, in line with  the prediction from our model  that
uses productivity, slack, and inflation.  We continue to expect  the ECI
to rise at that pace ove r the projection period.
oBased on the preliminary release, c ompensation per hour (CPH) in the
business sector increased a s trong 4.6 percent ov er the four quarters
ending in the third quarter.7  However, we expect the four-quarter
change in CPH to drop back early next year, as the anomalously large
7 The GDP release on November 27 will include a revision of wage s and salaries for the second 
quarter, which could change the contour (and our interpretation ) of compensation.  The staff’s estimate of 
compensation gains based on the microdata from ADP has been much more subdued than CPH the past 
couple of quarters, though we do not yet have a lot of experien ce analyzing this ADP-b ased measure in real 
time.

  first-quarter reading drops out, and to rise 3.6 percent per year through 
the end of the forecast.  This pace is a bit faster than in the  October 
Tealbook, reflecting the slightly t ighter resour ce utilization in this 
forecast.  
o The 12-month change in average  hourly earnings, at 3 percent in  
October, has edged down, on net, over the course of this year.    
THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK  
 The natural rate of unemploymen t is still assumed to remain at 4.4 percent 
through the long term.  Potential output growth is assumed to slow to its long-run value of 1.7 percent in 2023, as the boost to potential gro wth from the 
2017 tax cuts wanes.  
 The real long-run equilibrium federal funds rate is still assum ed to be 
0.5 percent, and the nominal yiel d on 10-year Treasury securiti es is 
3.0 percent in the longer run. 
o We continue to assume that fiscal policymakers will eventually start to 
gradually reduce primary deficits  by an amount sufficient to st abilize 
the debt-to-GDP ratio.  We expect  this ratio to eventually settle around 
105 percent, 20 percentage points higher than would have occurr ed in 
the absence of the 2017–18 federal  tax and discretionary spending 
changes.  We also still assume that this 20 percentage point in crement 
to the debt-to-GDP ratio will pus h up the term premium on 10-year 
Treasury yields 50 basis points in the long run. 
 As monetary policy tightens, GDP growth slows from 1.7 percent in 2022 to 
1.4 percent in 2024 and 2025 before ris ing gradually to its long-run value 
thereafter.  The unemployment rate moves up gradually from 3.5 percent at 
the end of 2022 toward its assumed natural rate in subsequent y ears.  Core 
PCE price inflation increases f rom 1.9 percent at the end of th e medium term 
to its long-run value of 2.0 percent in 2024. 
 Given the outlook for inflation a nd resource utilization, the n ominal federal 
funds rate slightly overshoot s its long-run value of 2.5 percen t over the 2023–
25 period.

International Economic Developments and Outlook  
Foreign economic growth appears to have remained weak in the second half of 
this year, but we still see a rebound next year as the most likely outcome.   On the positive 
side, in some important regions, such as China and the euro area, incoming data suggest 
these economies are stabilizing.   Euro -area third -quarter GDP surprised on the upside,  
and survey -based  indicators have edged up.  Recent Chinese indicators are also consistent 
with a modest pickup in growt h.  On the negative side, manufacturing remains weak 
throughout much of the world , and GDP data have disappointed in several economies .  
We now see aggregate foreign growth at an annual rate of 1. 3 percent in the second half 
of this year, down from its pac e in the first half and ½ percentage point below our 
October Tealbook forecast.   However , much of this markdown  results from  a double -digit 
contraction in third -quarter GDP in Hong Kong, where social unrest has depressed 
activity.   Although our conviction is not strong , we expect growth abroad to pick up to 
2.3 percent next year and 2.5 percent further out .  This outlook is predicated on 
assumption s that the global manufacturing slump will fade, trade and political tensions 
will ease somewhat, and highly ac commodative policies will remain in place.     
Although the continued weakness in manufacturing is worrying, a s we discuss in 
the box “Manufacturing Recessions and the Global Economy,” significant declines  of 
industrial production historically  have not alwa ys been followed by  global GDP 
recessions.  With consumer spending, services activity, and financial conditions  around 
the world  holding up better, our expectation is that the current situation is one of these 
episodes .  That said, the weakness in global manufacturing could prove deeper and more 
protracted than we are anticipating, spilling over more broadly to consumer and business 
confidence  and weighing on foreign and U.S. economic activity.  We highlight this risk 
in our “Foreign Sl owdown” scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section.  
While momentum in foreign economies remains fragile, some risks have actually 
diminished.  Importantly, t he risk of a no-deal Brexit in the near ter m has receded.  And, 
although significant differences  remain , there has been some progress on the U.S .–China 
phase-one trade agreement.  There is some possibility that trade policy outcomes could be 
more favorable than we and other observers are expecting .  For example , we could see 
rapid passage of the U.S.–Mexico –Canada Agreement , an agreement to forgo tariffs on 
imported autos, and a more substantial U.S. –China deal that includes  the rollback of

 Manufacturing Recessions and the Global Economy  
Global manufacturing output  has been stagnating for almost one year , raising concern s that this 
sector’s weakness may presage  a broader downturn in economic activity .  In this discussion , we 
review evidence o f the extent to which weakness  in manufacturing spills over to the broader 
economy or provides a warning signal of recession.    
We first examine the historical correlation of manufacturing and services purchasing manager s 
indexes (PMIs), survey -based indicators that provide early information o n economic activity  in the 
two sectors .  Over the past 18 months , manufacturing PMI s for the United States and the foreign 
economy have declined, with both indexes falling to levels below  50 this year and thus indicating 
contraction  (figures  1 and  2).  In contrast,  services PMIs , while also declining , have remained in 
expansionary territory.  Looking at the relationship between manufact uring and services over the 
past two decades, we find  that  manufacturing PMIs help  forecast services PMIs , such that a 
slowdown in manufacturing is generally followed by a slowdown in services .  This finding would 
seem to justify concerns about manufacturi ng weakness spilling o ver to the broader economy.  
However, services also help forecast manufacturing, implying that if services PMIs continue to 
remain in the expansionary range, they may lift up manufacturing .1  In several episodes, such as in 
late 2015 and early 2016, the manufacturing PMI indicated contraction , but the services PMI held 
up above the 50  threshold .   
Another approach to addressing the risks to the broader economy posed by weakness in 
manufacturing is to examine  whether declines  in industrial production  (IP)—which includes 
output of the manufacturing, mining, and utility  industries —have historically heralded  recession s.  
Table  1 report s changes in IP relative to  its trend over  the four quarters  preceding each recession 
                                                 
1 Using both the U.S.  and foreign economy PMI series over 2000:M1 –2019:M10, the Granger -causality tests 
reject the null hypothesis that manufacturing does not Granger -cause services PMI with a p value lower than 
5 percent at 4  and 6  lags.  We find similar results for the null hypothesis that services do not Granger -cause 
manufacturing PMI.  Thus, Granger causality appears to run in both directions.

since 1970 , together with GDP growth  relative to its trend during each  recession .2  Over the past 
50 years,  IP growth rate s fell well  below trend the year preceding each of the five recessions in 
the foreign economy and seven  recessions  in the United States , by 1.8 and 2. 4 percentage points , 
on average, respectively (line  8).  Given this  evidence , the fact that over the past year IP growth 
has fallen 2.0 percentage point s relative to trend in the United States and abroad  point s to 
elevated recession risks .  That said, the foreign economy also had nine  episodes and the U.S. 
economy had seven  episodes during which IP growth fell considerably below trend , but no GDP 
recession  followed.  During these “false alarm s,” IP growth rates were somewhat weaker, on 
average, than they were before the realized recessions  (line  9).  
Our assessment is  that the recent weakness in manufacturing activity , though weighing on 
growth , will not tip the global economy into recession.  In part, this view reflects the f act that 
other data have held up better, including consumption indicators  and financial conditions.  
Indeed, recession prediction models —which  use a broader range of information such as PMIs, IP, 
retail sales, and financial conditions —estimate that the pro bability of recession in the world 
economy  over the next 12 months  has increased in recent quarters but remains near its 
unconditional average of about 20 percent  (figure  3).3  In our Tealbook forecast, we  expect that 
manufacturing will gradually recover as global GDP growth picks up and trade tensions cool.  This 
forecast is predicated on the view that, amid solid labor market conditions and accommodative 
monetary policy actions, household demand will be r esilient and financial conditions will remain 
favorable.  However, we cannot rule out less favorable outcomes.

  some recently introduced tariffs .  Such developments could significantly alleviate  trade 
policy uncertainty  and, as we discuss in the “ Easing of Trade Tensions ” alternative 
scenario in the Risks and Uncertainty section, provide some boost to the global economy.   
However, given past experience, we remain cognizant that trade tensions could resurge.    
Foreign headlin e inflation is estimated to pick up in the fourth quarter, driven by 
higher  energy prices and soaring food prices in the case of emerging market economies 
(EMEs ) due to shortages of pigs in China and onions in India .  However, underlying 
inflation pressures remain subdued in many countries; 12 -month core inflation in the euro 
area and Japan came in at 1 percent and 0.3 percent, respectively , in October .  Amid a 
lack of inflation pressure s and fragile growth, we conti nue to anticipate monetary polic y 
abroad  to remain highly accommodative throughout the forecast period .  Since the 
previous Tealbook , there has been  further  monetary policy easing in several EMEs , 
including in Brazil, Chile, China , Indonesia, Mexico, Russi a, Thailand , and Turkey .        
ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES  
 Euro Area.   Economic activity appears to have stabilized, though the underlying pace 
of growth remains subdued  and risks remain tilted to the downside.  Real GDP 
growth for the third  quarter came in at 0.9 percent, 0.5 percentage point higher than 
estimated in the  October Tealbook  and up a touch from the previous quarter .  
Although official estimates for the expenditure components have not yet been 
released, it seems that the third -quarter GDP expansion was supported by household 
demand and exports .  Germany  avoided a technical recession in the third quarter , with 
its GDP growth print ing at 0.3 percent .  Indicators for the fourth quarter also 
surprised on the upside , on net,  and suggest  that manufacturing output has bottomed 
out, leading us to mark up the near -term outlook  for the region , though only slightly.   
Over the medium term , we continue to  project euro-area growth to increase to 
1.3 percent in 2020 (about potential) and 1.8  perce nt in 2021 , supported by a gradual 
recovery in global manufacturing  and highly accommodative monetary policy .   
Twelve -month headline inflation edged down to 0.7 percent in October, while  core 
inflation continue d to hover at around 1  percent .  We expect inflation to gradually rise 
to 1.6 percent by 2022 , in line with the projected narrowing of the output gap .  The 
weak outlook for inflation and fragility of the prospects for growth  could be seen as 
calling for some further loosening of monetary p olicy.  However, based on the 
opposition within the Governing Council to additional stimulus , we anticipate the

 European Central Bank  will not implement new measures  but will continue to run its 
Asset Purchase Program until the second quarter of 2021 and m aintain its deposit rate 
at the current record low level of  negative 0.5 percent until the end of 2021.  
Japan.   The pace of economic activity slowed more than expected in the third
quarter , despite some front -running of consumption ahead of October’s tax hike.
Real GDP grew only 0.2  percent, significantly below the robust 1.9  percent pace of
the first half of the year.  The slowdown is largely attributable to a drawdown of
inventories, as firms satisfied the r ush demand ahead of the tax hike out of existing
supplies rather than by boosting production.  The expectation that firms will rebuild
their inventories led us to mark up our current -quarter estimate , but we still expect
that the tax hike will contribute t o a 2 percent contraction of GDP .  Thereafter, we see
GDP growth recover ing to a bit above its potential pace of 0.7  percent, in part
supported by spending related to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics .
In October , with the tax hike boosting prices less than expected, 1 2-month total
inflation stayed flat at  0.2 percent  and core inflation remained  at 0.3 percent.  We
forecast that i nflation will gradually pick up to 1 percent by 2022, as a highly
expansionary monetary policy  and a persistently positive output gap gradually lift
inflation expectations.  At its October meeting, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) updated its
forward guidance , indicating a bias for lowering policy rates  and replacing its
calendar -based commitment to keeping  rates low through spring of 2020 , with a state-
based commitment to keeping them low long enough to maintain progress toward
achieving the target .  Even so, we do not assume any easing in our baseline , as our
outlook for Japanese growth  is relatively benig n and the BOJ is con cerned that more -
negative interest rates could put additional pressure on financial institutions’ profits ,
intermediation , and vulnerabilities.
United Kingdom.   Brexit -related uncertainty has continued to weigh on the U.K.
economy.  After contracting 0.9 percent in the second quarter, real GDP rose
1.2 percent in the third.  However, worse -than-expected incoming data suggest that
the rebound was temporary, leading us to mark down the growth forecast for the
current quarter t o a meager 0. 1 percent.  Despite a new Brexit deal agreed to with the
European Union (EU), Prime Minister Johnson did not secure enough support in the
U.K. Parliament for immediate approval of the deal .  As a result, the EU granted the
United Kingdom anoth er extension through January 31, 2020 , and Johnson called for
new elections to take place on December 12.  The Conservatives are ahead in the

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

  polls , and we assume that  they will gain the majority to form a government and pass 
the earlier -negotiated Brexit deal by the end -January deadline.  Once that is behind 
them,  a transition period starts in which  the U nited Kingdom h as until the end of next 
year to negotiate its new trade arrangement with the EU, as well as with all of its 
other trading partners.  Thus , we expect Brexit uncertainty to persist for some time  
amid contentious negotiations , and we  project a subdued pace of growth in 2020 at 
0.7 percent, well below potential of 1.2  percent.  Accommodative monetary policy , 
together with some fiscal stimulus (pledged by both Conservative and Labo ur 
parties) , should lift growth to 1.4 percent in 2021 and 2022.    
Twelve -month headline inflation in October declined to 1.5 percent , mainly reflecting 
mandated cuts in utility pric es, while core inflation was 1.7 percent.  As retail energy 
prices stabilize, we expect inflation to pick up next year and stay close to the Bank of 
England’s (BOE’s) 2  percent target through the forecast period .  With inflation under 
control and growth pe rsistently weak, we assume that the BOE will cut its policy rate 
from 0.75 percent to 0.5  percent in the third quarter of 2020.  Assuming successful 
completion of trade negotiations by the end of 2020 , we expect the BOE to gradually 
normalize its policy st ance, raising the Bank Rate to 1 percent by mid -2022.    
 Canada .  After a strong second quarter, driven by a rebound in oil production, we 
estimate that real GDP growth  slowed to 1.4 percent in the third.  Incoming data, such  
as employment for October , suggest that the soft patch has extended in to the fourth 
quarter .  Even so , improvement in business sentiment indicators and signs of recovery 
in the housing market  point to  a pickup in  domestic demand.  Accordingly, we project 
that growth will gradually r ise to its potential pace of 1.8 percent by the second half 
of 2020 and remain about there over the forecast period.  Relative to the October 
Tealbook, the projections for higher oil prices and faster  U.S. growth  led us to 
slightly revise up the Canadian o utlook  over the next two years.   Still, given the 
relatively subdued near -term outlook and the dovish tone of its most recent monetary 
policy statement, we expect the Bank of Canada to cut its policy rate 25 basis point s 
to 1.5  percent early next year before increasing rates in the second half of 2021.  
EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES  
 China.  Growth in China had slowed to a 5.5 percent pace in the second quarter and 
remained about there in the third .  We see some modest improvement in growth in the 
current qua rter to 5.7 percent .  Although manufacturing exports and production point

Class II FOMC – Restricted (FR)

 to some recent strengthening in external demand, indicators of domestic demand 
remain weak, suggesting that the deleveraging campaign continues to exert a drag on 
the economy.  Going  forward, the outlook faces several  headwinds.  First, financial 
conditions remain tight because of concerns about the health of China’s small banks, 
with runs on two rural lenders during the intermeeting period underlining this risk.  
Second, the property  market should slow as authorities take measures to cool it .  
Finally, despite optimism about a potential phase -one trade deal, trade tensions with 
the United States  will likely remain  and could even resurge .  We see growth holding 
at about its fourth -quarter pace over the forecast period, with the authorities offsetting 
some of these headwinds with limited policy stimulus.  
Inflation has jumped notably  in recent months , almost entirely because of the effect of 
African swine flu on pork price s.  We expect some further pressure in the coming 
months but then see inflation falling back to 2.5 percent by the end of next year.  
Other Emerging Asia.   GDP growth in the region was dragged down in the third
quarter by  a sharp contraction (12.1 percent at an annual rate) in Hong Kong.
Elsewhere in the region, economies continue to tread water in choppy conditions,
with growth, on balance, holding steady at a slightly below -trend 3.5 percent pace  in
the third quarter .  Although manufacturin g production in parts of the region has
already rebounded substantially from its slump, we see the recovery in manufacturing
gaining some additional traction  over time , which, together with easing monetary and
fiscal polic ies in many economies in the regio n, should support a modest further
pickup in the region’s growth.
Hong Kong.  Increasingly violent protests have resulted in serious disruptions to the 
city’s transport system, emergency evacuations of Chinese students to the M ainland , 
and a plunge in touris m.  These developments have already  led to a nearly 20 percent 
drop in retail sales  in the third quarter .  In contrast, exports have been holding up  
somewhat better , and the trade and logistics sector does not appear to be materially 
affected by the protests .  For now, our baseline outlook assumes that the situation will 
eventually be brought under control by some combination of more aggressive police 
tactics, further concessions to protestors , and fading support among the local 
population amid escala ting violence.   Even so, we expect GDP to contract again at a 
double -digit pace in the fourth quarter, with the economy returning to positive growth 
next year .

In mid -November,  the U.S. Congress approv ed the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
Democracy Act , whic h, if signed by the President, would require the U.S. State 
Department to recommend annually whether Hong Kong should continue to enjoy 
separate and more favorable  trading status with the U nited States  than does Mainland  
China .  The direct effects of revoking Hong Kong’s special status would likely be 
limited (given that exports account for relatively little valued added in the economy), 
but such a move could potentially weigh on investor sentiment and undermine Hong 
Kong ’s role as  a major financial and trade center . 
•Mexico.  The malaise afflicting the Mexican economy extended into the third quarter,  
with GDP remaining flat after contracting in the first half of the year.  The poor 
performance of the Mexican economy reflects domestic factors—including a 
crackdown on corruption that has delayed government spending, concerns about the  
government’s market -unfriendly policies, and problems at Pemex —and external  
factors, notably weakness in U.S. manufacturing production.  Construction activity, in  
particular, has continued to slide, and exports to the United States have weakened. As 
such, we expect growth to remain below 0.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  However, 
the projected pickup in U.S. manufacturing, together with monetary policy easing and 
a gradual turnaround in public investment, should support a pickup in  Mexican 
growth, albeit to a still-mediocre 2 percent by the second half of 2020.  Our  forecast is 
down in the near term—which, in part, reflects a larger-than-expected  effect of the 
GM strike on Mexican manufacturing activity —and a bit in the longer-term as well.
Twelve-month inflation remained at the target rate of 3 percent in October, but core 
inflation is still running high at 3.7 percent.  Citing weak growth, and given headline  
inflation at target and benign global financial conditions, the Bank of Mexico 
decreased its policy rate 25 basis points for a third time in a row to 7.5 percent.
•Brazil.  Incoming data for the third quarter suggest that the recovery is gaining a 
foothold.  Industrial output gained traction, which partly reflects a continued rebound  
in mining production following a dam collapse early this year.  Buoyant retail sales 
throughout the third quarter suggest that household demand is also improving,  
supported in part by low inflation, declining interest rates, and a mini fiscal stimulus 
that allows even employed workers to draw on their unemployment funds.  
Accordingly, we now estimate that real GDP grew 1.5 percent in the third quarter,

somewhat above our forecast in the October Tealbook.  We have  growth pick ing up 
to 2.6 percent by the end of 2020, supported by monetary policy easing and the boost 
to business confidence following the passage of the long -awaited pension reform last 
month.  W ith growth still relatively weak and 12-month inflation at an extremely 
subdued 2.5  percent  in October , the Brazil ian central bank  cut the benchmark Selic 
rate another 50 basis points, to 5.5 percent , and signaled another cut at its next 
meeting.

Financial Market Developments 
Over the intermeeting period, ass et prices moved with the waxin g and waning of 
sentiment regarding prospects for a “phase one” interim trade d eal between the United 
States and China.  Treasury yields ended the period down somewhat, while broad equity 
price indexes gained on net.  Foreign markets followed a similar pattern.  Short-term 
funding markets were sta ble over the period.   
 On net, nominal 2-, 10-, and 30-ye ar Treasury yields fell 3 bas is points, 
5 basis points, and 14 basis points, respectively.  Inflation compensation was 
little changed at both the 5-y ear and 5-to-10-year horizons. 
 A straight read of federal funds  futures options quotes implies  that investors 
assign around an 85 percent probability to the federal funds ta rget range 
remaining unchanged following the December FOMC meeting.  OIS quotes, unadjusted for term premiums, i mply a 30 basis point decline in the federal 
funds rate by the end of 2020.  In con trast, adjusting for staf f term premium 
estimates suggests some ambigu ity regarding the direction of th e expected 
path.  
 Broad equity price indexes incr eased about 3 percent.  Spreads on investment-
grade corporate bonds were lit tle changed, while spreads on spe culative-grade 
bonds widened slightly. 
 On net, most foreign equity index es posted slight increases, the broad dollar 
index edged higher, and long-term  AFE sovereign yields were lit tle changed. 
DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS  
Nominal U.S. Treasury yields wer e sensitive to news reports rel ated to trade 
negotiations between the United S tates and China, as they have been for much of the 
year.  Early in the intermeeting period, yields rose amid growi ng optimism about the 
outlook for the negotiations; howev er, as the prospect of an agreement in the near term 
became more uncertain, yields fel l.  Domestic and foreign econo mic data releases were in 
line with market expectations, on balance, and appeared to have  had little effect on 
Treasury yields on net.  Over  the period, nominal 2-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury yields fell

 3 basis points, 5 basis points, a nd 14 basis points, respectively, while the 5-year and 5-to-
10-year TIPS-based measures of i nflation compensation were litt le changed.  The spread
between 10-year and three-month Treasury yields and the near-term forward spread were
also little changed.  Both spr eads stand around 70 basis points above their respective
early September lows.
Relative to their recent peak around the time of the November 2 018 FOMC 
meeting, 5-to-10-year forward int erest rates and inflation compensation are down about 
1.4 percentage points and 0.4 percentage point, respectively.  The box “Financial Market 
Measures of the Neutral Real Rat e and Inflation Expectations since November 2018” 
examines those moves in more detail. 
Federal Reserve communications over the period were interpreted  by market 
participants as suggesting that additional near-term changes to  the target range for the 
federal funds rate are somewhat  less likely than had previously  been expected.  A straight 
read of the probability distribution for the federal funds rate  implied by options prices 
suggests that investors now assign a probability of around 85 p ercent to the target range 
remaining unchanged at the December FOMC meeting.  Looking furt her ahead, forward 
rates implied by OIS quotes declin ed modestly on net.  Unadjust ed for term premiums, 
the quotes imply about a 30 basis po int decline in the federal funds rate by the end of 
2020.  In contrast, quotes adjusted f or staff term premium esti mates suggest some 
ambiguity regarding the direc tion of the expected path.  The staff’s most commonly used 
term premium model suggests the market expects about a ¼ percen tage point increase 
over that period. 
The implied volatility of the one-y ear swap rate derived from s ix-month 
swaptions quotes declined over the intermeeting period, reachin g its lowest level since 
May.  The implied volatility of the 1 0-year swap rate was littl e changed.  Treasury cash 
market depth recovered somewhat from its trough in October but remains below its 
average level over recent years.  
Like Treasury yields, stock price movements were largely attrib uted to news 
about trade negotiations.  The t hird-quarter earnings season ne arly wrapped up over the 
period and had little apparent effect on the overall market.  C onsistent with the waxing 
and waning of perceived prospects for an interim deal, stock pr ices of firms with greater 
exposure to China outperformed early in the period before retra cing some of those gains.  
The S&P index increased 3.2 per cent on net.  One-month option-i mplied volatility on the

Financial  Market Measures  of the Neutral Real Rate and 
Inflation  Expectations  since  November  2018 
The 5‐ to‐10‐year nominal  forward interest rate implied  by the prices of U.S. 
Treasury securities  has risen about 0.3 percentage point,  on net, since its trough 
in late August.  However,  it remains about 1.4 percentage points  lower than  its 
peak around the November 2018 FOMC  meeting.   About 1 percentage  point of 
the net decline since November  2018  reflects 
a lower  real forward rate,  with the 
remainder reflecting  lower forward inflation  compensation.   This discussion  
examines  what these developments  tell us about perceptions  of the longer ‐run 
neutral real interest  rate and longer‐run expected  inflation.  
In the absence of risk  premiums,  5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ forward real rates  and inflation 
compensation  would be equal to 
expectations  of average short‐term  real rates  
and inflation,  respectively.  If we  additionally  assume that investors  expect the 
economy  to be operating  at potential  and the effects of transitory  shocks to have 
abated within 5 years, then the 5‐to‐ 10‐year‐ forward real rate also  provides  a 
measure of the perceived  longer‐run neutral  real  interest 
rate.  In practice, 
however,  risk premiums  can be sizable and  vary over time,  which means that 
forward rates do not provide clean measures  of expectations.   An alternative  
measure of expectations  that should be  free of risk premiums  is provided by  
survey forecasts.  However,  surveys are published  infrequently  and may measure  
financial market participants’  expectations  with errors  (because  expectations  
reported  by survey respondents  may not always be  representative  of the views 
of market participants).  
This discussion introduces  a new method for gauging expected  real interest rates 
and inflation rates based on nonlinear  regressions  of Blue Chip  survey forecasts  
of Treasury  bill yields 
and CPI inflation on Treasury  yields.1  The parts  of survey 
forecasts  that are explained  by the level of Treasury  yields provide  measures  of 
expected  interest rates and inflation,  while the  unexplained  parts are assumed  to 
be measurement errors.   Thus, the benefit of this new approach is  that it 
produces  estimates  of longer‐run expectations  that account for ter m premiums 
and measurement
 errors.  Moreover,  these regression‐ based expectations  can  be 
estimated  at a much higher frequency  (daily). 
Between  November  2018 and  late August  2019, the  estimated  expected  short‐
term real interest  rate from  5 to 10 years  ahead adjusted  for term premiums 
using the regression‐ based approach (the  dashed red line in figure 1) fell about  
1 The regressions  are local linear regressions  of Blue Chip survey expectations  on 6‐month, 
5‐year, and 10‐year yields.  Further details are provided  in Andrew Meldrum  (2019), “New 
Estimates  of the Natural Real Rate, Inflation Expectations,  and Term Premiums,” 
memorandum,  Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve System, Division of Monetary  
Affairs,  Octobe r 8.

0.8 percentage point on  net.  That decline  followed  a general downward  trend 
since the Global  Financial  Crisis.  Since August, the rate has risen about 0.2 
percentage point as  Treasury  yields have  recovered  somewhat,  and it currently  
stands at 0.2 percent.   The average CPI inflation expectation (the solid  blue line) 
from the regression‐ based approach is  little changed,  on net, since  November  
2018, at 2.2 percent.
2  However,  it has edged down 0.2 percentage  point since 
early 2014. 
Another measure  of long‐horizon interest rate and  CPI inflation expectations  is 
provided  by the staff’s term structure  model of  Treasury  yields.3  The term  
structure model  also assumes  that the part of survey forecasts  that cannot be 
explained  by the yield curve is measurement error.   The principal  differences  
compared  with the regression  approach are  that the term structure  model 
imposes theoretical  restrictions  and has less flexibility  to explain variation  in the 
surveys, so it can struggle  at times to capture  the broad movements  in the 
surveys.  Sinc e November  
2018, the  term structure  model points  to a somewhat 
smaller decline  in real interest rate expectations  (0.3  percentage point)  than the 
regressions  and a somewhat  larger decline in inflation expectations  
(0.2 percentage  point).  
As can be seen in the gray region in figure 2, estimates  of the longer‐run neutral  
real rate from  eight models, as  reported  in the Monetary  Policy Strategies  (MPS) 
section, have also been low  since the financial  crisis.  However,  the average of  
                                                 
2 This level of CPI inflation expectations  corresponds  to PCE inflation expectations  slightly 
below 2 percent,  based on the average historical  spread between  core CPI and PCE inflation. 
3 The staff model is explained  in Don Kim, Cait Walsh, and Min Wei (2019), “Tips from TIPS:  
Update and Discussions,”  FEDS Notes  (Washington:   Board of Governors  of the Federal 
Reserve System, May 21), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds ‐notes/tips ‐from‐

those estimates  (the black line) declined  sharply after the crisis and has since 
remained  fairly flat, whereas  the regression‐ based estimate has  declined  more 
steadily since  the crisis.  That difference  may be because most  of the models 
reported  in the MPS section incorporate  macroeconomic  data such as real 
activity and inflation measures,  whereas  financial market participants  may have 
been slower  to take those  data into account after the 
crisis.  That said, there are  
also notable  differences  among the estimates  from the models reported  in the 
MPS section.  For example,  the model of  Johannsen  and Mertens  (2016) (the 
green  line) tr acks the regression ‐based measure (the red line) relatively  closely 
and both were at similarly  low levels in the third quarter of 2019, which  may be 
because both  models capture the  low levels of long‐term Treasury  yields.4 
In conclusion,  market participants’  perceptions  of the longer ‐run neutral real 
interest rate  appear to have declined,  on net, since November  2018, even  as the 
average of the model‐ based estimates  reported  in the MPS  section remained  
fairly flat.  Evidence  on long‐horizon CPI inflation expectations  since November  
2018 is more mixed, although  they may have edged down since 2014.

historical distribution.  Yields  on investment-grade corporate bonds moved down along 
with Treasury yields, while yie lds on speculative-grade bonds r ose a bit, leaving their 
spreads over comparable-maturit y Treasury securities a tad wider. 
FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS  
Over the intermeeting period, sentiment in foreign financial markets fluctuated in 
response to headlines related to the U.S.–China trade negotiati ons.  Rising unrest in Hong 
Kong and Latin America garnered m arket attention but left limit ed imprint on broad 
financial markets.  On net, most foreign equity indexes posted slight increases, the broad 
dollar index edged higher, and long- term AFE sovereign yields w ere generally little 
changed.  Sentiment toward emerging market (EM) assets improved  somewhat, and 
flows into EM-dedicated bond and equity mutual funds turned pos itive following several 
months of outflows. 
The ongoing U.S.–China trade negotiations and political unrest in Hong Kong 
prompted some financial mark et volatility in China and Hong Kong, but the net changes 
in these markets’ asset prices  were modest and mixed.  Chinese equity indexes decreased 
somewhat but the currency appreciated 0.5 percent against the d ollar, temporarily 
strengthening past the psychologically important threshold of 7 yuan per dollar for the 
first time since the escalati on of trade tensions in early August.  Chinese assets were 
reportedly supported by a cut of 5 ba sis points in the lending facility rates as well as a 
series of liquidity injections  by the central bank.  Protests i ntensified in Hong Kong, 
leading to swings in financial m arkets, but asset prices were l ittle changed on net.  The

Political unrest intensified in s everal Latin American countries as well, but

optimism for the economy’s oil industry, pushed the real about 7 percent lower, 
offsetting the earlier boost from the passage of pension reform s.  Another sovereign 
default appears imminent in Arg entina, where the price of CDS o n sovereign bonds

 Prices of AFE risky assets a nd sovereign bonds broadly tracked the moves in 
similar U.S. assets.  Major AFE equity indexes increased modest ly, on net, and AFE 
long-term sovereign yields e nded the period little changed.  Ca nadian sovereign yields 
were an exception; the 10-year y ield declined 16 basis points, as market participants 
interpreted the Bank of  Canada’s domestic economic projections and communications as 
pointing to a more accommodative  policy stance than was expecte d.  
SHORT -TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FEDERAL RESERVE OPERATIONS  
Money markets were stable over the intermeeting period.  Intere st rates for 
overnight secured and unsecured lo ans fell in line with the 25 basis point decrease in the 
target range for the federal funds rate at the October FOMC meeting.  Trading in money 
markets has been orderly amid volumes within normal ranges, and  rates declined further 
relative to the IOER rate, likel y reflecting an increase in liq uidity through the Desk’s 
overnight and term repo operations .  The effective federal fund s rate and the secured 
overnight financing rate aver aged 1.57 percent and 1.60 percent , respectively.  Pressures 
on these rates at October mont h-end and November mid-month were muted compared 
with recent Treasury issuance  days.  To date, spreads on unsecu red private short-term 
instruments have not yet shown any notable imprint from year-en d pressures, and FX 
swap bases have remained low rel ative to recent year-ends.  (Th e box “Year-End Effects 
in Short-Term Funding Markets in Recent Years” provides additio nal analysis.)   
The Desk continued to conduct both temporary and permanent open  market 
operations aimed at maintaining a mple reserves and addressing m oney market pressures 
that could adversely affect pol icy implementation.  These opera tions have proceeded 
smoothly.  On November 14, the Desk also announced three longer -term repo operations 
with maturities extending beyond y ear-end as an additional step  to alleviate potential 
year-end pressures in money markets.  The first of these operat ions, conducted on 
November 25, had a $25 billion limit and was oversubscribed. 
Total assets held by money marke t funds were stable over the in termeeting 
period.  These funds continued to i ncrease their Treasury holdi ngs, but their holdings of 
repos edged down.

 Year‐ End Effects  in Short‐Term  Funding Markets  in Recent Years 
At recent  year‐ends, certain money  market segments  have exhibited  unusual volatility  
and elevated  funding costs, which have the potential  to affect market  functioning  and 
credit provision.   Historically,  year‐ end effects have reflected  a combination  of factors, 
including  balance sheet management  (“window  dressing”)  for financial  and 
regulatory  reporting  and the potential fo r coordinati on failures in these markets  
during the holidays,  as well as special factors that vary from year to year.1  Given the  
unexpected  volatility  in money markets in September  2019, there are  heightened  
concerns  about potential  pressures  going into the upcoming  year‐ end, even as the 
Federal Reserve  is providing  additional  liquidity.  
Year‐ end funding pressures  materialized  somewhat  differently  in 2017 and in 2018.  For  
example,  while Treasury  GC repo rates moved little at  the end of 2017, they  spiked 
substantially—far  more than anticipated—at  the end of 2018 (figure 1),  reportedly  in 
part because of  funding demands  arising from a Treasury auction  settlement on  
December  31.  In contrast,  three‐month FX swap bases rose sharply at the end  of 2017 
but were more subdued  at the end  of 2018 (figure  2), perhaps as firms obtained  
funding early in anticipation  of year‐ end pressures.2  Other segments,  such as markets 
for commercial  paper (CP)  and certificates  of deposit (CDs), have exhibited  more 
consistent  behavior from  year to year.   Money market funds and other investors  
typically pull  back from CP and CDs leading  up to year‐end, putting upward pressure  
on rates, particularly  in A2/P2‐rated CP (figure 3).  
Market
 commentary  indicates  some money market participants  are on edge heading 
into the end of 2019, in part because of  concerns  raised by the mid‐September   
  
                                                 
1 While  money markets tend to exhibit such dynamics  around other financial reporting  dates, 
such as quarter‐ ends,  the effects are typically more pronounced  around year‐ends.   
2 EUR–USD  and JPN–USD  FX swap basis.  The FX swap basis, usually calculated  as the difference  
between  the dollar  funding cost via an FX swap and LIBOR, reflects  the costliness  of “offshore”  
dollar  funding relative to the domestic  money market.

volatility 
in these markets.  Indeed, several of  the factors that contributed  to the 
volatility at the end  of 2018 and  in September  of this year will be  in play again.  Dealer 
positions  in Treasury  securities  remain elevated, and  there will again be  a sizable 
Treasury auction settlement on  December  31.  In addition,  market participants  have 
stated that regulatory  constraints  diminish their ability to supply  dollar liquidity.   
Market participants  and the Federal 
Reserve have undertaken  some extra 
preparations  for this year‐ end amid the heightened  uncertainty.   For example,  the 
share of nonfinancial  CP that currently  matures after year‐ end is about 15 percentage  
points higher than is typical at this time of year, and  other segments  of the CP and CD 
markets show slightly 
elevated shares of pre‐funding.  In  addition,  dealers have 
reportedly  been more  proactive  than usual in pressing  clients to seek alternative  
sources of funding at year‐end.  Finally, Federal Reser ve open  market operations—
Treasury bill purchases  and repo operations—will  increase the  availability  of financing  
to securities  dealers and help to maintain  ample levels of reserves  through year‐ end.  
The first operation offering  term repo maturing  beyond year‐ end was conducted  on 
November  25 and was significantly  oversubscribed.   Mark et participants  have no ted 
that these  operations  have helped ease some concerns  about year‐end pressures.    
Thus far, we have seen only  limited evidence  of heightened  year‐ end funding 
pressures.   Anecdotal  reports suggest term repo rates are  slightly elevated compared  
with this time last year.  In contrast,  increases  in three‐month FX swap bases and 
three‐ month CD spreads have so far
 been smaller than is  typical for this time of year.  
To be sure, the illiquidity  of some term money markets limits their reliability  in 
indicating  pressures  until closer to year‐end.  While issuers  are being more proactive  
than usual in obtaining  funding ahead of year‐ end, it is too early to predict the extent 
of potential  ye
ar‐end funding pressures.

Financing Conditions for Businesses and Households 
Information received over the intermeeting period suggests that financing 
conditions for businesses and households remain supportive of spending and economic 
activity on balance.  While there is some evidence that demand for financing by businesses may hav e weakened, borrowing volumes generally remained solid, likely 
supported by the decline in borrowing costs witnessed over the past year.  
• Gross issuance of investment - and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined 
in October after a strong September but has returned to a robust pace thus far in November.  Institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be solid.   
• C&I loans held by banks contracted in October, likely reflecting a decline in borrower demand reported in the October SLOOS. 
• CMBS issuance reached a post -crisis high in October, as declining interest 
rates have increased the incentive of mortgage borrowers to refinance.  CRE loan growth at banks picked up relative to recent quarters. 
• Home -purchase mortgage originations remained near the post -crisis high in 
September, and refinancing increased again in October to a multiyear high.  
• Consumer credit conditions remained supportive of spending overall, although 
supply conditions continued to be tight for nonprime borrowers. 
BUSINESS FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Nonfinancial Businesses  
Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remain accommodative on balance.  
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds declined mostly in line with comparable-
maturity Treasury yields over the intermeeting period, while yields  on speculative- grade 
corporate bonds increased modestly.  Both are near historical lows and are substantially 
lower than the recent peaks in late 2018.  Spreads for investment-grade bonds were little 
changed, while spreads for speculative- grade corporate bonds increased somewhat.   
Gross issuance of both investment - and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined in 
October after a strong September but have returned to robust levels in November.  Net

 corporate bond issuance so far  in 2019 has been substantially above that for 2018 and 
comparable with  the large volumes seen from 2015 to 2017.   
Interest rate spreads for newly issued lower -rated institutional loans were roughly 
unchanged, while spreads for higher- rated loans tightened somewhat.  Both remain well 
below their levels early in 2019.  New money institutional leveraged loan issuance in 
October was solid, remaining near 2019 monthly averages and slightly below the rate for 2017 and 2018.  The majority of new money issuance was driven by acquisition activity, 
while refinancing volume increased to the highest level since 2017.     
Interest rates on C&I loans declined notably in the third quarter after being flat in 
the first half of 2019.  C&I loans held by banks contracted in October after growing 
slowly in the third quarter, consistent with the weaker demand for C&I loans reported in 
the October SLOOS.  Available data suggest that C&I loans will grow modes tly in 
November.  
The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations has deteriorated s lightly in recent 
months but remains solid overall.  The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of downgrades in October, and the KMV expected year- ahead 
default rate stayed near the midpoint of its historical distribution.  Leveraged l oan rating 
downgrades to triple -C have also trended up since the beginning of this year.   
Gross equity issuance of both initial and seasoned offerings declined in October 
after a particularly strong September but were only slightly below the average volumes 
over the past few years.  Preliminary data from November show a more pronounced decline.  Reports suggest that sentiment in the initial public offerings (IPO s) market has 
turned more negative following the withdrawal of a high- profile IPO in September and 
the poor performance of several others earlier in the year. 
Small Businesses  
After having fallen from May through August, loan volumes to small businesses 
were stable in September at a level that was only slightly above that from a year ago.  Data suggest that demand for credit from small businesses has weakened in recent 
months, with the share of firms not interested in borrowing rising slightly over the past 
year.  Moreover, small business optimism is well below levels from a year ago.  Meanwhile, credit supply to small businesses remained stable and relatively 
accommodative.  The share of firms reporting that it was somewhat or very difficult to

 obtain credit over the past 12 months ticked down to a post- crisis low.  Recent loan 
performance continues to deteriorate slightly but remains strong by historical standards.  
Commercial Real Estate  
Financing conditions for CRE remained generally accommodative.  Triple- B 
CMBS spreads widened slightly but remained near the low end of their post- crisis range.  
Declining interest rates have supported strong CMBS issuance, in part because the 
incentive of mortgage borrowers to refinance has increased.  Agency and non-agency CMBS issuance continued to increase in October and reached a post -crisis high.  CRE 
loan growth at banks also picked up in October relative to recent quarters, boosted by growth in the nonfarm nonresidential and construction and land development categories.  
Municipal Government Financing Conditions  
Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative.  Gross 
issuance of municipal bonds was strong in October, with refinancing accounting for the majority of the issuance.  Municipal bond yields and spreads in both the secondary and 
primary  markets were little changed, though it bears noting that the municipal yields 
remain near the record -low levels reached this summer.  The credit quality of general 
obligation bonds has improved in recent months, with the number of credit rating upgrades continuing to outpace that of downgrades.  
HOUSEHOLD FINANCING CONDITIONS  
Residential Real Estate  
Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed, on 
balance, over the intermeeting period .  Home mortgage interest rates moved down 
13 basis points, slightly more than yields on 10- year Treasury securities.  Mortgage rates 
are 17 basis points above their early October lows but still about 60 basis points below 
their average of the first half of the year and about 1 40 basis points below last November .  
This year’s decline in rates has boosted home-purchase originations and refinancing.  
Mortgage credit standards—as measured by staff estimates of lenders’ maximum 
available debt- to-income ratios—were little changed at somewhat tighter levels than in 
the early 2000s.

  Consumer Credit 
Overall, financing conditions in consumer credit markets continued to be 
supportive of growth in consumer spending.  Credit card debt grew at a solid pace as 
interest rates began to fall  in the third quarter.  Auto loan  growth has picked up in 2019, 
coinciding with a significant decline in auto loan interest rates this year.  Student loan growth remained solid  through September.  (See the box “The Effect of Student Debt on 
Borrowing in Other Credit Markets” for a discussion of how student loan debt affects 
access to and demand for other forms of household credit. )  Consumer ABS issuance was 
strong through October as spreads remained at levels that are somewhat above their post -
crisis avera ges.  While conditions are generally supportive, supply remains tight for 
nonprime borrowers.  For example, credit card limits are well below the pre -crisis level, 
and credit scores on used auto loan originations are significantly higher than a few years 
ago. 
FINANCING AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS INDEXES  
A staff index that provides a measure of financing conditions for nonfinancial 
corporations indicates that financing conditions eased modestly as equity prices increased over the intermeeting period and has r emained accommodative relative to historical 
standards.  As shown in the appendix to this Tealbook section, the average reading of 
other publicly available financial conditions indexes, which aggregate a large set of 
financial variables into summary series, also points to slightly easier financial conditions over the intermeeting period.  Overall, these indexes indicate that broad financial 
conditions are either accommodative or close to a neutral level relative to historical 
standards and are signaling con siderably easier conditions than at the start of the year.

 The Effect of Student Debt on Borrowing in Other Credit Markets  
Student loan borrowing has risen rapidly in recent years.  Outstanding student loan balances owed 
by U.S. households now stand at approximately $1.6 trillion, the second largest category of 
household debt behind residential mortgages.  This increasingly bu rdensome form of debt has the 
potential to markedly change borrowers’ financial behavior and outcomes.  For example, Mezza, 
Ringo, Sherlund , and Sommer show that increased student loan debt causes a reduction in access 
to mortgage loans, which is at least partly driven by negative effects of increased student loan delinquencies on credit scores.
1  In this discussion , we show that, while increased student loan debt 
reduces borrowing in more tightly underwritten credit markets (such as those for mortgages and  
credit card debt), all else being equal, it leads to additional borrowing in credit markets with easier 
credit standards (such as those for auto and other nonhousing collateralized debts).  
 The effect of early -life student loan debt on borrowing in other forms of consumer credit later in 
life is theoretically ambiguous.  On the demand side, larger student loan debt service payments 
mean that a lesser amount of borrower s’ income is available for other uses, so households making 
student loan payments may limit their other spending and borrow less to finance outlays, thereby 
reducing their demand for nonstudent debt.  However, having lower disposable income (all else 
being equal) due to student loan payments also means that households choosing to maintain a  
given level of spending may rely more on debt financing than cash financing for their purchases, 
thereby increasing their demand for debt.    
 On the supply side, if increased student loan borrowing leads to a deterioration of borrowers’ credit 
profiles, then higher student loan obligations could reduce willingness to supply other forms of 
consumer credit to these borrowers.  For example, l enders focused on debt- to-income ratios may 
ration credit more tightly to individuals with higher levels of student loan debts on their credit records.  Moreover, if higher student loan payments result in borrowers being delinquent on any of their  debt  obligations , some lenders are likely to restrict their willingness to extend additional credit 
to these individuals.
2  Either way, taking on student loan debts early in life could end up restricting 
borrowers’ access to credit later on, presumably to a greater extent in more tightly underwritten markets.
3   
 In the figure, we show the estimated effect of  a 10 percent increase in student loans disbursed early 
in life (that is, by age 22) on the probability of a person having other types of debt from ages 22 to 32, holding other factors  constant.
4  The top panels plot estimated effects for the more tightly 
underwritten forms of debt —home mortgages (top left) and credit cards (top right).  The bottom 
two panels show estimated effects on the less tightly underwritten forms —auto loans (bottom 
                                                 
1 See Alvaro Mezza, Daniel Ringo, Shane Sherlund, and Kamila  Sommer (forthcoming), “S tudent Loans and 
Homeownership,”  Journal of Labor Economics . 
2 Mezza and others (forthcoming) find that increased student loan balances increase the likelihood borrowers 
will become delinquent on their student loans (all else being equal), but the authors find no evidence of an effect on 
the probability of becoming delinquent on other forms of consumer debt.  
3 There are potential countervailing forces to these mechanisms as well, however.  A change in the supply of 
credit could also cause consumers to substitute the form of their borrowing.  For example, if credit card borrowing  
becomes less available to those with low credit scores, applicants with derogatory information on their credit record 
may choose more easily accessible forms of borrowing , such as goods- secured loans , to maintain the desired level of 
consumption.

 left) and other collateralized consumer loans (bottom right), that is, loans secured by goods or an 
installment sales contract.5  For each type of debt, the solid lines represent the estimated effect, 
while the dashed lines show 90 percent confidence intervals .  A 10 percent increase in early -life 
student loan borrowing reduces the age- specific probability of having a mortgage about 
1.5 percentage points on average.  The effect is also negative for credit cards and is of a similar size.  
In marked contrast, the same increase in student loans increases the probability of a pe rson having 
an auto loan or other collateralized consumer debt about 2 to 2.5 percentage points on average.  In 
additional analysis (not shown), we find that increased student loan debt causes a decline in limits on credit card accounts but an increase in the utilization rates of credit cards.  This finding support s 
the premise that higher student debt could reduce the supply of credit available from credit cards but stimulates to some extent the demand for such  credit.  
 
 In summary, our analysis suggests that increased student loan obligations result in differential effects on total borrowing by market segment by interacting differentially with the demand and 
supply of credit.   In credit markets with more stringent underwriting, increasing student loan 
burdens can lead to a reduction in borrowing, likely because of  a contraction in credit supply  (that 
is,  either through a reduction in entry to the credit market or through a reduction in credit limits ).  
In contrast, in credit markets where underwriting is less tight, higher  levels of student debt can lead 
to additional borrowing.  As such, the ready availability of credit in these markets mitigates any potential contractionary effect that student loan debt service might have on borrowers’ spending . 
 
 
 
 
                                                 
5 For example, these debts are used to finance furniture and household appliances.  These loans have an 
average maturity of one  to three  years , and the average loan size is about $3 ,000.

Appendix 
Technical Note on Financial Conditions Indexes 
The table “Overview of Selected FCIs” provides a summary of various financial conditions 
indexes (FCIs) that have been developed at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere.  The historical 
evolution of these indexes is reported in the exhibit “Selected Financial Conditions Indexes .”

The first index in the table, the s taff FCI for nonfinancial corporations , measures financing 
conditions for nonfinancial corporations.1  This index is constructed as the difference in equity returns 
between two portfolios of firms with credit ratings above and just below investment grade.  To the extent 
that speculative-grade firms are more sensitive to changes in financing conditions than investment -grade 
firms but have similar exposure to other shocks, movements in this index provide a measure of changes in 
financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations.   
The second index in the table  measures the net share of domestic banks reporting tighter lending 
standards across all core loan categories in the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending 
Practices.  Banks’ responses for a given loan category are weighted by banks’ holdings of those loans on 
their balance sheets.2 
The other FCIs are constructed by aggregating a large set of financial variables into a summary 
series using various statistical methods.  While these indexes provide a useful summary of broad financial market developments, the movements in these indexes may reflect both changes in financing conditions 
and other shocks to the economy.

Businesses and Households section of the September 2018 Tealbook A.

John C. Driscoll, and Egon Zakrajsek (2014), “ Changes in Bank Lending Standards and the Macroeconomy,” 
Journal of Monetary Economics,  vol. 62  (March) , pp. 23–40.  The current index uses a new weighting approach for 
each loan category .

Risks and Uncertainty  
ASSESSMENT OF RISKS
We continue to judge that the risks around our baseline projection for GDP are tilted to 
the downside .  However , as we will discuss, we see the downside risks as having diminished 
some what  over the past month.  Among the most salient risks, trade policies and foreign 
economic developments seem more likely to move in directions that would create a significant 
drag on domestic activity than to resolve more favorably  than assumed.  In addition, the softness 
in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year could be pointing to a more substantial slowing in economic growth than we currently recognize.  Among risks to the upside, many of the underlying fundamentals for household spending and business investment remain 
solid, and financial conditions remain favorable.  In these circumstances, spending could expand 
at a pace that is faster than in the staff projection.  Altho ugh we view the current circumstances 
as quite uncertain, we judge the overall degree of uncertainty as being broadly in line with the average over the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC); notably, that period includes the most recent two recess ions along with a number of other episodes with elevated uncertainty 
and market volatility.   
Model- based measures of recession risks have fallen noticeably since the October 
Tealbook.  As shown in the bottom table of the “Assessment of Key Macroeconomic R isks” 
exhibit, the estimated probability of moving into recession over the next year based on a term-spread model has moved down to 49 percent from 57 percent.  However, these estimate s should 
be interpreted with some caution given the long sample period over which the model is estimated and secular trends—particularly declining term premiums —that may materially affect its 
predictions.  The recession probability estimate from a model- averaging framework that uses a 
selection of both r eal and financial variables is 8 percent, compared with 22 percent in the 
October Tealbook, and is now notably lower than the unconditional probability.  The increase in the term spread is an important factor behind the decline in the recession risk for both models.   
The exhibits on the next two pages provide alternative perspectives on the chance of an 
adverse outcome in the period ahead.  According to the exhibit “Time-Varying Macroeconomic Risk 1 Year Ahead,” the projected distribution of misses around the Tealbook forecast over the 
next four quarters does not appear particularly wide or skewed.  In contrast, the exhibit “Conditional Distributions of Macroeconomic Variables 2 Years Ahead” shows that, at the two-

10-year and 3-month Treasury yields. “Unconditional” is calculated using NBER recession dating from 1973:Q1 to the most
recent quarter with a BEA estimate of GDP.

year horizon, current conditions suggest that the risks are skewed to the downside for GDP 
growth and to the upside for the unemployment rate, albeit to a lesser extent than in recent months.  The narrowing of the two -year-ahead distributions is driven primarily by the decline in 
the term -spread -based recession  probability, which is used as an input into the conditional 
distribution model.    
As indicated in the exhibit “Effective Lower Bound Risk Estimate,” the estimated 
probability of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) over the next three years is  
24 percent , similar to the estimate in recent Tealbooks .  The probability rises to 36 percent by the 
end of the medium term as the distribution of outcomes around the baseline naturally widens farther into the future.  A return of the federal funds rate to the ELB may leave monetary policy with less capacity to offset significant negative economic shocks than positive ones, contributing to the downside skew in economic outcomes.   
With regard to inflation, we view the risks to the projection as slanted to the downside—
in part because of the downside risks to economic activity.  Moreover, inflation has been running low over the past year, and longer-run inflation expectations could currently be lower than we recognize.  Also, if downside risks abroad materializ e, the exchange value of the dollar could 
appreciate more than expected and put downward pressure on inflation.  There are also risks to the upside.  For example, an extended period with unusually tight resource utilization could lead 
to greater upward pre ssure on wages and prices,
 consistent with the predictions of models that 
emphasize nonlinear effects of resource utilization on inflation.  In addition, further increases in 
trade barriers could lead to temporarily higher inflation.   
All of these inflation risks would tend to be of modest size as long as inflation 
expectations remained reasonably well anchored.  The risks could increase substantially in either 
direction if expectations were to follow actual inflation up or down.  Such movements in expectations could induce changes in inflation to build on themselves and thus lead inflation to deviate significantly and persistently from 2 percent.  Notwithstanding these concerns, we judge the overall degree of uncertainty to be about the same as over the past 20 years.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS 
To illus trate s ome of  the risks  to the outlook, we construct alternatives to the baseline 
projection using simulations of staff models.1 
Weaker Labor Demand [GS T model] 
Published pr ivate employment gains have slowed f rom 215,000 betwee n April 2018 and 
March 2019 to a n average  of 133,000 jobs per month be tween A pril and  October 2019.  While 
such employment gains remain a bove the p ace consistent with a s table une mployment rate, th e 
box “Alternative View:  The Labor  Market Is i n a Pr ecarious Position”  in the  Domestic 
E
conomic Developments and Outlook section suggests that the gains may have been smaller 
still.  Based on their analysis of data from the payroll processing firm ADP, the authors of the 
box argue that t he true underlying p ace of r ecent  employment gains could be cl oser to 70,000 
jobs per month.  In this scenario, we consider the implications of this risk and assume that labor 
demand is weaker than in the staff projection, primarily because a ggregate demand  growth is 
slower t han w e currently recognize and  remains  soft through n ext year.  W e assume that 
employment gains  are about 50 pe rcent  low er than i n the staff ba s eline project ion over the next 
four quarters and slowly converge to the staff projection t hereafter .   
Under these assumptions, GDP growth slows to 1.8 pe rcent  in 2020.  T h e unemployment 
r
ate gradually moves up to 3.9 pe rcent  by mid 202 1, an inc rease t hat ha s often been as sociated 
w
ith a fragil e economy.  Core PCE inflation fails to move back toward 2 percent and stands at 
1.7 pe rcent  in 2022.  With inflation and t he out put ga p bot h running below the st aff forecast, the 
federal funds rate fluctuates around 2 percent until 2025, 0.6 pe rcent age point lower than in the 
staff forecast.

quite strong, but also that the very tight  labor conditions in the baseline projection have persistent

positive effects on the productive capacity of the economy, a phenomenon often referred to as 
“positive hysteresis.”2  Exposure to a hot economy encourages workers to remain in  the labor 
force and motivate s others to join, which could persistently increase labor force attachment .  In 
this scenario , we assume that the trend labor- force participation rate rise s about 1 percentage 
point above the baseline by the end of 2025.  Furthermore, we assume that the experience that workers gain through greater employment lowers the natural rate of unemployment 0.5 per centage point over that period.  We assume that policymakers recognize both of these 
favorable developments in real ti me. 
As a result  of these developments, potential output rises, on average, 0.3 percentage point 
more per year through 2025 than in the baseline.  This additional room to grow allows GDP to expand faster .  The initial increase in GDP growth is slightly belo w the pickup in potential 
growth becaus e the inertial  monetary policy rule does not ease the funds rate quickly enough 
relative to baseline in response to the improvements in the supply-side conditions.  Initially, the 
unemployment rate remains close to  baseline because increases in labor force participation  offset 
the effect of greater gains in employment.  T he unemployment rate eventually follows a lower 
trajectory and is about 0.2 percentage point below the staff projection by 2025.  With inflation roughly at the baseline and with the muted response to the output gap from the staff policy rule, 
the federal funds rate is little changed.  
Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds  Rate [SW model] 
While the staff assumes that the long -run equilibrium real fed eral funds rate, rLR, has 
declined over the past two decades, some estimates suggest it may be even lower than  we 
currently assume.  Competing explanations for the decline in rLR have different implications for 
the baseline projection.  In this scenario, w e posit that structural productivity growth is 
0.5 percentage point below baseline over the projection period, which, according to the Smets-Wouters model that we use for this scenario, will result in a 70  basis  point decline in r
LR.  We 
also assume that p olicymakers only gradually recognize that  rLR is lower.3

about the new value of the long- run equilibrium real rate.

The initial effects of the assumed productivity slowdown are relatively benign.  Because 
businesses are less productive, they initially hire more workers to meet demand, and the 
unemployment rate declines to 3.3 percent by the end of 2022.  The lower pace of productivity growth puts upward pressure on firms’ marginal costs, and inflation is slightly above baseline, 
running at 2.0 percent  in 2021 and 2022.  GDP rises only 1.8 percent in 2021 and 1.5 percent in 
2022, as the slower pace of productivity growth is not completely offset by the gains in  
employment.  The unemployment rate remains below baseline, but real wages are lower.  The 
federal funds rate path is only 0.2 percentage point below baseline at the beginning of 2021, because policymakers do not recognize the tightness of their policy stance for a while and respond to the higher inflation and lower unemployment rate by raising rates.  
By 2025, GDP growth is 0.5 percentage point below baseline and monetary policymakers 
have fully learned about the lower r
LR.  However, inflation remains at  2 percent, and the output 
gap remains positive .  Because of this drawn-out adjustment process, the federal funds rate is 
still above its new long-run value by the end of 2025, though it is down 0.3 percentage point 
relative to baseline .  In the longer run, the economy converges to its new less- favorable steady 
state, where households have a lower standard of living and policymakers have less spa ce to ease 
in the event of an adverse shock. 
Stronger Aggregate Demand [FRB/US model] 
While  we view  aggregate risk as remain ing skewed to the downside, the downside risk 
appears to have eased in recent months.  Moreover, many of the underlying fundamentals for 
household spending remain solid, including strong labor market conditions, low interest rates, and high levels of net wealth.  And it is possible that the recent weakness in business investment, which can be quite volatile from quarter to quarter, will turn out to be more transitory than 
projected.  In this scenario, we assume that consumer spending and, in turn, investment expand 
at a faster pace than in the baseline.  We also assume that these favorable conditions  result in a 
larger cyclical response in labor force participation than in the baseline , which attenuates 
somewhat the decline in the unemployment rate.  
Under these assumptions, GDP increases 2.8 percent, on average, in 2020 and 2021, a 
pace comparable with that in 2017 and 2018, and the unemployment rate declines to 3 percent by the end of 2021.  Inflatio n increases slightly, reaching 2.1 percent in 2025.  In response to the 
stronger economy, the federal funds rate rises relative to the baseline, reaching 3  percent in 2025.

Foreign Slowdown [SIGMA  model] 
Foreign growth t his year is ex pected t o be the weakest s ince the  global f inancial crisis, 
held down by trade tensions, a global manufacturing slump, and political developments in a 
number of economies.  In our baseline, we see foreig n growth picking up as these headwinds 
ease and monetary policy abroad remains highly accommodative.  However, trade and political 
tensions could intensify and the global manufacturing weakness could persist, weighing on 
consumer and business confidence and resulting in a deterioration of financial conditions.  
This scenario envisions that in both the AFEs and the EMEs, aggregate demand weakens, 
corporate borrowing spreads widen 100 basis points, and equity prices decline sharply.  F oreign 
GDP g rowth steps down to a meager 1 percent in 2020, 1.2 percentage points below  baseline.  
The financial tightening a broad a nd concerns about the foreign outlook prompt a 50 basis point 
rise in corporate borrowing spreads in the United States, while flight- to-safety f lows l ead  to a 
7 per
cent appreciati on of the dollar.   
Weaker foreign dema nd, the stronger dollar, and the  adverse financial s pillovers caus e 
U.S. economic activity to slow.  In particular , GDP growth falls to 1.4 percent in 2020, 
0.7 percentage point below the baseline, and t he unemployment rate r is es to 4 percent  in 2022.  
Lower resource utilization and falling import prices reduce core PCE inflation to 1.4 pe rcent  in 
2020.  
In response to modest output growth and muted inflation, the federal funds rate runs about 
1 percentage point below the baseline through 2023. 
Easing of Trade Tensions [SIGMA model] 
The projected pickup i n global activity in t he baseline builds on the assumption that some 
of the heat of trade tensions will dissipate.  However, positive news on trade policy, such as the 
ratification  of a phase-one trade deal be tween t he United S tates a nd China, may spur a somewhat 
faster cooling of trade tensions and reduction in t rade unc ertainty than envisioned in our baseline 
and result in an improvement of business and consumer sentiment around the world.   
In this scenario, w e assume t hat the  United States and China agree to a truce and roll back 
the tariffs announ ced i n early S eptember ( that i s, the United S tates r emoves t he 15 pe rcent  tariff 
im
posed on $100 billi on of imports from China, and China removes its retaliatory measures).  In 
addi
tion, w e assume no  new tariffs are imposed on imports fr om China, Congress ratifies the 
United S tates–Mexico–Canada t rade agreement, and an agreement to forgo tariffs on imported 
autos  is reached;  as a result, uncertainty about tra de policy diminishes.  T hese developments 
lessen somewhat the drag on economic activity and lead to some improvement in global

sentiment and asset prices, with stock prices around the world increasing about 5 percent by 
early 2020.  Optimism about the global outlook also  contributes to a moderate depreciation  of the 
dollar.  All told, the level of foreign GDP is 0.5 percent above the baseline through 2021.   
Stronger foreign demand and the depreciation of the dollar cause U.S. GDP growth to 
edge up to 2.5 percent in 2020, 0.4 percentage point above the baseline.  The U.S. unemployment rate declines about 0.2 percentage point below the baseline over the forecast period .  With a 
tighter labor market and a depreciating dollar, core PCE inflation reaches 2 percent  in 2020.  
Accordingly, the federal funds rate is a tad higher than in the baseline, reaching 2.6 percent by 
2021.  The relatively modest effects of this easing of trade tensions on the U.S. economy reflect the assumption that, in this scenario, the majority of the recently enacted tariffs remain in place and some trade policy uncertainty persists. 
ALTERNATIVE MODEL FORECASTS  
As shown in the “Alternative Model Forecasts” exhibit, the FRB/US model projects that 
GDP will grow 1.9 percent, on average, over the next three years , similar to the Tealbook 
baseline outlook.4  This projection  represents an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point, on 
average, relative to the FRB/US projection shown in the previous Tealbook.  The stronger forecast  is largely  the consequence of  rolling forward the initial forecast period  (now 2020: Q1) 
by one quarter and  hence  taking on board key macroeconomic variables from the judgmental 
forecast for the fourth  quarter  (rather than the third quarter , as last round).  Importantly, t he 
model pr ojection  now fully incorporates the recent cuts in the federal  funds rate and jumps off 
from the staff forecast of inflation for the  end of this year, which is noticeably  lower than the 
model’s predicted value in October.
5  These changes imply a more accommodative monetary 
policy going forward .  The model’s projection of potential output growth  is also revised up 
a touch.   
This brighter constellation of easier financial conditions and a slightly stronger  supply 
side, in turn, support higher equity pri ces over the projection period.  A resilient stock market 
4 We condition the FRB/US forecast on staff projection s for federal government spending and tax policies , 
foreign GDP growth,  foreign inflation, and the paths of the U .S. dollar and oil prices .  The federal funds rate is 
governed by the same specification for the policy rule used in the baseline.   
5  The model forecast now fully incorporates the 50  basis  point decline from the September and October 
FOMC meetings.  In the previous Tealbook, the model’s third -quarter observation of the federal funds rate was 
based on an average of daily observations over the whole quarter and, hence , hardly reflected the rate cut from the 
September meeting.

 and solid momentum in consumption growth during 2019 are sufficient for  the model to predict 
that consumption will grow 2.4 percent, on average, over the next few years .  Significantly 
weighing agai nst robust private domestic demand is the  model’s negative outlook for net exports, 
as growth in the U.S. economy is relatively strong compared with  growth in the rest of the world 
and the model’s forecasting procedure carries forward some of the recent weakness in exports.  
On net, GDP  rises at  close to its potential pace of  about 2.0 percent over the next two years and , 
consequently, the estimate of the output gap hovers around 1.6 percent  during that period.  T he 
unemployment rate moves up gradually and reaches 4.1 percent by  the end of 2022, well below 
the model’s natural rate estimate of 4. 6 percent.  Core inflation increases from 1.6 percent in 
2019 to 2.0 percent, on average, over the next three years.  
The EDO model projects GDP growth to average 1.8 percent over the next three years, a 
touch below the model’s estimate of the growth in potential output.  Favorable risk premiums 
and accommodative monetary policy have boost ed the level of aggregate demand over the past 
few years , and the waning support from those factors causes growth to fall below its potential 
pace over  2020 and 2021.   
The EDO model predicts core inflation will rise  to 2.2 percent in 2020 and 2.5 percent in 
2021 before moving down to 2.4 at the end of the medium term.  From the model’s perspective, wage gains have been surprisingly weak given the strength of aggregate demand, and the 
sluggish wage gains have, in turn, held down inflation.  In the forecast, the model predicts wage growth to step up, causing inflation to overshoot its longer- run level .  Over the medium term, 
inflation remains above the FOMC’s 2 percent objective because of  the previously mentioned 
supportive aggregate demand conditions.

Appendix 
Technical Note on “Predictio n Intervals Derived from  
Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors”   
This technical note provides additional details about the exhib it “Prediction Intervals 
Derived from Historical Tealbook Forecast Errors.”  In the four  large fan charts, the black dotted 
lines show staff projections and current estimates of recent va lues of four key economic variables:  
average unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of each year an d the Q4/Q4 percent change for 
real GDP, total PCE prices, and core PCE prices.  (The GDP series is adjusted to use GNP for 
those years when the staff forecast GNP and to strip out softwa re and intellectual property 
products from the currently pub lished data for years preceding their introduction.  Similarly, the 
core PCE inflation series is adjusted to strip out the “food aw ay from home” component for years 
before it was included in core.)   
The historical distributions of the corresponding series (with the adjustments described 
above) are plotted immediately to the right of each of the fan charts.  The thin black lines show 
the highest and lowest values of  the series during the indicate d time period.  At the bottom of the 
page, the distributions over three different time periods are p lotted for each series.  To enable the 
use of data for years prior to 1947, we report annual-average data in this section.  The annual data going back to 1930 for GDP growth, PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation are available in the 
conventional national accounts; w e used estimates from Lebergot t (1957) for the unemployment 
rate from 1930 to 1946.
1 
The prediction intervals around the current and one-year-ahead forecasts are derived from 
historical staff forecast errors, comparing staff forecasts wit h the latest published data.  For the 
unemployment rate and real GDP growth, errors were calculated f or a sample starting in 1980, 
yielding percentiles of the sizes of the forecast errors.  For PCE and core PCE inflation, errors 
based on a sample beginning in 1998 were used.  This shorter ra nge reflects both more limited 
data on staff forecasts of PCE inflation and the staff judgment  that the distribution of inflation 
since the mid-1990s is more appropr iate for the projection peri od than distributions of inflation 
reaching further back.  In all cas es, the prediction intervals are computed by adding the percentile 
bands of the errors onto the forecast.  The blue bands encompas s 70 percent prediction-interval 
ranges; adding the green bands expands this range to 90 percent.  The dark blue line plots the median of the prediction interv als.  There is not enough histor ical forecast data to calculate 
meaningful 90 percent ranges fo r the two inflation series.  A m edian line above the staff forecast 
means that forecast errors were positive more than half of the time.

Because the staff has produced two-year-ahead forecasts for onl y a few years, the 
intervals around the two-year-ahead forecasts are constructed by augmenting the staff projection 
errors with information from outside forecasters:  the Blue Chi p consensus, the Council of 
Economic Advisers, and the Congr essional Budget Office.  Specifically, we calculate prediction 
intervals for outside forecasts in the same manner as for the staff forecasts.  We then calculate the change in the error bands from outside forecasts from one year ahead to two years ahead and 
apply the average change to the staff’s one-year-ahead error bands.  That is, we assume that any 
deterioration in the performance between the one- and two-year- ahead projections of the outside 
forecasters would also apply to the Tealbook projections.  Limi tations on the availability of data 
mean that a slightly shorter sample is used for GDP and unemplo yment, and the outside 
projections may only be for a s imilar series, such as total CPI instead of total PCE prices or 
annual growth rates of GDP instead of four-quarter changes.  In particular, because data on forecasts for core inflation by these outside forecasters are m uch more limited, we did not 
extrapolate the staff’s errors for core PCE inflation two years  ahead. 
The intervals around the historical data in the four fan charts  are based on the history of 
data revisions for each series.  The previous-year, two-year-ba ck, and three-year-back values as 
of the current Tealbook forecast are subtracted from the corres ponding currently published 
estimates (adjusted as described earlier) to produce revisions,  which are then combined into 
distributions and revision intervals in the same way that the p rediction intervals are created.

Monetary Policy  Strategies  
In this section, we discuss a range of strategies for setting the federal funds rate 
and compare the associated interest rate paths and macroeconomic outcomes with those 
in the Tealbook baseline projecti on.  In the near term, reflecting recent reductions i n the 
federal funds rate , those  policy strategies that incorporate  interest rate inertia prescribe 
lower values of the federal funds rate than in the October Tealbook.   Over the medium 
term, the policy strategies generally prescribe somewhat higher policy rates than in the 
October Tealbook , mainly because of  the upwardly revised level of resource utilization 
over the forecast period .  An additional exhibit provides updated estimates of the 
equilibrium real federal funds rate in the long er run.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS  OF SELECTED  SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhibit shows near-term prescriptions for the federal 
funds rate from four simple policy rules:  the inertial version of the Taylor  (1999)  rule, 
the Taylor  (1993) rule, a first-difference rule, and  a flexible price -level targeting  (FPLT ) 
rule.1  These near-term prescriptions take as given the Tealbook baseline projections for  
the output gap and core inflation , which are shown in the middle panels .2  The top and 
middle panel s also provide the staff’s baseline path for the federal funds rate . 
The current near-term prescriptions are lower than those reported in the
October Tealbook , especially for rules  that display interest rate inertia .  For
those  inertial rules, the lower initial  level of the federal funds rate , which
reflects recent policy actions, largely passes through to the near -term
prescriptions .  In addition , over the next two quarters, the staff projects
slightly higher resource utilization and slightly lower core PCE inflation than
in the October Tealbook.  However, t hese latter revisions, by themselves,
imply small and mostly offsetting effects on the rules’ prescriptions.
1 The appendix  in this Tealbook section provides technical details on the se simple policy rules .  
Except for the first -difference rule, which has no intercept term, the simple rules examined herein use 
intercept terms that are consistent with a real federal funds  rate of 50  basis points in the longer run.  
2 Because the FPLT rule responds to the gap b etween the unemployment rate and the natural rate 
of unemployment, this rule takes as given the Tealbook baseline projections for these variables instead of 
the projection for the output gap.

 The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule  responds more strongly to the output gap than
the conditiona l attenuated rule used in the Tealbook baseline projection.
Consequently,  over the next two quarters, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule
prescribes  higher  policy rates than  those in  the Tealbook baseline .
The Taylor  (1993) rule, which do es not feature an interest rate  smoothing
term, calls for  higher policy r ates than any of the other simple policy  rules and
the Tealbook baseline  projection .
The first -difference rule , which responds to the expected change  in the output
gap, prescribes gradually increasing the federal funds rate from its current
level because of the projected  widening of  the output gap over the next year .
The FPLT rule  calls for holding the federal funds rate well below the other
rules  in an effort to eliminate a cumulat ive shortfall in the core PCE price
index of almost 3  percent  since the end of 2011 .
A MEDIUM -TERM  NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM  REAL  FEDERAL
FUNDS  RATE 
The bottom panel of the first exhibit reports estimates of a medium -term concept 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate (r*).  These estimates ar ise from  two baseline  
projections :  the Tealbook baseline and a projection consistent with the medians of the 
September  2019 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) .3  This concept of r*—labeled 
“FRB/US r*”—corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained 
over a 12 -quarter period from  the current quarter  onward , would , according to the 
FRB/US model,  bring the outpu t gap to zero in the final quarter of that period.  This 
measure summarizes  the projected underlying strength of the real economy but does not 
take into account other considerations such as achieving the inflation objective or 
avoiding sha rp changes in the  federal funds  rate. 
3 To construct a baseline projection consistent with median SEP responses for the FRB/US model, 
the staff interpolated annual SEP information to a quarterly frequency and assumed that,  beyond 2022  (the 
final year reported in the September 2019 SEP), the economy transitions to the longer -run values in a 
smooth and monotonic way.  The staff also posited economic relationships to project variables not covered 
in the SEP.  For example, the staff assumed an Okun’s law relationship to recover an output gap fro m the 
deviation of the median SEP unemployment rate from the median SEP estimate of its longer -run value.

  At 1. 27 percent, the current value of the Tealbook -consistent FRB/US r* is 
essentially unchanged from  the value consistent with the October Tealbook  
projection  and is about 1 percentage point above the average level of the real 
federal  funds rate in the baseline .  Through the lens of the FRB/US model, the  
staff’s upward revision to the level of resource utilization fully reflects the 
modestly lower path  for the real federal funds rate —as opposed to greater 
underlying strength in the pro jection.  
 At 0. 33 percent, the September  2019 SEP -consistent FRB/US r* is lower than 
the Tealbook -consistent FRB /US r*—even though the two projections contain  
similar policy rate paths —because the level of resource utilization over the 
coming years consistent  with median SEP responses  is lower than the staff’s 
outlook for resource utilization . 
SIMPLE  POLICY RULE  SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports the Tealbook baseline projection and results from 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model under the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, the 
Taylor  (1993) rule, the first -difference rule, and the FPLT rule.  These simulations reflect 
the endogenous responses of resource utilization and inflation to the different federal 
funds rate paths implied by the policy rul es.  The simulations for each rule incorporate 
the assumptions that policymakers commit to following that rule in the future and that 
financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly anticipate that 
monetary policy will follow throu gh on this commitment and are aware of the 
implications for interest rates and the economy.   
 Under the conditional attenuated policy rule used to construct the Tealbook 
baseline , the federal funds rate edge s up gradually from its current level , 
reaching  2½ percent by the end of  2022. 
 The inertial Taylor  (1999) rule, which embodies the same degree of inertia as 
the Tealbook baseline rule but responds more strongly to the output gap , calls 
for the federal funds rate to increase at a faster pace  than the Tealb ook 
baseline path  in 2020 before  plateau ing near 3 percent in 2021.  The less 
accommodative monetary conditions result in higher unemployment rate s than 
in the Tealbook baseline  over the period shown .  Under this rule , inflation is 
Monetary Policy Strategies

 lower  and the real 10 -year Treasury yield is higher  than the corresponding 
values in the Tealbook  baseline  projection . 
 The Taylor  (1993) rule , which  features no interest rate  smoothing , calls for an 
immediate increase in the federal funds rate  to 3 percent .  The prescribed 
policy rate remains near that level  through out the period shown  and well 
above the baseline policy rate path .  Nonetheless , the unemployment rate  
under the Taylor  (1993) rule runs only a little  above the corresponding 
Tealbook baseline path.  The reason is that, beyond the period shown, the 
Taylor  (1993) rule prescribes values that are similar to, or somewhat lower 
than, those in the staff projection , thus containing the increase in the real long -
term rates that drive real activity in the mode l. 
 The first-difference rule , which  reacts to the expected change in the output 
gap rather than its level, calls f or a gradual increase in the federal funds rate, 
reaching nearly 2¾ percent  in 2022 .  The federal funds rate subsequently runs 
below  the path  in the Tealbook baseline for an extended period.  Because of 
the forward -looking nature of financial market participants, price setters, and 
wage setters  in the model , this strategy generates lower unemployment and 
higher inflation than in the staff proje ction —even in the early years of the 
simulation . 
 The FPLT rule responds to , and seeks to eliminate,  the cumulative shortfall of 
the level of core PCE prices  from  a target path defined by the growth of  that 
price level at an annual rate of 2  percen t from th e end of 2011 onward .  
Eliminating the current shortfall  of almost 3  percent re quires inflation to run 
above 2  percent in coming years , which, in turn,  calls for  a significantly easier 
stance of monetary policy than is prescribed by the other  rules shown here.  
With  financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters correctly 
anticipat ing the ensuing long period of a low federal funds rate , the path of the 
real 10 -year Treasury rate  immediately  drops to nearly  negative 0.75 percent  
and remains below the corresponding Tealbook baseline path throughout the 
period shown .  The unemployment rate is substantially lower under the FPLT 
rule than in the Tealbook baseline and all other simulations, dropping below  
3 percent  in late 202 1.  Inflation ex ceeds 2  percent by about 20 basis points , 
on average, over the coming decade .

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation rather than to
headline inflation.  This choice of rule specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core

 With the e xcept ion of the Taylor  (1993) rule , which  features  no interest rate
smoothing , the lower initial level of the federal funds rate implies that the
near-term policy rate prescriptions  from the simple policy rules  are lower than
those in the October Tealbook .  By contrast , the medium -term policy rate
prescriptions from all the simple rules under consideration here  are higher
than those in the October Tealbook  because of the greater resource tightness
in the staff projection.
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS  UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control  simulations conditional on the Tealbook 
baseline under two different assumptions about policymakers’  preferences, as captured 
by alternative specifications of the loss function.4  The concept of optimal control 
employed here is one in which  current policymakers are able to commit future 
policymakers to th eir plans; such a commitment, when feasible, may  lead to improve d 
economic outcomes .5 
The simulation labeled “Equal weights” presents the case in which
policymakers , by assumption,  place equal weights on keeping headline PCE
inflation close to the Committee’s objective of 2  percent, on keeping the
unemplo yment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of
unemployment, and on keeping the federal  funds rate close to its previous
value.  Under this strategy, the federal funds rate runs significantly higher than
the Tealbook baseline path , reachin g a peak of  about 4¾ percent  in 2022 .
This strategy is designed to counter the projected persistent undershooting by
the unemployment  rate of its natural rate that occurs in the Tealbook
baseline —an outcome that policymakers with the equal -weights loss fu nction
judge to be undesirable.  The less negative  unemployment gap implies  only a
modestly lower path of inflation because , in the FRB/US model, the response
of inflation to the level of resource utilization is small.
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
Tealbook B for June 2016 offers motivations for these s pecifications .  The appendix  in this Tealbook 
section provides technical details on the optimal control simulations.  
5 Under the optimal control policies, policymakers achieve the displayed  economic outcomes by 
making promises that bind future policymakers  to take actions  that may not be optimal from the perspective 
of those future policymakers (that is, the promises are time inconsistent).  It is assumed that these promises 
are taken as credible by wage and price setters and by financial market participant s.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of 4−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

 The simulation labeled “Asymmetric weight on ugap ” uses a loss function
that assigns no cost to deviations of the unemployment rate from the natural
rate when the unemployment rate is below the natural rate but is otherwise
identical to the specification with equal weights.  Under this strategy, the path
for the federal funds rate is lower than the Tealbook baseline because
policymakers’ desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not accompanied  by a
desire  to prevent the unemployment rate  from  falling below its natural rate  in
the next few years .  Nonetheless, policymakers choose a modestly increasing
policy rate path  in anticipation of  the inflation overshoot of 2 percent starting
in 2024 .
Compar ed with the optimal control simulations in the October Tealbook, the
prescriptions from the equal -weight s and asymmetric specifications
conditional on the current Tealbook  projection  are lower  in the near term
because of the lower starting level of the federal funds rate  and the interest
rate smoothing motive .  By contrast, because of tighter resource utilization  in
the current projection, the medium -term prescriptions are higher than the
corresponding prescriptions in the October Tealbook .

consistent with the Septemb er 2019 SEP (not shown) are well below those
under the same loss function using the current  Tealbook.   The main reason for
this difference is that unemployment  gaps in the SEP -consistent baseline are
only about half as large as those in the Tealbook baseli ne.  Hence, the federal
funds rate , which peaks at 3 ¼ percent  in the SEP -consistent baseline , does not
need to rise as much to close those gaps.   The policy rate prescriptions under
the asymmetric loss function  using the SEP -consistent baseline are similar  to
those derived  using the current Tealbook projections .
ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE
LONGER RUN 
The next exhibit updates selected estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds 
rate in the longer run, denoted rLR.  This concept is the rate consistent with the economy 
operating at its potential once the transitory effects of economic shocks have abated.  
This rate, along with the Committee’s inflation objective, determines the longer -run level 
of the nominal federa l funds rate and other interest rates in the staff’s projection and

 economic models.  In addition, rLR is a parameter in many of the simple policy rules, 
including the staff’s baseline policy rule, considered in this and other sections of 
Tealbook A.  
 The top panel of the exhibit shows the range of historical values through 
2019:Q 3 from  several model -based time -series estimates of rLR.6  The values  
for 2019:Q 3 range from 0.3 to 2.1  percent, with a mean of about 0.8 percent.  
These statistics  are slightly lo wer than those reported for 2019:Q 2 in the 
September  Tealbook.7 
 Time -series estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty, as 
depicted in the middle panel.  The sources of this uncertainty vary across the 
studies, reflecting factors such as the choice of econometric approach as well 
as the uncertainty that exists within each model about the prevailing state of 
the economy and the model’s parameter estimates.  
 The lower panel of the exhibit reports longer -term estimates of the real federal 
funds r ate from selected sources.  The Tealbook baseline assumption, at 
½ percent , is similar to  or between  the median values reported in a number of 
surveys as well as the most recent estimate by the Congressional 
Budget  Office.  
 The median estimate of rLR from the October 2019 Blue Chip survey is nearly 
50 basis points lower than when the survey was conducted in  March 2019 
(value not shown).  
The final four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the  
policy strategies  shown in the ex hibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations ” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment. ” 
                                                 
6 The top panel reports the range of one -sided estimates, meaning that the estimates for a particular 
date only condition on data up to that date.  Although the modeling approaches and econometric techniques 
differ across models, the studies have the co mmon feature that they use time -series methods to infer rLR 
from the co -movement of either macroeconomic series (like inflation, interest rates, and output) or both 
macroeconomic and financial data (like TIPS yields).  See the appendix to this section for sources and 
methodology.  
7 The downward revision to the mean is mainly attributed to lower estimates from the models of 
Christensen and Rudebusch  (forthcoming) and Lubik and Matthes  (2015).

Appendix  
Implementation of the Simple Rules and Optimal Control Simulations  
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Tealbook A typica lly fall into 
one of two categor ies.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number of macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that mi nimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over macroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the 
simulations embed the assum ption  that policymakers will adhere to th e policy strategy in the 
future and that financial market participants, price setters, and wage setters not only believe that 
policymakers will follow through with their strategy , but also fully understand the 
macroeconomic implications  of policymakers doi ng so .  Such policy strategies are described as 
commitment strategies.  
The two approaches have different merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and , because they respond only to 
varia bles that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure of the economy.  However, simple rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict adherenc e to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal  control policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And , 
although this section focuses on p olicies under commitment, optimal control policies can more 
generally be derived under various assumptions about the degree to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of the 
particular  model.  
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, they are probably 
best considered together as a means to assess the various  tradeoffs policymakers may  face when  
pursuing their mandated objectives.  
POLICY RULES USED IN THE MONETARY  POLICY STRATEGIES SECTION  
The table “Simple Rules” that follows gives expressions for four simple policy rules 
reported in the first two exhibits of the Monetary Policy Strate gies section.  It also reports the 
expression for the conditional attenuated rule that the staff uses in the construction of the 
Tealbook baseline projection .1  𝑅𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate prescribed by a strategy 
                                                 
1 In constructing the baseline projection, the staff estimates the level of the federal funds rate in the 
current quarter using  a weighted average of daily quarter -to-date realized values and  expected values, 
inferred from financial market s, over the remainder of the quarter .  Thereafter, th e staff uses the conditional 
attenuated rule to project the path of the federal funds rate.  The box “A New Conditional Baseline Policy

  for quarter  t; for quarter s prior to the projection period under consideration, 𝑅𝑡 corresponds to the 
historical data in the economic projection.  T he right -hand -side variables of the first four rules 
include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE price inflatio n for the current 
quarter and three quarters ahead ( 𝜋𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡+3|𝑡), the output gap estimate for the current period 
(𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡), and the forecast of the three -quarter -ahead an nual change in the output gap 
(𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡+3|𝑡−𝑦𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡−1).  The value of policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective, denoted 𝜋𝐿𝑅, 
is 2 percent.   In the case of the flexible price -level targeting rule , the right -hand -side variables 
include an unemployment rate gap  and a price  gap.  The unemployment gap is d efined as the 
difference between the unemployment rate, 𝑢𝑡, and the staff’s estimate of its natural rate, 𝑢𝑡∗, 
which currently stands at 4. 6 percent.  The price gap is defined as 100 times the difference  
between the log of the core PCE price level, 𝑝𝑡, and the log of the target price -level path, 𝑝𝑡∗.  The 
2011:Q4 value of 𝑝𝑡∗ is set to the 2011:Q4 value of the core PCE price index, and, subsequently, 
𝑝𝑡∗ is assumed to grow at a 2  percent annual rate.  
Simple Rules  
 
The first rule  in the table was studied by Taylor (1993 ).  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
features more inertia and a stronger response to resource slack over time  compared with the 
Taylor (1993) rule .  The inertial Taylor (1999) and rules that depend on a price gap , like the 
FPLT  rule, have been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .2  The conditional 
attenuate d rule has the same form as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule but responds less strongly to 
the output gap.  Where applicable, t he intercepts of the  simple rules, denoted 𝑟𝐿𝑅, are constant 
and chosen so that they are consistent with a 2  percent longer -run inflation objective and a n 
equilibrium  real federal funds rate in the longer run of 0.5 percent.  The prescriptions of the first -
difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the longer -run rea l interest rate; see 
Orphanides  (2003).  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED POLICY RULES  
The “ Near -Term Prescriptions of Selected Policy Rules” reported in the first exhibit are 
calculated taking as given the Tealbook projections  for inflation and the output gap.  When the

  Tealbook is published earl y in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the current and next 
quarter s.  When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next two quarters.  Rules that include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand -side variable are 
conditioned on the lagged federal funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown 
and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  
A MEDIUM -TERM NOTION OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides 
estimate s of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate  that uses alternative baselines:  
the Tealbook baseline and another one consistent with median respo nses to the latest Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The simulations are conducted using the FRB/US model, the staff’s 
large -scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  “FRB/US r*” is the real federal funds rate 
that, if maintained over a 12 -quarte r period (beginning in the current quarter), makes the output 
gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period , given either the Tealbook or the SEP -
consistent economic projection .  This measure  depends on a broad array of economic factors, 
some of wh ich take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables .3  The 
measure is derived under the assumption that agents in the model form VAR -based 
expectations —that is, agents use small -scale statistical models so that their expectations of fu ture 
variables are determined solely by historical relationships.  
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” for the Tealbook baseline and the SEP -
consistent baseline reported in the panel are the corresponding  average s of the real federal funds 
rate under the Tealbook baseline projection and SEP -consistent projection, respectively, 
calculated over the same 12 -quarter period as the Tealbook -consistent and SEP -consistent 
FRB/US r*.  For a given economic projection, the average projected real federal fun ds rate s and 
the FRB/US  r* may be associated with somewhat different macroeconomic outcomes even when 
their values are identical.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  r* simulation, the real federal funds 
rate is held constant over the entire 12 -quarter period , whereas , in the economic projection,  the 
real federal funds rate can vary over time.  
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhibits “Simple Policy Rule Simulations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy  is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends se veral decades beyond the time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters form  model -consistent expectations  and are predicated on the staff’s 
extended Tealbo ok projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s 
large -scale asset purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the 
simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quart er, all of the

 COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLIC IES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers choose a path for the federal 
funds rate to minimize a discounted weighted sum of s quared inflation gaps (measured as the 
difference between four -quarter headline PCE price inflation, 𝜋𝑡𝑃𝐶𝐸, and the Committee’s
2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡, measured as the difference between
the unemployment rate and t he staff’s estimate of the natural rate), and squared changes in the 
federal funds rate.  In the following equation, the resulting loss function embeds the assumption 
that policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor , 𝛽=0.9963 : 
𝑳𝒕=∑ 𝜷𝝉𝑇
𝝉=𝟎{𝜆𝜋 (𝜋𝑡+𝜏𝑃𝐶𝐸−𝜋𝐿𝑅)𝟐+𝜆𝑢,𝑡+𝜏(𝑢𝑔𝑎𝑝 𝑡+𝜏)𝟐+𝜆𝑅(𝑅𝑡+𝝉−𝑅𝑡+𝝉−𝟏)𝟐}. 
The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers two 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment  gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B  provides motivations for the 
specifications of the loss function.  The table  “Loss Functions” shows the weights used in the two 
specifications.  
The first specification, “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three components at 
all times.  The second  specification, “Asymmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the same weights as the 
equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above t he staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate , but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  
The optimal control policy and associated outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the 
absolute) values of the weights.   
For ea ch of these specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is subject 
to the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates .  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook  baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that the public  sees this path as 
a binding commitment on policymakers’ future decisions; the optimal control policy takes as 
given the initial lagged value of the federal  funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy 
decisions made prior to the simulation period.   Loss Functions

  ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN THE 
LONGER RUN 
The top panel of the exhibit “ Estimates of the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate in the 
Longer Run ” shows a range of estimates of  𝑟𝐿𝑅 from eight time -series models based on the 
following studies:  Christensen and Rudebusch (forthcoming); Del Negro, Giannone, Giannoni, 
and Tambalotti (2017); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Joh annsen and Mertens (2016); 
Kiley (2015); Laubach and Williams (2003); Lewis and Vazquez -Grande (2019); and Lubik and 
Matthes (2015).  For comparability, all computations use the latest vintage of historical data 
through 2019:Q 3.  Moreover, the estimates ar e “one sided” in the sense that, at each point, they 
make use of historical data only up to that point in time.  As a result, their historical movements 
can differ from the “two sided” estimates reported in some of those studies.  
The middle panel reports 6 8 percent uncertainty bands around each model’s point 
estimate for 2019:Q 3.  The computation and interpretation of these bands are specific to each 
study.   
The bottom panel shows 𝑟𝐿𝑅 values from selected forecasters.  These values were 
obtained as foll ows:  
 “Tealbook baseline” is the staff’s assumption about the level of the equilibrium real 
federal funds rate in the longer run.  
 “Median SEP” is the median of FOMC participants’ projections of the federal funds 
rate in the longer run minus the correspond ing projection of PCE inflation as of the 
September  2019 SEP.  
 “Median Survey of Primary Dealers” equals the long -run median dealer forecast for 
the target rate minus the longer -run median dealer forecast of PCE inflation as of the 
October  2019 survey.  
 “Median Blue Chip (6 -to-10-year)” equals the consensus five -year average (2026 –
30) forecast for the three -month Treasury bill rate minus the consensus five -year 
average (2026 –30) forecast for the annual change in the GDP chained price index as 
of the October  2019 Blue Chip Economic Indicators  survey.  
 “Congressional Budget Office (10 -year)” equals the federal funds rate at the end of 
2029 minus the annualized change in the PCE index at the end of 2029 as of 
August  2019.

3. Percentage point contribution to change in real disposable personal income, annual basis.
4. The FE measure captures the total contribution of the government sector to the growth of aggregate demand (excluding any multiplier effects and financial
offsets).  It equals the sum of the direct contributions to aggregate demand growth from all changes in federal purchases and state and local purchases, plus
the estimated contribution to real household consumption and business investment that is induced by changes in transfer and tax policies. FI (fiscal impetus)is the portion of FE attributable to discretionary fiscal policy actions (for example, a legislated change in tax revenues).
