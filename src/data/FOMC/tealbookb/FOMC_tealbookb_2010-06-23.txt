1 While the EDO model’s estimate of short- run r* is the same as in A pril, the corresponding estimate 
from the single -equation model has edged upward by 10 basis points, reflecting a small increase in the 
staff’s estimate of the level of output relative to potential in the first half of 2010.

The staff’s estimates of short -run r* —defined as the real federal funds rate that, if 
maintained over time, would return output to potential in twelve quarters —have mostly 
decreased in this forecast.  As shown in the exhibit “Equilibrium Real Federal Funds 
Rate,” t he Tealbook- consistent estimates of short-run r*  generated by the FRB/US and 
EDO mode ls have decreased  by 40 basis points and 120 basis points, respectively.  These 
decreases reflect  a stronger foreign  exchange value of the dollar, a higher equity 
premium, and adverse effects on aggregate demand arising from increased uncertainty  
related to financial conditions in Europe, which led the staff to widen its projection of the 
output gap for the fourth quarter of 2011 by 1 percentage point.  For broadly similar 
reasons , most other model-derived estimates of short-run r*  are below those shown in 
April .  However, forecasts from the EDO model and the single-equation model do not 
incorporate the recent changes in financial conditions, and estimates of short -run r*  from 
these models have changed  little .1
The policy prescriptions produced by optimal control simulations of the FRB/US 
model—in which policymakers are assumed to place equal weight on keeping core PCE 
inflation close to a 2 percent inflation goal, on keeping unemployment close to the effective NAIRU, and on minimiz ing changes in the federal funds ra te—are shown in the 
exhibit “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Monetary Policy.”  These prescriptions continue to imply that monetary policy is strongly constrained by the effective lower bound.  As a 
result, the nominal funds rate does not rise from the effective lower bound until late  2013, 
about two quarters later than in April .  Under this policy, the unemployment rate would 
be projected to remain above the NAIRU  until early 2013, while  core PCE inflation 
would stay appreciably below 2 percent through 2014.  The exhibit also displays the optimal-control results obtained if the nominal funds rate were not constrained by the effective lower  bound.  Absent the constraint, the nominal funds rate would move down 
to about negative 4¾ percent by the middle of next  year; this more accommodative policy 
would bring the unemployment rate back to the NAIRU more quickly and move the inflation trajectory closer to the assumed 2 percent goal.  Reflecting the deterioration in

Note: Appendix A provides background information regarding the construction of these measures and confidence
intervals.  The actual real federal funds rate shown is based on lagged core inflation as a proxy for inflation expectation.
For information regarding alternative measures, see Appendix A.  Estimates of r* may change at the beginning of a
quarter even when there is no shift in the staff outlook because the twelve quarter horizon covered by the calculation
has rolled forward one quarter.  Therefore, whenever the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this table includes
a third column labeled "Current Quarter Estimate as of Previous Tealbook."Short-Run Estimates with Confidence Intervals

2For reasons related to the passage of time since the last FOMC meeting, the unconstrained 
prescriptions from the two estimated rules have increased somewhat since April, as both rules depend on 
the lagged value of the federal funds rate.  For example, t he current prescription  of the estimated outcome -
based rule for the third quarter puts significant weight on the actual s econd -quarter funds rate value of 20 
basis points,  whereas the previous simulation  for the third quarter jumped off from the rule’s prescription  
for the second quarter of negative 47 basis points .

the economic outlook, the unconstrained path for the funds rate is as much as  1¼ 
percentage points lower than it was last round.   
As shown in the exhibit, “The Policy Outlook in an Uncertain Environment,” the 
staff’s estimated outcome -based policy rule prescribes keeping the federal funds rate at 
its effective lower bound through the first half of 2012.  Consistent with the widening in 
the staff estimates of the output gap, the rule calls for tightening to be gin one quarter later 
than prescribed in April .  Over the intermeeting period , financial market expectations for 
the funds rate at the end of 2010 appear to have shifted down by about 15 basis points, 
while the expected funds rate for 2011 through the end  of 2014 has decreased on average 
by about 70 basis  points.  The lower panel of the exhibit provides near- term prescriptions 
from simple policy rules .  As shown in the left-hand columns, all of the prescriptions are 
at the effective lower bound.  The right-hand columns show the prescriptions that would 
be implied by these rules if the lower bound was not imposed.  All these unconstrained 
rules generate prescriptions of  negative funds rates.  R eflecting the widening of the staff’s 
output gap projections, most rules  prescribe interest rates that are markedly lower than in 
April.2

Monetary Policy Alternatives  
This Tealbook presents three policy alternatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Under Alternative A, the statement would indicate that the 
Committee would maintain agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) in the System 
Open Market Account (SOMA) at approximately their current level rather than 
continuing to allow them to run off; in addition, the statement would suggest that the federal funds rate was likely to remain  near zero for a longer period than anticipated in 
April .  Apart from updating the characterization of the incoming data , the statement 
under Alternative B would be unchanged from the one released at the conclusion of the 
April meeting.  Under Alternative C , the Committee would indicate that it anticipated 
that economic conditions would warrant a “ low,” rather than “exceptionally low ,” target 
range for the federal funds rate for “some time ” rather than “an extended period;” the 
Committee  would also begin to allow Treasury securities to roll off as they mature.  
Under all three alternatives, the Committee would maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate.  Table 1 provides an overview of the key elements of the alternatives.  Draft sta tements are provided on subsequent pages, followed by the case for 
each alternative.   
Under all of the alternatives, the statement would indicate that the economy has 
continued  to strengthen, with household spending increasing and investment in 
equipment and software rising at a robust pace, and that conditions in the labor market 
are improving.  The statements would also note that underlying inflation has trended  
lower and  that longer -term inflation ex pectations have been stable;  Alternatives A and B 
would mention the recent decline in energy  and other commodity prices.  All of the  
statement s observe that financial conditions have become somewhat less supportive of 
economic growth.  In addition, each of the statements indicates an outlook for a gradual 
return to higher levels of resource utilization with subdued inflation.  Under Alternative 
A, the st atement characterizes the recent strengthening of the economy as gradual and the 
improvement in the labor market as slow.  In addition, Alternative A indicates that the 
near-term outlook for activity has weakened and that the outlook is for “quite” subdued 
inflation – below levels consistent with the dual mandate.  By contrast, Alternative C 
states that a sustainable recovery is under  way.

APRIL  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. I nformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor 
market is beginning to improve. Growth in household spending has picked up recently but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structure s 
is declining and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts have edged up but remain at a depressed level.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.  Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.   
2. W
ith substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-
term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.  
3. T
he Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 
percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial d evelopments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to 
promote economic recovery and price stability.   
4. I
n light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has 
closed all but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new -issue commercial mortgage -backed securities; it closed on March 31 for 
loans backed by all other types of collateral.

rices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent 
months, and underlying inflation has trended lower.   With substantial resource 
sl
ack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer- term inflation expectations 
stable, inflation is likely to be quite  subdued for some time, remaining below 
rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s 
dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices .   
3. T

per
cent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates 
of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations,  
w
ill warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended 
per
iod.  The Committee expects to maintain the current range for the federal 
funds rate until resource utilization and underlying inflation are clearly 
moving toward rates consistent with the dual mandate.  In addition, to provide cont inue
 d support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to 
aid overall conditions in private credit markets, the Committee will maintain holdings of agency mortgage- ba
 cked securities in the System Open Market 
Account at approximately their current level rat her than allowing them to 
run off.  The Committee will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities.

Th
e Committee will continue to 
evaluate its holdings of securities in light of the 
evolving economic outlook and conditions in  financial mark ets and will employ

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Committee  members may see the current policy stance as consistent with  a 
gradual return to full employment and with subdued inflation , and they may judge the 
anticipated trajector y for the economy as the best that can be achieved under current 
circumstances .  If so , they might wish to maintain the existing target range for the federal 
funds rate, reiterate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low 
levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period, and continue essentially its current 
practices with respect to outright purchases, sales, and redemptions of securities in the 
System Open Market Account , as in Alternative B. 1   A
lthough financial conditions 
became less suppo rtive of economic growth over the intermeeting period, the incoming 
data, while mixed, continued to suggest moderate growth  in economic activity .  In the se 
circumstances, the Committee may prefer to refrain from adjusting policy until the implications of r ecent financial developments for activity become clearer, and may think 
that an essentially unchanged policy statement would be most reassuring to  financial 
markets.     
Even if Committee  members , like the staff, marked down their outlook in 
response to the decline in equity prices and  appreciation of the dollar, they may judge it 
appropriate to leave the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate 
unchanged.  The statement is explicit that expectations for continued exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate are conditional on economic developments, and members  
may take the substantial drop in money market futures rates over the intermeeting period as indicating that market participants recognize  that the extended period is likely to be 
longer than before.  Moreover, participants may be concerned that modifying the language in the statement  to indicate more explicitly that the “extended period” would 
likely be longer  than had been thought , as in Alternative A,  would lead mar ket 
participants to conclude incorrectly that the Committee was making a  less conditional 
commitment to leave rates unchanged .  If so, participants may also be concerned that 
market s could overreact when any expanded forward guidance was unwound, potential ly 
leading  the Committee to adjust policy more slowly than would otherwise be optimal 
when the time comes to remove policy accommodation.  In addition, participants  may be 
reluctant to  revis e the current policy of allowing agency mortgage -backed securities to 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Page 14 of 40   
roll off because they wish to make progress toward normalizing the size and composition 
of the balance sheet and reducing the level of reserves in the banking system.   
Alternatively , participants may be skeptical that the adverse effects of recent 
financial developments will be as pronounced as anticipated by the staff and read the 
incoming data as suggesting that the economic expansion has appreciable momentum .  At 
the same time, they may  judge it to be premature to re vise the statement  to suggest that 
the Committee is moving toward a reduction in policy accommodation.  Even though 
economic activity has continued to expand, both unemployment and core inflation are far 
from the levels that most participants view as  consi stent with the dual mandate , and thus 
the Committee may still judge that a near -zero federal funds rate is likely to be 
appropriate for an extended period.  Partly for the same reasons, the Committee may be reluctant to allow Treasury securities to run off , as under Alternative C, because doing so 
could put upward pressure on longer- term interest rates .  In addition, redeeming 
Treasuries  would have the disadvantage of tilting the Committee’s  securities holdings 
further away from the desired long-run composition.  Moreover, the concerns of policymakers who had been worried that the large size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would contribute to increased inflation expectations may have been  allayed 
somewhat by the very low readings on inflation over the intermeeting period and by the 
decline in TIPS -based estimates of longer -term inflation compensation.   
The statement proposed under Alternative B would probably result in little change 
in bond yields, equity prices, or the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The Desk’s 
recent survey of primary dealers suggests that market participants expect the statement to 
be similar to the one released in April apart from revisions to the characterization of the 
economic situation, and that they place low odds on any changes to the Committee’s SOMA strategy  at this meeting .   
Variant of Alternative B.  
The Committee ’s portfolio management policies can, of 
course, be adjusted independently of its policies toward short- term interest rates.  
Policymakers might believe that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low short-term rates for an extended period but also believe that it would be appropriate soon to begin to allow the SOMA portfolio to shrink through redemptions of Treasury securities.  If so, they may prefer to combine the language about the economic situation 
and guidance about the target federal funds rate of Alternative B with an announcement— as in Alternative C —that the Committee would begin to re deem

maturing Treasury securities.  Redeeming Treasury securities would reduce the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and reserve balances by about $200 billion over the next two 
years.  That reduction could facilitate an eventual increase in the target feder al funds rate.  
Participants also may wish to commence steps toward normalizing the size of the balance 
sheet  in order to reduce the risk that inflation expectations might become unmoored.  A 
possible disadvantage of this approach, however, is that redeemi ng all maturing Treasury 
securities in addition to allowing agency debt and MBS to run off is that the Committee 
would not make progress toward its long-run objective of normalizing the composition of 
the balance sheet.    
Although the staff estimates that a policy of redeeming all Treasury securities 
would increase longer- term interest rates about 15 basis points, that estimate is very 
uncertain and is based on the market reactions to FOMC announcements about asset 
purchases made during a period when financial market functioning was considerably 
impaired.2   Gi
ven the improved condition of financial markets, participants may judge 
the likely reaction to be much smaller  now.  The market reaction could also be muted by 
the retention of the “extended period” language in the statement, which might limit the extent to which market participants took the change in redemption policy as an indication that the target federal funds  rate was likely to be increased sooner than had been 
anticipated.  
Nevertheless, an announcement  at this time  that the FOMC was going to begin 
redeeming Treasury securities would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  The Desk’s current s urvey of primary dealer s found that dealers place near -
zero odds on the Committee adopting a policy of redeeming all Treasury securities at the current meeting.  Even if coupled with the unchanged language about the interest rate outlook of Alternative B, i nterest rates would probably rise, at least initially, in large part 
because market participants seem likely to  misinterpret the change in redemption policy 
as indicating an earlier start to interest rate hikes .  Most of any initial increase in market 
interest rates would likely be reversed subsequently as investors came to understand, in 
light of policy communications such as the minutes, that the changed redemption policy had no implication for the Committee’s intentions with respect to the federal funds ra te.  
However, the direct upward pressure on rates resulting from redemptions would persist.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
If Committee members, lik e the staff, have marked down their outlook in 
response to intermeeting developments, then they may see unemp loyment remaining 
above, and inflation below, levels consistent with the dual mandate by greater amounts 
and for even longer than at the time of the April meeting.  In such circumstances, the Committee might wish , as under Alternative A,  to adjust the lang uage in the statement to 
suggest that the period of near- zero interest rates  will be even longer than previously 
anticipated  and may also decide to  keep the SOMA holdings of MBS at around their 
current levels rather than allowing them to roll off .  These actions would provide 
additional monetary stimulus but would stop short of resuming an expansion of the portfolio, a step that might be viewed as to o costly in current circumstances relative to the 
likely benefit.   
The additional monetary stimulus  provided under Alternative A would come in 
large part through a reduction in short- and intermediate- term interest rates as market 
participants marked down their outlook for the federal funds rate path.  Judging by  the 
results of the primary dealer survey and by interest rate futures, market participants appear to be expecting the Committee to begin raising short -term interest rates in the first 
half of 2011.  By contrast, the staff assumption is for policy to be on hold until the 
summer  of 2012, and the opt imal policy prescriptions discussed in the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of this Tealbook are for the federal funds rate to remain at about zero until late  2013.  If members also anticipate that the funds rate will remain at the effective 
lower bound for longer than market participants currently expect, and they wanted  to 
provide additional monetary stimulus, then they might wish  to bring market expectations 
for the federal funds rate into closer alignment with  their own by modifying the 
statement.  In the draft statement under Alternative A, for instance, the Committee would indicate that it anticipates economic conditions “will” rather than “are likely to” warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  In addition, the statement indicate s that the Committee “ expects to maintain the current range for the 
federal funds rate until resource utilization and underlying inflation are clearly moving toward rates consistent with the dual manda te.”  This stronger and more expansive 
language , especially if coupled with a decision to keep MBS holdings constant, seems 
likely to persuade market participants that the federal funds rate will probably be exceptionally low for longer than currently anti cipated.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
June 17, 2010
Page 17 of 40   
Monetary stimulus would also be applied  under this alternative by halting the 
upward pressure on longer- term interest rates caused by  the gradual decline of MBS in 
the SOM A as payments on the securities are received .  The statement under Alternative 
A would note that the change was  intended  “to provide continued support to mortgage 
lending and housing markets and to aid overall conditions in private credit markets .”  
Although the statement does not specify the period of time over which the current 
holdings of MBS would be maintained, the final sentence indicates that the Committee 
would “…evaluate its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook 
and conditions in financial markets…”  The staff projects that payments on MBS will reduce holdings by about $230 billion over the next two years.  If, instead, the Committee 
announced that MBS holdings in the SOMA would be maintained at their current level , 
and market participants expected that policy to be followed for two years, w e estimate 
that longer- term rates would fall  about 10 basis points.  As another option, i f 
policymakers wished to mitigate the upward pressure on longer- term interest rates but 
were reluctant to slow the transition toward an all- Treasury portfolio , the Com mittee 
could instead purchase longer -term Treasury securities using the proceeds from payments 
on MBS.  A possible advantage of such an approach  is that Treasury purchases would be 
less likely to be seen as allocating credit to a particular sector of the e conomy.  However, 
purchasing longer- term Treasury securities could have the disadvantage of potentially 
being portrayed as monetizing currently very high federal deficits.  
Participants may favor the combination of language and policy actions in 
Alternative  A as a way to put downward pressure on interest rates to counter the 
tightening in financial conditions that occurred over the intermeeting period.  As discussed in the Monetary Policy Strategies section, the decline in equity prices and the 
appreciation of the dollar contributed to significant reductions  in a range of staff 
estimates of the equilibrium federal funds rate .  Policymakers  might be unwilling to 
accept this  tightening in financial conditions if  they not only view the outlook as having 
deteriorated but also see increased downside risks to that outlook.  For example, the 
sovereign debt crisis in Europe could intensify, perhaps even to the point of pushing the United States  back into recession, as described in the box “Consequences of a Severe 
European Sovereign Debt Crisis” in the Risk s and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.  
Moreover, with inflation evidently trending down and resource utilization rates very low , 
participants may see an increased risk of a pernicious disinflation, as in the “Greater Disinflation ” alternative scenario .  Participants may be particularly worried that , because 
of investors’ intense concerns about fiscal sustainability, the re is little  scope for increased

fiscal stimulus in the United States , and with the federal funds rate at its effective lower 
bound, both the f ederal government and the Federal Reserve would be hampered in their 
ability  to counter a deflationary spiral should one develop. 
As noted above, m arket participants appear to expect little change to the 
characterization of the policy outlook in the statement and no change in the Committee’s 
SOMA strategy .  Consequently, interest rates would likely fall across the yield curve in 
response to a statement like that proposed under Alternative A .  The decline in longer-
term yields might be offset to some extent by an increase in inflation compensati on, if 
investors concluded that sustained monetary stimulus was likely to lead eventually to 
higher inflation .  Equity prices would probably rise, while the foreign exchange value of 
the dollar would likely fall.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
If policymakers see a sustainable economic recovery as  now under way or are 
concerned that the prolonged period of near- zero interest rates could contribute to 
financial imbalances, they might choose to modify the statement to imply an approaching increase in interest rates and to indicate a start to redemptions of  Treasury securities, as 
under Alternative C.  P articipants mig ht take a more positive signal  for the outlook than 
the staff has from incoming economic data, perhaps on the view that the recent financial turmoil is likely to prove transitory  and the European situation will improve relatively 
soon, as in the “Normaliza tion in Europe” and “Stronger R ecovery” alternative scenarios 
in the Risk s and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.  Even if policymakers have not 
changed their outlook, with the passage of time they may now consider it appropriate to 
modify the statement to  reflect an approaching exit from highly accommodative policies .  
Moreover, they may view redeeming Treasury securities, and the associated reduction in 
reserve balances, as supportive of an eventual increase in interest rates .   
If participants judge that the near -zero federal funds rate is contributing to 
financial imbalances  but still anticipate the need for continued policy accommodation in 
coming months, they may wish to move the federal funds rate up a bit but then hold at an only moderately higher  level while gather ing additional information on the outlook.  
Such a strategy might be viewed as the best means  to support the economic expansion 
while avoiding financial instability .  The statement under Alternative C  would suggest an 
approaching increase in rates by changing “will maintain” to “decided to maintain ,” thus 
indicating that the Committee’s commitment to the current target range did not extend to 
 
  
                                                 
3 Another feature of the structure proposed for paragraph C -1 is that it treats output and inflation in a 
parallel way in that there is no discussion of the causal factors behind the outlook for either variable.

future meetings,  and by changing  “extended period” to “some time.”  The statement 
leaves open the possibility that the FOMC might choose to set its target range only a bit 
higher than its current range by changing  “exceptionally low” to “low.” 
Even though energy prices and other commodity prices  have declined over the 
intermeeting period and core inflation has trended down, participants may be confident 
that solidly anchored inflation expectations will prevent a prolonged, unwelcome 
disinflation.  Nevertheless, neither recent inflation developments nor the near- term 
inflation outlook would appear to be a reason to tighten policy.  Consequently, in the statement under Alternative C, the pertinent inflation developments are listed in the first paragraph along with the other information about economic developments.  That paragraph then concludes with a characterization of the outlook for both economic activity and inflation.
3
An announcement along the lines of the statement under Alternative C would 
surprise investors.  The changes to the statement language would lead market participants to conclude that the Committee was going to increase its target for the federal funds rate sooner than had been anticipated.  Moreover, as noted above, announcing that the 
Committee would begin redeeming all maturing Treasury securities would directly 
increase longer -term Treasury yields to some extent.  Consequently, interest rates would 
likely rise  across the yield curve.  Forward measures of inflation compensation might 
move down, lessening the rise in nominal longer- term rates,  if the statement led  inve stors 
to reduce their assessment of the longer -term inflation outlook .  Equity prices likely 
would fall, and the dollar appreciate.   
                                                 
4 The Tealbook projection assumes that the federal funds rate lifts off in the third quarter of 2012.  The

LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
In this section, scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet are presented 
that correspond to the alternatives discussed in the “ Monetary Policy Alternatives” 
section of the Tealb ook.  The baseline scenario corresponds to Alternative B in this 
Tealbook.  In the baseline scenario , the FOMC continues to allow agency MBS and debt 
securities to roll off as they mature  or are prepaid .  Additionally, we assume that the 
FOMC begins asset  sales in the first quarter of 2013, six months after the assum ed rise in 
the target federal funds rate.  Specifically, beginning at that time , agency MBS and debt 
securities are sold at a constant rate for five years until holdings of these asset s reach zero 
in December  2017.4  
All Treasury securities are rolled over as they mature, continuing 
the current practice.  Under Alternative A , holdings of agency debt securities are 
redeemed , while we assume that holdings of agency MBS  remain constant until the target 
fed funds rate increases in the third quarter of 2012.  At this point, MBS holdings are also 
allowed to decline as these assets mature or prepay .  As in the baseline scenario, sales of 
agency MBS and debt securities  commence in the first quarter of 2013, and these 
securities are sold at a constant rate for five years until  the holdings fall to zero.  All 
Treasury securities are rolled over as they mature.  In Alternative C, agency MBS and 
debt securities are treated as in the baseline.  Treasury securities , however, are allowed to 
run off beginning in August of 2010.  Projections for the scenarios are based on 
assumptions about each component of the balance sheet.  Details of these assumptions are 
described in Appendix C.  Substantive revisions that result from these assumptions, 
relative to  material presented during  the last FOMC cycle, are noted below.  
Under the baseline, total assets are lower from now through 2016 and hi gher 
thereafter than in the balance sheet projection s presented in April .  The most significant 
change relative to the previous projection is a downward revision in the projected holdings of agency MBS and debt securities .  In the near term, the downward revision is 
to the path for agency MBS , reflecting hig her forecasted prepayments  based on a lower 
projected level of mortgage rates .  In the medium term, the downward revision stems 
from the new assumption that agency MBS and debt are sold beginning in 2013, rather than roll ed off the balance sheet only as they mature  or prepay.  Another change to assets 
reflects the reestablishment of central bank liquidity swaps over the intermeeting period.  
 
                                                 
5 Given the low demand so far for the renewed liquidity swaps, the assumed use in these projections 
may be an upper boun d on their likely use.  
6 Reserve balances are computed as a residual of assets and liabilities in this exercise.  Reserve 
balances fall as securities obtained through large -scale asset purchases mature, are prepaid, or are sold, and 
as credit facilities co ntinue to unwind.  An assumption of this forecast is that the aggregate level of reserve 
balances does not fall below $25 billion.  When reserve balances first hit this level, the U.S. Treasury’s 
supplementary financing account (SFA) is assumed to fall fro m $200 billion to zero.  Once the balances in 
the SFA have run off, the Federal Reserve begins to purchase Treasury bills until bills comprise one- third 
of the Federal Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings.  At this point, the Federal Reserve begins  to 
purchase notes and bonds in addition to bills so that bills continue to constitute about one -third of total 
Treasury security holdings.

The forecast now anticipates  that $15 billion in swaps will be on the balance sheet from 
July 2010 to year-end; how ever, the level of swaps returns to zero by the end of 2011.5   
Beginning in 2015, the balance sheet begins to expand again in line with growth 
in total Federal Reserve notes in circulation and capital, as Treasury securities are 
purchased to prevent the aggregate level of reserve balances from falling below $25 
billion.6  B
ecause under Alternative A agency MBS are held at the current level until the 
third  quarter of 2012, the path of total assets  associated with this scenario  is higher over 
that time period relative to the baseline.  After sa les commence, the paths for total assets  
under both Alternative A and the baseline converge in June 2015, after which point they 
follow the same slight upward trajectory in line with growth in  Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation  and capital .  Alternative C assumes that Treasury securities  are not rolled over 
when they mature , resul ting in a lower path of assets than under the baseline .  Because of 
these redemptions , purchases of Treasury secur ities undertaken to maintain the level of 
reserve balances at $25 billion begin sooner than under the baseline.  T he total assets pat h 
corresponding to Alternative C eventually  converge s with the baseline path  in February  
2015.     
On the liability side of  the baseline balance sheet, reserve balances are lower 
initially than in the previous projection because of the downward revision to the agency 
MBS forecast path.  The path for reserve balances is revised downward in the medium term in response to agency debt and MBS sales.  In response to the more rapid decline in 
reserve balances  in the medium term, under the baseline, the U.S. Treasury’s 
supplementary financing account falls to zero in February  2015, two and a ha lf years 
earlier than the last cycle .

7 The composition of Federal Reserve assets in these projections differs notably at times from historical 
patter ns.  Prior to August 2007, U.S. Treasury securities were about 90 percent of assets, and the Federal 
Reserve did not hold any agency debt or MBS.  By contrast, under the baseline scenario, Treasury 
securities are projected to account for only around 35 percent of total assets at the end of 2010.  However, 
by the end of 2020, Treasury securities in the SOMA portfolio account for 96 percent of total assets.

nder the baseline scenario , the balance sheet peak s at $2.34 trillion in June 2010.  
The balance sheet  then contracts  as securities obtained through large- scale asset 
purchases mature, prepa y, or are sold, and credit extensions are repaid .  From March  
2015 onwards, after  reserve balances hit the assumed $25 billion floor and the 
supplementary financing account has been drained, the balance sheet begins to expand 
again in line with growth in Federal Reserve notes in circulation and capital, as purchases of Treasury securities match the growth in these two items.   In Alternative s A and C, the 
size of the balance s heet peaks in June 2010 at $2.34 trillion , as well .  By the end of 
2020, the size of the balance sheet under all  scenarios is roughly $1.86 trillion.

projected to contract from  2010 through 2013 on an annual basis.  Because the monetary

DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY FORECASTS  
Growth in domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to pick up to a 5¾  
percent annual rate in the current quarter, with government borrowing continuing at a 
brisk pace and private -sector debt about unchanged.  For both 2010 and 2011, domestic 
nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow around 5¼ percent.  Household debt edges up over the projection period as consumer credit begins to expand in the near term and residential mortgage debt increases starting  next year.  L ending standards for households 
are expected to ease slowly.  The  outlook for borrowing by nonfinancial businesses is 
similarly tepid:  The rates of  corporate bond and commercial paper issuance are projected 
to be moderate, and tight terms and standards for bank loans that loosen only gradually hold down increases in business loans.  State and local government debt grows moderately, with fiscal pressures limiting spending, and federal government debt continues to expand at a double- digit pace, although not as rapidly as this year . 
 Commercial bank credit is expected to fall  at an annual rate of about 5¾ percent 
in the second quarter of 2010, reflecting a broad-based contraction across all loan categories and a slight drop in securities  holdings as well .  Bank credit is projected to 
begin expanding later this year, trimming the decline for 2010 as a whole to 2 percent , 
and to rise 4¼ percent in 2011.  Supported by modest but steady growth in economic 
output, the persistent decline in commercial and industrial loans is expected to abate next 
quarter ; that said, business loan growth remains  subdued through 2011.  Consumer loans 
also begin  to edge up late this year and then increase modestly through 2011 as spending 
on durables rises.  However, real estate lending is expected to recover more slowly over the forecast period .  Despite low interest rates on home mortgages, sluggish housing 
demand is expected to weigh on residential loan growth, and continued poor 
fundamentals should result in continued w eakness  in banks’ commercial real estate loans.  
Securities are projected to expand at a moderate pace over the forecast period as tight 
lending conditions that ease only gradually and weak loan demand cause further substitution of securities for loans. 
After expanding modest ly in the first half of this year, M2 is expected to grow

Draft language for a June directive corresponding to each of the alternatives 
follows the April directive shown on the next page.  Consistent with a recommendation in 
a memorandum to the Committee from the Desk, all of the d irectives include language 
that would direct the Desk to use coupon swaps, as well as dollar roll transactions, to facilitate the settlement of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities.  The directive for Alternative A would instruct the Desk to purchase mortgage-
backed securities to hold the level of the SOMA’s holdings of such issues approximately 
constant.  The directive for Alternative C would instruct the Desk to stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities,  effective on August 3, 2010.

Measure  Description  
Single -equation 
Model  The measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single- equation model is 
based on an estimated aggregate-demand relationship between the current 
value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate.  
Small 
Structural 
Model  The small -scale model of the economy consists of equations for six 
variables: the output gap, the equity premium, the federal budget surplus, the trend growth rate of output, the real bond yield, and the real federal 
funds rate.  
EDO Model  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using EDO —an estimated dynamic-
stochastic- general -equilibrium (DSGE) model of the U.S. economy—
depend on data for major spending categories, price and wages, and the federal funds rate as well as the model’s structure and estimate of the output 
gap. 
FRB/US Model  Estimates of the equilibrium real rate using FRB/US —the staff’s large- scale 
econometric model of the U.S. economy—depend on a very broad array of economic factors, some of which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  
Teal book-
consistent  Two measures are presented —based on the FRB/US and the EDO models.  
Both models a re matched to the extended Teal book forecast.  Model 
simulations determine the  value of the real federal funds rate that closes the 
output gap conditional on the extended baseline. Explanatory Notes

A. Measures of the Equilibrium Real Rate  
The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be 
projected to return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is 
defined as the rate that would c lose the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding 
model’s projection of the economy.  The medium- run concept is the value of the real federal 
funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years, under the assumption that 
monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps 
them equal thereafter.  The TIPS -based factor model measure provides an estimate of market 
expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  
  Measure  Description  
TIPS -based 
Factor Model  Yields on TIPS (Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities) reflect investors’ 
expectations of the future path of real interest rat es.  The TIPS -based 
measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven -year-
ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from TIPS yields as of the 
Tealbook publication date.  This forward rate is adjusted to remove 
estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three- factor 
arbitrage- free term -structure model applied to TIPS yields, nominal yields, 
and inflation.

Page 34 of 40The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal 
rate and realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the 
observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the core 
PCE price index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.   If the upcoming FOMC meeting falls 
early in the quarter, the lagged inflation measure ends in the last quarter.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Tealbook publication date.   
Estimates of the real federal funds rate depend  on the proxies for expected inflation used.  
The table below shows estimated real federal funds rates based on lagged core PCE inflation, the 
definition used in the Equilibrium Real Federal Funds Rate chart; lagged four-quarter headline 
PCE inflation; and  projected four-quarter headline PCE inflation beginning with the next quarter.  
For each estimate of the real rate, t he table also provides the Teal book-consistent FRB/US -based 
measure of the short -run equilibrium real rate and the average actual real fed eral funds rate over 
the next twelve quarters.  
   
  B. Analysis of Policy Paths and Confidence Intervals  
RULE SPECIFICATIONS    
For the following rules,  denotes the federal funds rate for quarter t , while the 
explanatory variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE inflation 
(), inflation two and three quarters ahead ( and ), the output gap in the current period 
and one quarter  ahead (   and  ), and the three -quarter- ahead forecast of 
annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( ), and denotes an assumed 
value  of policymakers’ long -run inflation objective.  The outcome- based and forecast -based rules 
were estimated using real- time data over the sample 1988:1 -2006:4; each specification was 
chosen using the Bayesian information criterion. Each rule incorporates a 75 basis point shift in 
the intercept, specified as a sequence of 25 basis point increments during the first three quarters 
of 1998.  The first two simple rules were proposed by Taylor (1993, 1999).  The prescriptions of 
the first -difference rule do not de pend on assumptions regarding r*  or the level of the output gap; 
see Orphanides (2003).

FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
Prescriptions from the two empirical rules are computed using dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule were followed starting at this FOMC 
meeting.  The dotted line labeled “Previous Teal book” is based on the current specification of the 
policy rul e, applied to the previous Teal book projection.  Confidence intervals are based on 
stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model with shocks drawn from the estimated residuals over 
1969-2008.

INFORMATION FROM FINANCIAL MARKETS    
The expected funds rate path is based on  Eurodollar quotes and implied three -month 
forward rates from swaps, and the confidence intervals for this path are constructed using prices 
of interest rate caps.   
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SIMPLE POLICY RULES    
These prescriptions are calculated using T ealbook projections for inflation and the output 
gap. Because the first -difference rule involves the lagged funds rate, the value labeled “Previous 
Tealbook” for the current quarter is computed using the actual value of the lagged funds rate, and 
the one-quarter -ahead prescriptions are based on this rule’s prescription for the current quarter.

C. Long -run Projections of the Balance Sheet  
and Monetary Base 
This appendix presents the assumptions underlying the projections provided in the 
section entitled “Long -Run Projections of the Balance Sheet and Monetary Base.”  
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are constructed on a monthly frequency from June 2010 to 
December 2020.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on May 31, 2010.  The pr ojections for all 
major asset and liability categories are summarized in the table that follow s the bullet points.   
The Teal book projection assumes that the federal funds rate begins to increase in the third 
quarter of 2012.  The balance sheet projections assume that no use of short -term draining tools is 
necessary to achieve the projected path for the federal funds rate.     
ASSETS  
Treasury securities, agency MBS, and agency debt 
• The baseline scenario, corresponding to Alternative B. 
o The Federal Reserve will begin to sell agency MBS and  agency  debt securities 
six months after the FOMC begins to increase the federal funds rate.  
Commencing in the first quarter of   2013, t he sales of these securities will be 
executed over a five- year period at a constant rate until the Federal Reserve’s 
agency MBS  and agency debt holdings fall to zero.  
o Prepayments of MBS and maturing agency debt are not reinvested. 1
o Due to expected settlement lags and prepayments, agency MBS holdings peak at 
$1.1 trillion in June 2010, a somewhat lower level than the amount purchased.  For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on estimates from one of the program’s investment managers.  The historically low coupon on these securities implies a relatively slow pr epayment rate.   
o Holdings of agency debt securities peaked at $169 billion in March 2010 and decline slowly thereafter as holdings continue to mature.  
o The maturity distribution of the Treasury securities is calculated  based on the 
actual holdings of Treasury securities.   The current weighted average maturity is

about s even  years.  Treasury securities held in the SOMA portfolio are reinvested 
as they mature.  
• Under Alternative A, the Committee reinvests the proceeds of maturing and prepaying 
Treasury  securities and  agency  MBS to maintain  the current level  of these securities until 
the target federal funds rate increases in the third quarter of 2012.  At this point, MBS holdings are allowed to decline as these assets mature or prepay.  As in the baseli ne 
scenario, sales of agency MBS and debt commence in the first quarter of 2013, and these securities are sold at a constant rate for five years until the holdings fall to zero.  Holdings 
of agency debt securities are redeemed.  
• Under Alternative C, the Com mittee allows Treasury  securities, agency debt securities, 
and agency MBS  to prepay or to redeem as they mature.   As in the baseline scenario, 
sales of agency MBS and debt commence in the first quarter of 2013, and these securities are sold at a constant rate for five years until the holdings fall to zero.    
• In all three alternatives, a minimum level of $25 billion is set for reserve balances.  To ensure that reserve balances do not fall below this minimum level, first the U.S. Treasury’s supplementary f inancing a ccount (SFA) is reduced.  After the SFA declines to 
zero, Treasury bills are purchased .  Purchases of bills continue until these securities 
comprise one- third of the Federal Reserve’s total Treasury holdings.  Once this threshold 
it met, the Federal Reserve buys notes and bonds in addition to bills in order to keep  bills 
at one -third of total Treasury holdings.   
• By the end of the projection period in all  three alternatives, the expansion of Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and capital, combined  with a runoff of assets, necessitates 
the reduction of the SFA to zero  and results in a level of reserve balances of $25 billion.  
After the SFA reaches zero, purchases of Treasury securities are resumed to maintain reserve balances at a level of $25 bill ion. 
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
• Loans through the Term Asset -Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) peaked at $48 
billion in December 2009.  Credit extended through this facility declines to  zero in the 
first quarter of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.  
• The assets held by TALF LLC increase to $1 billion by June 2010 and remain at that level through June 2015, before dropping down to zero thereafter.  Assets held by TALF 
LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by  the LLC and the U.S. 
Treasury’s initial funding.  In this projection, the LLC does not purchase any asset -
backed securities received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.  
• Central ban k liquidity swap lines, which were re -established on May 9, 2010, are 
projected to rise to $15 billion by July 2010.  S wap lines return to zero by the end of 
2011.    
                                                 
2 The staff forecast for end -of-month U.S. Treasury operating cash balances includes forecasts of both 
the TGA and balances associated with the U.S. Treasury’s Tax and Loan program.  Because balances 
associated with the Tax and Loan program are $2 billion, for the time being, this forecast is a good proxy 
for the level of TGA balances.

• Credit extended to AIG, the sum of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s extension 
of revolving credit and its preferred interests in AIA Aurora LLC and ALICO Holdings 
LLC, drops to $28 billion by December 2010 and then declines to zero by the end of 2013. 
• The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC, Maiden Lane II LLC, and Maiden Lane III LLC are sol d over time and reach either zero or a nominal level by the end of 2016.   
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
• Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock currency through the end of 2011.  From 2011 to the end of the proj ection period, Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, as projected in the extended Tealbook forecast. 
• The U.S. Treasury’s general account (TGA) follows the staff forecast for end -of-month 
U.S. Treasury operating cash balances through September 2010.
2  T
hereafter, the TGA 
drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion by the end of 2010 as it is assumed that the Treasury will have implemented a new cash management system that allows it to invest funds in excess of  $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the 
remainder of the forecast period.  
• Balances in the SFA remain at their current level until the SFA is reduced to ensure reserve balance levels do not fall below $25 billion.   
• Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year, in line with the average rate of the past ten years.  
• In general, increases in the level of assets of the Federal Reserve generate higher levels of 
reserve balances.  Increases in the levels of other liability items, such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation or the Treasury’s general account , like increases in the level of 
Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital 
items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of Treasury securities are assumed in order to maintain that  level of reserve balances.
