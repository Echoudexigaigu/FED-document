 Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from six policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, a nd the nominal income targeting rule.1  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2012 and 2013.  Medium-term prescriptions deri ved from dynamic simulations of each 
rule are discussed below.  As shown in the left-hand columns, the near-term prescriptions 
from all but one of the rule s keep the federal funds rate  at the effective lower bound 
through the first quarter of 2013.  The exception is the Taylor (1993) rule, which has a 
relatively low response to the output gap; it prescribes a funds rate  target of about 150 
basis points for the fourth quarter of 2012 a nd 130 basis points for the first quarter of 
2013.  The right-hand columns display the rule pr escriptions that arise in the absence of 
the lower-bound constraint.  The outcome-based  rule, the first-difference rule, and the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribe funds ra tes that are near zero for the next two 
quarters, whereas the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targ eting rule prescribe 
rates well below zero.  The more-accommodative prescriptions under these two rules 
reflect their stronger immediate response to the staff estimate of a sizable negative output 
gap. 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key Elements of the Staff Projection.”  The outlook 
for inflation is about the same as in th e previous Tealbook. The staff outlook for the 
output gap from 2012 through 2017 is 20 to 60 ba sis points narrower than in July, but 
little changed thereafter.  The na rrower output gap in part reflects the fact that the staff, as 
detailed in Book A of the Tealbook, now estimat es that economic activity increased at a 
somewhat faster pace during the first half of th is year than had been estimated in the July 
Tealbook.  In addition, the staff slightly revi sed up its outlook for real GDP growth in 
                                                 
1 Details for each rule appear in Explanatory Note A.   This is the first Tealbook that has presented 
near-term prescriptions for the inertial Taylor (1999) rule .  This rule uses the same long-run coefficients on 
the inflation and output gaps as Taylor (1999) and includes a coefficient of 0.85 on the lagged nominal 
federal funds rate.  Its properties are discussed in the memo by C. Erceg, J. Faust, M. Kiley, J.P. Laforte, D. López-Salido, S. Meyer, E. Nelson, D. Reifschneider , and R. Tetlow titled “An Ov erview of Simple Policy 
Rules and Their Use in Policymaking in Normal Ti mes and Under Current Conditions,” sent to the 
Committee on July 18, 2012.

  2013.  Because of the narrowing in the output ga p projection, the near-term prescriptions 
from the unconstrained rules have risen a bit co mpared with those in the July Tealbook.   
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US model when conditioned on the staff’s 
outlook for the economy.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained, would return output to potential in twelve quarters.  Reflecting 
the narrower staff projecti ons for the output gap, the r* estimate is 40 basis points higher 
than in the July Tealbook.  However, at 2.4 percent, it remains well below the estimated 
actual real federal funds rate of 1.7 percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations using 
the FRB/US model that incorporate the endogenous responses of inflation and the output 
gap to the different paths of the federal funds  rate prescribed by th e constrained versions 
of the six policy rules described above. The model is adju sted to match the staff’s 
baseline outlook for the economy and then simula ted using each of the policy rules.  Each 
rule is implemented from the third quart er of 2012 onward, under the assumption that 
private agents fully understand a nd anticipate the implications of  the rule for future real 
activity, inflation, and interest rates.2  For comparison, the exhibit also displays the 
Tealbook baseline paths, which are conditioned on the prescriptions of the outcome-
based rule. 
In the Tealbook baseline, th e federal funds rate depart s from the effective lower 
bound in the third quarter of 2014, one quarter ea rlier than in the Ju ly Tealbook, and then 
increases gradually to just above 4 percent by the end of the decade.  The Taylor (1999) 
rule leads to a path for the federal funds ra te that nearly replicates the baseline path.3  The 
                                                 
2 The staff’s baseline forecast inco rporates the effects of the larg e-scale asset purchase programs 
that the FOMC undertook in past years, as well as the effects of the ongoing maturity extension program 
and the modifications to the Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policies that were announced last September.  
Via this procedure, the policy rule simulations incorporate the effects of these balance sheet policies; the rules themselves are not directly adjusted fo r the effects of balance sheet policies.   
3 The outcome-based rule and the Taylor (1999) ru le have similar longer-run properties, especially 
with respect to the response to the level of the output  gap; however, their short-run responses are typically 
more distinct.  Currently, two offsetting forces lead to the similar funds rate prescriptions:  On the one hand, the outcome-based rule includes a term for the change in the output gap which, because of the projected pickup in output growth in 2014 and beyond, tends to prescribe faster increases in the funds rate relative to the Taylor (1999) rule.  On the other hand, the outcome-based rule includes lags of the federal  
funds rate whose presence tends to sl ow the pace of increase in the funds rate.  Currently, these two forces 
are almost precisely offsetting each other, leading,  on net, to similar funds rate prescriptions.

  Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based policy rule therefore produce very similar 
economic conditions, characterized by a slow convergence of the unemployment rate to 
the staff’s estimate of the effectiv e natural rate of  unemployment by 2020.4  In addition, 
inflation, after declining initially to belo w 1.4 percent, gradually increases to the 2 
percent goal. 
Under the nominal income targeting rule, the initial increase in the funds rate 
occurs in the fourth quarter of 2014, and po licy remains more accommodative than under 
the other rules for several years thereafter.  This more-accommodative policy is reflected 
in a more rapid decline in the unemployment ra te with inflation fluc tuating near 2 percent 
from mid-2013 onward. 
As both the Taylor (1993) ru le and the first-difference ru le prescribe tighter funds 
rate paths than the other rules, these two ru les are associated with a higher path for the 
unemployment rate and lower inflation through the end of the decade.  As noted above, 
because the Taylor (1993) rule does not re spond strongly to the level of the output gap, 
this rule implies an immediat e departure of the funds rate from its effective lower bound; 
the prescribed 130 basis point incr ease in the funds rate leads real activity and inflation to 
be weaker than under the baseline, prompting a partial reversal of th e initial rate hike.  
While the first-difference rule does not call for an  increase in the funds rate until the first 
quarter of 2014, it implies policy rates from mi d-2015 onwards that are about the same as 
under the Taylor (1993) rule.  Reflecting th e forward-looking pric e- and wage-setting 
behavior assumed in these simulations, the Tayl or (1993) rule and the first-difference rule 
thus generate fairly similar outcomes for infla tion, despite the initial  differences in their 
funds rate prescriptions. 
Under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first tightening of th e funds rate occurs 
in the second quarter of 2014, one quarter before the initial tighten ing prescribed by the 
Taylor (1999) rule and in the baseline simula tion.  This earlier tightening reflects the fact 
that the inertial Taylor (1999)  rule subsequently prescrib es a slower pace of policy 
tightening, generating a lower path for the real  federal funds rate in the near term and 
therefore a quicker pickup in real activity  and a lower path for the unemployment rate 
than for the Taylor (199 9) rule simulation.   
                                                 
4 The staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment declines from 6.2 percent in 
the third quarter of 2012 to 5.25 percent by the end of 2017.

  The implications of the staff’s revisions to economic fundamentals can be seen in 
the next exhibit, “Constrained vs. Uncons trained Optimal Control Policy,” which 
compares optimal control simulations derive d for this Tealbook with those shown in 
July.5  In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping 
headline PCE inflation close to the Co mmittee’s 2 percent go al, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  The simulations 
indicate that, with the federal funds rate c onstrained to remain positive, the optimal path 
for the federal funds rate does not rise a bove the effective lower bound until the fourth 
quarter of 2015, two quarters earlier than the path reported in the July Tealbook.6  The 
earlier funds rate firming is primarily a c onsequence of a modest downward revision to 
the staff’s medium-term outlook for the unemployment rate.  
The constrained optimal control policy keep s the funds rate lower for longer than 
any of the policy rules discussed above, and this policy would promote a faster pace of 
economic recovery than in the staff’s baseli ne outlook, in addition to keeping inflation 
close to the Committee’s goal of 2 percent.  In this set of  simulations, the gap between 
the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment is closed by the end of 2015, and the unemployment rate subsequently 
runs slightly below its natural rate for a few years.  Inflation initially exhibits a smaller 
decline than in the Tealbook baseline before  increasing to the 2 pe rcent objective by the 
fourth quarter of 2015 and then overshooting slightly, peaking at 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 and gradually returning to th e 2 percent objective thereafter.  The more 
rapid convergence to the Committee’s assumed objectives (and the subsequent temporary 
overshooting) occur because policymakers respond to the lower bound constraint by 
promising to keep interest rates low for an extended period of time.  As this policy is assumed to be completely credible, it boosts  inflation expectations and reduces real 
interest rates during the initial years of the simulation. 
                                                 
5 The optimal policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, including the assumptions about balance sheet policy 
described above. 
6 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit is  calculated as the differen ce between the nominal funds 
rate and a four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the 
real rate for this illustrative purpos e because it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expectations 
than does a four-quarter moving  average of headline inflation.

  If the nominal federal funds rate could fall below zero, the funds rate, under the 
optimal unconstrained policy, would decrease to 2.3 percent in the third quarter of 2013 
and return to positive territory by the second quarter of 2015.  Under these conditions, the 
unemployment rate would decline more rapidl y than under the optimal constrained policy 
and would reach the estimated natural rate  of unemployment by early 2015.  Inflation 
would rise back to 2 percent by the third quarter of 2015, a pa ttern much like that in the 
constrained simulation.  In subsequent year s, inflation would slightly overshoot the 
2 percent objective—but less persistently than in the constrained case—moving up to 
2.25 percent by 2017 before returning to the 2 percent mark by the end of 2019. 
The optimal control simulations discussed above assume that policymakers can 
credibly commit to future policy actions, constr aining the choices of future policymakers.  
A potential difficulty with commitment-based strategies is that their effectiveness 
depends on influencing the private sector’s e xpectation of the policy strategy likely to be 
in place several years ahead.  Policymaker s’ scope to manage expectations via a 
commitment policy thus hinge s on the private sector’s belief that the Committee will 
continue to choose accommodative policy well after the point at which the 
unemployment rate has returned to a level c onsistent with full employment and inflation 
has risen somewhat above its target.  The private sector may instead judge that the 
Committee would reoptimize at that point and choose less stimula tive policy.  As a result, 
monetary policy would have less scope to provide stimulus via f unds rate policy under 
discretion than under commitment, and as the exhibit “Optimal  Control Policy:  
Commitment vs. Discretion” shows, the federal funds rate would depart from the 
effective lower bound in the fi rst quarter of 2015, th ree quarters earlier than in the 
commitment case.  Accordingly, the unemploym ent rate would decline more slowly, and 
inflation would rise more gradua lly, back to the 2 percent goal.7 
The fifth exhibit, “Outcomes under Altern ative Policies,” tabulates the simulation 
results for key variables under the se lected policy rules described above. 
                                                 
7  These simulations take the staff’s baseline assumption about SOMA portfolio policy as given 
and so treat the federal funds rate as the sole instrument that the Committee adjusts in response to the state 
of the economy.  If policymakers wished to provide additional policy stimulus but saw little remaining 
scope to lower private sector expectations of the funds  rate path because of limits on their ability to commit 
to future policy, they could still provide stimulus by expanding the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents five policy alternatives—labeled A, B, B ′, B′′, and C—for 
the Committee’s consideration.  As always, the Committee could blend elements of the 
draft statements to constr uct its desired statement. 
The alternatives are quite similar in thei r characterization of the incoming data.  
The draft statements for each alternative begin by noting that “economic activity has 
continued to expand at a moderate pace in r ecent months.” Alterna tive A and each of the 
B alternatives observe that employment ha s “increased somewhat” and note that the 
unemployment rate remains elevated.  Altern ative C does not describe unemployment as 
elevated, and it characterizes employment growth as having “picked up.”  Alternative A 
and each of the B alternatives indicates that household spending has “continued to 
advance,” but that growth in business fixed investment “appears to have slowed.”  In 
contrast, Alternative C characterizes privat e domestic demand as having “continued to 
advance.”  Likewise, Alternative A and each of  the B alternatives note some further signs 
of improvement in the housing sector, albeit from a depressed level; Alternative C notes 
only the improvement.  With respect to in flation, Alternative A and each of the B 
alternatives indicate  that it has been subdued but qualify that ch aracterization by noting 
recent increases in “the prices of some key commodities.”  Alternative C says that 
inflation has declined since earlier this year  while also noting the significant increase in 
some commodity prices.  Each statement indi cates that longer-term inflation expectations 
have remained stable. 
Alternative A and each of the B alternatives also differ fr om Alternativ e C in their 
approach to communicating the medium-term outlook for real activity and employment.  
The language describing the outlook in Altern ative A and the B alternatives has been 
changed significantly from the August statem ent.  These draft alternatives give a 
conditional outlook based on the absence of furt her policy action; this approach aims to 
convey clearly why additional policy accommoda tion is forthcoming.  Specifically, the 
statements indicate that “without further po licy accommodation” economic growth either 
likely would not or might not (in the case of B ′) “be strong enough to generate sustained 
improvement in labor market conditions.”  In  contrast, the character ization of the outlook 
in Alternative C is unconditional and differs  only slightly from that in the August 
statement.  All of the draft statements continue to highlig ht the significant downside risks

to the outlook from strains in global financia l markets.  With respect to the outlook for 
inflation, Alternative A and each of the B alternatives indicate that the Committee 
anticipates that inflation over the medium term  “likely would run at or below” 2 percent, 
while Alternative C includes a projection th at inflation over the medium term will run 
“near” the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
The alternatives offer a range of different approaches to balance sheet policies.  
Alternatives A, B, and B ′ highlight a choice between tw o types of asset purchase 
programs.  Alternative A describes an LSAP that is discrete in nature, announcing new 
purchases that will cumulate to $750 billi on of longer-term Treasur y securities and $500 
billion of agency mortgage-back ed securities (M BS) by early 2014.1  Alternatives B and 
B′ embody incremental, flow-based approaches.  In particular, Alte rnative B indicates 
that the Committee will start purchasing $45 bi llion of longer-term Treasury securities 
per month and $30 billion of agency MBS pe r month and will continue adding to its 
holdings “until it has observed substantial ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions,” provided that pr ojected inflation over the medium term is “close to 2 
percent” and longer-term infla tion expectations remain stable .  Under either Alternative 
A or B, the Committee would end the maturity  extension program (M EP) and reinstitute 
the policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auc tion.  Alternative B ′ 
continues the MEP through year-end and adds  $30 billion per month in purchases of 
agency MBS; this alternative indicates th at the Committee will undertake additional asset 
purchases if “it does not observe substant ial ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions” in coming months.  Neither Alternative B ′′ nor Alternative C initiates 
additional asset purchases at the September meeting.  Alternative B ′′ continues the MEP 
through the end of the year, and indicates that  the Committee “will engage in further asset 
purchases” if it does not observe substant ial ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions over coming months.  In contrast , Alternative C would only continue the MEP 
through year-end, as announced in June.  A ll five alternatives envision the Committee 
continuing its policy of reinvesting principal payments on its holdings of agency debt and 
agency MBS.

Federal Reserve could purchase over the next two years without causing a meaningful deterioration in 
market functioning see the memo by staff in the Division of Monetary Affairs at the Board of Governors

on Asset Purchases” sent to the Committee on July 25, 2012.

Under all five alternatives, the Committ ee would maintain the 0 to ¼ percent 
target range for the federal funds rate.  Alternatives A, B, and B ′ extend the period over 
which the Committee anticipates maintaining exceptionally low levels of the funds rate to 
“at least through mid-2015.”  Except for Alternative C, the statements also give the 
forward guidance a more positive tone by re placing the reference to “low rates of 
resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation” with language that conveys the 
Committee’s intention to keep the federal f unds rate low until afte r the recovery has 
clearly strengthened.  Specifically, statements associated with Alternatives A and B say, “the Committee expects that a highly acco mmodative stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the conclusion of this asset-purchase program.”  The wording under Alternatives B ′ and B′′ replace “after the conclusion of 
this asset-purchase program ” with “after the economic  recovery strengthens.”  
Alternative B ′′ aims to provide additional accommodation by introducing new forward 
guidance, indicating that the Committee will keep the target range for the federal funds 
rate at 0 to ¼ percent “at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 6½ percent” 
provided that inflation stays close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and longer-term 
inflation expectations continue  to be well anchored.  Altern ative C offers the choice of 
making the anticipated date of the first increase in the funds  rate a year earlier, or by 
replacing the current forward guidance—in cluding the date—with new language that 
describes the factors the Committee will consider in deciding when first to raise its target 
for the funds rate. 
Finally, Alternative A notes the possibility  of a reduction in th e remuneration rate 
on excess reserves from 25 basis points to 15 basis points in order to provide a modest 
amount of additional policy stimulus. 
The following table highlights key elements of the differences in the alternative 
statements.  The table is followed by complete draft statements and then by a summary of

AUGUST FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests 
that economic activity decelerated somewhat ove r the first half of this year.  Growth 
in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains 
elevated.  Business fixed investment has co ntinued to advance.  Household spending 
has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.  Despite some 
further signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depre ssed.  Inflation has 
declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices  of crude oil and 
gasoline, and longer-term inflation e xpectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects economic growth to remain 
moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very graduall y.  Consequently, the 
Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward 
levels that it judges to be consistent with  its dual mandate.  Furthermore, strains in 
global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee anticipates that infl ation over the medium term will run at 
or below the rate that it judges most  consistent with its dual mandate. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to 
maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep  the target range for the fe deral funds rate at 0 to ¼ 
percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of 
resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels fo r the federal funds ra te at least through 
late 2014. 
4. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to 
extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it 
is maintaining its existing policy of reinve sting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee will closel y monitor incoming information on economic 
and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

put downward pressure on longer-term  interest rates, support mortgage 
markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

4. This new asset-purchase program replaces  the previously announced maturity

reserve balances, the Board of Governors would issue an accompanying statement that 
might read:  
In a related action, the Board of Governors voted today to reduce the

6. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market con
ditions  in 
a context of price stability.  In particular, if the Co mmittee does not observe 
substantial ongoing improvement in labor market conditions over coming 
months, it will engage in further asse t purchases until such improvement is 
achieved.  In determining the pace and composition of any new asset-purchase 
program, the Committee will take appropriat e account of the likely efficacy and 
costs of additional purchases.

SEPTEMBER FOMC  STATEMENT —A LTERNATIVE C 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June  August  
suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over  the first half of this year  
has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months .  Growth in 
employment has been slow in recent months , and the unemployment rate remains 
elevated  picked up .  Business fixed investment   Private domestic demand  has 
continued to advance, Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace 
than earlier in t he year .  Despite some further signs of improvement , and the housing 
sector remains depressed  has shown some further signs of improvement .  Inflation 
has declined since earlier this year, mainly  reflecting lower prices of crude oil and 
gasoline,  and longer-term inflation exp ectations have remained stable , but prices of 
some key commodities recently have increased significantly . 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects economic growth to remain 
moderate over coming quarter s and then to pick up very  gradually.  Consequently, the 
Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only  slowly toward 
levels that it judges to be consistent with  its dual mandate.  Furthermore, strains in 
global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee anticipates that infl ation over the medium term will run at 
or below  near  the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate  
Committee’s 2 percent objective .   
3. To support a  stronger  the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at the rate most consistent wi th its dual mandate, the Committee expects to 
maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the 
Committee decided today to keep  the target range for the fe deral funds rate at 0 to ¼ 
percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions—including low rates of 
resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run—are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels fo r the federal funds ra te at least through 
late [ 2013
 | 2014 ] .

3'. To support a stronger  sustainable  economic recovery and to help ensure that 
inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  
In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal 
funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and curren tly anticipates that  economic conditions
—
including low rates of resource utilization and a subdue d outlook for inflation over 
the medium run —are likely to warrant exceptionally low leve ls for the federal funds 
rate at least through late 2014 .  As rates of resource utilization rise toward levels 
consistent with maximum employment, the Committee eventually will need to 
make monetary policy less accommodative  in order to ensure that the economy 
expands at a sustainable pace and to prevent inflation from persistently 
exceeding its longer-run objective.  In determining the appropriate time to 
increase its target for the federal funds  rate, the Committee will consider a range 
of factors, including actual and project ed labor market conditions, the medium-

term outlook for inflation, and the risk s to the achievemen t of the Committee’s 
objectives.  
4. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to 
extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it 
is maintaining its existing policy of reinve sting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed 
securities.  The Committee will closel y monitor incoming information on economic 
and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed  
regularly review the size and compositio n of its securities holdings and is 
prepared to adjust those holdings as necessary  to promote a stronger economic 
recovery and sustained improvement in la bor market conditions in a context of  
maximum employment and  price stability.

THE CASE FOR ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATION  
The Committee may believe that without additional policy accommodation 
economic growth will not be adequate to re turn the unemployment rate to its mandate-
consistent level within the ne xt few years.  Members might also expect the inflationary 
pressures from recent increases in oil and grai n prices to be temporary and moderate, and 
they might see inflation expectations as well anchored, leaving little risk that inflation 
would surprise to the upside.  The general contours of th is outlook have persisted for 
quite some time.  Although some of the incoming data during the intermeeting period 
suggested modest increases in household spending and employment, and the housing 
sector showed some further signs of improve ment, other data, such as those for business 
spending and consumer confidence, remained soft.  Therefore, policymakers also may 
judge that it would be unlikely that even a couple of months of stronger-than-expected 
economic activity could reduce the amount of  slack in labor markets or alter the 
trajectory of expected infla tion to a degree that would obvi ate the need for a further 
easing of monetary policy.  With the inflation outlook subdued and the employment 
outlook unsatisfactory, some policymakers ma y argue that a bala nced approach to 
achieving both sides of the dual mandate requires significant a dditional monetary 
stimulus.   
In addition to an unsatisfactory modal projection, policymakers may also judge 
that downside risks to that outlook—particular ly from the European crisis and issues 
relating to U.S. fiscal policy—remain quite  elevated.  Specifically, they may see non-
trivial odds that the European crisis could ultimately impose a very substantial drag on the U.S. recovery.  In addition, some policym akers may also see a sizable probability that 
the Congress and the Administration will be una ble to resolve contentious fiscal issues 
before the turn of the year, and that fiscal  policy could consequen tly tighten sharply at 
that time.  Some members may want to add accommodation in advance to insure against 
such an event, so that the economy is st ronger before encountering those headwinds.  
Moreover, continued uncertainty about those scenarios could restra in household spending 
and business investment over the rest of this year more significantly than appears to have 
been the case thus far.  With a substan tial fraction of unemployed workers having been 
jobless for long periods, some FOMC participan ts also might want to guard against the 
risk that this high level of long-term unemployment wi ll persist long enough to 
permanently depress labor s upply and potential output.

These draft alternatives provide four  approaches to providing additional 
accommodation.  Alternatives A, B, and B′  describe three different strategies for 
additional asset purchases.  If the Committee de cided to ease policy through a substantial 
expansion of its balance sheet, it might choos e one of Alternative A, which describes a 
standard fixed asset-purchase program, or Alternative B, which describes an open-ended, 
flow-based asset-purchase program.  Each of those new asset-purchase programs would 
replace the existing MEP.  Alternative B ′ proposes a more incremental change to the 
Committee’s policy by adding agency MBS purchases of $30 billion per month while the 
MEP is completed and then assessing pr ogress toward the Committee’s goals over 
coming months.  Alternative B ′′ completes the MEP and strengthens the forward 
guidance by providing explicit quantitative gu idance for the unemployment rate and 
inflation that suggests the first increase in th e target range for the federal funds rate will 
be further in the future than market particip ants currently expect rather than specifying a 
date.  Alternative B ′′ also indicates that the Committee would engage in further asset 
purchases if it does not “observe substant ial ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions over coming months.” 
Each of Alternatives A, B, and B ′ increases the SOMA’s holdings of both longer-
term Treasury securities and agency MBS with the aim of putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and easing financia l conditions in general while also directly 
supporting mortgage markets.  In  part, the split between Trea sury securities and agency 
MBS is designed to achieve a higher comb ined monthly rate of purchases while 
minimizing the possibility that the program  will affect market functioning.  Although 
purchases of agency MBS would typically re move less duration from the market than 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securi ties, MBS purchases also may depress 
somewhat the spread between MBS and Treasury yields, perhaps because of the associated removal of prepayment risk and volatility.  As such, those purchases would 
likely place slightly more downward pressure on residential mortgage interest rates than 
would a similarly sized program focused sole ly on Treasury securities.  Indeed, some 
participants may judge that providing additional support to the housing market may help 
firm the emerging recovery in that sector , a development that they might see as 
generating wider-ranging benefits, such as higher consumer confidence, given the 
prominence of the contribution of that  sector to the downturn.

Alternative B 
The Committee may favor a flow-based purchase program to its previous strategy 
of announcing a large, discre te total purchase amount, b ecause an open-ended policy 
conveys that it is willing to do whatever it can to make progress toward its dual 
objectives.  If so, members may wish to announce an incremental, open-ended purchase 
program like the one included in Alternat ive B.  The Committee could choose to 
implement such a flow-based program by speci fying initial monthly rates of purchases—
for example $45 billion per month of longer-te rm Treasury securities and $30 billion per 
month of agency MBS—and by stating that it anticipates continuing to expand the 
SOMA portfolio “until it has observed subs tantial ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions,” provided that the Committee projects that infl ation over the medium term 
“will be close to its 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations remain 
stable.”  The new purchase program would replace the existing MEP and the policy of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities  at auction would be reinstituted. 
Policymakers may feel that such a clear  indication of the Committee’s resolve 
could boost consumer and business sentim ent to a greater de gree than announcing 
another fixed program with a defined end da te.  Moreover, an open-ended program, if 
well understood by the public, would lead market participants to revise  their expectations 
about the total size of the purchase program in response to incoming economic data, and 
so could help to shore up economic activity in  the face of unanticipat ed adverse shocks or 
dampen concerns that the purchases would ge nerate excessive inflat ion by persisting too 
long after the outlook strengthened sufficientl y.  Members may judge  that conveying the 
goals of the program and the Committee’s reaction function or “st opping rule” by using 
qualitative language such as that in paragra ph 4 of the draft statem ent for Alternative B 
will give investors enough information to enable them to form a reasonable expectation 
of how long the program is likely to continue, particularly if that language were to be 
supplemented by the Chairman’s press conferen ce remarks and the minutes of the FOMC 
meeting.2  Conveying the Committee’s anticipati on of the minimum length of the 
program, currently stated as “at least through mid-2013” in Alternative B, could also help 
anchor market expectations.3  Staff models suggest that  a program ending in July 2013 
                                                 
2 Additional considerations related to the effe cts of a flow-based purchase program on the 
economic outlook can be found in the memo by J.-P. Laforte, D. Lóp ez-Salido, S. Meyer, E. Nelson, and J. 
Roberts titled “Flow-Based Balance-Sheet Policies: Communication Issues and Macroeconomic Effects,” 
sent to the Committee on August 29, 2012. 
3 The date also provides an additional aspect of policy that can be changed to help communicate 
the evolution of the Committee’s outlook for economic activity and inflation.

might result in a ½ percentage point decline in the unemployment rate over the next two 
years relative to a simulation without an LSAP and would le ave inflation running close to 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.   
Policymakers may judge not only that the persistence and exte nt of weakness in 
the economic outlook warrant a new asset-purch ase program, but also that many of the 
costs of nontraditional policies relative to more-standard policy appear manageable.  In 
the memo, “Market Functioning and Limits on Asset Purchases,” the staff presented 
analysis indicating that a new LSAP of  around $1 trillion—an amount corresponding to a 
decision to conclude purchases of about $75 bi llion per month in the fourth quarter of 
2013—likely would not cause meaningful disruptions in market functioning.4  Moreover, 
staff concluded that the Committee probabl y could accumulate considerably more 
securities than is currently envisioned before  such concerns materialized.  Moreover, the 
memo “The effect of an additional $1 trilli on LSAP on the exit strate gy,” concludes that a 
$1 trillion program would not require a change to the stated exit principles when the 
Committee believes that it is time to tighten policy.5 
Some policymakers may judge that the pace of economic recovery is 
unsatisfactory and insufficient to make st eady progress toward the Committee’s dual 
mandate, but have concerns about whether th e expected benefits of additional asset 
purchases are large enough to offset the cost s and risks of such a policy.  These members 
may favor a flow-based policy because it o ffers the opportunity, as indicated in the 
statement, to regularly review the efficacy and costs of the new program, and to make 
appropriate adjustments to the pace and composition of its purchases.  If the benefits of 
the new policy turn out to be greater than e xpected and the costs remain manageable, the 
Committee may find it easier, if necessary, to provide additional accommodation by 
continuing its purchases or increasing th e pace of purchases under the open-ended 
program than it would be to design and announc e another discrete program.  In contrast, 
should policymakers suspect that the program is contributing to undesired outcomes—such as impaired market functioning, excessive risk taking by financial institutions, or a 
                                                 
4 Additional considerations related to the effect s of significant additional asset purchases on 
market functioning can be found in the memo titled “Market Functioning and Limits on Asset Purchases” 
noted above. 
5 Additional considerations related to the effects of significant additional asset purchases on the 
Committee’s exit strategy can be found in the memo by staff in the Division of Monetary Affairs at the 
Board of Governors and in the Markets Group at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York titled “The Effect of an Additional $1 Trillion LSAP on the Exit Strategy,” sent to the Committee on August 28, 2012.

rise in longer-term inflation e xpectations—they may feel that  it would be easier for the 
Committee to slow the pace of purchases or shorten the horizon over which purchases 
continue under a flow-based program th an to interrupt a discrete program. 
The same assessment of the economic outlook and inflation over the medium run 
that might lead policymakers to undertake a new purchase program could also argue in 
favor of extending the forward guidance on the fe deral funds rate in the statement to “at 
least through mid-2015.”  Some members mi ght have pushed out the period over which 
they see unemployment remaining elevated and so with inflation still likely to be 
subdued, they now anticipate that near-zero fede ral funds rates are likely to be warranted 
for somewhat longer than when the Committee last changed the forward guidance in 
January.  Moreover, policymakers may judge  that it is approp riate to extend the 
anticipated period of near-zero funds rates in concert with the new LSAP to reinforce the 
Committee’s commitment to provide a dditional accommodation until the economic 
recovery strengthens.  Furthermore, the statement introduces a new rationale for 
providing forward guidance—“to support continued progress toward maximum 
employment and price stability…a highly accommodative stance…will remain 
appropriate for a considerable time after the co nclusion of this asset- purchase program.”  
Policymakers may view the new formulation as  more positive than the language in the 
August statement and as better reflecting thei r desire to leave the funds rate unchanged 
for longer than might be prescribed by polic y rules developed when interest rates were 
not constrained by the zero lower bound. 
According to the Desk’s latest surve y, a statement along the lines of the one 
associated with Alternative B would likel y be somewhat more accommodative than 
market participants expect.  About three-fourth s of the dealers in the Desk survey expect 
the Committee to extend the forward guidance at the September meeting, and a majority 
anticipate that the first increase in the target federal funds rate will most likely occur in 
mid-2015.  That expectation is roughly consis tent with market-implied measures of the 
path of the federal funds rate.  In addition, d ealers appear to be assigning slightly greater 
than even odds to the announcement of a new asset-purchase program at the September 
meeting and very high odds on additional ea sing through the SOMA por tfolio within one 
year.  Most of the dealers that expected the Committee to increase its securities holdings believed that a new purchase program would be between $400 billion and $600 billion, 
with a roughly equal split of  Treasury securities and agen cy MBS.  Thus, despite the 
language in the August statement indicat ing that the Committee would provide 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
September 6, 2012
Page 32 of 70
Authorized for Public Release
   
“additional accommodation as needed,” dealers do not appear to have priced in additional 
purchases of the magnitude of Alternative B.  Therefore, investors would likely revise up 
their estimates of the ultimate size of a purchase program over the coming year, though 
the indication that the Committee is concerned about the costs of th e program could result 
in a smaller revision than otherwise.  As a consequence, longer-ter m interest rates would 
likely fall somewhat, stock prices would rise, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar 
would decline.  The end of the sales of  short-term Treasuries under the MEP and 
expansion in reserve balances  would also put some downw ard pressure on short-term 
interest rates.  However, market participan ts might find an open-ended purchase program 
difficult to interpret because it would be  a notable departure from past purchase 
programs, making the size of the effect on a sset prices more uncertain than usual.  
Alternative B ′ 
As in the case for Alternative B, members may view the information received 
since their last meeting as insufficient to chan ge what they see as an unsatisfactory modal 
economic outlook and so wish to increase the amount of accommodation at this meeting.  
Given the positive tone of some recent economic indicators and improved market 
sentiment toward Europe, however, some FOMC  participants may view the risks to the 
economic outlook as somewhat more balance d.  Members also might want to postpone 
more dramatic action until they receive additional information about the underlying 
strength of the economic recovery, in order to better evaluate the extent to which 
temporary factors and seasonal-adjustment di fficulties contributed to the weak data 
received earlier this year.  In addition, some policymakers may want to evaluate the 
effects of the ongoing MEP and move cautious ly in adding to the size of the SOMA 
portfolio given attendant costs and risks of nontraditional policy tools.   
Therefore, the Committee might consider a staged approach to providing 
additional accommodation, as in Alternative B ′, and begin by purchasing $30 billion per 
month of agency MBS while completing the ME P, leaving ample time to assess the need 
for, as well as the benefits and costs of, a larger expansion of the balance sheet.  The 
statement would then indicate that the Committee will undertake additional asset 
purchases if it does not observe “substantial ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions” over coming months.  Policymakers might favor such an approach because 
the MEP is already adding long-term Treasuries to the SOMA portfolio at about the rate 
and of the same net duration as indicated in Alternative B, and, as  noted above, purchases 
of MBS would likely place slightly more dow nward pressure on residential mortgage

interest rates than purchases of Treasury securities.  The Co mmittee could also adopt, as 
noted in the statement, the more accommoda tive language associated with the forward 
guidance for the federal funds rate and extend to “at least through mid-2015” the 
anticipated period during which rates will remain exceptionally low, for reasons 
described in the case for Alternative B. 
Because of the many new components of the statement associated with 
Alternative B ′, including the open-ended nature of the purchases and the relatively short 
time frame for evaluating whether to continue  or expand the program, the statement could 
leave market participants uncertain about the likely future path of policy.  This 
uncertainty might damp the announcement ef fect of the program unless subsequent 
communications by policymakers were to convey a likelihood that the cumulative total of 
additional purchases will be quite large.  As a result, it is even more difficult than usual to 
forecast the reaction of financial markets to  the release of a statement like the one 
associated with Alternative B ′.  The extension of the forward guidance would, all else 
equal, put downward pressure on long-term in terest rates.  Stric tly speaking, the amount 
of MBS purchases during the rest of 2012 would be somewhat more than the median 
expected over that period according to th e Desk survey, but markets still may be 
disappointed in the relatively small amount  of purchases to which the Committee is 
willing to commit at this time.  Therefore, equity prices might decline somewhat on the 
announcement and the dollar could strengthen.  Indeed, markets may be unsettled until 
further communications—such as the release of the SEP and the press conference—are 
forthcoming.   
Alternative B ′′ 
In contrast, some members who would like to increase the extent of policy 
accommodation may see an extension and strengthening of the forward guidance as a 
more effective or lower cost nontraditional tool at this time than the other options 
available to the Committee, and so may wish to consider a statement along the lines of 
B′′.  Important factors that might guide po licymakers’ preference for relying more 
heavily on forward guidance than on asset pu rchases at this time could include their 
assessments of the degree to which additional transparency by the FOMC will be viewed 
as a credible commitment and thereby transl ate into meaningful financial and economic 
effects, and the extent to which they are c oncerned about the costs of a further expansion 
of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
Alternatives

For instance, participants ma y at this time judge that a modification of the forward 
guidance would provide at least as mu ch accommodation as the amount of asset 
purchases they would be willing to support.   Policymakers may also believe that a 
credible extension of the forward guidance could provide  insurance against downside 
risks and compensate for limits to polic y accommodation when conducting policy near 
the effective lower bound on interest rate s.  Members may find the explicit 
communication of the rates of unemploymen t and inflation associated with the 
conditional forward guidance contained in paragraph 3 of the proposed statement 
particularly attractive.   To the extent that providing quantitative  guidance reduces the 
public’s uncertainty about the Committee’s economic outlook and its policy reaction 
function, a statement along those lines could reduce market volatility, and, in current circumstances, foster more accommodative financial conditions.  By giving market 
participants greater clarity about the economic conditions that the Committee judges would be likely to warrant rais ing the target for the federal funds rate, a statement using 
this sort of conditional forward guidance could also reduce the chance that medium- and longer-term rates will rise too soon or t oo quickly as the recovery progresses. 
In order to clarify the forward guidan ce, the statement associated with B ′′ could 
indicate that the Committee would maintain “this exceptionally low range” for the federal 
funds rate rather than the somewhat less sp ecific language, “exceptio nally low levels” for 
the federal funds rate, used in the other alte rnatives.  The statement might then go on to 
indicate that, conditional on projected inflati on over the medium term remaining close to 
2 percent and inflation e xpectations staying well anchored, the Committee would 
maintain the current target range for “at leas t as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 
6½ percent.”  The Desk’s most recent survey indicated that most primary dealers expect 
the first increase in the federal funds rate target to occur in the middle of 2015 or later, 
reflecting the significant odds the dealers place on the Committee extending the forward 
guidance at the September meeting. For most dealers, their associated forecasts of the unemployment rate remain above 6½ percen t through the end of 2015.  Thus, a statement 
along the lines of  Alternative B ′′ might be viewed as a sign ificantly longer-than-expected 
extension of the forward guida nce.  As in Alternative B ′, the statement also indicates in 
paragraph 6 that additional asset purchases  would be forthcoming if labor market 
conditions had not improved substantially by th e end of the year.  With a majority of 
market participants expecting the Committ ee to announce additional asset purchases at 
the September meeting, it is difficult to judge the extent to which a significant change in the forward guidance combined with the la nguage indicating that an asset purchase 
Alternatives

Page 35 of 70

program is still a distinct po ssibility would affect asset ma rkets.  Thus, the reaction of 
interest rates, equity prices, and th e dollar might depend importantly on other 
communications, including the Chairman’s press conference.   
Alternative A 
Some members might judge that the flow  purchase programs in Alternatives B 
and B′ are likely to result in too small and uncertain an improvement in the economic 
outlook, and that additional asset purchases ar e an important complement to an extension 
of the forward guidance.  If so, participants may wish to provide a much stronger signal 
of the Committee’s willingness to s ubstantially increase its holdings of securities in order 
to help make greater progress toward its dua l mandate.  Furthermore, some participants 
may judge that the outlook is unusually uncertain , with risks that are heavily weighted to 
the downside, and see that as a reason not to adopt an incremental approach but instead to 
act more forcefully.  In addition, members ma y view the consequences of a new adverse 
shock while the economy remains weak as significantly more costly than the possibility 
that the Committee would fail to tighten pol icy as needed should economic performance 
surprise to the upside.   
These participants may want to adopt a statement such as the one presented in 
Alternative A that expands th e balance sheet thro ugh a large, discrete  purchase program 
as in previous LSAP operations , and also extends the date in the forward rate guidance to 
“at least through mid-2015.”  Specifically, the Committee could choose to announce its 
intention to purchase an addi tional $750 billion of longer-t erm Treasury securities and 
$500 billion of agency MBS at a combined pace of about $75 billion per month through 
early 2014.  The new purchase program would also replace the existing MEP and the 
policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securi ties at auction would be reinstituted.   
The Committee might prefer to implement a large, discrete purchase program if it 
believes that investor uncertainty about the ultimate size of an open-ended program would make it less effective than a discrete  program.  For instance, policymakers may 
decide that articulating all of  the conditions that might lead them to end a flow-based 
program could undermine the public’s understa nding of the Committee’s intentions and 
so dampen the announcement effect.  Moreover,  members might also point out that the 
type of LSAP envisioned in Alternative A is not truly “fixed;” the Committee has, in fact, 
made adjustments during earlier LSAP programs, as well as to its reinvestment policies, 
when conditions warranted.  Thus, participants  may believe that the moderate additional 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

flexibility of a flow-based program is out weighed by the relative ease of communicating 
a discrete LSAP program to the public. 
Policymakers also may see the benefits of a reduction in the interest rate paid on 
required and excess reserve balances to 15 ba sis points as likely to outweigh the costs.6  
In that case, the Board could adopt such a reduction, and that step could be noted in the 
press release containing the FOMC statement.   Such a reduction in the rate paid on 
reserve balances would put m odest downward pressure on a range of money market rates, 
and so lower medium-term and perhaps longer- term rates, at least to some degree.  
Indeed, some short-term rates ar e nearer to the top of the fe deral funds target range than 
they were at other times the Committee has considered this option.  Lower compensation 
for reserve balances would also provide a m odest increase in the incentive for banks to 
expand lending or their holdings of securities .  In addition, it could mitigate uneasiness 
about the Federal Reserve appearing to subsid ize banks by remunerating reserves at a rate 
noticeably above that on other short-term investments.  Although participants might be concerned that a further reduction in money market rates could disrupt money markets and so have adverse effects on the economy, the ECB’s recent decision to cut its deposit 
rate to zero does not appear, thus far, to have caused a ny significant disruptions in 
European money markets.  That said, it may be premature to draw conclusions from the European experience, both because insuffici ent time has passed since the cut and because 
of the important differences that exist between money markets in the United States and Europe.  Cutting the rate paid on reserve balances also would reduce depository institutions’ incentive to borrow and hold exce ss reserves, likely resulting in a further 
reduction in trading volume in the federal funds market and potentially in greater 
volatility in the effective federal funds rate.  Moreover, banks might impose greater fees on deposit accounts, a development that could le ad to a negative response by the public.  
These risks would be reduced by keeping the rate paid on reserve balances at 15 basis points rather than redu cing it to zero.    
 Although most dealers in the Desk’s surv ey anticipated a change in the forward

6 Additional considerations related to possible changes in the remuneration rate on excess reserves 
can be found in the memo by M. Gilles DeBoer, M. DePooter, and S. Hilton titled “Reducing the Interest 
Rate Paid on Excess Reserves,” sent to the Committee on September 6, 2012.

be expected to fall.  Primary dealers, on av erage, saw about a 25 percent probability of a 
cut in the remuneration rate on required and excess reserves at some point within a year, 
but the probability of such a change at the September meeting was notably smaller.  
Thus, if the interest rate on excess reserves were reduced, shorte r-term yields would 
likely decline several basis points, in additi on to the effects of the other actions the 
Committee announced.  The impact could be  amplified by the in crease in reserve 
balances generated by the new purchase progr am and the end of sales of short-term 
Treasury securities under the MEP.  With any combination of the options in Alternative 
A, equity prices would probably increase, a nd the foreign exchange  value of the dollar 
would likely decline. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some participants may see the recent data as suggesting that the underlying pace 
of economic recovery and growth in employ ment have remained moderate in recent 
months.  This view could be reinforced by further improvement in some indicators of 
conditions in the housing sector.  Ind eed, smoothing through the month-to-month 
fluctuations in the data, some policymakers may see the economic recovery as continuing 
on a sustainable course.  Furthermore, they ma y judge that overall financial conditions in 
the United States remain supportive of economic growth and view financial strains in Europe as having eased of late.  Members mi ght note that while inflation has declined 
since earlier this year and inflation expecta tions remain well anchored, the prices of oil 
and other key commodities have increased recently.  In addition, some participants may 
see little risk of signifi cant disinflation or deflat ion given the current outlook. 
Some policymakers may believe that mone tary policy actions taken to date are 
sufficient to support a near-term pick up in th e underlying pace of gr owth in output to a 
rate somewhat above their assessment of the gr owth rate of potential output, and so might 
view the projected pace of improvement in the labor market as adequate.  If so, they may 
prefer to maintain a policy stance similar to  that at the previous meeting and make no 
further changes to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet or the Committee’s forward 
guidance.  Some may even wish to begin sc aling back the public’s expectations for the 
duration of the current low range of the fede ral funds rate.  These possibilities would be 
consistent with a statement like that in Alternative C. 
Committee members whose outlook for the economy and assessment of the risks 
to that outlook have not changed significan tly since the August meeting might think it 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Page 38 of 70

imprudent to change policy substantially at this  juncture, particularly if they anticipate a 
quicker convergence toward full employment a nd 2 percent inflation than envisioned in 
the staff forecast.  Therefore, they may prefer again to forego additional policy 
accommodation while leaving the forward guidance unchanged, as offered in one option 
in paragraph 3.  In contrast, the stronger t one of some incoming data may have led some 
participants to mark up their outlook for economic growth or to see some of the downside 
risks to that outlook as having become more  manageable.  As a result, those members 
may now anticipate a significantly earlier first increase in  the funds rate than was 
indicated by the Committee’s statements so fa r this year, and might want to adjust the 
forward guidance at this meeting.  Alternatively, as in paragraph 3 ′, the FOMC could 
eliminate the calendar date from its forw ard guidance and replace it with new language 
that describes in somewhat greater detail  the key economic factors that the Committee 
will consider in deciding when to first increase its target for the federal funds rate.  If the 
public understood this new language, invest ors would modify appropriately their 
assessments of the likely timing of the first increase in the target funds rate as these 
factors change over time. 
Some members may note that the outlook over the medium term has not improved 
despite the better tone of incoming data during this intermeeting period, especially if they 
believe that downside risks to the outlook remain  elevated.  Thus, they may be inclined to 
provide additional monetary accommodation to foster more rapid progress toward the 
dual mandate.  Nevertheless, they may want to wait for additional information about the 
trajectory of output and inflati on to gauge the extent to whic h growth is likely to pick up 
in response to policy actions already in place before undertaking a new policy action, 
especially given the higher-than-normal un certainty about the economic outlook as well 
as the efficacy and costs associated with va rious policy easing measures.  Indeed, some 
participants may have a high threshold for additional action, either because they expect that additional asset purchases would likely have only a very modest effect on the 
economic outlook or because they are concerne d that those purchases could have adverse 
effects on inflation or negative implications for financial market functioning or financial 
stability.  Alternatively, some members may be  concerned that a signi ficant expansion of 
the balance sheet, whether via an open-ended or discrete asset pur chase program, could 
result in the Federal Reserve having to su spend remittances to the Treasury and book a 
sizeable deferred asset, especially if interest rates increased unexpectedly.

some participants may be worried that providing quantitativ e guidance about the 
unemployment rate and inflati on to convey the likely timing of  the first increase in the 
target range for the federal funds rate could le ad the public to view th e specified values as 
representative of the Committee’s goals rather  than interim targets to be reached in 
furtherance of those goals.  In light of su ch concerns, those participants may want 
additional time to evaluate the potential co sts and benefits of po licy alternatives.   
A statement like those included in Alternativ e C, even with the option that retains 
the late 2014 date, would strike market participants as likely  signaling a faster removal of 
policy accommodation, and so resu lt in higher interest rate s and a decline in equity 
prices.  A statement that moved forward the expected date of the first increase in the 
funds rate—or that included language that investors read as indicating that the date was 
likely to be substantially earlier than previously thought—would greatly surprise 
financial market participants.  According to the Desk’s survey, the primary dealers see a 
substantial probability that the Committee will m ove the expected date of the first policy 
firming further into the future at this meeti ng and zero probability that it will be brought 
closer.  Hence, moving the projected date of the first increase in the funds rate closer 
would likely cause a sizable adjustment in mark et participants’ expectations of the policy 
rate path, leaving market interest rates significantly higher at maturities beyond a year or so.  If the Committee were to drop the date from its forward guidance without providing a 
clear indication of the specific economic c onditions that would cause the Committee to 
begin raising the target rate, investors might well be quite uncertain about the 
Committee’s intentions, at least until policymakers provided additional information about 
the likely path for policy.  Furthermore, par ticipants have priced in significant odds of 
additional asset purchases in the near future, and the statement in Alternative C (with or 
without a change in the forward guidance) woul d be read as a signal that such action was 
very unlikely to be forthcoming, putting furt her upward pressure on longer-term rates and 
weighing on equity prices.  Any statement along the lines of Alte rnative C would likely 
lead to an appreciation of the dollar.

LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared four scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to the policy a lternatives A, B, B ′, and C.1  Alternatives A, B, and B ′ include 
new asset purchase programs and extend the period over which the Committee anticipates 
maintaining an exceptionally low funds rate  to June 2015, while Alternative C continues 
the MEP through year-end with no additional pu rchase program and has the federal funds 
rate lift off from its lower bound in August 2014.  Projections under each scenario are 
based on assumptions about the trajectory of various components of the balance sheet.  
Details of these assumptions, as well as pr ojections for each major component of the 
balance sheet, can be found in Explanatory Note D.  
 
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to end the MEP at the end of Se ptember and begin a flow-based purchase 
program that ultimately expands the SOMA por tfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities 
by $1 trillion.2  This scenario is roughly consis tent with the open-ended purchase 
                                                 
1 A balance sheet projection for Alternative B ′′ will be provided under separate cover. 
2 This scenario is nearly identical to the $1 trillion LSAP scenario pr esented in FOMC memo 
"Options for an Additional LSAP Program" by Board and FRBNY staff.  The scenario is also similar to the 
example presented in the memo to the FOMC "Flow- Based Balance-Sheet Policies: Communication Issues

program detailed in the Alternative B statement if purchases last, and are expected to last, 
for a little more than a year.  The progra m is assumed to include purchases of $600 
billion of Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and purchases of 
$400 billion of agency MBS at a pace of about $30 billion per month.  Purchases are 
completed in October 2013.  The Committee reinstitutes its polic y of reinvesting 
principal payments from Treasury securitie s at auction and co ntinues reinvesting 
principal payments from agency MBS and ag ency debt securities into agency MBS.  
Overall, under this scenario, SOMA securities holdings in crease to about $3.6 trillion by 
the end of 2014. 
In this scenario, consistent with the stat ement language that the federal funds rate 
is expected to be at exceptionally low levels  “at least through mid-2015,” we assume that 
the first increase in the target fe deral funds rate is in June 2015.3  The date of liftoff is a 
key determinant of the trajectory of the balance sheet.  In December 2014, six months 
before the first increase in the target federa l funds rate, all reinvestment is assumed to 
cease, and the balance sheet begins to cont ract.  In December 2015, six months after the 
initial increase in th e target federal funds rate, the Co mmittee begins to sell its holdings 
of agency securities at a pace that reduces the amount of thes e securities in the portfolio 
to zero in five years, that is, by November 2020.4, 5  Through these redemptions and sales, 
the size of the portfolio is normalized by April 2019.6, 7  The balance sheet then begins to 
                                                                                                                                                 
and Macroeconomic Effects" by La forte, et al. in which the flow -based program has a 7.8 percent 
unemployment stopping rule. 
3 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is six months later than that assumed in the balance 
sheet projections from the July Tealbook Book B, and is ten months later than the current staff forecast in 
Tealbook Book A.   
4 Consistent with the exit principles the Committee announced in the minutes of the June 2011 
FOMC meeting, we assume the Committee directs the Desk to sell only agency securities during the exit period in order to promote a timely return to an all-Treasury SOMA portfolio.  In Alternative B, MBS are 
sold over a five-year period, and the size of the portfolio normalizes thr ee years and five months after sales 
begin—somewhat longer than the timeframe anticipated  in the exit strategy principles.  However, as 
discussed in the FOMC memo "The effect of an additio nal $1 trillion LSAP on the exit strategy" by staff of 
the Board and FRBNY, sales over 3½ years would result in the portfolio being normalized in three years, 
within the timeframe anticipated in the exit principles. 
5 Under Reserve Bank accounting, losses and gains on securities held by the SOMA portfolio are 
only realized when securities are sold.  In Alterna tive B, in 2018, realized losses from MBS sales and 
interest expense are projected to be almost as large as earnings.  Cons iderable uncertainty surrounds these 
projections, however, and under plausible assumpti ons, losses could exceed earnings; in that case, 
remittances to the Treasury would cease, and a deferred asset would be booked. 
6 The tools to drain reserve balances (reverse re purchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of 
Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse

expand, with increases in SOMA holdings es sentially matching the growth of Federal 
Reserve Bank capital and currency in circulati on.  Total assets reach a size of $2 trillion 
by the end of 2020.    
In the scenario for Alternative B ′, the Committee is assumed to continue the MEP 
and to begin purchasing agency MBS at a rate  of $30 billion per month in October.  We 
further assume that after the MEP reach es its conclusion, the Committee continues 
purchases of Treasury securities at $45 bill ion per month and agency MBS at $30 billion 
per month through July 2013.  Overall, this scenario includes purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities of $450 billion and purch ases of agency MBS of $300 billion between 
October 2012 and mid-2013.  The Committee continues reinvesting principal payments 
from agency MBS and agency debt securities in to agency MBS.  In this scenario, total 
assets peak at $3.5 trillion in July 2013.  In December 2014, six months prior to the 
assumed first increase in the federal funds ra te in June 2015, all rei nvestment is assumed 
to cease and the balance sheet begins to cont ract.  Six months af ter the liftoff of the 
federal funds rate, sales of ag ency securities begin and continue for five years.  The size 
of the portfolio is norm alized by February 2019. 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to end the MEP and 
begin a $1.25 trillion LSAP program in Octobe r.  Under the program, the Desk purchases 
$750 billion of Treasury securi ties at a pace of about $45 billion per month and $500 
billion of agency MBS at a pace of a bout $30 billion per month.  Purchases are 
completed by the end of February 2014.  The Committee reinstitutes its policy of reinvesting principal payments from Treas ury securities at au ction and continues 
reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency 
MBS.  In this scenario, total assets peak  at $4.2 trillion in Apr il 2014.  In December 2014, 
six months prior to the assumed first increas e in the federal funds rate in June 2015, all 
reinvestment is assumed to cease and the balance sheet begins to contract.  Six months 
after the lift off of the federal funds rate, sales of agency secu rities begin and continue for 
five years.  The additional pur chases of securities in this scenario substantially boost the 
volume of reserve balances.  As a result, as interest rates rise, the interest expense on 
                                                                                                                                                 
repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the 
balance sheet. 
7 The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on 
the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be necessary to conduct monetary policy; currently, we 
assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billi on.  A higher demand for reserve balances would, all 
else equal, lead to an earlier norma lization of the size of the balance sheet.

reserve balances is likewise boosted.  This expe nse, combined with the realized losses on 
sales of agency MBS, imply that the Fede ral Reserve has an operating loss and, as a 
result, a deferred asset is recorded on the balance sheet in 2018, 2019, and 2020.  The 
size of the portfolio is normalized by July 2019. 
For the scenario that corresponds to Alte rnative C, the Committee is assumed to 
complete the current MEP in December 2012.  In this scenario, the federal funds rate is 
assumed to lift off in August 2014, ten mont hs earlier than in  Alternative B.  
Corresponding to this earlier incr ease in the federal funds rate , reinvestment of principal 
from maturing or prepaying securities ends in  February 2014, and the portfolio begins to 
contract.  Sales of agency secu rities commence in February 2 015 and last for five years.  
Total assets in this scenario peak at $2.9 trillion, and the size of the balance sheet is 
normalized in March 2018, more than a y ear earlier than under Alternative B. 
Across scenarios, the volume of reserve balances is directly related to the 
assumed purchase programs.  U nder Alternative A, reserve ba lances peak at about $2.8 
trillion, while under Alternatives B and B ′, reserve balances peak  at $2.5 and $2.2 trillion, 
respectively.  Under Alternative C, reserve bala nces do not rise from their current level of 
roughly $1.6 trillion.   
In the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives B, B ′, and A, the monetary base 
increases from 2012 to 2013, due to the purchase programs.  Once exit begins, the 
monetary base shrinks thr ough the second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting a decline 
in reserve balances as securities are redeemed  or sold.  Starting in the third quarter of 
2019, after reserve balances are assumed to ha ve stabilized at $25 billion, the monetary 
base begins to expand again, in line with the growth of Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation.  Under Alternative C, the mone tary base is roughly flat from 2012 to 2013, 
rising only with the assumed increase in curr ency, and then contracts until the size of the 
portfolio is normalized.

  DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY FORECASTS  
Domestic nonfinancial sector  debt is projected to expa nd at an annual rate of 4½ 
percent over the second half of  this year, driven by a significant expansion in federal 
government debt and a modest rise in private nonfinancial debt.  For the remainder of the 
forecast period, domestic nonfinancial debt growth  is expected to slow to about 4 percent, 
on average, as federal debt rises less rapidl y and private debt acceler ates only gradually.  
Nonfinancial business debt is forecast to increase at a modest pace over the projection 
period, reflecting favorable fina ncing conditions and an increas e in capital expenditures.  
The level of home mortgage debt is projected to bottom out this year and edge up only a 
little in the next two years, as financing conditions are expected to remain tight, demand 
for owner-occupied housing is expected to stay  weak, and house prices are forecasted to 
increase only slowly.  Meanwhile, consumer credit is projected to expand throughout the 
forecast period, accelerating from a pace of about  5 percent over the second half of this 
year to about 7½ percent in 2014, driven by a gradual easing of credit conditions as well 
as modestly rising demand for student loan s and for loans to finance purchases of 
consumer durables. 
Commercial bank credit is expected to in crease moderately over the forecast 
period.  Core loans—the sum of commercial  and industrial (C&I), real estate, and 
consumer loans—are projected to increase modestly for the remainder of 2012 and to 
pick up somewhat in 2013 and 2014.  C&I loans have increased robustly so far this year, 
and are projected to continue to expand rapidly in the near term before slowing to a pace 
closer to that of nominal GDP by the e nd of the forecast period.  Growth in both 
residential real estate and consumer loans is  anticipated to pick up throughout the forecast 
period, reflecting improvements in borrowers’ credit quality and furt her gradual easing of 
standards and terms on such loans.  In contrast , commercial real estate loans are projected 
to contract through mid-2013, and only edge up thereafter, as high vacancy rates, 
depressed prices for commercial properties, and the poor credit quality of existing loans 
are likely to suppress activity in this sector for some time.  Banks’ securities holdings are 
projected to rise at a moderate pace, with growth in this category slowing, on balance, 
over 2013 and 2014, as deposit growth ebbs and loan demand strengthens. 
Staff anticipates that M2 will continue to grow faster than nominal income 
through the remainder of 2012 but will expand more slowly than nominal income, on

  balance, in 2013 and 2014.  Ongoing concerns ab out the European situation and the U.S. 
growth outlook will likely encourage investors to  add to their already elevated allocations 
of M2 assets in 2012.  Staff expects that in early 2013, M2 growth will be dampened 
somewhat due to the expiration of the un limited FDIC insurance on noninterest-bearing 
transaction deposits.1  M2 growth is forecast to slow further in 2014 as investors 
reallocate their portfolios toward riskier as sets in line with the projected firming in 
economic growth and monetary policy.   
Turning to the components of M2, liquid de posits are expected to grow at a brisk 
pace for the remainder of 2012 and to slow significantly in 2013 and the beginning of 
2014 before contracting in the second half of  2014 in response to the projected increase 
in yields on alternative assets .  Continuing a trend seen in recent years, retail money 
market funds and small time deposits are projected to shrink further through mid-2014 
and then increase slowly as th e rates paid on these products adjust upward in response to 
tighter monetary policy.  Currency growth is anticipated to gradually decline to a pace 
consistent with its long-term average of 6 percent by mid-2013 and to continue at that 
pace over the rest of the projection period. 
  
                                                 
1 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 provides unlimited 
deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts in excess of $250,000 from 
December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012.  Deposits in these types of accounts are estimated to have 
grown nearly 56 percent from December 31, 2010, and cu rrently make up about 16 percent of M2 or about 
$1.6 trillion.  (See the box “Bank Funding Consultations” in the Financial Developments section of this Tealbook, Part A.)

DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was is sued in August appears on the next page, followed by 
drafts for a September directive that corre spond to each of the po licy alternatives.   
The directives for Alternatives A, B, and B ′ direct the Desk to expand the SOMA 
portfolio.  The directives for Alternatives A and B would instruct the Desk to begin new 
asset purchase programs.  U nder Alternative A, the Committ ee would direct the Desk to 
execute purchases of $750 billi on of longer-term Treasury securities and $500 billion of 
agency MBS by early 2014, at a combined pace of $75 billion per month.  Under 
Alternative B, the Desk would be instructed  to begin purchasing longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and agency MBS at a pace of about 
$30 billion per month.  Alternative B ′ directs the desk to begin purchasing agency MBS 
at a pace of about $30 billion per month and to  take appropriate steps to complete by the 
end of December 2012 the MEP of $267 billion that was announced in June.  The 
directives for Alternatives B ′′ and C leave the total face valu e of domestic securities in 
the SOMA about unchanged and instruct the De sk to take appropriate steps to complete 
by the end of December 2012 the MEP of $267 b illion that was announced in June.  Each 
of the draft directives would al so instruct the Desk to cont inue the current practice of 
reinvesting principal payments  on all agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  
Alternatives A and B would reinstitute the pol icy of rolling over maturing Treasuries at 
auction, while Alternatives B ′, B′′, and C would continue th e practice of redeeming 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.

A. Policy Rules Used in “M onetary Policy Strategies” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
, while the t  denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter ௧	ܴ In the table, Policy Strategies.”  
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( gap t and gap t+1|t), and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective, denoted π*, is 2 percent.  The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
 (100 times the log of ∗
௧݊ݕ(  100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ௧݊ݕ 
potential nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to potential real GDP in 
that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in th at quarter; subsequently, target nominal GDP 
grows 2 percentage points per year faster than potential GDP. 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured promin ently in recent analysis by Board staff.1  The outcome-
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q12006:Q4.  The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run, quarterly real interest rate of 2¼ 
percent, a value used in the FRB/US model.  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, and 
the long-run intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set at 2¼ percent—instead of Taylor’s 
original value of 2 percent—for the same reason.  The 2¼ percent real rate estimate also enters 
the long-run intercept of the nominal income ta rgeting rule.  The prescriptions of the first

Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the

outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far this quarter.

 B. Estimates of the Equilib rium and Actual Real Rates 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using the projection for the economy of 
FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends 
on a very broad array of economic factors, some of  which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  The estimate reported is the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, 
which is generated after the path s of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so 
that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date.

 C. FRB/US Model Simulations 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

 D. Long-Run Projections of the Ba lance Sheet and Monetary Base 
This explanatory note presents the assumptions  underlying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Long-Run Projections of the Bala nce Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as 
projections for each major component of the balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from August 2012 
to December 2020.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level ob served on July 31, 2012.  The projections for all 
major asset and liability categories under each scen ario are summarized in the tables that follow 
the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives B, B ′ and A 
assume that the target federal funds rate begins  to increase in June 2015, consistent with the 
forward guidance in the FOMC’s statement that the ta rget federal funds rate is expected to be at 
exceptionally low levels “at least through mid-2015.”2  This date of liftoff is six months later than 
that assumed in the balance sheet projections from the July Tealbook Book B for Alternative B 
and is ten months later than the current staff fo recast in Tealbook Book A.  The projection for the 
scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts off in August 
2014, consistent with the draft statement langua ge “at least through late [ 2013 | 2014 ]” and ten 
months earlier than in Alternative B.  The bala nce sheet projections assume that no use of short-
term draining tools is necessary to achieve the projected path for the target federal funds rate.3 
  
                                                 
2 The federal funds rate paths in Alternatives B, B′ , and A are adjusted to reflect their assumed 
liftoff dates, which are different from the staff forecast.  By the end of the forecast horizon, all federal 
funds rate paths converge to the proj ection assumed in the July Tealbook staff forecast.  The projected path 
of the 10-year Treasury yields in Alternatives B, B ′, and A are the yields assumed in the September 
Tealbook staff forecast adjusted for the expectations effect of a later target  federal funds rate liftoff (see the 
box on “Forward Rate Guidance and Policy Expectations” from the January 2012 Tealbook Book B) and for the term premium effect associat ed with the LSAP program as well as the later liftoff date for the 
federal funds rate which triggers a later start to asset redemptions and sales. 
3 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreements were used to drain reserves prior to raising the 
federal funds rate, the composition of liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse 
repurchase agreements would be matched by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, 
these draining tools would be wound down as the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so 
that the projected paths for Treasury securities presented in the Tealbook remain valid.

 ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B  are: 
o The Committee is assumed to halt the MEP at the end of September and begin a $1 
trillion purchase program in October 2012 under which it purchases $600 billion in Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and $400 billion in current coupon agency MBS at a pace of about $30 billion per month into the fourth quarter of 2013.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average 
duration of about nine years, roughly the net duration of purchases and sales under the MEP.   
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS and reinstitutes its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.   
o Starting in December 2014—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target 
federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature 
or prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agen cy MBS and agency debt securities in 
December 2015, roughly six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by November 2020. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the program’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections from the Tealbook.
4  
The projected rate of prepayment is  sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative B ′, the Committee is assumed to continue the 
MEP program and begin a $750 billion purchase program in October 2012 under which it purchases $450 billion in Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and $300 billion in current coupon agency MBS at a pace of about $30 billion per month into the third quarter of 2013.  The Treasury secu rity purchases are assumed to include the 
remaining MEP purchases through December 2012 plus an additional $45 billion per month from January 2013 to July 2013.  The Treasury purchase distribution through December 2012 will remain consistent with  previous MEP purchases.  Beginning in 
January 2013, purchases are assumed to have an average duration of 9 years.  After the completion of the MEP at the end of the year, the Committee is assumed to end its sales of shorter-term Treasury securities and rein stitute its policy of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee is also assumed to maintain its existing 
policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency 
MBS in agency MBS.  In December 2014, six months prior to the assumed increase in

 the federal funds rate in June  2015, principal payments from all securities are allowed to 
roll off the portfolio.  Sales of agency secur ities begin in December 2015 and continue for 
five years. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to end the 
MEP at the end of this month and begin a $1.25 trillion LSAP program in October 2012 
under which it purchases $750 billion in Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month and $500 billion in current coupon agency MBS at a pace of about $30 billion 
per month into the first quarter of 2014.  The Treasury security purchase distribution is 
assumed to have an average duration of nine years.  In addition, the Committee is assumed to reinstitute its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and maintain its existing policy of reinvesti ng principal payments from its holdings of 
agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  In December 2014, six months prior to the assumed increase in the federal funds rate in June 2015, principal payments from all 
securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  Sales of agency securities begin in December 2015 and continue for five years. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is expected to continue the 
MEP at its current pace through the end of 201 2.  The FOMC continues to reinvest the 
proceeds from principal payments on its agen cy securities holdings in agency MBS until 
February 2014—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate.  
Starting in February 2014, all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The Federal Reserve be gins to sell agency MBS and agency debt 
securities in February 2015.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years 
and reach zero by January 2020.    
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which these securities are 
purchased will generally exceed their face va lue, with a larger premium for longer-
maturity securities.  As a resu lt, each alternative will add premiums to the balance sheet.  
In Alternative C, where the MEP is assumed to  continue to year end, premiums net of 
amortization will increase an additional $25 billion.  In Alternatives B ′, B and A, where 
an additional $450 billion, $600 billion, and $750 billion in Treasury securities are purchased, respectively, premiums are boosted by roughly an additi onal $65 billion, $75 
billion, and $85 billion, resp ectively, at the end of each program.  The increase in 
premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.   
 The asset purchase programs in Alternatives B, B ′, and A would put downward pressure 
on market interest rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.   
 The current and near-term market value of agency MBS is assumed to be four percent 
above its face value.  As a result, for Alternatives B ′, B, and A, the $300 billion, $400 
billion and $500 billion of agency MBS purch ases, respectively, wi ll cause unamortized 
premiums on the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet to rise by roughly $12 billion, $16 
billion, and $20 billion, respectively, relativ e to a scenario without these MBS purchases.

 The increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve 
balances. 
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is  assumed to decline gradually, as the recent 
foreign central bank swap auctions mature, a nd then return to zero in December 2013.  
 In all scenarios, a minimum level of $25 billion is set for reserve balances.  Once reserve 
balances drop to this level, the Desk first purchases Treasury bills to maintain this level 
of reserve balances going forward.  Purchases of bills continue until such securities comprise one-third of the Federal Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reserve buys coupon securities in addition to bills to main tain an approximate composition of the 
portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 
 The assets held by TALF LLC remain at about  $1 billion through 2014  before declining 
to zero the following year.  Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of 
commitment fees collected by the LLC and the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  In this projection, the LLC does not purchase any asset-backed securities received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connec tion with a decision of a borrower not to 
repay a TALF loan. 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane III LLC reach zero around the end of 2012 and the assets 
held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero by the end of 2015.   
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 
currency through the last quarter of 2014.   Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP, as in the extended Tealbook 
projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) is assumed to remain around $70 
billion, about the average level of RRPs associat ed with foreign official and international 
accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the 
TGA slowly drops back to its historical targ et level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the 
Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion. The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 We maintain the Supplementary Financing Acc ount (SFA) balance at its current level of 
zero throughout the forecast.

  Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.5 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of 
Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset is recorded in lieu of reducing the Reserve 
Bank’s capital and is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as “Interest on 
Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”   This liability takes on a positive value 
when weekly cumulative earnings have not yet been distributed to the Treasury and takes 
on a negative value when earnings fall short of the expenses listed above.  In Alternative A, a small deferred asset is recorded at year-end in 2018, 2019, and 2020. 
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS6 
 Under Alternative B, the current staff estimates of the contemporaneous term premium 
effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note is negative 102 basis points.  Based on 
the projection for the balance sheet, that term premium effect converges slowly toward zero over the forecast period as the portfolio normalizes.  The term premium is more 
negative than it was in July Alternative B because of the $1 trillion purchase program and 
a later liftoff date, which imply securities remain  out of the hands of the public for longer 
than in the last Tealbook.  
 Under Alternative B′ , the term premium effect is negative 93 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because of the smaller assumed purchase program. 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect is negative 111 basis points.  The effect is 
more negative than in Alternative B because of the larger assumed purchase program. 
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 64 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because there is no purchase program and the liftoff 
date is earlier. 
                                                 
5 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date  of normalization of the size of the balance sheet 
and the size of the SO MA portfolio.  Growth in Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two 
years; however, even if Federal Reserve capital were assumed to be constant, normalization only would be 
pushed later by about a quarter. 
6 Staff estimates use the model outlined in the appendix of the January 18, 2012, memo “Possible 
MBS Large-Scale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors.  More details of the model can be found in “Term Structure Modeling with Supply 
Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs” by Li and Wei, FEDS working 
paper #37, 2012.
