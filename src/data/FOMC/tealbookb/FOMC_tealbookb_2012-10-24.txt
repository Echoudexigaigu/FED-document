Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the fede ral funds rate from six policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, a nd the nominal income targeting rule.1  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2012 and 2013.  Medium-term prescriptions deri ved from dynamic simulations of each 
rule are discussed below.  As shown in the le ft-hand columns, all bu t one of the near-term 
prescriptions keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound through the first 
quarter of 2013.  Only the Taylor (1993) ru le, which puts relatively less weight on the 
output gap, prescribes an increa se in the target federal funds rate, to 165 basis points for 
the fourth quarter of 2012 and 140 basis points for the first quarter of 2013.   
The right-hand columns display the rule pres criptions that arise in the absence of 
the lower-bound constraint.  The outcome-based  rule, the first-difference rule, and the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescr ibe federal funds rates that are near zero for the next two 
quarters, while the Taylor ( 1999) rule and the nominal inco me targeting ru le prescribe 
rates further below zero.  The more-accomm odative prescriptions under the latter two 
rules reflect their str onger immediate response of the rules to the staff’s estimate of the 
output gap, which remains appreciably negative.2 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key Elements of the Staff Projection.”  Over the 
near term, the outlook for inflation is essent ially unchanged from the previous Tealbook.  
From 2017 through 2019, the staff has revised up its forecast of core inflation from just under 2 percent to just over 2 percent, consis tent with the change in the staff outlook for 
the output gap, which is narrower over the me dium term than in September and turns 
slightly positive in the third quarter of 2016.  As desc ribed in Book A of the Tealbook, 
the projected path of the output gap is narrower than in the September projection 
primarily for two reasons.  First, the staff has revised down its estimate of the level of 
potential GDP at the end of 2012 (but not it s growth rate going forward) by nearly 
                                                 
1 Details for each rule appear in Explanatory Note A.   
2 Although the rule prescriptions are not constrained to be at or above the lower bound, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule all include and place 
material weight on the lagged federal funds rate , which was subject to the lower-bound constraint.

  ½ percent, thus narrowing the output gap.  Second, over the medium term, economic 
activity is now projected to increase at a some what faster pace than was the case in the 
September projection, reflecting the policy accommodation provided by the Committee at 
the September meeting.  Because of the narrowing in the output gap, the near-term 
prescriptions from the unconstrained rules have  risen a bit compared with those in the 
September Tealbook. 
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US model when conditioned on the staff’s 
outlook for the economy.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained, would return output to potential in twelve quarters.  Reflecting 
the staff’s revision to the output gap, the r* estimate is 20 basis points higher than in the 
September Tealbook.  However, at 1.9 percent, it remains below the estimated actual 
real federal funds rate of about 1½ percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations using 
the FRB/US model that incorporate the endogenous responses of inflation and the output gap to the different paths of the federal funds  rate prescribed by th e constrained versions 
of the six policy rules described above.  The model is adjusted to match the staff’s 
baseline outlook for the economy and then simula ted using each of the policy rules.  Each 
rule is implemented from the fourth qua rter of 2012 onward, under the assumption that 
private agents fully understand a nd anticipate the implications of  the rule for future real 
activity, inflation, and interest rates.
3  For comparison, the exhibit also displays the 
Tealbook baseline paths, which are conditioned on the prescriptions of the outcome-
based rule, adjusted to be consistent  with the Committee’s September 2012 policy 
guidance.4 
                                                 
3 The staff’s baseline forecast incorporates the effects of the asset pu rchase programs that the FOMC 
has undertaken in recent years, as well as the eff ects of the new flow-based asset purchases that the 
Committee began in September, the ongoing maturity extension program, and the modifications to the 
Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policies that were anno unced in September 2011.  Via this procedure, the 
policy rule simulations incorporate the effects of thes e balance sheet policies; the rules themselves are not 
directly adjusted for the effect s of balance sheet policies.   
4 As discussed in Book A of the Tealbook, the staff projection for the federal funds rate follows the 
estimated outcome-based rule, augmented with an intercept adjustment that reflects the Committee’s 
forward guidance announcement at the end of its September meeting.  The adjustment is calibrated to delay the first increase in the federal funds rate until the third quarter of 2015 under the economic outlook in the 
September Tealbook.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, this intercept adjustment is steadily reduced 
and is zero beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.

  In the Tealbook baseline, th e federal funds rate depart s from the effective lower 
bound in the third quarter of 2015, one year later than in the September Tealbook.  
Reflecting the forward guidance in the Septem ber statement, the Tealbook baseline keeps 
the interest rate at its effective lower bound longer than what would otherwise be 
prescribed.5  The federal funds rate increases to 4¼ percent by the second quarter of 
2018, and hovers around that level through the end of the forecast period.  The 
unemployment rate drops below 7 percent in 2015 and is exp ected to reach the staff’s 
long-term estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment by mid-2017.6  Headline inflation 
is projected to average about  1.4 percent until the end of 2014, then rise slowly toward 
2 percent. 
The Taylor (1993) rule initially prescribes a tighter path for the federal funds rate 
than the other rules.  As noted above, becau se the Taylor (1993) rule does not respond 
very strongly to the level of the output gap, it calls for an immediate increase in the 
federal funds rate to 160 basis points.  The higher federal funds rate  makes real activity 
and inflation weaker than in the baseline, prom pting a partial reversal of the initial rate 
increase.  Reflecting the early tightening, however, th e rule implies a higher 
unemployment rate initially as well as lower levels of inflation over the whole projection 
period. 
While the first-difference rule does not call for an increase in the federal funds 
rate until the first quarter of 2014, it implies policy rates from the fourth quarter of 2015 
until the third quarter of 2017 that are higher than  under all of the other rules.  Because of 
the more-elevated average federal funds rate , the unemployment rate is higher and 
inflation lower in the near term. 
Compared with the Taylor (1993) rule, th e Taylor (1999) rule leads to a later 
tightening of policy and produces generall y lower unemployment rates and slightly 
higher inflation rates over the projection period.  However, because the policy rate is 
higher under the Taylor (1999) rule than in the baseline, the rule produces worse outcomes.  The unemployment rate slowly converges to the staff’s estimate of the 
                                                 
5 Because of this adjustment, the baseline path for the federal funds rate includes a more rapid increase 
in the funds rate after liftoff than in past Tealbooks.  The extent of the policy tightening implied by the rule 
between the third quarter of 2015 and the second qu arter of 2018 is roughly comparable to the actual 
tightening observed between the second quarter of 2004 and the third quarter of 2006, when the overall 
increase in the federal funds rate was 425 basis points. 
6 The staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment declines from about 6¼ percent in 
the fourth quarter of 2012 to 5¼ percent by the end of 2017.

  effective natural rate of unemployment while  inflation, after dec lining to 1 percent, 
gradually increases to  the 2 percent goal. 
Under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first increase of the federal funds rate 
takes place in the second quarter of 2014, one  quarter before the Taylor (1999) rule 
would initiate tightening.  This earlier firmi ng of policy reflects the fact that the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule subsequently prescribes a slower pace of policy tightening with higher 
future inflation, thereby generating a lower average path for the real federal funds rate 
through the rest of the decade, and so fueling a more rapid pickup in real activity and a 
lower path for the unemployment rate.  The unemployment gap closes by mid-2017, 
when inflation is about 2 percent. 
Under the nominal income targeting rule, th e initial increase in the federal funds 
rate occurs in the fourth quarter of 2014, and for several years thereafter policy is 
generally more accommodative than under the ot her rules.  In particular, the average 
level of the real federal funds rate through the rest of the d ecade is markedly lower than 
in the baseline.  This more-accommodative po licy is reflected in a more-rapid decline of 
the unemployment rate, culminating in a peri od in which it is below the natural rate, 
while inflation is uniformly higher than in  the Tealbook baseline and modestly exceeds 
its 2 percent longer-run objective for a few years. 
 The next exhibit, “Constrained vs. Un constrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares optimal control simulations derive d for this Tealbook with those shown in 
September.7  In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on 
keeping headline PCE inflation close to th e Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  The simulations indicate that, with the federal funds rate constrained to remain positive, the optimal 
control path for the federal funds rate doe s not rise above the effective lower bound until 
the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as repor ted in the September Tealbook; the optimal 
path is also little revised beyond 2015.

used in the staff’s baseline forecast, including the assumptions about balance sheet policy described above.

funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute

  The stability of the optimal policy path across the September and October 
Tealbooks may seem surprising in light of the staff’s substantial downward revision in its 
projection for the unemployment rate in response to favorable incoming data, the 
Committee’s decision to conti nue expanding its securities hol dings until the outlook for 
the labor market improves substantially, and a lower path for the federal funds rate.  The 
first two of these factors have  caused the FRB/US estimate of r*  to rise since the 
September Tealbook, and by themselves they would have led to tighter optimal policy as 
well.  In contrast to r*, however, optimal policy also de pends on the outlook for inflation.  
As shown in the bottom panel of the first exhi bit, the staff has not appreciably changed its 
forecast for inflation.  From the FRB/US model’s perspective, this stability is surprising:  
Given the staff’s projection for stronger real  activity, the model would have predicted 
noticeably higher inflation in both th e near term and the longer run.9  For this reason, it is 
necessary to shift down the intercepts of th e model’s wage and price equations to match 
the staff forecast prior to running the optimal control exerci se.  These adjustments lower 
the underlying outlook for inflation in the matc hed baseline, which essentially offsets the 
upward revision to the underlyi ng outlook for real activity in  the baseline, leaving the 
optimal path for the federal funds rate little changed, on net.     
The constrained optimal control policy would promote a faster pace of economic 
recovery than in the staff’s baseline outlook by raising rates more slowly than under any 
of the simple rules, while still keeping inflation close to the Committee’s goal of 
2 percent over the medium term.  In this  set of simulations, the gap between the 
unemployment rate and the sta ff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment 
is closed by the fourth quarter of 2015, and the unemployment rate subsequently runs 
below the natural rate for a few years.  Inflati on initially exhibits a smaller decline than in 
the Tealbook baseline, after which it increa ses to the 2 percent objective by the third 
quarter of 2016 and then overshoots slightl y, peaking at about 2¼ percent in 2018 and 
gradually returning to the 2 percent objectiv e thereafter.  The more-rapid convergence to 
the Committee’s assumed objectives than in the Tealbook baseline, and the subsequent temporary overshooting, occur because policymakers respond to the lower bound 
                                                                                                                                                 
the real rate for this illustrative purpose because it pr ovides a less volatile measure of inflation expectations 
than does a four-quarter moving  average of headline inflation. 
9 In many respects, the staff’s view of inflation dynamics is similar to that generated by the model’s 
New Keynesian Phillips curve.  However, the staff gene rally views inflation as being much less sensitive to 
expected future economic conditions than is the case in the FRB/US model when run under rational 
expectations (as is the case in the optimal control exercise).  In general, future economic conditions 
influence the staff inflation forecast only to the extent that they affect the survey measures of expected 
long-run inflation that unde rpin the staff’s forecast.

  constraint by promising to keep interest rates low for an extended period of time.  As this 
policy is assumed to be completely credible, it boosts inflation expectations and reduces 
real interest rates during the initial years of the simulation. 
If the nominal federal funds rate could fall below zero, the funds rate, under the 
optimal unconstrained policy, would decrease to 2.4 percent in the third quarter of 2013 
and return to positive territory by the second quarter of 2015.  Under these conditions, the 
unemployment rate would decline more ra pidly than under the optimal constrained 
policy.  Inflation would return to 2 percent by the second quarter of 2016, a pattern much 
like that in the constrained simulation.  In subsequent years, inflation would slightly 
exceed the 2 percent objective—but less persis tently than in the constrained case. 
The fourth exhibit, “Outcomes under Alternative Policies,” tabulates the 
simulation results for key variables under the selected policy rules described above.

The draft statement for Alternative B is  largely unchanged from the September 
statement.  In particular, it begins by obser ving that economic activ ity has continued to 
expand at a moderate pace in recent months, that growth in  employment has been slow, 
and that the unemployment rate remains elevat ed—all as in the September statement.  It 
then notes that household spending “has adva nced a bit more quickly, but growth in 
business fixed investment has slowed.”  Alte rnative A contains much the same language 
except that it describes consumer spending with the words of the September statement:  
“household spending has continued to advance. ”  Alternative C offe rs a somewhat more 
positive characterization of the data by no ting that economic activity has expanded 
moderately “despite the adverse effects of  the drought on agricult ural production” and 
that “private domestic demand has continued to advance.”  Moreover, Alternative C says 
that “employment has increased further” a nd that “the unemployment rate, though still 
elevated, has declined.”  Alternatives A and B again note “some further signs of 
improvement” in the housing sector, “albeit from  a depressed level,” while Alternative C 
notes the improvement but not th e depressed level.  With resp ect to inflation, Alternatives 
A and B say that it “recently picked up some what, reflecting higher energy prices.”  
Alternative C suggests greater concern by st ating that inflation “recently picked up, 
mainly reflecting higher energy prices.”  E ach alternative indicates that longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable. 
Alternatives A and B also differ from A lternative C in how they communicate the 
outlook for real activity and employment.  Th e language in Alternatives A and B is 
essentially the same as in the September statement, reiterating the Committee’s concern 
that economic growth might not, on its ow n, be strong enough to generate sustained 
improvement in labor market conditions.  A lternative B says that growth might not be 
strong enough unless there is “sufficient”  policy accommodation, while the September 
statement said “further” polic y accommodation.  Alternative A retains “further,” which 
some market participants might read as a si gnal that the Committee sees a need for more 
stimulus than will be provided by the flow-based asset purchases that it announced in

September.  Alternative C indicates that th e Committee expects economic growth to pick 
up gradually and consequently anticipates th at the unemployment rate will continue to 
decline; this observation sets  the stage for ending asset pu rchases upon completion of the 
maturity extension program (MEP) and for m oving closer the projec ted start of policy 
normalization.  All of the draft statements co ntinue to highlight the significant downside 
risks to the outlook from strain s in global financial markets.  With respect to inflation, 
Alternatives A and B say, as in the Septembe r statement, that the Committee anticipates 
that inflation over the medium term “lik ely would run at or below its 2 percent 
objective.”  Alternative C says  the Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium 
term “will run near its 2 percent objective.” 
The alternatives also offer different approaches to balance sheet policy.  
Alternative B maintains both the asset purchases and the language the Committee 
adopted in September:  Purchases of agency  MBS would continue at a pace of $40 billion 
per month and the MEP would run through year -end; the statement would again indicate 
that the Committee “will conti nue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, 
undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate” if 
it does not observe substantial improvement in  the outlook for labor market conditions in 
coming months.  Alternative A would state exp licitly that purchases of agency MBS will 
continue at a pace of $40 billion per month beyond the turn of the year and that the Committee will buy longer-term Treasury secur ities at a pace of $45 billion per month 
after completing the MEP.  Alternative A also  offers new language that is intended to 
give the public additional information about the factors the Committee will consider in 
deciding how long to continue asset purchases.  In contrast , Alternative C implies that 
purchases of both MBS and Treasury securi ties will stop at y ear-end.  All three 
alternatives envision that the Committee will continue to reinvest principal payments on 
its holdings of agency MBS and agency debt into MBS. 
Under each alternative, the Committee woul d maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target 
range for the federal funds rate.  Altern atives A and B indicate that the Committee 
anticipates maintaining exceptionally low leve ls of the funds rate  “at least through mid-
2015,” as in the September statement.  Both alte rnatives also retain th e language that says 
“the Committee expects that a highly acco mmodative stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.”  
Alternative C offers the choice of retaini ng the words “for a considerable time” or 
replacing them with “for some time”; it also  offers a choice between specifying an earlier

SEPTEMBER FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests 
that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.  
Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  
Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed.  The housing sector has shown some further signs of 
improvement, albeit from a depressed level.  Inflation has been subdued, although the 
prices of some key commodities have in creased recently.  Longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee is concerned that, without further policy 
accommodation, economic growth might not be  strong enough to generate sustained 
improvement in labor market conditions.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee 
also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.  
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at 
the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase 
policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a 
pace of $40 billion per month.  The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturi ty of its holdings of securities as announced 
in June, and it is maintaining its existing po licy of reinvesting principal payments from its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-
backed securities.  These actions, which t ogether will increase the Committee’s holdings 
of longer-term securities by about $85 billi on each month through the end of the year, 
should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  
4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve 
substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed 
securities, undertake additional asset purcha ses, and employ its other policy tools as 
appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as 
always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.  
5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  In 
particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds 
rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the 
federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee, like the staff, might  judge that the near-term outlook for 
economic activity now appears only modestly better than it did in mid-September and 
that the medium-term outlook, wh ile a little stronger, has im proved primarily because the 
policy steps the Committee took at its last  meeting have made broader financial 
conditions more accommodative.  Participants  might think that the outsized gain in 
household employment reported for September, and the acco mpanying sharp drop in the 
unemployment rate, probably overstate the re cent gains in labor market conditions and 
the improvement in the outlook for the labor market; policymakers may judge that the 
more moderate gain in payrolls is the more  reliable measure.  If so, the Committee may 
remain concerned that economic growth would not be adequate to return the 
unemployment rate to its mandate-consistent le vel over the next several years without an 
exceptionally accommodative monetary policy that includes continued asset purchases.  
Policymakers might also see the inflationary pressure from increases in oil prices as temporary and as likely to abate in the near future.  Moreover, participants might note 
that measures of medium- and longer-run inflation compensation remain within the 
ranges seen during the past two years, that the median of longer-r un expected inflation 
from the Michigan survey has declined in  recent months and is now a bit below its 
average since 2005, and that the mean and median of the primary dealers’ forecasts for 
inflation are essentially un changed from their values ahead of the September FOMC 
meeting.  Accordingly, they might judge th at inflation expectations remain well 
anchored.  For all these reasons, the Committee may consider it appropriate to stay on the 
course it set in September.   
Moreover, policymakers may judge that dow nside risks to the outlook for growth 
in economic activity—particularly from the euro  area crisis and unres olved U.S. fiscal 
policy decisions—remain quite elevated.  Speci fically, they may see non-trivial odds that 
the euro area crisis could deepen and impose a very substantial drag on the U.S. recovery.  
Some policymakers may also see a sizable probability that the Congress and the Administration will be unable to settle contentio us fiscal issues in an orderly and timely 
manner, and that fiscal policy could consequently  tighten sharply at the turn of the year.  
If so, they may judge it appropriate to keep policy unchanged for the time being while 
retaining the option to adjust the pace  and composition of the Committee’s asset 
purchases.

In light of the positive tone of some recent economic indicators and improved 
market sentiment toward Europe, other policymakers may view the economic outlook as 
somewhat brighter and see the risks to th e outlook as having diminished since the 
Committee last met.  Even so, with the unemp loyment rate still we ll above participants’ 
estimates of its longer-run normal level and in flation for items other than energy prices 
subdued, these participants might think it prud ent to postpone a decision about whether to 
continue asset purchases into 2013 until late this year, when they will have additional 
information about the underlying strength of the economic recovery and the outlook for 
fiscal policy.   
Some participants may anticipate that labor market conditions will not improve 
substantially unless asset purchases continue well into ne xt year but may be unsure 
whether MBS purchases alone will be suffi cient or whether purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities will prove necessary as well.  Yet policymakers may also be uncertain 
whether the benefits of an ongoing expansion of the Committee’s se curities holdings will 
outweigh the associated costs and risks.  In  either case, these participants may favor 
making no change to the flow of asset purchases for the time being, because waiting will allow them to learn more about the efficacy and costs of the flow-based program before 
deciding whether to continue it  beyond the turn of the year and, if so, whether to adjust 
its pace and composition.   
With respect to the forward guidanc e for the federal funds rate, some 
policymakers may judge that explicit thresh olds for unemployment and inflation would 
more clearly communicate the Committee’s polic y intentions than the language in the 
September statement.
1  But they might also think th at the FOMC should explore the 
implications of quantitative thresholds more fully before deciding whether to include them in its statement.  They also may j udge that it would be better to introduce new 
forward guidance at a meeting that will be followed by a press conference.   
Accordingly, the Committee might agree that  it is best to continue the current 
pace and composition of its flow-based asset purchases at least until the end of the year and to maintain both the target and forward guidance for the federal funds rate, as in 
Alternative B.

Salido, E. Nelson, W. Nelson, D. Reifschneider, and R. Tetlow, titled “U sing Thresholds to Clarify the 
Conditionality in the Committee’s Forward Guidance for the Federal Funds Rate,” which was distributed to

The Desk’s latest survey of the primary dealers indicates that the median dealer 
expects flow-based asset purchases to conti nue into the first quarter of 2014; no dealer 
expects purchases to end before mid-2013.  Th e survey also indicates that the dealers 
expect the Committee to conti nue acquiring longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of 
$45 billion per month after the MEP comes to a cl ose.  Thus the dealers appear to expect 
the flow-based asset purchases to end later, a nd so to cumulate to a larger total, than 
assumed in the baseline staff forecast.2  The results of the dealer survey also indicate that 
the dealers expect no more than minor updating to the language of the statement and no 
change in the forward guidance at this m eeting.  Thus, the survey suggests that a 
statement along the lines of the draft for Alte rnative B would be in line with market 
expectations, so it probably would result in little change in inte rest rates, equity prices, or 
exchange rates.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Members may instead conclude that  the medium-term outlook remains 
sufficiently weak to warrant making clear to  the public that purchases of both agency 
MBS and longer-term Treasury secu rities will continue well in to next year, particularly 
given that both core and headline inflati on are running close to 1½ percent on a 12-month 
basis.  Moreover, they, like the staff, might project that inflation will continue to run well below the Committee’s 2 percen t longer-run objective for the next several years even 
with asset purchases continui ng to mid-2013.  They also mi ght judge that announcing in 
the October FOMC statement that purchases  of MBS and Treasury securities will 
continue into next year would complement  the forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate that the Committee adopted  in September.  Moreover, policymakers may think that 
continuing to purchase agency MBS at a pa ce of $40 billion per month would help 
strengthen the emerging recovery in the hous ing sector, a development that they might 
see as generating ancillary benefits such  as raising consumer confidence, boosting 
household wealth, and increasing access to credit.  In additi on, participants  may see the 
new language in paragraph 4 of the draft st atement for Alternative A as desirable, 
because it signals that the Committee will not end asset purchases at the first signs of 
improvement in labor market conditions. 
                                                 
2 The staff forecast is conditioned on the assumpti on that asset purchases proceed at a rate of $85 
billion per month until they end in mid-2013, and cumulate to about $750 billion.  Of course, the 
Committee has not fixed an end date or specified pr ecisely the conditions that might warrant ending

Some members may judge that risks to the outlook stemming from U.S. fiscal 
policy, the euro area crisis, and slowing grow th in China are heavily weighted to the 
downside.  Moreover, members may view th e consequences of a new adverse shock 
while the economy remains weak as significantly  more costly than the consequences of 
some delay in tightening policy should economic  performance or inflation surprise to the 
upside.  If so, they may see the degree of uncertainty about the outlook and the 
asymmetry in risks and potential costs as arguing for providing clarity about future 
monetary policy by announcing now  that asset purchases will c ontinue into next year.  
These policymakers may want to adopt a statement such as the one presented in 
Alternative A, which says explicitly that  the Committee will con tinue to acquire both 
agency MBS and longer-term Treasur y securities after year-end.   
The Desk’s latest survey shows that most dealers already predict that the FOMC 
will continue to purchase both MBS and Treasury securities well beyond year-end and expect an announcement to that effect af ter the December FOMC meeting, but they 
anticipate little change  in the Committee’s statement at  this meeting.  Thus, while the 
content of a statement along the lines of Alternative A should not greatly surprise 
investors, the Committee’s deci sion to make substantial ch anges in statement language 
would be a surprise.  Investors might take the new wording of Alternative A, including 
the revisions to the language about the conditions that would lead the Committee to end those purchases, as a signal that asset purchases will last longer and cumulate to a larger 
total than they had projected, in which case longer-term real intere st rates likely would 
decline somewhat, inflation compensation and equity prices might rise, and the dollar 
could depreciate.  Or investors might read the statement of A lternative A, with its earlier-
than-expected announcement that asset purchases will continue into 2013, as indicating that the FOMC has a relatively gloomy outlook for growth and employment.  If so, equity 
prices could decline.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
The Committee might see the recent data as suggesting that, adjusting for the 
effects of drought on agricultural producti on, the underlying pace of economic recovery 
and rate of employment gains have impr oved in recent months.  Policymakers might 
point not only to recent labor market reports but also to stronger-tha n-expected growth in 
consumer spending and housing starts.  Indeed, smoothing through the month-to-month fluctuations in this year’s data, policymakers may see the ec onomic recovery as finally on

a sustainable course that will generate ongoi ng improvements in labor market conditions.  
Furthermore, they may view financial strains in Europe—and therefore the downside 
risks to the U.S. economy—as having eased of  late and see the Committee’s action in 
September as having made overall financial c onditions in the United States even more 
highly accommodative.  Moreover, in the cu rrent environment policymakers may see the 
potential benefits of additional asset purchases as likely to be small.  Participants may be 
concerned that inflation has picked up recently, even though largely in response to increased energy prices, and they might not e that ten-year inflation compensation 
temporarily rose to the upper end of its re cent range immediately after the Committee’s 
September announcement and remains in the upp er part of the range in which it has 
varied in recent years.  Thus, they may ag ree that longer-term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored for the time being but see upside risks to the inflation outlook in 
both the near term and the medium run unle ss asset purchases end fairly soon.  Some 
members may also be concerne d that continuing asset purc hases beyond the end of this 
year could put the Federal Reserve in the posi tion of having to reali ze large losses when it 
eventually sells the MBS it has acquired.
3  Others may worry that substantial further 
purchases of safe assets when longer-term in terest rates are already quite low could lead 
to imbalances in financial markets that might  undermine financial stability.  In light of 
these concerns, policymakers may prefer to adopt  a statement such as that for Alternative 
C to indicate that the Committee is unlikely to continue expanding the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet beyond the end of this year.   
If policymakers see the recove ry as now on a course that  will generate continuing 
reductions in unemployment and also see upside risks to inflation, or if they are 
concerned that continuing to hold the federal funds rate near zero until mid-2015 or later 
would pose increasing risks to financial stabil ity, they might consider it appropriate to 
begin scaling back the public ’s expectations of how long the federal funds rate will 
remain at its current exceptionally low level.  If so, they might favor a statement like the 
version of Alternative C that includes paragraph C.5.  Alterna tively, as in paragraph C.5', 
they might prefer to eliminate the calenda r date from the Committee’s forward guidance 
and replace it with new language that descri bes in somewhat greater detail the key 
                                                 
3 For a broader discussion of the potential effects of additional asset purchases on the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and income see the memo by staf f in the Division of Monetary Affairs at the Board 
of Governors and in the Markets Group at the Federa l Reserve Bank of New York titled “Options for an 
Additional LSAP Program,” sent to the Committee on August 28, 2012.

economic factors that the Committee will consid er in deciding when and how quickly to 
increase its target for th e federal funds rate.   
A statement along the lines of Alternative C would greatly surprise market 
participants and would be inte rpreted as signaling a significan tly faster removal of policy 
accommodation than investors had expected.  According to the Desk’s survey, the 
primary dealers anticipate no changes in the Committee’s forward guidance at this 
meeting.  Moving the projected date of the fi rst increase closer to the present, as in 
paragraph 5 of Alternative C, would cause a sizable upward shift in market participants’ 
expectations of the likely path for the fe deral funds rate, leav ing interest rates 
significantly higher at maturities  beyond a year or so.  Equity prices would probably fall, 
and the dollar might appreciate.  If the Comm ittee were to drop the date from its forward 
guidance without providing a clear indication of the specific econom ic conditions that 
would cause the Committee to begin raising the target rate, as in paragraph 5' of 
Alternative C, investors might become uncertain about the Committee’s intentions, and 
interest rate volatility could increase.

LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to the policy alternat ives A, B, and C.  Alternatives A and B include asset 
purchases that continue be yond the end of the maturity extension program (MEP) and 
assume that the Committee maintains an exceptionally low federal funds rate until 
August 2015.  In contrast, Alternative C ends purchases of MBS at the same time as the 
MEP, at the end of this year, and has the federal funds rate lift off from its lower bound in 
August 2014.  Projections under each scenar io are based on assumptions about the 
trajectory of various components of the balan ce sheet.  Details of these assumptions, as 
well as projections for each major component  of the balance sheet, can be found in 
Explanatory Note D.  
 
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue its current purchases of  MBS through the end of the year, when the 
MEP concludes, and then both continue MB S purchases and make additional purchases 
of Treasury securities through June 2013.  These purchases from October 2012 through June 2013 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Authorized for Public Release
    
$750 billion.4  This scenario is roughly consistent  with the descriptions of the asset 
purchases detailed in the Alternative B statement if purchases last for about nine months.5  
After the end of the MEP, the Committee is assumed to reinstitute its policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from Treasury securities at auction, it is also assumed to 
continue reinvesting principal payments fr om agency MBS and agency debt securities 
into agency MBS.  Overall, under this scenario, SOMA secu rities holdings increase to 
about $3.3 trillion by late-2013. 
In the Alternative B scenar io, consistent with the st atement language that the 
federal funds rate is expected to be at exceptionally low levels  “at least through mid-
2015,” we assume that the first increase in the target federal funds  rate is in August 
2015.6  The date of liftoff is a key determinant of the trajectory of the balance sheet.  In 
February 2015, six months before the first in crease in the target fe deral funds rate, all 
reinvestment is assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  In February 2016, six months after the initial in crease in the target fe deral funds rate, the 
Committee begins to sell its holdings of ag ency securities at a pace that reduces the 
amount of these securities in th e portfolio to zero in five y ears, that is, by January 2021.  
Through these redemptions and sales, the size of the portfolio is normalized by February 
2019.
7, 8  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA holdings 
                                                 
4 This amount does not include purchases conducted in September.  If the current pace of purchases 
continues at about $45 billion per month in Treasury securities and $40 billion per month in MBS, total 
purchases from October 2012 through June 2013 will be $763 billion.  In addition, although the SOMA 
portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities increases by $763 billion, total securities holdings increase by 
less because of the asset sales under the MEP. 
5 The statement indicates that the Committee will continue asset purchases until a substantial 
improvement in the outlook for the labor market is ac hieved in a context of price stability.  In the staff 
economic outlook, by mid-201 3 there will be accumulatin g evidence of a pickup in economic growth and 
an outlook for substantial improvement in the unemployment rate, which is projected to decline from 8 
percent in mid-2013 to 7½ percent in mid-2014 and to 7¼ percent in late 2014. 
6 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is two months later than that assumed in the balance sheet 
projections from the September Tealbook Book B Alternative B’ and is consistent  with the current staff 
forecast in Tealbook Book A.   
7 The tools to drain reserve balances (reverse re purchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of 
Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
8 The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the 
level of reserve balances that is assumed to be necessary to conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume 
that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  A hi gher demand for reserve balances would, all else equal, 
lead to an earlier normalization of the size of the balance sheet.

essentially matching the growth of Fede ral Reserve Bank capital and currency in 
circulation.  Total assets are $2 trillion at the end of 2020.   
The additional purchases of  securities in this scenario substantially boost the 
volume of reserve balances.  As the federa l funds rate increases  rapidly in 2016 and 2017, 
the interest expense on reserve balances rises quickly.  This expense, combined with the 
realized losses on sales of agency MBS, im ply that the Federal Reserve has an operating 
loss, and, as a result, remittances to Treasur y cease and a small deferre d asset is recorded 
on the balance sheet at year-end in 2 017, 2018 and 2019, peaking at about $8 billion 
in 2018.9,10 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue its 
current purchases of MBS through the end of the year, when the MEP is completed, and 
then continue MBS purchases and additional purchases of Treasury securities through the 
end of 2013.  These purchases from October 2012 through December 2013 ultimately expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term s ecurities by about $1.25 trillion.
11  
This scenario is roughly consistent with the descriptions of the asset purchases detailed in 
the Alternative A statement if purchas es last for about fifteen months.12  The Committee 
continues reinvesting principal payments fr om agency MBS and agency debt securities 
into agency MBS, and, after the MEP is complete, reinstitutes its policy of reinvesting principal payments from Treasur y securities at auction.  In this scenario, total assets 
increase to $4.1 trillion in 2014.  In February  2015, six months prior to the assumed first 
increase in the federal funds rate in Augus t 2015, all reinvestment is assumed to cease 
                                                 
9 Under Reserve Bank accounting, losses and gains on  securities held by the SOMA portfolio are only 
realized when securities are sold. 
10 Alternative B is similar to the $750 billion LSAP  scenario presented in the September FOMC memo 
"Options for an Additional LSAP Program" by Board and FRBNY staff.  In the memo, however, as in the 
September Tealbook’s Alternative B’, remittances to the Treasury remained positive and there was no 
deferred asset.  Remittances are lower, and a deferred  asset is accumulated, in the current projection for 
Alternative B because the federal funds rate is assumed to rise more steeply than in the previous Tealbook  
and because a larger fraction of the projected purchases are assumed to be agency MBS, which are subsequently sold during exit.     
11 This amount does not include purchases conducted in September. 
12 The statement indicates that the Committee will continue its purchases of MBS and Treasury 
securities until “it judged that data on economic activity  and labor market conditions are consistent with an 
outlook for sustained progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability.”  Under the staff baseline forecast, by late 2013  payrolls will have been increasing at a pace of close to 200,000 per 
month for a few months, the unemployment rate will have fallen some, and real GDP will be expanding at about 3 percent.  The outlook for labor market conditions as of late 2013 would include a half percentage 
point decline in the unemployment rate through late 2014 and a one and a half percentage point decline 
through late 2015.

and the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  Six months after the lift off of the federal 
funds rate, sales of agency securities  begin and continue for five years.13  The size of the 
portfolio is normalized by August 2019.  As in Alternative B, increas ed interest expense 
and realized losses on sales of agency MBS cau se a deferred asset to be recorded on the 
balance sheet; under this altern ative, there is a deferred asset from 2017 through the end 
of the projection period. 
For the scenario that corresponds to Alte rnative C, the Committee is assumed to 
purchase MBS only through the completion of the MEP at the end of  this year, after 
which no additional asset purchases are assumed.  In this scenario, the federal funds rate 
is assumed to lift off in August 2014, one year earlier than in Alternatives B and A.  
Corresponding to this earlier incr ease in the federal funds rate , reinvestment of principal 
from maturing or prepaying securities ends in  February 2014, and the portfolio begins to 
contract.  Sales of agency secu rities commence in February 2 015 and last for five years.  
Total assets in this scenario peak at $3 trillion, and the size of the balance sheet is 
normalized in March 2018, 11 months earlier than under Alternative B. 
Across scenarios, the volume of reserve balances is directly related to the 
assumed asset purchases.  Under Alternativ e A, reserve balances peak at about 
$2.7 trillion, while under Alternative B, rese rve balances peak at $2.2 trillion.  Under 
Alternative C, reserve balances rise only sligh tly from their current level to $1.7 trillion.  
For the scenarios corresponding to  Alternatives B and A, rese rve balances are $2 trillion 
and $2.5 trillion, respectively, when the federa l funds rate lifts off from its lower bound 
in August 2015.  For the scenario corresponding to Alternatives C, reserve balances are 
$1.5 trillion when the federal funds rate li fts off from its lower bound in August 2014.   
In the scenario corresponding to Alternativ e B, the monetary base increases from 
2012 to 2013 because of the purchase program.  Once exit begins, the monetary base 
shrinks at a notable pace through the second quarter of  2019, primarily reflecting a 
decline in reserve balances as  securities are redeemed or sold.  Starting in the third 
quarter of 2019, after reserve bala nces are assumed to have stabilized at $25 billion, the 
monetary base begins to expand again, in lin e with the growth of Federal Reserve notes 
                                                 
13 In Alternative A, MBS are sold over a five-year  period, and the size of the portfolio normalizes 
about three and a half years after sales begin—somewh at longer than the timeframe anticipated in the exit 
strategy principles.  If sales were assumed to be co mpleted over about three and a half years, the portfolio 
would normalize in three years; however, for consiste ncy, we have maintained the same assumption about 
the timeframe of sales—five years—as in Alternative B.

in circulation.  Under Altern ative A, the monetary base increases from 2012 to 2014 
because of the purchase program and then c ontracts during exit until after the size of the 
portfolio is normalized.  Under Alternative C, the monetary base increases a bit from 
2012 to 2013 — rising with delayed settlement of MBS purchases —and then contracts, 
on net, until after the size of the portfolio  is normalized.

DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY FORECASTS  
Domestic nonfinancial sector  debt is projected to e xpand at an annual rate of 
about 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, and then slow slight ly to 4 percent in 
2013 and 3¾ percent in 2014.  The expected slow ing is almost entirely the result of 
smaller projected increases in federal governme nt debt, from an annual rate of 10 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 7 percent in  2013 and 5¾ percent in 2014.  We forecast 
nonfinancial business debt to increase at a moderate pace over the projection period, 
reflecting favorable financing conditions in  the near term and a rise in capital 
expenditures in the medium term.  The level of  home mortgage debt is projected to hit 
bottom by the end of the year and to rise sl owly thereafter at an  annual rate of around 
1 percent, in line with the expectation that  financing conditions will remain relatively 
tight and that housing demand and house prices  will increase only gr adually.  Meanwhile, 
the rise in consumer credit is projected to pi ckup from an annual rate  of 6 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 2012 to 7½ percent in 2014, driven by further increases in demand for student loans, lending to finance consumer dur ables expenditures, and a gradual easing in 
credit conditions. 
We expect commercial bank credit to in crease at an annual rate of about 
3½ percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, 4 percent in 2013, and 4¾ percent in 2014.  Core loans—the sum of commercial and indus trial (C&I), real es tate, and consumer 
loans—are projected to increase modestly for the remainder of 2012 and to pick up 
somewhat in 2013 and 2014.  After having e xpanded robustly for most of 2012, C&I 
loans are expected to rise at a more moderate rate over the forecast period, in part reflecting low expected interest rates on alternatives to bank borrowing.  We anticipate 
that growth in both residential real estate  and consumer loans will pick up somewhat 
from their currently weak paces, reflecting improvements in borrowers’ credit quality and 
further gradual easing of standa rds and terms on such loans.  We also expect residential 
real estate lending to be s upported by gradual increases in  residential investment.  
Commercial real estate loans are projected to increase slowly over the forecast period, as 
high vacancy rates, depressed prices for co mmercial properties, and the poor credit 
quality of existing loans are likely to suppress activity in this sector .  Banks’ securities 
holdings are expected to rise  at a moderate pace, with smaller increases in 2013 and 2014 
than were posted in 2012, as deposit growth ebbs and bank loans strengthen.

We project that M2 will  increase faster than nominal income through the 
remainder of 2012, as investors continue to re spond to uncertainty about global economic 
and financial conditions by addi ng to their already elevated deposit balances.  We expect 
a significant portion of these elevated ba lances to unwind in early 2013 due to the 
expiration of the unlimited FDIC insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction deposits, 
leading M2 to rise at a slower pace than nominal income.14  M2 growth is forecast to 
remain below that of nominal income after this unwinding, as improvements in financial 
and economic conditions encourage investors to reallocate their portf olios towards riskier 
assets.   
Turning to the components of M2, liquid deposits are expected to expand at a 
brisk pace for the remainder of 2012, and then  to slow somewhat over the rest of the 
forecast period.  In contrast, retail money market funds and small time deposits are 
projected to decline through late 2014.  We pr oject that currency growth will gradually 
decline to a pace consistent with  its long-term average of 6 percent, and then continue at 
that rate through the end of the forecast period.

deposit insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts in excess of $250,000 from 
December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012.

DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued in Septem ber appears on the next page, followed by 
drafts for an October directive that corre spond to each of the po licy alternatives.   
The draft directives for all three Alternatives instruct the Desk to take appropriate 
steps to complete, by the end of Decembe r 2012, the MEP of $267 billion that was 
announced in June.  The draft directives for Alternatives A and B also tell the Desk to 
continue purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month; 
they do not specify an end date.  The directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to 
continue purchasing additional agency MBS at  a pace of $40 billion per month “until the 
end of the year.”  Each of the draft directives would also inst ruct the Desk to continue the 
current practice of reinvesting principal paym ents on all agency debt and agency MBS in 
agency MBS. 
If the Committee were to decide to co ntinue purchasing longer-term Treasury 
securities after the MEP concludes, that de cision would be reflected in the December 
directive.

September 2012 Directive  
The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions 
that will foster price stability  and promote sustainable growth  in output.  To further its 
long-run objectives, the Committ ee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
continue the maturity extension program it announced in June to purchase Treasury 
securities with remaining maturities of 6 year s to 30 years with a total face value of about 
$267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with 
remaining maturities of approximately 3 year s or less with a tota l face value of about 
$267 billion.  For the duration of this pr ogram, the Committee directs the Desk to

A. Policy Rules Used in “M onetary Policy Strategies” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
, while the t  denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter ௧  ܴ In the table, Policy Strategies.”  
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( gap t and gap t+1|t), and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective, denoted π*, is 2 percent.  The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
 (100 times the log of כ
௧݊ݕ(  100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ௧ ݊ݕ
potential nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to potential real GDP in 
that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in th at quarter; subsequently, target nominal GDP 
grows 2 percentage points per year faster than potential GDP. 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured promin ently in recent analysis by Board staff.1  The outcome-
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q12006:Q4.  The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run, quarterly real interest rate of 
2¼ percent, a value used in the FRB/US model.  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, 
and the long-run intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set at 2¼ percent—instead of 
Taylor’s original value of 2 percent—for the same  reason.  The 2¼ percent real rate estimate also 
enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income  targeting rule.  The prescriptions of the first

Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the

rate as a right-hand-side variable.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook” report rule prescrip tions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff 
outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far this quarter.

 B. Estimates of the Equilib rium and Actual Real Rates 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using the projection for the economy of 
FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends 
on a very broad array of economic factors, some of  which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  The estimate reported is the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, 
which is generated after the path s of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so 
that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date.

The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

 D. Long-Run Projections of the Ba lance Sheet and Monetary Base 
This explanatory note presents the assumptions  underlying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Long-Run Projections of the Bala nce Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as 
projections for each major component of the balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from October 2012 
to December 2020.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on September 30, 2012.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the tables that 
follow the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives B and A 
assume that the target federal funds rate begins  to increase in August 2015, consistent with the 
forward guidance in the FOMC’s statement that the ta rget federal funds rate is expected to be at 
exceptionally low levels “at least through mid-2015.”  This date of liftoff is consistent with the 
current staff economic forecast but is two mont hs later than assumed in the balance sheet 
projections for Alternative B in the Septem ber Tealbook.  The projection for the scenario 
corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts  off in August 2014, 
consistent with the draft statemen t language “at least through [late 2014  | mid-2014  | late 2013 ]” 
and a year earlier than in Alternative B.  In each  case, the balance sheet projections assume that 
no use of short-term draining tools is necessary to achieve the projected path for the target federal 
funds rate.2 
  
                                                 
2 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreements were used to drain reserves prior to raising the 
federal funds rate, the composition of liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse 
repurchase agreements would be matched by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, 
these draining tools would be wound down as the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so 
that the projected paths for Treasury securities presented in the Tealbook remain valid.

 ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B  are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue it s current purchases of MBS through the end 
of the year, when the MEP concludes, and then continue MBS purchases and 
additional purchases of Treasury securities through June 2013.  Purchases of Treasury securities will continue at a pace of about $45 billion per month and purchases of MBS securities will continue at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The Treasury securities purchased after the conc lusion of the MEP are assumed to have 
an average duration of about nine years, roughly the net duration of purchases and sales under the MEP.  The purchases between  October 2012 and June 2013 expand 
the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of l onger-term securities by $763 billion.   
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS.  
o Starting in February 2015—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agen cy MBS and agency debt securities in 
February 2016, six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the target federal funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and 
reach zero by January 2021. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections from the Tealbook.
3  The 
projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A,  the Committee is assumed to continue its 
current purchases of MBS through the end of the year, when the MEP concludes, and 
then continue MBS purchases and additional purchases of Treasury securities through December 2013.  Purchases of  Treasury securities will continue at a pace of about $45 
billion per month and purchases of MBS securities will continue at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The Treasury securities purchased after the conclusion of the MEP are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The purchases between October 2012 and December 2013 expand the SO MA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by $1.28 trillion.  In addition, the Committee is assumed to maintain its 
existing policy of reinvesting principal paym ents from its holdings of agency debt and 
agency MBS in agency MBS.  In Februa ry 2015, six months prior to the assumed 
increase in the federal funds rate in August 2015, principal payments from all securities 
                                                 
3 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of October 15, 2012.

 are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  Sales of agency securities begin in February 2016 
and continue for five years. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternativ e C, the Committee is assumed to purchase 
MBS only through the completion of the MEP at the end of this year; no additional asset purchases are assumed.  The FOMC continues to  reinvest the proceeds from principal 
payments on its agency securities holdings in agency MBS until February 2014—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate.  Starting in February 2014, all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency MBS a nd agency debt securities in February 2015.  
Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by January 2020.    
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which these securities are 
purchased will generally exceed their face va lue, with a larger premium for longer-
maturity securities.  As a resu lt, each alternative will add premiums to the balance sheet.  
In Alternative C, premiums net of amortizati on will increase $5 billion.  In Alternatives B 
and A, premiums are boosted by roughly $40 billion and $50 billion, respectively, by the time asset purchases end.  The increase in premiu ms is reflected in higher total assets and 
in higher reserve balances.   
 The asset purchases in all three alternatives put downward pressure on market interest 
rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.   
 The current and near-term market value of agency MBS is assumed to be four percent above face value.  As a result, for Alternatives B, A, and C, the $360 billion, $600 billion, 
and $120 billion of agency MBS purchases, respectively, will cause unamortized 
premiums on the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet to rise by roughly $14 billion, $24 
billion, and $5 billion, respectively, relativ e to a scenario without these MBS purchases.  
The increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances. 
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is  assumed to decline gradually, as the recent 
foreign central bank swap auctions mature, and then return to zero in 2013.  
 In all scenarios, once reserve balances drop to  $25 billion, the Desk begins to purchase 
Treasury bills to maintain this level of reser ve balances going forward.  Purchases of bills 
continue until such securities comprise one-thi rd of the Federal Reserve’s total Treasury 
securities holdings—about the average share prio r to the crisis.  Once this share is 
reached, the Federal Reserve buys coupon secur ities in addition to bills to maintain an 
approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.

  The assets held by TALF LLC remain at about  $1 billion through 2014  before declining 
to zero the following year.  Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of 
commitment fees collected by the LLC and the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  In this projection, the LLC does not purchase any asset-backed securities received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connec tion with a decision of a borrower not to 
repay a TALF loan. 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero in 2016.   
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 
currency through 2015.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements  (RRPs) is assumed to remain around $70 
billion, about the average level of RRPs associat ed with foreign official and international 
accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the TGA slowly drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion. The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 We maintain the Supplementary Financing Acc ount (SFA) balance at its current level of 
zero throughout the forecast. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
4 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset is recorded in lieu of reducing the Reserve 
Bank’s capital and is reported on the liability side of the balance sheet as “Interest on 
                                                 
4 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance sheet and 
the size of the SOMA portfolio.  Growth in Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two years; 
however, even if Federal Reserve capital were assumed to be constant, normalization only would be pushed 
later by about a quarter.

Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury .”  This liability takes on a positive value 
when weekly cumulative earnings have not yet been distributed to the Treasury and takes 
on a negative value when earnings fall short of the expenses listed above.  In Alternative 
B, a small deferred asset – peaking at about 8 billion in 2018 – is recorded on the balance 
sheet at year-end in 2017, 2018 and 2019.  In Alternative A, a deferred asset is recorded 
from 2017 through the end of the projection horizon, with a peak year -end value of about 
$36 billion  in 2019. 
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS4
• Under Alternative B, the current staff estimates of  the contemporaneous term premium 
effect on the yield of the ten- year Treasury note is negative 93 basis points.  Based on the 
projection for the balance sheet, that term premium effect converges slowly toward zero over the forecast period as the portfolio normalizes.  The term premium is about the same 
as it was in September Alternative B ’.   
• Under Alternative A, the term premium effect is negative 114 basis points.  The effect is 
more negative than in Alternative B because of the larger assumed securities purchases. 
• Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 66 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because there are no additional securities purchases in 
2013 and the liftoff date is earlier  so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternative B . 
 
 
                                                 
4 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model o utlined in the 
appendix of the January 18, 2012, memo “Possible MBS Large -Scale Asset Purchase Program” written by 
staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors.  More details of the model can

Purchase Programs” by Li and Wei, FEDS working paper #37, 2012.
