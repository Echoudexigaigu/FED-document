Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from six policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, a nd the nominal income targeting rule.1  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013.  (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of each rule are 
discussed later).  As shown in the left-h and columns, all but two of the near-term 
prescriptions keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound through the second quarter of 2013.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which puts relatively little weight on the output 
gap, prescribes an increase in the target fe deral funds rate to a bout 130 basis points in 
both the first and second quarters of 2013.  In  addition, the first-difference rule, which 
responds to the three-quarter-ahe ad change in the output gap, prescribes a target federal 
funds rate of 37 basis points for the second quarter of 2013. 
The right-hand columns display the rule pres criptions that arise in the absence of 
the lower-bound constraint.  The outcome-based rule and the inertial  Taylor (1999) rule 
prescribe federal funds rates that  are near zero for the next two quarters, while the Taylor 
(1999) rule and the nominal in come targeting rule prescribe rates that are well below 
zero.  The more-accommodative prescriptions aris ing from the latter two rules reflect the 
stronger immediate response of the rules to the staff’s estimate of the output gap, which 
remains appreciably negative.

The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key  Elements of the Staff Projection.”  As 
described in Book A of the Tealbook, the proj ected path of the output gap is wider in 
2013 and 2014, relative to the October projecti on, reflecting a mode st downward revision 
to the staff’s assessment of the underlying st rength of household spending in light of 
                                                 
1 Details for each rule appear in Explanatory Note A.  Note that the prescriptions of the outcome-
based rule reported in the table are not adjusted to conform with the Committee’s forward guidance, unlike 
the approach taken by the staff in using this rule to set the path of the federal funds rate in its baseline 
forecast.  
2 Although the rule prescriptions are not constrained to be at or above the lower bound, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule all include and place 
substantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate, which is subject to the lower-bound constraint.

   surprisingly weak incoming data on consumer spending and income, as well as somewhat 
less favorable financial conditions.3  In contrast, the staff’s pr ojection of core inflation is 
essentially unchanged since the October T ealbook.  Because of the slightly weaker 
outlook for economic activity, the near-term pr escriptions from all of the unconstrained 
rules have decreased a bit compared with those in the October Tealbook.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US model when conditioned on the staff’s 
outlook for the economy.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained, would return output to  potential in twelve quarters.  Consistent 
with the staff’s revision to the output gap, the r* estimate is about 30 basis points lower 
than in the October Tealbook.  As in  previous rounds, the estimate of r*—currently about 
2¼ percent— remains below the estimated act ual real federal funds rate of about 1½ 
percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations using 
the FRB/US model that incorporate the endogenous responses of inflation and the output 
gap to the different paths of the federal funds  rate prescribed by th e constrained versions 
of the six policy rules described above.  The model is adjusted to match the staff’s 
baseline outlook for the economy and then simula ted using each of the policy rules.  Each 
rule is implemented from the first quar ter of 2013 onward, under the assumption that 
private agents fully understand a nd anticipate the implications of  the rule for future real 
activity, inflation, and interest rates.4  The exhibit also displa ys the Tealbook baseline 
                                                 
3 With regards to financial conditions, the staff’s baseline assumption is that the asset purchase 
program will end in mid-2013.  Market participants appe ar to expect purchases to continue longer, and so 
they are assumed to be disappointed when purchases end.  The staff’s output gap forecast embeds the 
assumption that market rates will reflect the smaller-than-expected total purchases by the beginning of the 
third quarter of 2013.  The disappointment will result in a weaker stock market, a stronger dollar and higher 
longer-term real interest rates that widen the output gap by 8 basis points by the end of 2013, 24 basis points by the end of 2014, and 34 basis points by the end of 2015.  
4 The staff’s baseline forecast inco rporates the effects of the larg e-scale asset purchase programs 
that the FOMC has undertaken in recent years, as we ll as the effects of the flow-based asset purchases 
through December, the continuation of the maturity extension program until the end of this year, and the modifications to the Federal Reserve’s reinvestment policies that were announced in September 2011.  The staff baseline also assumes that the FOMC will purchase an additional $500 billion in long-term Treasury securities and MBS through mid-2013, and incorporates some “disappointment” on the part of financial market participants as they gradually come to recognize that the program will not be continued past this point, as they currently appear to expect.  Based on these assumptions, the policy rule simulations 
incorporate the baseline effects of these balance sheet policies; the rules themselves are not directly 
adjusted for the effects of balance sheet policies.

   paths, which are conditioned on the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule, adjusted to 
be consistent with the policy guidance reaffirmed in the October statement.5 
In the Tealbook baseline, th e federal funds rate depart s from the effective lower 
bound in the fourth quarter of 2015, one quart er later than in the October Tealbook.  
Subsequently, the federal funds rate increas es to 3.5 percent by the second quarter of 
2018, and reaches 4.2 percent by the end of the decade.  The unemployment rate reaches 
6.5 percent at the end of 2015 and is expected to reach the staff’s long-term estimate of 
the natural rate of unemployment by 2017 and remain close to this level thereafter.6  
Headline inflation is projected to rise gradua lly over time and eventually converge to 2 
percent after 2017.   
The Taylor (1993) rule initially prescribes a tighter path for the federal funds rate 
than the other rules.  As noted above, becau se the Taylor (1993) rule does not respond 
very strongly to the level of the output gap, it  calls for a federal funds rate of 140 basis 
points for the current quarter be fore a reduction to just below 100 basis points in the first 
quarter of 2013.  The higher federal funds rate makes real activity and inflation weaker 
than in the baseline, prompting a subsequent pa rtial reversal of the initial rate increase.  
Reflecting the early tightening, however, the rule implies a higher unemployment rate 
throughout the medium term as well as lower le vels of inflation over the whole projection 
period. 
While the first-difference rule does not call for an increase in the federal funds 
rate until the third quarter of  2014, it implies real and nominal federal funds rates that are 
above those prescribed by all but the Tayl or 1993 rule through mid-2017.  Reflecting the 
more-elevated average federal funds rate, the unemployment rate is higher and inflation 
lower in the medium term than under all of  the rules except the Taylor 1993 rule. 
Compared with the Taylor (1993) rule, th e Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a later 
tightening of policy and produces generall y lower unemployment rates and slightly 
                                                 
5 As discussed in Book A of the Tealbook, the st aff projection for the federal funds rate follows 
the estimated outcome-based rule, augmented with an  intercept adjustment that reflects the forward 
guidance in the Committee’s October statement and the economic outl ook as it stood at the time.  
Beginning in the third quarter of 2015, this intercept adjustment is steadily reduced and is zero beginning in 
the fourth quarter of 2017. 
6 The staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment declines from about 6 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 5¼ percent by the end of 2017; it is assumed to remain at this level 
thereafter.

   higher inflation rates over the projection period.  However, because the policy rate is 
higher under the Taylor (1999) rule than in the baseline, the rule produces worse 
outcomes.  The unemployment rate slowly converges to the staff’s estimate of the 
effective natural rate of unemployment while  inflation declines to 1.1 percent before 
gradually increasing to  the 2 percent goal. 
Under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first increase in the federal funds rate 
takes place in the third quarter of 2014, two qua rters before the Taylor (1999) rule would 
initiate tightening.  This earlier firming of po licy reflects the fact that  the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule subsequently prescr ibes a slower pace of policy tightening with higher future 
inflation, thereby generating a lower average path for the real federal funds rate through 
the rest of the decade, and so fueling a more rapid pickup in real activity and a lower path 
for the unemployment rate.  The unemploymen t gap is essentially closed by late 2017, 
when inflation is around 2 percent. 
Under the nominal income targeting rule, th e initial increase in the federal funds 
rate occurs in the second quarter of 2015, and for several years thereafter policy is 
generally more accommodative than under the ot her rules.  In particular, the average 
level of the real federal funds rate through the rest of the d ecade is markedly lower than 
in the baseline.  This more-accommodative po licy is reflected in a more-rapid decline of 
the unemployment rate, culminating in a peri od during which it is below the natural rate, 
while inflation is uniformly higher than in  the Tealbook baseline and modestly exceeds 
its 2 percent longer-run objective for a few years.7 
 The next exhibit, “Constrained vs. Un constrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares optimal control simulations derive d for this Tealbook with those shown in 
October.8  In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on 
                                                 
7 With the exception of the Taylor (1993) rule, th e prescribed dates of departure from the effective 
lower bound under the various simple rules are sensitive to the assumption that the public recognizes at the 
start of the simulations both what rule the FOMC will fo llow and the full implications of that rule for future 
economic conditions, as this assumpti on can lead to significant near-ter m movements in real activity and 
inflation in the simulations.  If the public were instead  assumed to revise only gradually its expectations for 
the FOMC future policy actions, then the prescribed departure dates under the Taylor (1999) rule, the 
inertial Taylor rule, and the first-difference rule would be advanced relative to the results reported in the exhibit, while the prescribed departure date under the nominal income targeting rule would be pushed further off into the future.   
8 The optimal policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, including the assumptions about balance sheet policies described above.

   keeping headline PCE inflation close to th e Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.  The simulations 
indicate that, with the federal funds rate constrained to remain positive, the optimal 
control path for the federal funds rate doe s not rise above the effective lower bound until 
the first quarter of 2016, one quarter later than  in the optimal control exercise shown in 
the October Tealbook; the optimal path is revised down beyond 2015, reflecting the 
wider output gap in the staff projection.9  Under the optimal control path, when the 
federal funds rate rises above the lower bound, the unemployment rate is 5.7 percent and the projected rate of inflation over both subsequent years is close to 2 percent. 
The constrained optimal control policy would promote a faster pace of economic 
recovery than in the staff’s baseline outlook by raising rates more slowly than under any 
of the simple rules, while still keeping inflation close to the Committee’s goal of 
2 percent over the medium term.  Under th is policy, the gap between the unemployment 
rate and the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemplo yment is closed by 
mid-2016, and the unemployment rate subsequently runs below the natural rate for a few 
years.  Inflation initially exhi bits a decline similar to that  in the Tealbook baseline, but it 
then increases to the 2 pe rcent objective by mid-2016 and then overshoots slightly, 
peaking at about 2¼ percent in 2018 and gra dually returning to th e 2 percent objective 
thereafter.  The more-rapid convergence to th e Committee’s assumed objectives than in 
the Tealbook baseline, and the subsequent  persistent overshooting, occur because 
policymakers respond to the lower bound constrai nt by committing to keep interest rates 
low for an extended period of time.  As this policy is assumed to be completely credible, 
it boosts inflation expectations and reduces real interest rate s during the initial years of 
the simulation. 
Under the optimal unconstrained policy, th e federal funds rate would gradually 
decline to about 2 percent by early 2014 and return to  positive territory only in late 
2015.  Under these conditions, th e unemployment rate would decline more rapidly than 
under the optimal constrained policy.  Infla tion would return to 2 percent by mid-2016, a 
                                                 
9 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit is calculated as the difference between the nominal 
federal funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to 
compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because it provides a less volatile measure of inflation 
expectations than does a four-quarter moving average of headline inflation.

   pattern much like that in the constrained simulation.  In subs equent years, inflation would 
slightly exceed the 2 percent objective, but less persistently than in the constrained case.10 
The fourth exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy: Commitment vs. Discretion,” 
displays simulations of the FRB/US model us ing two different concepts of optimality.  
Under the first concept (commitment), pol icymakers can choose conditional policies 
today that effectively constrain the Committ ee’s policy choices in future periods; under 
the second concept (discretion), policymakers are assumed to be unable to bind the policy 
decisions of future Committees and so c hoose policy today subject to the expected 
behavior of future policymakers.  The co mmitment policy corresponds to the optimal 
control concept presented in the third exhibit and so the red lin es in this exhibit trace the 
same paths as in the constrained case in the third e xhibit.  In the case of discretion, results 
are presented both with and without the e ffective lower bound imposed on the federal 
funds rate.  
As can be seen from the unconstrained simulations under discretion, policymakers 
would like to provide additional stimulus by cu tting the federal funds rate today.  With 
that option ruled out by the lower-bound constr aint, they therefore might consider an 
alternative strategy of promising to keep th e policy rate lower in the future.  Under 
discretion, however, policymakers’ inability to  credibly bind future Committees to carry 
out the original plan limits their ability to in fluence private-sector expectations regarding 
the federal funds rate and other variables.  Instead, the public knows that future 
Committees will always reoptimize policy wi thout regard for past policymakers’ 
promises.  As a result, policy under discretion evolves over time in a way that causes the 
federal funds rate to leave the lower bound sooner than under commitment, accompanied 
by higher unemployment and lower inflation.11 
Importantly, these exercises take the st aff’s baseline assumption about the SOMA 
portfolio policy as given and so treat the federa l funds rate as the sole  instrument that the 
Committee adjusts in response to the state of the economy.12  If policymakers wished to 
                                                 
10 The differences, in terms of economic outcomes, between constrained and unconstrained 
optimal control policies have noticeably narrowed since the December 2011 Tealbook.  This narrowing is 
in line with the intu ition that additional policy accommodation provi ded this year and other factors have 
boosted aggregate demand and thereby reduced the impact of the lower-bound constraint. 
11 For further discussion of the different properties of commitment and discretion, see the box in 
Book B of the December 2010 Tealbook, “The Role of Commitm ent in Optimal Policy Simulations.” 
12 As discussed in Book A of the Tealbook, the baseline assumption about the conduct of 
monetary policy is that the Federal Reserve will comple te the maturity extension program as scheduled at

   provide additional policy stimulus but saw little remaining scope to lower private sector 
expectations of the funds rate path because of limits on their ability to commit to future 
policy actions, they could s till provide stimulus by expa nding the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of longer-term securities.  That such a step could be appropr iate is suggested by 
the unconstained optimal control simulations  under either commi tment or discretion, 
which uniformly call for pushing the funds rate  noticeably below zero in the near term. 
The final exhibit, “Outcomes under Altern ative Policies,” tabulates the simulation 
results for key variables under the se lected policy rules described above.

noted above, the staff further assumes, as in Octobe r, that the Federal Reserve will purchase longer-term 
securities at a pace of about $85 billion per month through the end of June 2013.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  As always, the Co mmittee could blend elements of the draft 
statements to construct its desired statement. 
In its description of recent economic developments, Alternative B begins by 
observing that, “apart from weather-related di sruptions,” economic ac tivity has continued 
to expand moderately and that employment  growth has picked up a bit although the 
unemployment rate remains elevated.  Like the October statement, Alternative B notes 
that household spending has advanced; in light of recent data, however, October’s 
observation that this spending category has been  rising a bit more quickly is omitted.  The 
draft statement also notes “further signs of improvement” in the housing sector. 
Alternative A, unlike Alternative B, re peats the Committee’s October assessment 
that employment growth “has been slow,” that  there have only been  “some” further signs 
of improvement in the housing sector, and th at the improvement in housing activity is 
taking place “from a depressed level.”  Alte rnative C offers a somewhat more upbeat 
characterization of the data by describing employment growth as having “strengthened 
somewhat” and stating that the “unemployment rate, though still elevat ed, has declined.”  
Alternative C also drops the reference in th e October statement to slower growth in 
business fixed investment, instead observing more broadly that private domestic demand 
has continued to advance.     
With respect to inflation, Alternatives  A and B say that it “has been running 
somewhat below the Committee’ s longer-run obj ective, apart from temporary variations 
that largely reflect fluctuations  in energy prices,” while Altern ative C states that inflation 
“has been running close” to the Committee’ s longer-run objective and does not cite 
energy prices.  Each alternativ e indicates that longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
The language in Alternative B follows the October statement language on the 
outlook for real activity and employment, reiterating the Committee’s concern that, 
without sufficient policy accommodation, “econo mic growth might not be strong enough 
to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.”  Alte rnative A’s language 
on this issue is also similar to October’s, except that “further” policy accommodation is

  said to be needed to achieve the sustaine d labor market improvement.  Alternative C 
indicates that the Committee expects economic  growth to pick up gradually and that it 
anticipates that the unemployment  rate will continue to declin e at a pace consistent with 
the Committee’s mandate.  All of the draft statements continue to highlight the significant 
downside risks to the economic outlook from strains in global financial markets.  With 
respect to inflation, Alternatives A and B state that the Committee anticipates that 
inflation over the medium term “likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective,” while 
Alternative C indicates that inflation over th e medium term “will run near its 2 percent 
objective.” 
Reflecting their contrasting economic asse ssments, the alternatives also offer 
different approaches to balance sheet policy after December.  Altern ative B maintains the 
purchases of agency MBS at a pace of $40 b illion per month and indicates that, after the 
completion of the MEP at the end of the ye ar, the Committee will purchase longer-term 
Treasury securities, “initially at  a pace of $45 billion per month.”1  The statement would 
indicate that the Committee “will conti nue its purchases of Treasury and agency 
mortgage-backed securities, and employ its  other policy tools as appropriate” until 
substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market is achieved in a context of 
price stability.  Alternative A would increase  the monthly flow of purchases of agency 
MBS to $50 billion per month beginning in January and would increase the flow of 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securitie s to $50 billion per month after the MEP 
concludes.2  Moreover, the draft statement for Alte rnative A indicates that the purchases 
will continue until the Committee judges that data on economic activity and labor market 
conditions are consistent with an outl ook for sustained progress toward maximum 
employment in a context of price stability.  In contrast, Alternative C announces that 
purchases of both MBS and longer-term Treasury securities will stop at year-end.  Both Alternatives A and B would continue to indi cate that the Committee will also take into 
                                                 
1 The sales side of the MEP will, by the end of the year, have brought down to near zero the 
Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities of maturities within three years.  Therefore, a renewal of 
the MEP is not feasible, and those alternatives (A and B) whose policy announ cements include continued 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities do no t include sales of shorter-term Treasuries. 
2 Staff analysis suggests that agency MBS pur chases of $50 billion per month in addition to 
reinvestments appear feasible over the first six months of next year, even though such purchases would 
account for roughly 93 percent of gross TBA issuance.   See the memo, “Agency MBS Market Functioning 
and Purchase Capacity under the Open-Ended Purchase Program” (by M. Wei of the Federal Reserve Board and M. Ezer, D. Finkelstein, J. Frost, D. Lucca, L. Molloy, J. Moore, M. Raskin, J. Remache, R. 
Shimonov, and N. Wuerffel of the Federal Reserve Ba nk of New York).  This memo was sent to the 
Committee on November 30, 2012.

  account the likely efficacy and costs of the purchases when deciding on their size, pace, 
and composition.  All three al ternatives envision that the Committee will continue to 
reinvest principal payments on its holdings of  agency MBS and agency debt into agency 
MBS, and all three statements indicate that the Federal Reserve will, in January, resume 
rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at auction. 
Under each alternative, the Committee woul d maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target 
range for the federal funds rate.  However, th e alternatives take di fferent approaches to 
the forward guidance regarding th e path of the federal funds rate.  Alternative A and one 
of the two versions of the forward guidance for Alternative B would provide quantitative 
thresholds that link the Committee’s eventual reconsideration of the target range for the 
federal funds rate to labor market conditions and the outlook for inflation.3  The draft 
language for Alternative B states that the Committee “currently an ticipates that this 
exceptionally low range for the federal funds ra te will be appropriate at least as long as 
the unemployment rate remains above 6½ per cent, inflation between one and two years 
ahead  is projected to be no more than ½ pe rcentage point above the Committee’s 2 
percent longer-run goal, and l onger-term inflation expectations continue to be well 
anchored.”  Alternative A adopts this form ulation too, except that the unemployment 
threshold is 6 percent. 
Another new sentence in A lternative B indicates that the Committee views these 
thresholds as “consistent with its earlier date-based forward guidance.”  This sentence 
does not appear in Alternative A because the 6 percent unemployment threshold in 
Alternative A would likely amount  to a shift in forward guidance toward a longer period 
of exceptionally low levels of the federal f unds rate than was indicated in October. 
Further sentences in the new forward guida nce in both Alterna tives A and B state 
that other indicators of economic and financia l conditions will also enter into the decision 
to tighten, and that when the Committee be gins to remove policy accommodation, it “will 
take a balanced approach” in line  with its statutory mandate.   
The other version of the forward guidan ce in Alternative B is closer to the 
language used in October.  Both versions of  the forward guidance in the fifth paragraph 
                                                 
3 For a detailed analysis of quantitative thresholds, see the memo by E. Engen, J.P. Laforte, D. 
López-Salido, E. Nelson, W. Nelson, D. Reifschneider,  and R. Tetlow, titled “Using Thresholds to Clarify 
the Conditionality in the Committee’s Forward Guid ance for the Federal Funds Rate,” which was 
distributed to the Committee on October 16, 2012.

  of Alternative B include optional additional language intended to clarify that the firming 
of the funds rate will occur after the Committee “sees a substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market” and “the asset pu rchase program ends.”  One variant of the 
fifth paragraph of Alternative C retains language from the October statement without this 
new clarifying phrase, while providing the opt ion of stating that highly accommodative 
policy will remain appropriate for “some time” after the economic recovery strengthens 
instead of “for a considerable time.”  This va riant of the paragraph in Alternative C gives 
the choice of several dates, each prior to mid-2015, through which exceptionally low 
federal funds rates would be warranted.  Th e other variant of the fifth paragraph of 
Alternative C describes qualita tive factors the Committee will consider in deciding when 
to raise its target for the funds rate.  Specifi cally, this variant states that the exceptionally 
low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate until the Committee “has observed substantial improvement in labor market conditions, provided that the 
Committee projects that inflation over the medi um term will be close to its [ 2 percent ] 
objective and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.” 
The following table summarizes key elements of the alternative statements.  The 
table is followed by complete draft statemen ts and then by a summary of the arguments

  OCTOBER FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September 
suggests that economic activity has continue d to expand at a moderate pace in recent 
months.  Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains 
elevated.  Household spending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed.  Th e housing sector has shown some further 
signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level.  Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Co mmittee remains concerned that, without 
sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to 
generate sustained improvement in labor ma rket conditions.  Furthermore, strains in 
global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that  inflation over the medium term likely 
would run at or below it s 2 percent objective.  
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue 
purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed  securities at a pace of $40 billion per 
month.  The Committee also will  continue through the end of  the year its program to 
extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  These actions, which together  will increase the Co mmittee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, 
should put downward pressure on longer-t erm interest rates, support mortgage 
markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If th e outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional a sset purchases, and employ its other policy 
tools as appropriate until such improvement is  achieved in a context of price stability.  
In determining the size, pace, and compos ition of its asset purchases, the Committee 
will, as always, take appropriate account of  the likely efficacy and costs of such 
purchases.  
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the 
federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and curren tly anticipates that  exceptionally low 
levels for the federal funds rate are likely  to be warranted at least through mid-2015.

growth to be moderate over coming qua rters and then to pick up gradually,

together will increase  keep  the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities by 
about $85 billion each month through the end of the year,  at a level of about $2.8

  4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If th e outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage -

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee might judge that the medium-term outlook for economic activity 
has changed only modestly since the October meeting, and that fostering substantial 
improvement in the outlook for the labor market will require a continuation of the recent 
pace of asset purchases, as in Alternative B.   Policymakers may see recent data, even 
after adjusting for weather eff ects, as reinforcing their judgm ent that real GDP growth is 
not, and, absent additional purchases, will not be sufficient to produce sustained progress 
toward maximum employment.  Moreover, they  may view inflation as having remained 
somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run ob jective, especially when temporary 
variations that reflect recent  fluctuations in energy pri ces are excluded; in addition, 
participants may see infla tion as likely to remain subdued over the medium term.  
Participants might additionally note that m easures of medium- a nd longer-run inflation 
compensation have been relatively stable ove r the intermeeting peri od and that the mean 
and median of the primary dealers’ medium -term forecasts for inflation are roughly 
unchanged from their values ahead of th e October FOMC mee ting.  Accordingly, 
participants might judge that inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Against this 
backdrop, the Committee may conclude that it is  appropriate to continue purchases of 
agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month and, once the MEP is completed, to 
maintain the Federal Reserve’s $45 billion pe r month rate of acqui sition of longer-term 
Treasuries.4 
Policymakers may judge that downside risks to the outlook for economic 
activity—particularly from the euro-area cr isis and unresolved U.S. fiscal policy 
decisions—remain quite elevated.  While noting that financial conditions in the euro area 
have improved slightly, on balance, since October, policymakers may see non-trivial 
odds that the euro-area crisis could deepen ne xt year and produce a very substantial drag 
on U.S. economic growth.  Some policymakers may also see a sizable probability that 
fiscal policy could tighten more  sharply at the turn of the year than in their baseline 
projections.  Nonetheless, policymakers may anticipate that the January meeting will 
provide a better vantage point for assessing the fiscal situation, and for determining 
whether monetary policy accommodation, beyond that implied by the current pace of 
                                                 
4 The Desk’s proposed distribution for the Treasu ry securities purchases under Alternatives A and 
B implies a 9-year duration of purchases, about the same as the duration of net purchases under the MEP 
but greater than under LSAP1 or LSAP2.

  asset purchases, is needed to help lean against the effects of tighter fiscal policy on 
economic activity and inflation.  A decision made in early 2013 rather than in December might also put policymakers in a better posit ion to reach judgments about the extent of 
improvement in euro-area financ ial markets and to adjust for distortions to incoming data 
arising from the immediate impact of Hu rricane Sandy.  Taking these considerations 
together, policymakers may judge it appropriate  to continue existi ng monthly flows of 
asset purchases at this meeting, and await additional information before deciding on any adjustment to the pace and composition of  the Committee’s asset purchases.   
Some policymakers may view the economic outlook as somewhat brighter than in 
October and see the risks to the outlook as ha ving diminished in recent months, perhaps 
because they tend to put greater weight on th e underlying growth in payroll employment, 
the signs of improvement in the housing market , and reduced financial strains in the euro 
area.  These policymakers may nonetheless judge  that the informati on received to date 
does not imply a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market and 
conclude that the present flow s of asset purchases should be continued at this meeting, as 
in Alternative B. 
Some participants may concur that labor market conditions point to the need for 
continuing policy accommodation but may see th e costs and risks associated with an 
ongoing expansion of the Committee’s securities holdings as potentially outweighing the 
likely benefits at some stage.  These part icipants may neverthele ss favor continuing for 
the time being the present flows of purchases of longer-term securitie s.  While staying on 
alert for signs that costs of asset purchas es are becoming more important, members may 
currently judge that the costs of purchases ar e likely to be low in comparison with the 
benefits.  Moreover, some members may view the language in Alternative B that the new 
year’s Treasury purchases will proceed “initially  at a pace of $45 billion per month” as 
useful in conveying the message that purchases could be scaled back if evidence emerged 
of rising costs of purchases.   
With respect to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate, policymakers may 
judge that explicit quantitativ e thresholds for unemploymen t and inflation would more 
clearly communicate the Committee’s policy intentions than the date-based language in 
recent statements.  They may regard a move to such thresholds as more likely than date-
based guidance to promote a situation in which the responses of financial asset prices to 
changes in the outlook are of a direction a nd magnitude that are consistent with the 
Alternatives

  Committee’s reaction function.  They also may view the December meeting as a 
convenient time to introduce new forward guidance because the change can be explained 
and underscored at the post-m eeting press conference.   
Policymakers may also wish to make e xplicit that the thre shold language, while 
intended to provide greater clarity about the Committee’s reaction function, does not 
signal a change in the Committee’s assessment of the likely future path of the federal 
funds rate.  In particular, participants may view thresholds  for the unemployment rate of 
6½ percent and for projected in flation between one and two y ears ahead of “no more than 
½ percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal” as broadly 
consistent with the version of the date-b ased forward guidance used since September.5  
Policymakers may therefore favor inclusion in  the Committee’s statement of a sentence, 
like that in the fifth paragraph of Alternat ive B, indicating that the Committee views the 
thresholds language as consistent with its  earlier date-based forward guidance.  
Policymakers may regard this sentence as useful to include in the December statement, as 
the Committee transitions from date-based to  thresholds-based guidance concerning the 
federal funds rate target, but see no need to include this sentence in subsequent 
statements.  The draft statement in Alterna tive B also indicates that the Committee will 
continue to take a balanced approach toward  meeting its objectives after a threshold is 
crossed.  The Committee might wish to provide  such guidance in light of the important 
role that expectations of interest-rate polic y after the Committee begins to remove policy 
accommodation play in shaping current financial conditions.  If they favor adopting quantitative thresholds, policymakers may al so view a reference to the Committee’s 
“longer-run goals of maximum employment and in flation of 2 percent”  as a valuable way 
to round off the new forward guidance langua ge, on the grounds that this reference 
underlines the distinction between the th resholds and the Committee’s statutory 
objectives.   Alternatively, if policymakers regard this distinction as adequately 
highlighted by the paragraph’s earlier refe rence to the Committee’ s longer-run goal of 2 
percent inflation, they may pr efer to conclude the forw ard guidance language with a 
reference to “maintaining satisfactory progress toward maximum employment in a 
context of price stability.” 
                                                 
5 Such a judgment would be in line with the staff analysis provided in the memo, “Using 
Thresholds to Clarify the Conditionality in the Co mmittee’s Forward Guidance for the Federal Funds 
Rate,” cited earlier.

   Some policymakers, while agreeing with th e overall settings of policy associated 
with Alternative B, may think that date-bas ed forward guidance is a more effective way 
of communicating policy.  Other policymakers might accept the desirability in principle 
of including thresholds in the statement but ma y regard the quantitative specification of 
the thresholds as an issue th at requires further analysis before thresholds could be 
announced.  These policymakers may prefer a st atement along the line s of the variant in 
paragraph 5' of Alternative B that preserves the date-based forward guidance language.   
Members may see the additional optional la nguage in both versions of paragraph 
5 of Alternative B—language that indicat es that a highly accommodative policy will 
continue after the Committee “sees a substan tial improvement in the outlook for the labor 
market, the asset purchase program ends, and the economic recovery strengthens”—as 
potentially helpful in further clarifying th e likely sequence of the Committee’s policy 
steps as the economy improves.  However, othe r members may regard this distinction as 
already well understood by market participants.  They may vi ew the optional language as 
unnecessary and liable to create confus ion if added to the statement.  
The Desk’s latest survey of primary d ealers indicates that the median dealer 
expects flow-based asset purchases to conti nue into the first quarter of 2014; no dealer 
expects purchases to end before mid-2013.  Th e survey also indicates that the dealers 
expect the Committee to continue MBS purchases of $40 billion a month and to continue 
acquiring longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month after the 
MEP comes to a close, as in Alternative B.   The survey further suggests that dealers 
assign a high probability to the eventual  adoption by the Committee of threshold 
language, and that thresholds of 6½ per cent for unemployment and 2½ percent for 
inflation (as in Alternative B) are broadl y consistent with market participants’ 
expectations of the quantitative form that thresholds would likely take.  However, the 
survey also indicates that dealers do not see a move to thresholds at this meeting as all 
that likely.  All told, a Decem ber statement along the lines of Alternative B would not 
surprise market participants in terms of the announced flows of asset purchases, but the 
shift to thresholds-based fo rward guidance would be somewhat unexpected.  The degree 
to which this new form of the forward guida nce led to an appreciable market reaction 
would likely be tempered by the indication in the statement that the Committee regards 
the thresholds as consistent with its earlier  date-based guidance.  However, longer-term 
interest rates could rise some what if the phrase “initially  at a pace of $45 billion per 
month” is taken to imply that purchases may be scaled back in a few months.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some policymakers may instead see the medium-term outlook as still sufficiently 
weak to justify announcing further policy a ccommodation immediately, as in Alternative 
A.  These members may have doubted th at the amount of policy accommodation 
provided via the last two meetings’ decisions  regarding flow-based asset purchases was 
sufficient to generate satisfactory progress toward the Committee’ s goals of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation in the longer term.  Information since the October 
meeting may have reaffirmed their earlier asse ssment that, absent an increase in the pace 
of asset purchases, sustained improvement in la bor market conditions is  likely to take an 
unacceptably long time. 
Those members who see the outlook as unsatisfactory may also point to the fact 
that the gradual firming in economic activity that they projected earlier appears less likely 
given the softer tone of incoming economic data, particularly on household income and 
spending.  Moreover, members may see recent inflation rates as somewhat below the 
Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and, especially now that  upward pressure on 
energy prices has abated, might expect that inflation will continue to run appreciably 
below the Committee’s 2 percen t longer-run objective for the next several years, even 
with asset purchases continuing at their present $85 billion pe r month pace well into next 
year.  Thus, for some members, the unde rlying weakness in economic activity and low 
inflation may suggest the need for further policy accommodation, in the form of a 
stepping-up in the pace of pur chases of both longer-term Tr easury securities and agency 
mortgage-backed securities.  
Moreover, policymakers may think that stepping up the pace of purchases of 
agency MBS would help strengthen the em erging recovery in the housing sector, a 
development that they might see as generating ancillary benefits such  as raising consumer 
confidence and boosting household wealth.  They  may further regard an announcement of 
increased purchases of longer-t erm Treasury securities as providing desirable downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates while continuing the broad outlines of the Treasury 
purchase policy included in the MEP.  These policymakers may anticipate that these 
further purchases of Treasuries and agen cy MBS would raise market participants’ 
expectations of the ultimate stock of securi ties acquired by the Fe deral Reserve under the 
flow-based purchase program, and thereby make financial conditions more accommodative.  Policymakers might view such a shift to greater accommodation as 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
December 6, 2012
29 of 63

  warranted by the weak outlook that is in pros pect in the absence of  further expansionary 
measures.  Furthermore, participants may see the purchases made by the Committee since 
September as having had stronger effects on financial conditions than they had 
anticipated, without an offsetting increase in  costs, suggesting that larger purchases 
would be desirable.    
Other members who previously viewed the Committee as having established an 
appropriately accommodative monetary policy stance may have come to reassess their position in light of recent months’ financial market developments.  These members may 
regard financial conditions as having become less accommodative in the last couple of 
months as a result of lower equity prices and a higher dolla r, and they may see financial 
conditions as poised to become still less accommodative in the absence of a shift to a 
greater pace of purchases.  If so, they might view the pace of purchases previously 
decided upon by the Committee, while appropria te in September and October, as now 
inadequate.   
While acknowledging some improvement in the outlook for the euro area since 
the October meeting, members may feel that  risks to the economic outlook stemming 
from the euro-area crisis are still heavily weighted to the downside.  Moreover, they may 
see further downside risks associated with a sharper-than-expected U.S. fiscal tightening 
and a greater-than-anticipated slowdown in China.  Members may also judge that the 
consequences of a new adverse shock at a time when the economy remains weak are 
significantly more costly than the consequen ces of some delay in tightening policy should 
economic performance or inflation surprise to the upside.  If so, they may see the degree 
of uncertainty about the outlook and the asymmetry in risks and potential costs as arguing 
for further policy accommodation.  They may also  think it would be useful to indicate 
that asset purchases will continue until th e Committee “judges that data on economic 
activity and labor market conditions are consistent with an outlook for sustained progress 
toward maximum employment in a context of pr ice stability.”  In addition, policymakers 
might view a move to a thresholds-based formulation of the forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate as a useful complement to their announcement of increased flows of 
purchases and their guidance re garding the purchase policy.   
The Desk’s latest survey shows a median dealer expectation that the Committee 
will announce that it will continue purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month 
and Treasury securities at $45 billion per month.  An announcement like Alternative A 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
December 6, 2012
30 of 63
Authorized for Public Release
     
  that raised the flows of each  of these monthly purchases to $50 billion per month would 
thus come as a considerable surprise to ma rket participants, and it would likely prompt 
investors to mark upward the projected amount of securities that the Federal Reserve will 
acquire under its flow-based program.  Mo reover, while dealers do expect threshold 
language to be adopted by the FOMC eventu ally, the 6 percent unemployment threshold 
in Alternative A is lower, and so implies a more expansionary polic y, than dealers expect 
to be associated with thresholds-based guidance.  In response to a statement like 
Alternative A, longer-term real  interest rates likely would decline somewhat, reflecting a 
higher projected peak for Federal Reserve secu rities holdings and a lower expected path 
for the federal funds rate.  Inflation compen sation and equity prices might rise, and the 
dollar could depreciate.  However, if invest ors read the statement of Alternative A as 
indicating that the FOMC has a relatively  gloomy outlook for growth and employment, 
equity prices would rise by le ss or could even decline.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some participants might see the recent data as suggesting that, adjusting for 
temporary factors such as the effects of the drought and th e disruptions from Hurricane 
Sandy, the underlying pace of economic recovery  and rate of employment gains have 
improved, on balance, in recent months.  Policymakers might point not only to recent 
months’ labor market reports but also to the further signs of impr ovement in the housing 
market.  Indeed, after smoothing through the month-to-month fluctuations in recent data, 
policymakers may see the economic recovery as having reached a sustainable course that 
is likely to be associated with ongoing improvements in labor market conditions.  
Furthermore, they may view financial strains in Europe—and the corresponding 
downside risks to the U.S. economy—as having eas ed further since October.  As a result, 
they may see the monetary policy settings put in place by the Committee since September 
as having provided sufficient accommodation and so choose to bring asset purchases to a 
close at year-end, as in Alternative C.   
Moreover, some policymakers may regard the potential benefits of additional 
asset purchases under present circumstances as likely to be small and unlikely to 
outweigh the costs.  They may view th e accommodation already provided by Federal 
Reserve purchases as having laid the groundwor k for the unemployment rate to decline at 
a pace consistent with achieving the Comm ittee’s statutory mandate over the medium 
term.  In addition, participants may see in flation as having been  near the Committee’s 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
December 6, 2012
31 of 63
Authorized for Public Release
     
  longer-term goal of 2 percent and as like ly to pick up if w ithdrawal of policy 
accommodation does not begin before long.  They may agree that longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well anchored for the time being but perceive upside risks to the 
inflation outlook in both the near term and the medium run unless asset purchases are 
promptly discontinued and policy normaliza tion commences sooner than expected in 
markets.   
Some members may also be concerned th at a continuation of asset purchases 
beyond the end of this year would likely be in consistent with the exit strategy principles 
announced by the Committee in June 2011, and they may worry that making an adjustment to the exit strategy principles at this point could weaken the credibility of the 
Committee’s announcements about future mone tary policy.  In addition, members could 
see further asset purchases as raising the odds that the Federal Reserve realizes 
significant losses during exit and be worried  about the communications and political 
issues that such losses could raise.
6     
Some policymakers, moreover, may be skeptical that the downward pressure on 
longer-term interest rates fr om additional Treasury and MBS purchases would have a 
significant effect on macroeconomic outcomes.  For example, they may feel that lower 
longer-term interest rates woul d prompt corporations to re structure their balance sheets 
but would have little impact on their investment and hiring decisions.  Alternatively, they may worry that further purchases by the Federa l Reserve of safe assets when longer-term 
interest rates are already qu ite low could lead to exce ssive risk-taking and other 
imbalances that might undermine financial stabil ity over time.  In light of these concerns, 
policymakers may prefer to adopt a statement like that in Alternativ e C, which indicates 
that the Committee will cease expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet at the end 
of this year.   
If policymakers judge that the recovery is presently on a course that will generate 
sustained reductions in unemployment, and that the present stance of monetary policy 
risks a rise in inflation, or if they are con cerned that continuing to hold the federal funds 
rate near zero until mid-2015 or later would pose increasing risks to financial stability,

  they might consider it appropria te to begin scaling back the public’s expectations of how 
long the federal funds rate will remain at its current exceptionally low level.  If so, they 
might favor a statement like the version of Alternative C that includes paragraph C.5', 
which alters the existing date-based forwar d guidance in the direction of a 2013 or 2014 
date for initial policy firming.  Alternatively, as in paragraph C.5, th ey might prefer to 
eliminate the calendar date from the Comm ittee’s forward guidance and replace it with 
new language that lays out in somewhat grea ter detail the key economic factors that will 
figure in the Committee’s decisions concerning when, and how quickly, to increase its 
target for the federal funds rate.   
A statement along the lines of Alternative C would greatly surprise market 
participants and would be inte rpreted as signaling a significantly more rapid removal of 
policy accommodation than investors had expe cted.  According to the Desk’s survey, 
primary dealers expect purchases of l onger-term securities to continue well beyond 
December, and to proceed at their present pace .  The primary dealers also anticipate little 
change to the Committee’s forward guidance at this meeting.  Moving the projected date 
of the first increase closer to the present, as in paragraph 5' of Alternative C, would cause 
a sizable upward shift in market participants’ expectations of the likely path for the 
federal funds rate, leaving interest rates signi ficantly higher at maturities beyond a year or 
so.  The upward movement in longer-term in terest rates would be reinforced by the 
announcement, in Alternative C, that additi onal asset purchases will be discontinued at 
the end of the year.  Equity prices would probably fall significantl y, and the dollar might 
appreciate.  If the Committee were to drop the date from its forward guidance without 
providing a clear indication of the specific economic conditions that would lead the 
Committee to begin raising the ta rget rate, as in paragraph 5 of Alternative C, investors 
might become uncertain about the Committee’s intentions, and interest rate volatility 
could increase.

  LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.7  All options assume that the maturity extension 
program is completed at the end of Decembe r and that $40 billion of agency mortgage-
backed securities (MBS) are purchased in D ecember, resulting in about $250 billion in 
purchases of longer-term securities from Oc tober to December 2012.  Alternatives A and 
B include asset purchases that continue beyond the end of the year and assume that the 
Committee maintains an exceptionally low federal funds rate until October 2015.  In 
contrast, Alternative C ends purchases at the end of this year and has the federal funds 
rate lift off from its lower bound in October 2014.  Projections under each scenario are 
based on assumptions about the trajectory of various components of the balance sheet.  
Details of these assumptions, as well as pr ojections for each major component of the 
balance sheet, can be found in Explanatory Note D.

“Options for Continuation of Open-Ended Asset Purchases in 2013” by Board and FRBNY staff sent to the 
Committee on November 30, 2012 (hereafter “the  options memo for the December FOMC”).

  For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue MBS purchases at $40 billion per month and make additional 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities of $45 billion per month through June 2013.  
These roughly $500 billion in additional pur chases in 2013, when combined with the 
$250 billion in purchases fr om October through December 2012, imply a total expansion 
of SOMA holdings of longer-term securities of about $750 billion.8  This scenario might 
be viewed as roughly consistent with the desc ription of asset purchas es in Alternative B.9  
Overall, under this scenario, SOMA securities holdings in crease to about $3.3 trillion by 
December 2013. 
In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in October 2015 as in the staff forecast.10  The date of liftoff is a key 
determinant of the trajectory of  the balance sheet.  In Apr il 2015, six months before the 
first increase in the target federal funds rate , all reinvestment is as sumed to cease, and the 
SOMA portfolio begins to contract.11  In April 2016, six months after the initial increase 
in the target federal funds rate, the Comm ittee begins to sell its holdings of agency 
securities at a pace that reduces the amount of these securities in the portfolio to zero in 
five years, that is, by March 2021.  Through th ese redemptions and sales, the size of the 
portfolio is normalized by March 2019.12, 13  The balance sheet then begins to expand, 
                                                 
8 This amount does not include purchases conducted in September 2012.  Although the SOMA 
portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities increa ses by about $750 billion between October 2012 and 
June 2013, total securities holdings increase by less b ecause of the asset sales and redemptions under the 
MEP. 
9 The statement indicates that the Committee will continue asset purchases until a substantial 
improvement in the outlook for the labor market is ac hieved in a context of price stability.  In the staff 
economic outlook, by mid-201 3, there will be accumulating evidence of a pickup in economic growth and 
an outlook for substantial improvement in the unemployment rate, which is projected to decline from near 8 
percent in mid-2013 to 7¾ percent in mid-2014 and to 7½ percent in late 2014.  Alternatively, by mid-2013, the Committee could end the purchase program base d on its assessment of the efficacy and costs of 
additional asset purchases.   
10 At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is projected to be 6.5 percent, and core PCE 
inflation is expected to be 1.7 percent.  This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is two months later than 
that assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the October Tealbook and is consistent with the policy assumption in the current staff forecast in Tealbook Book A.   
11 After the end of the MEP, the Committee is a ssumed to reinstate its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from Treasury securities at auction.  It is also assumed to continue reinvesting principal 
payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS.  The effect of assuming reinvestment of Treasury securities at auction is very modest; after the completion of the MEP, there will be less than $6 billion of Treasury securities in the SO MA portfolio that mature before January 2016.   
12 The tools to drain reserve balances (reverse re purchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse

  with increases in SOMA holdings essentially  matching the growth of Federal Reserve 
Bank capital and currency in circulation.  Total assets are $2.6 trillion at the end of 2025.   
The additional purchases of securities  through the middle of 2013 significantly 
increase the level of SOMA holdings and reserve balances  through the medium term.  
Sales of agency MBS after the federal funds rate increases are proj ected to result in 
realized capital losses.14  These capital losses in conjunction with the rise in interest 
expense on reserve balances substantially re duce Federal Reserve net income; the Federal 
Reserve makes modest remittances to the Treasury in 2017, 2018, and 2019, but no 
deferred asset is recorded.15 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue its 
current purchases of MBS through the end of th e year, as well as complete the MEP.  
Beginning in January 2013, the Committee is assumed to increase the pace of purchases 
of Treasury securities and agency MBS to $50 billion each per month.  Around midyear, 
the Committee is assumed to begin to tape r purchases and at year-end it stops all 
purchases.  These purchases total $1 trilli on in 2013, which, when combined with the 
$250 billion in purchases from October through December 2012, ultimately expand the 
SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $1.25 trillion.  This 
                                                                                                                                                 
repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the 
balance sheet. 
13 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts 
to its longer-run trend level, determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and 
a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of re serve balances that is assumed to be necessary to 
conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  A higher demand for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead  to an earlier normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet. 
14 Under Reserve Bank accounting, securities held  in the SOMA portfolio are recorded on an 
amortized cost basis.  As a result, realized losses an d gains on securities sold a ffect the Federal Reserve’s 
net income; unrealized losses and gains are not reflected in net income.   
15 Alternative B is similar to the $750 billion purchase program scenario presented in the options 
memo for the December FOMC.  Bala nce sheet and income projections in that memo are based on the 
interest rate assumptions from the October Tealbook .  Based on those interest rate assumptions, the 
projections for the $750 billion purchase program in the options memo and for Alternative B in the October 
Tealbook suggested that the Federal Reserve experien ces a temporary period of operating losses.  As a 
result, remittances to Treasury cease for a time and a smal l deferred asset is booked on the balance sheet at 
year-end in 2017, 2018, and 2019, peaking at about $4 billion in 2018.  Remittances are higher, and a 
deferred asset is not booked, in the current projec tion for Alternative B because the interest rate 
assumptions are lower than in the previous Tealbook in 2015 through 2020, reflecting a downward revision to the projection for economic activity  and an associated widening of the output gap.  The lower assumed 
path of interest rates significantly dampens the rise in  interest expense and reduces realized capital losses 
relative to the last Tealbook.

  scenario might be viewed as roughly consistent  with the descriptions of asset purchases 
in Alternative A, with the tapering allo wing the Committee to wi nd down purchases as 
the economy makes “sustained prog ress toward maximum employment  in a context of 
price stability.”16  The Committee continues reinvesting principal payments from agency 
MBS and agency debt securities into agen cy MBS, and, after the MEP is complete, 
reinstitutes its policy of re investing principal payments from Treasury securities at 
auction.  In this scenario, total assets increa se to $4.0 trillion.  In April 2015, six months 
prior to the assumed first increase in the federal funds rate in October 2015, all 
reinvestment is assumed to cease and the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  Six months after the lift off of the federal funds rate, sales of agency secu rities begin and continue for 
five years.  The size of the portfolio is normalized by August 2019—about three-and-a-
half years after sales begin, and somewhat l onger than the timeframe anticipated in the 
exit strategy principles.
17  (See the box, “Implications of  Additional Securities Purchases 
for the Exit Strategy Principles ” for more discussion.)   
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of reserve balances.  As the federal funds rate rises in 2016 and 2017, the interest expense 
on reserve balances increases quickly.  The in terest expense combined with the losses 
realized on the sales of agency MBS result in an operating loss, which causes remittances to the Treasury to cease and a small deferred asset to be recorded on the balance sheet at 
year-end in 2017, 2018, and 2019.  The deferred asse t peaks at about $4 billion in early 
2019.
18   
                                                 
16 Under the staff’s baseline forecast, by mid-20 13, the longer run outlook will have improved 
somewhat.  In late 2013, payrolls will have been increasing at a pace of close to 170,000 per month for a 
few months, the unemployment rate will have fallen some, and real GDP will be expanding at about a 3 
percent annual rate.  The outlook for labor market conditions as of late 2013 would include a half 
percentage point decline in the unemployment rate through late 2014 and a one and a quarter percentage point decline through late 2015. 
17 In Alternative A, MBS are sold over a five-year  period.  If sales were assumed to be completed 
over about three and a half years, the portfolio woul d normalize in three years; however, for consistency, 
we have maintained the same assumption about the timeframe of sales—five years—as in Alternative B. 
18 Alternative A is similar to the $1.25 trillion pu rchase programs presented in the options memo 
for the December FOMC.  In those projections, as well as in October Tealbook’s Alternative A, a deferred 
asset was recorded on the balance sheet at year end from 2017 to 2021, peaking at about $45 billion in 2020.  The deferred asset is smaller in the current pr ojection reflecting a lower assumed path for interest 
rates than in the October Tealbook.  The lower interest rate path, in turn, implies a more modest increase in 
interest expense on reserve balances and lower realized capital losses on MBS sales over the projection 
period.

  For the scenario that corresponds to Alte rnative C, the Committee is assumed to 
purchase MBS only through the end of this  year, after which no additional asset 
purchases are undertaken.  In this  scenario, the federal funds ra te is assumed to lift off in 
October 2014, one year earlier than in Alternatives B and A.  Corresponding to this 
earlier increase in the federal funds rate, reinvestment of principal from maturing or 
prepaying securities ends in Ap ril 2014, and the portfolio begi ns to contract.  Sales of 
agency securities commence in April 2015 and last  for five years.  To tal assets in this 
scenario peak at $3 trillion, and the size of the balance sheet is normalized in April 2018, 
11 months earlier than under Alternative B. 
Across scenarios, the peak amount of rese rve balances and th e level of reserve 
balances outstanding at lifto ff are directly related to the magnitude of assumed asset 
purchases.  Under Alternative A, reserve bala nces peak at about $2.7 trillion, while under 
Alternative B, reserve balances peak at $2.2 trillion.  Under Alte rnative C, reserve 
balances rise only slightly from their curre nt level to $1.7 trillion.  For the scenarios 
corresponding to Alternatives B and A, reserve balances are $1.9 tr illion and $2.4 trillion, 
respectively, when the federal funds rate lifts off from its lower bound in October 2015.  
For the scenario corre sponding to Alternative C, reserve balances are $1.5 trillion when 
the federal funds rate lifts off fr om its lower bound in October 2014.   
In the scenario corresponding to Altern ative B, the monetary base increases 
substantially from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase program and the accompanying 
increase in reserve balances.  Once exit begi ns, the monetary base shrinks rapidly through 
the second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting a decline in reserve bala nces as securities 
are redeemed or sold.  Starting in the thir d quarter of 2019, after reserve balances are 
assumed to have stabilized at $25 billion, th e monetary base begins to expand again, in 
line with the growth of Federal Reserve notes  in circulation.  Under Alternative A, the 
monetary base increases from 2012 to 2014 as the level of reserve balances climbs in 
concert with the expansion of  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The base then 
contracts during the exit until after the si ze of the portfolio is normalized.  Under 
Alternative C, the monetary base increas es a bit from 2012 to 2013— rising with the 
delayed settlement of MBS purchases undertak en in 2012 as well as with the growth of 
currency—and then contracts, on net, until after the size of the portfolio is normalized.

  Implications  of Additional  Securities  Purchases                        
for the Exit Strategy  Principles  
Since the Committee described  its exit strategy principles  in June 2011, the SOMA 
portfolio and  its likely evolution,  along with the outlook for the economy  and 
interest rates, have changed  considerably.   The change  in reinvestment policy  
increased  the share of agency MBS in the portfolio,  the maturity  extension  
program lengthened  the average duration  of the portfolio,  the outright agency 
MBS purchases  have expanded  the size of the portfolio,  and the Committee’s  
extended  forward guidance language  has pushed out expectations  for the timing  
of the unwinding  of the highly accomodative stance  of monetary  policy.  If open‐
ended purchases  continue  into 2013, the portfolio will expand  further in size and 
duration.      
The balance sheet  projections  for Altern atives  A, B, and C take account of these 
changes in the portfolio as  well as the staff’s assumptions  regarding  the 
implementation  of the Commttee’s  exit strategy principles.1   In particular,  the 
projections  assume that sales of agency MBS proceed over five  years, starting six 
months after the first increase in  the target federal funds  rate.  Under 
Alternatives  B and C, such  sales are sufficient  to normalize  the size of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet over  three years  or less, consistent  with th e exit strategy 
principles.   However,  under Alternative  A, normalization  takes somewhat  
longer—about  three  and a half years.  It would be possible to normalize  the size 
of the balance sheet over  three years even in this case if the sales of agency MBS 
were conducted  over a shorter period.   However,  at some stage the size of the 
Federal Reserve’s portfolio will reach a point  where normalization  over three 
years will require  sales of agency securities  at a pace  that may be difficult to 
achieve without adverse  effects on market functioning.2  The June  2011 FOMC  
minutes noted that the Committee is  prepared  to make adjustments  to its exit 
strategy principles  in light of on economic  and financial developments.   Against 
this backdrop,  the Committee may  wish to revisit  these principles  if purchases  of 
longer‐term securities  continue  for long enough.  For example,  the Committee 
might want  to allow for somewhat  longer periods over which  to se ll agency 
securities  and normalize  the size of the balance sheet.    
                                                 
1 In the June 2011 FOMC minutes, the exit strategy principles  noted the anticipated  steps 
and sequence  of actions for the removal of policy accommodation  and the normalization  of 
the balance sheet.  These  were listed as: 
1. Cease reinvesting  some or all principal payments  on securities  holdings;  
2. Modify forward guidance  for the path of the federal  funds rate and initiate 
temporary  reserve‐draining operations;  
3. Raise the federal funds  target rate and adjust the interest  rate on excess 
reserves to move the federal funds rate toward the target  rate; 
4. Sell agency securities  gradually  and steadily over three to five years with the size 
of the portfolio expected  to normalize  over  two to three years. 
2 The effect of the pace of agency  MBS sales on market functioning  is discussed  in the 
memo by Board and FRBNY staff titled “The effect of an additional  $1 trillion LSAP on the exit 
strategy"  sent to the Committee  on August 28, 2012.

  The Committee could  also consider more substantial  changes to its exit strategy 
princples.  For  example,  the Committee  could consider  strategies  in which the 
portfolio is  normalized  by allowing  securities  to run off  without the use of sales, 
or by selling Treasury  securities  instead of or in addition to agency  securities,  or 
by selling securities  before raising the target for the federal funds  rate.  Such 
changes could materially  impact both the level of reserves  around the time of lift‐
off—and  so the extent  to which reserve draining tools may need to be 
employed—and  the path of income and remittances  to the Treasury.3 
 
                                                 
3 For example,  the staff memo on purchase  options distributed  prior to this meeting 
noted that  allowing  securities  to run off without sales  was consistent  with a higher path for 
Federal  Reserve income during exit as well  as greater remittances  to the Treasury but 
normalization  of the size of the balance sheet would be delayed by about  a year under  the 
options with larger purchases.

  DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY FORECASTS  
Domestic nonfinancial sector  debt is projected to expa nd at an annual rate of 4¾ 
percent in the fourth quart er of 2012, driven by signifi cant expansion in federal 
government debt and a modest rise in private nonfinancial debt.  For the remainder of the 
forecast period ending in 2015, we expect the ri se in domestic nonfinancial debt to slow 
to about a 3¾ percent pace, on average, as fe deral debt advances less rapidly and private 
debt accelerates only gradually.  Nonfinancial business debt is foreca st to increase at a 
moderate pace over the projection period, refl ecting favorable financing conditions and 
increasing capital expenditures.  The level of home mortgage debt is projected to bottom 
out in 2013 but only edge up thereafter, as financing conditions are expected to remain 
tight and a substantial amount of remaining negative home equity continues to damp debt 
growth.  Meanwhile, we project consumer cr edit to accelerate over most of the forecast 
period, from a growth rate of about 5½ percent in  the fourth quarter of this year to about 
7¼ percent in 2015, driven by continued strong demand for student loans and a pickup in 
spending on consumer durables. 
We anticipate commercial bank credit to increase at a moderate pace over the 
forecast period.  Core loans—the sum of comme rcial and industrial (C&I), real estate, 
and consumer loans—are projected to increase steadily.  C&I loans are expected to rise at 
a moderate rate over the forecast period, consis tent with the projected growth in business 
investment.  We expect growth in both reside ntial real estate and c onsumer loans to pick 
up gradually from their currently weak pace, reflecting improvements in borrowers’ 
credit quality and a further gradual easing of standards and terms on such loans.  We also 
anticipate residential real es tate lending to be supporte d by a pickup in residential 
investment.  Commercial real estate loans are projected to accelerate only very slowly 
over the next three years, as high vacancy rates, depressed prices for commercial 
properties, and the poor credit quality of existing loans are likely to continue to suppress 
activity in this sector.  Banks’ securities holdings are expected  to rise at a modest pace, 
with smaller increases over the forecast period than were posted in 2012, as deposit growth ebbs and demand for bank loans strengthens.

  We expect M2 to contract in the firs t quarter of 2013 following the expiration of 
the unlimited FDIC insurance on noninterest-be aring transaction deposits at year-end.19  
Subsequently, M2 is forecast to grow, but at a pace below that of nominal income, as the 
expected improvement in financial and economic conditions over the forecast horizon 
encourages investors to rea llocate their portfolios away from M2 assets and toward 
riskier investments.  M2 is projected to c ontract towards the end of 2015 in response to 
the liftoff in the federal funds rate and th e accompanying rise in the opportunity cost of 
holding money. 
These reallocations away from M2 assets  over the forecast period are expected to 
depress growth of liquid deposits—the larges t component of M2—relative to the rapid 
pace observed over recent years.  With respec t to the other components of M2, continuing 
a trend seen since the end of 2008, retail money funds and small time deposits are 
projected to contract until la te in the forecast period; with  interest rates expected to 
remain low, yields on these products are projected to offer only limited benefits relative 
to those on investment alternatives.  Currency growth is expected to moderate to a pace 
somewhat above that of nominal income a nd to continue at that pace through the 
projection period.

  DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued in Octo ber appears on the next page, followed by 
drafts for a December directiv e that correspond to each of the policy alternatives.   
The draft directives for all three Alternatives instruct the Desk to complete the 
MEP of $267 billion on schedule by the end of December 2012, and to continue 
purchasing longer-term Treasury securities after December (either by $50 billion per 
month in Alternative A, or by $45 billion pe r month in Alternative B).  All three 
directives also instruct the Desk to resu me, in January, rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  The dr aft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to continue 
purchasing additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month until the end 
of December 2012 and to raise the flow of pur chases to $50 billion beginning in January 
2013; it does not specify an e nd-date for these purchases.   The draft directive for

A. Policy Rules Used in “M onetary Policy Strategies” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies.”  In the table,  ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, while the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( gap t and gap t+1|t), and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective, denoted π*, is 2 percent.  The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
݊ݕ௧ (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ݊ݕ௧כ( 100 times the log of 
potential nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to potential real GDP in 
that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in th at quarter; subsequently, target nominal GDP 
grows 2 percentage points per year faster than potential GDP. 
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured promin ently in recent analysis by Board staff.1  The outcome-
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q12006:Q4.  The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run, quarterly real interest rate of 
2¼ percent, a value used in the FRB/US model.  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, 
and the long-run intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set at 2¼ percent—instead of 
Taylor’s original value of 2 percent—for the same reason.  The 2¼ percent real rate estimate also 
enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income  targeting rule.  The prescriptions of the first

Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the 
estimated outcome-based rule, and the nominal in come targeting rule include the lagged policy 
rate as a right-hand-side variable.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook” report rule prescrip tions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff 
outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far this quarter.

B. Estimates of the Equilib rium and Actual Real Rates 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using the projection for the economy of 
FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends 
on a very broad array of economic factors, some of  which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  The estimate reported is the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, 
which is generated after the path s of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so 
that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date.

C. FRB/US Model Simulations 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

  D. Long-Run Projections of the Ba lance Sheet and Monetary Base 
This explanatory note presents the assumptions  underlying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Long-Run Projections of the Bala nce Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as 
projections for each major component of the balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from November 
2012 to December 2025.  The few balance sheet ite ms that are not discussed below are assumed 
to be constant over the projection period at the level observed on October 31, 2012.  The 
projections for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the 
tables that follow the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenarios corresponding to Alternatives B and A 
assume that the target federal funds rate begins to  increase in October 2015.  This date of liftoff is 
consistent with the current staff economic forecast  but is two months later than assumed in the 
balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the October Tealbook.  The projection for the 
scenario corresponding to Alternative C assumes the target federal funds rate lifts off in October 
2014, consistent with the draft statem ent language “at least through [late 2014  | mid-2014  | late 
2013 ]” and a year earlier than in Alternative B.  In each case, the balance sheet projections 
assume that no use of short-term draining tools is  necessary to achieve the projected path for the 
target federal funds rate.1 
  
                                                 
1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreements were used to drain reserves prior to raising the 
federal funds rate, the composition of liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse 
repurchase agreements would be matched by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, 
these draining tools would be wound down as the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so 
that the projected paths for Treasury securities presented here remain valid.

  ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B  are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue it s current purchases of MBS through the end 
of the year, when the MEP concludes, and then continue MBS purchases and 
additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities through June 2013.  Purchases of Treasury securities will continue at a pace of $45 billion per month and purchases of MBS will continue at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The Treasury securities purchased after the conclusion of the MEP are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years, roughly equal to the net duration of purchases and sales under the MEP.  The purchases between October 2012 and June 2013 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by $763 billion.   
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS.  
o Starting in April 2015—six months prior to  the assumed increase in the target federal 
funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency  MBS and agency debt securities in April 
2016, six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the target federal 
funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by March 2021. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections from the Tealbook.
2  The 
projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A,  the Committee is assumed to continue its 
current purchases of MBS through the end of the year, when the MEP concludes, and 
then continue MBS purchases and additional purchases of longer-term Treasury securities 
through December 2013.  From January th rough June 2013, the pace of purchases of 
Treasury securities and MBS will be $50 billi on per month each.  After June 2013, the 
pace of purchases slows, and purchases end in  December 2013.  The Treasury securities 
purchased after the conclusion of the MEP are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by $1.25 trillion between October 2012  and December 2013.  In addition, the 
Committee is assumed to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  In April 2015, six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate in October 2015,

  principal payments from all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  Sales of 
agency securities begin in April 2016 and continue for five years. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternativ e C, the Committee is assumed to purchase 
MBS only through the end of this year; no additional asset purchases are assumed.  The 
FOMC continues to reinvest the proceeds  from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS until April 2014—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate under th is alternative.  Starting in April 2014, all 
securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency MBS and agency  debt securities in April 2015.  Holdings 
of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by March 2020.    
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which these securities are 
purchased will generally exceed their face va lue, with a larger premium for longer-
maturity securities.  As a result, in Alternatives B and A, premiums are boosted by roughly $33 billion and $41 billion, respectively, by the time asset purchases end.  In Alternative C, premiums will increase $5 billion.  The increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.   
 The asset purchases under all three alternatives put downward pressure on market interest 
rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.   
 The current and near-term market value of agency MBS is assumed to be four percent above face value.  As a result, for Alternatives B, A, and C, the $360 billion, $620 billion, 
and $120 billion of agency MBS purchases, respectively, will cause unamortized 
premiums on the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet to rise by roughly $14 billion, $25 
billion, and $5 billion, respectively, relativ e to a scenario without these MBS purchases.  
The increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances. 
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is assumed to decline, as draws under the recent 
foreign central bank swap auctions mature; it is  assumed to return to zero in early 2013.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  
Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.

   The assets held by TALF LLC remain at about  $1 billion through 2014  before declining 
to zero the following year.  Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of 
commitment fees collected by the LLC and the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  In this projection, the LLC is assumed to not purch ase any asset-backed securities.  (It would 
have to make such purchases if an asset-backed security were received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with  a decision of a borrower not to repay a 
TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero in 2016.   
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 
currency through 2015.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) is assumed to be around $70 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international 
accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that 
point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion. The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast 
period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
3 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
                                                 
3 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date  of normalization of the size of the balance sheet 
and the size of the SO MA portfolio.  Growth in Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two 
years; however, even if Federal Reserve capital were assumed to be constant, normalization only would be 
pushed later by about a quarter.

  to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  In Alternative A, a small deferred asset—peaking at about $4 billion in 
2018—is recorded on the balance sheet at year-end in 2017, 2018 and 2019.4   
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS5 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note 
is negative 113 basis points in the current quarter.  The effect wanes over time as the 
length of time the securities will be held by the Federal Reserve shortens and as securities 
subsequently roll off the portfolio or are sold until the size of the portfolio is normalized. 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous te rm premium effect is negative 113 basis 
points.  This estimate is the same as in Alte rnative A and reflects the fact that market 
participants are expecting an asset purchase pr ogram more in line with Alternative A.  
Over the first half of next year, as market participants come to realize that the purchases will end in June, the term premium effect  converges to one associated with the $750 
billion purchase program.  Over the remainder of the projection period, the term premium effect declines slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated normalization of the portfolio.    
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 69 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because there are no additional securities purchases in 
2013 and the liftoff date is earlier so asse t sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B 
and A. 
 
 
 
                                                 
4 In our projections, Federal Reserve capital is much larger than the peak value of the deferred 
asset. 
5 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the
