Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from six policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013.  (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of the rules are 
discussed later.)  As shown in the left-h and columns, all but two of the near-term 
prescriptions keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound through the second quarter of 2013.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which puts relatively little weight on the output 
gap, prescribes an average federal funds rate  of about 110 basis points in the first two 
quarters of 2013.  The first-difference rule, which responds to the three-quarter-ahead 
change in the output gap, prescribes an averag e federal funds rate of 40 basis points in the 
first two quarters of 2013.
1 
The right-hand columns display the rule pres criptions that arise in the absence of 
the lower-bound constraint.  The inertial Tayl or (1999) rule and th e outcome-based rule 
prescribe federal funds rates that  are near zero for the next two quarters, while the Taylor 
(1999) rule and the nominal in come targeting rule prescr ibe negative values for the 
federal funds rate.  The more-accommodative pr escriptions arising from the latter two 
rules reflect the stronger immedi ate response of the rules to the staff’s estimate of the 
output gap, which remains appreciably negative.2 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key  Elements of the Staff Projection.”  As 
described in Book A of the Tealbook, the estim ated path of the output gap is on average 
about 35 basis points narrower than in the December Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s new 
assumptions of higher equity pr ices and a less-restrictive fisc al policy as well as modest 
                                                 
1 As noted in Book A of the Tealbook, the staff has revised down the long-run value of the real 
funds rate from 2¼ percent to 2 percent, reflecting its assessment that the long-run growth of the economy 
is  2¼ percent compared to its previous estimate of 2½  percent.  The intercepts of the different policy rules 
have been adjusted to reflect this change, both for the current and the previous Tealbook simulations.  
2 Although the rule prescriptions are not constrained to be at or above the lower bound, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nomina l income targeting rule, and the first-difference rule 
all include and place substantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate, which is subject to the lower-
bound constraint.

Note: Since the previous Tealbook, the staff has revised down the long-run value of the real funds rate from 2.25 percent to 2 percent. The intercepts 
of the different policy rules have been adjusted to reflect this change, both for the current and previous Tealbook simulations. Estimates of r* may 
change at the beginning of a quarter even when the staff outlook is unchanged because the twelve-quarter horizon covered by the calculation has rolled 
forward one quarter. Therefore, whenever the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the memo includes a third column labeled "Current Quarter Estimate as of Previous Tealbook."

   downward revisions to potent ial output.  Compared to the December Tealbook, the staff 
now projects slightly lower core inflation in 2013 but essentially the same gradual 
convergence to 2 percent inflation over the subsequent years.  With an improved outlook 
for economic activity and an essentially unc hanged outlook for infl ation, the near-term 
federal funds rate prescriptions from the unconstrained rules have increased slightly 
compared to those in the December Tealbook.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US model when conditioned on the staff’s 
outlook for the economy.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained, would return output to  potential in twelve quarters.  Consistent 
with the staff’s revised assessment of the output gap, the r* estimate for the current 
quarter is about 20 basis points higher than  in the December Tealbook.  As in previous 
rounds, the estimate of r*—currently about  ¾percent— remains below the estimated 
actual real federal funds rate of about 1¼ percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations using the FRB/US model that incorporate the endogenous responses 
of inflation and the output gap to the paths of the federal funds rate prescribed by the 
different policy rules under th e assumption that the funds rate is constrained by the 
effective lower bound.  The model is adjusted to match the staff’s baseline outlook for the 
economy and then simulated using the different policy rules.  Each rule is implemented 
from the first quarter of 2013 onward, under th e assumption that private agents fully 
understand and anticipate the imp lications for future real ac tivity, inflation, and interest 
rates of following the rule instead of the baseline policy.3  The exhibit also displays the 
implications of the Tealbook baseline policy, which keeps the federal funds rate at its 
effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as lo ng as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 
percent and projected inflation between one and two years ahead is  less than 2.5 percent; 
once either of these thresholds  is crossed, the federal funds rate follows the prescription 
                                                 
3 The staff’s baseline forecast inco rporates the effects of the larg e-scale asset purchase programs 
that the FOMC has undertaken in recent years, as well as the modifications to the Federal Reserve’s 
reinvestment policies that were announced in Septem ber 2011.  The staff baseline also assumes that the 
FOMC will purchase an additional $500 billion in long-term Treasury securities and MBS during the first 
half of 2013, and incorporates some “disappointment” on the part of financial market participants as they gradually come to recognize that, contrary to what th ey currently appear to expect, the program will not be 
continued beyond this point.  Based on these assumptions, the policy rule simulations incorporate the 
baseline effects of these balance sheet policies; the rule s themselves are not directly  adjusted for the effects 
of balance sheet policies.

   of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.4  In contrast to the po licy assumption underlying the 
Tealbook baseline projecti on, the simulations of the differe nt policy rules shown in the 
exhibit do not impose the thresholds that  the Committee adopted in December 2012.  
(Alternative policy rule simulations augmente d with thresholds are discussed later.)  
In the Tealbook baseline, th e federal funds rate depart s from the effective lower 
bound in the fourth quarter of 2015, as in the December Tealbook.  Subsequently, the 
federal funds rate increases to 3 pe rcent by the beginning of 2018, and reaches 
3½ percent at the end of the decade.  The une mployment rate declines below its threshold 
value of 6.5 percent in the f ourth quarter of 2015 and is e xpected to converge to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment by 2017.5  Headline inflation is 
projected to rise gradually over time a nd then level off at 2 percent by 2018.   
Without thresholds, the different policy rules all call for tightening to begin 
appreciably earlier than in the Tealbook baseline.  As a result , most of the rules cause the 
real federal funds rate to be pe rsistently higher than in the baseline forecast, thereby 
resulting in higher unemployment and lower in flation through most of the decade.  The 
exception to this pattern is the nominal in come targeting rule.  Because this policy 
implicitly seeks to push inflation modestly above 2 percent later in the decade, it 
generates expectations of higher future infl ation that, due to the forward-looking nature 
of wage and price setting, lead  to a higher path for inflati on in both the near term and 
later in the decade, and therefor e a persistently lower path for the real federal funds rate 
than in the Tealbook baseline.6  This more accommodative stance of monetary policy 
stimulates real activity and generates a notic eably more rapid decline in unemployment 
                                                 
4 The use of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule with thresholds as the baseline rule represents a change 
from the October and December Tealbooks, which used the outcome-based rule augmented with intercept 
adjustments designed to be consistent with the date -based forward guidance in the Committee’s October 
statement and the economic outlook as it stood at the tim e.  The adjustments had the effect of delaying the 
onset of tightening until after mid-2015; in addition, they caused the subsequent rise in the federal funds 
rate to be more gradual than what the outcome-based rule without adjustments would have prescribed.  This round’s changes in the baseline rule do not substantially  affect the Tealbook projec tions, in part because the 
inertial Taylor rule closely replicates the gradual rise in  the funds rate after liftoff that was incorporated into 
the staff’s October and December projections.  
5 The staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment declines from about 6 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 5¼ percent by the en d of 2017.  It is assumed to remain at this level 
thereafter. 
6 As described in the Explanatory Notes, the nominal income targeting rule responds to the 
nominal income gap defined as the difference between nominal GDP and target nominal GDP.  For the rule simulated here, target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to potential real GDP in 2007:Q4 times the 
GDP deflator in that quarter; subseq uently, target nominal GDP grows at a rate that is 2 percentage points 
above that of poten tial real GDP.

   than in the Tealbook baseline.  As with the other policy rules, the prescriptions of the 
nominal income targeting rule are conditio nal on the public recognizing that monetary 
policy will adhere to the rule in  the future.  This assumption is particularly important for 
the nominal income targeting rule because it  yields inflation above the 2 percent goal 
even after the output gap is closed. 
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which policy rules are subj ect to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.  For each of the ru les, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and projected inflation between one and two 
years ahead is less than 2.5 percent.  In each  of the simulations discussed below, crossing 
the unemployment threshold is the catalyst for switching to the specified rule.  The 
private sector is assumed to understand the change in policy when a threshold condition 
is crossed and to view it as permanent and fully credible.  
The simulations with thresholds bring out several important properties of the 
rules.  First, because all of  the policy rules without thresholds shown in the previous 
exhibit imply a departure of the federal funds  rate from the effective lower bound before 
either threshold is crossed, imposing thresholds uniformly leads to a more-accomodative policy.  The imposition of thresholds alters  economic outcomes least for the nominal 
income targeting rule because this rule prescribes the most accommodative policy when 
no thresholds are imposed.  Second, the conduct of policy after the threshold is crossed 
exerts a major influence on the effective stimulus provided by the threshold strategy.  In 
particular, post-crossing policy rules that entail a more gradual increase in the federal 
funds rate imply a more rapid decline in  unemployment along with higher inflation, 
resulting in an earlier crossing of the thresholds and an earlier departure of the federal 
funds rate from the effective lower bound.  Third, the effectiveness of threshold-
augmented rules depends critically on th e ability of policymakers to commit to a 
particular rule after a threshold is crossed and the assumption of model-consistent 
expectations. 
An illustration of the effect  of the degree of inertia embodied in a policy rule on 
the amount of stimulus provided by the addition of thresholds is provided by simulations 
employing either the Taylor (1993) rule or th e Taylor (1999) rule once the unemployment 
threshold is crossed.  Because these rules are not subject to interest-rate inertia, they

   prescribe a rapid post-threshold tightening of monetary policy.7  As a result, real activity 
remains noticeably weaker and inflation lower than in the Tealbook baseline, which 
employs the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  Indee d, this effect is larg e enough to push back 
the onset of tightening relative to the base line.  Even with the rapid post-threshold 
tightening, however, a close comparison of this exhibit with the previous one reveals that 
augmenting the Taylor (1993) rule and the Tayl or (1999) rule with thresholds modestly 
improves macroeconomic outcomes.  
In contrast, consider a case in which policy follows either the nominal income 
targeting rule or the first-difference rule on ce one of the thresholds is crossed.  Because 
both of these rules are strongl y inertial, they prescribe a more gradual increase in the 
federal funds rate and implicitly push inflat ion modestly above 2 pe rcent later on in the 
decade.  This more accommodative post-threshold stance of policy produces favorable expectational effects similar to those disc ussed in the previous exhibit for nominal 
income targeting in the absence of threshol ds.  Due to the forward-looking nature of 
wage and price setting, expecta tions of higher future infla tion lead to higher current 
inflation and a lower path for the real federal funds rate before as well as after the 
unemployment threshold is crosse d.  The resulting boost in real  activity is reflected in a 
more rapid decline in the unemployment rate than in the Tealbook baseline, thus 
precipitating an earlier departure of the federal funds rate from the effective lower 
bound.

The fourth exhibit, “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares optimal control simulations derive d for this Tealbook with those shown in 
                                                 
7 The outcome-based rule prescribes a relatively rapid increase in the federal funds rate after the 
thresholds are crossed. The non-inertial behavior of th is rule primarily reflects the responsiveness of its 
prescriptions to changes in the output gap.  The outcome-based rule discussed here does not include any of 
the intercept adjustments that were applied to the rule to derive the staff’s baseline policy in the October and December Tealbooks; these October/December adjustments both delayed the onset of tightening until 
late 2015 and appreciably slowed the pace of tighten ing thereafter relative to wh at the unadjusted rule 
would have prescribed.  As a result, the unadjusted ou tcome-based rule leads to a more rapid increase in the 
federal funds rate once the threshold is reached than in the staff’s previous baseline projections.   
8 The effects of imposing thresholds are most pronounced in the case of the first-difference rule.  
Without thresholds, the economic outlook under this rule is no ticeably worse than in the Tealbook baseline, 
while with thresholds the outlook is noticeably better.  This improvement occurs in large part because the 
first-difference rule is more inertial than the other rules and does not respond to the level of economic 
slack.

   December.9  In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on 
keeping headline PCE inflation close to th e Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing cha nges in the federal funds rate.  
The simulations indicate that, with the fe deral funds rate constrained to remain 
positive, the optimal control path for the fe deral funds rate does not rise above the 
effective lower bound until the fourth quarter of 2015, one quarter earlier than in the 
optimal control exercise shown in the Decem ber Tealbook.  The optimal path is revised 
upward beyond 2015 as well, reflecting the narr ower output gap in the staff projection.10 
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal c ontrol policy promotes a faster pace of 
economic recovery while still keeping inflation well within a half per centage point of the 
Committee’s goal of 2 percent.  As a result, the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent in the second quarter of 2015 and falls to 5.9 per cent by the time of liftoff at the 
end of 2015; it then declines to 4.9 percen t by the end of 2017, temporarily undershooting 
the staff’s long-term estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  Inflation initially 
exhibits a decline similar to that in the Teal book baseline, but it then increases to near the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective by mid-2016.  Thereafter, inflation overshoots the 2 
percent target by 20 to 30 basis points before  gradually moving back toward 2 percent.  
The more-rapid convergence to the Committee’s assumed objectives than in the Tealbook 
baseline, and the subsequent persistent overshooting, occur because policymakers 
respond to the lower bound constraint by comm itting to a less-than-normally aggressive 
response to inflation for an extended period of  time.  As this policy is assumed to be 
completely credible, it boosts inflation expectations and reduces real interest rates in the 
short and medium run. 
                                                 
9 The optimal policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described above. 
10 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

   In the absence of the lower-bound constraint , the optimal federal funds rate would 
gradually decline to about ½percent by the end of 2013 and return to positive territory 
in the second quarter of 2015.  Under this optimal unconstrained policy, the 
unemployment rate would decline more ra pidly than under the optimal constrained 
policy.   Inflation would increase to 2 pe rcent by the beginning of 2016, a pattern much 
like that in the constrained simulation.  In subsequent years, inflation would slightly 
exceed the 2 percent objective, but by somewhat less than in the constrained case. 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under A lternative Policies without Thresholds” 
and “Outcomes under Alternativ e Policies with Thresholds,” tabulate the simulation 
results for key variables under each policy ru le discussed above, with and without 
thresholds.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Alternative B would continue purchases of agency-backed 
MBS and longer-term Treasury securities at  the monthly rates that the Committee 
specified in its December statement.  Altern ative A would increase th e pace of securities 
purchases to $100 billion per month.  In c ontrast, Alternative C would substantially 
reduce the pace of purchases; it also would i ndicate that the Committee expects to reduce 
the pace of purchases further in coming months  if the economy develops as anticipated.  
Alternatives A and B would repeat the “stopp ing condition” that the FOMC first used in 
its September statement:  The Committee will continue its securities purchases until a 
substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market is achieved in a context of 
price stability.  Alternative C would state th at the Committee expects to end purchases by 
midyear.  All three alternatives would mainta in the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate and retain threshold-based forward guidance for the funds rate (but all 
would drop the December language that said the Committee viewed the thresholds as 
consistent with its earlier date-based guida nce).  Alternatives B and C would keep the 
unemployment threshold at 6½ percent, as in December, while Alternative A would 
lower that threshold to 5½ percent.  All of  the alternatives would retain the 2½ percent 
threshold for projected inflation be tween one and two years ahead.   
In summarizing recent economic developm ents, all of the alternatives begin by 
noting that growth in economic activity slowed  in recent months.  Alternatives A and B 
attribute the slowing “in large part” to tr ansitory factors; Alternative C implicitly 
attributes all of the slowing to transitory factors.  Alternatives  A and B observe that 
employment continued to expand at a moderate pace, but that the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Alternative C acknowledges that the unemployment rate is still 
elevated, but emphasizes its substantial de cline during the past year.  All of the 
alternatives indicate  that household spending and business fixed investment advanced; 
the three draft statements al so note “further improvement” in the housing sector (rather 
than “further signs of improvement” as in th e Committee’s previous statement).  Each of 
the alternatives states, as in December, that  inflation “has been running somewhat below 
the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect 
fluctuations in energy prices.”  In addition, each alternative reiter ates that longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable.  In each alternative, the main message of the 
Alternatives

  first paragraph is that the Committee is not alarmed by the fourth quarter’s sluggish 
output growth, or by the evidence that headline inflation ran well below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, because it views those outcomes as the re sult of short-lived factors. 
The second paragraphs of Alternatives B and C reinforce this message by stating 
the Committee’s expectation that economic growth “will proceed at a moderate pace” (in 
Alternative B) or “will retu rn to a moderate pace” (in Alternative C), and that the 
unemployment rate will decline toward levels judged consistent with the dual mandate.  
Alternative B conditions that projection on “sufficient policy accommodation” while 
Alternative C implies that the Committee e xpects the recovery to be strong enough to 
warrant reducing the pace of asset purchases.  Alternative A adopts a more tentative tone, 
stating that “the Committee judges that , without additional policy accommodation, 
economic growth likely would not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement 
in labor market conditions.”  In response to the improved situ ation in European financial 
markets, Alternatives B and C note some easi ng of strains in global financial markets; 
Alternative C also points to  a reduction in downside risks to the outlook, while 
Alternative B indicates they remain significant.   In contrast, Alternative A not only says 
that downside risks remain signif icant, it adds a reference to risks from “unresolved fiscal 
issues.”  (Alternative B offers the option of ci ting risks from unresolved fiscal issues.)  
With respect to inflation, Alternative B repeats the word s of the December statement:  
“The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or 
below its 2 percent objective.”  In contrast , Alternative A indicates that medium-term 
inflation likely will be “somewhat below” it s 2 percent objective while Alternative C says 
that inflation likely will run “close to” its  2 percent objective over the medium term. 
The following table summarizes key elements of the alternative statements.  As 
always, the Committee could ble nd elements of the three draf t statements, or substitute 
other language, to construct it s desired statement.  The summary table is followed by the 
complete drafts of the three statements and then by arguments for each alternative.

Outlook The Committee remains 
concerned that, without 
sufficient policy 
accommodation, growth 
might not be strong 
enough to generate 
sustained improvement in 
labor market conditions. The Committee 
judges that, 
without additional 
policy 
accommodation, 
growth likely 
would not be 
strong enough to 
generate . . . The Committee expects 
that, with sufficient 
policy accommodation, 
growth will proceed at a 
moderate pace and the 
unemployment rate will 
gradually decline toward 
levels consistent with its 
dual mandate. The Committee expects that 
growth will return to a 
moderate pace and that the 
unemployment rate will 
decline toward levels the 
Committee judges consistent 
with its dual mandate.

term likely will run at or

Guidance If the outlook for the 
labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue 
its purchases of 
securities, and employ its 
other policy tools as 
appropriate, until such 
improvement is achieved 
in a context of price 
stability. Unchanged If the economy develops as 
anticipated, the Committee 
expects to further reduce the 
pace of its asset purchases in 
coming months and to bring 
them to an end by midyear.  
However, if the labor market 
does not improve as 
expected or if inflation is 
projected to be appreciably 
below 2 percent, the 
Committee is prepared to 
maintain or increase the pace 
of purchases of longer-term 
securities, and employ other 
policy tools as appropriate. 
In determining the size, pace, and composition of purchases, the Committee will, as always, take 
appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

Target 0 to ¼ percent 
Guidance . . . the Committee expects that a highly accommodative policy will remain appropriate for a considerable 
time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.

ahead is projected to be no more than ½ percenta ge point above the 2 percent longer-run goal, and  
longer-term inflation expectations continue to be we ll anchored; will also consider other information;

  DECEMBER FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October 
suggests that economic activity and employ ment have continued to expand at a 
moderate pace in recent months, apart fr om weather-related disruptions.  Although 
the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated.  
Household spending has continued to adva nce, and the housing sector has shown 
further signs of improvement, but growth in  business fixed investment has slowed.  
Inflation has been running somewhat be low the Committee’s longer-run objective, 
apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctu ations in energy prices.  
Longer-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Co mmittee remains concerned that, without 
sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to 
generate sustained improvement in labor ma rket conditions.  Furthermore, strains in 
global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that  inflation over the medium term likely 
will run at or below its 2 percent objective. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue 
purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed  securities at a pace of $40 billion per 
month.  The Committee also will purchase l onger-term Treasury securities after its 
program to extend the average maturity of  its holdings of Treasury securities is 
completed at the end of the year, initially at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and, in January, will resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest ra tes, support mortgage markets, and help 
to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a contex t of price stability.  In determining the 
size, pace, and composition of its asset purch ases, the Committee will, as always, take 
appropriate account of the likely effi cacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appr opriate at least as

  long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, infla tion between one and 
two years ahead is projected to be no more  than a half percen tage point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations 
continue to be well anchored.  The Committ ee views these thresholds as consistent 
with its earlier date-based guidance.  In  determining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment a nd inflation of 2 percent.

inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

  JANUARY FOMC  STATEMENT —A LTERNATIVE C 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October  
December  suggests  indicates  that growth in  economic activity and emplo yment 
have continued to expand at a moderate pace  slowed  in recent months, apart from 
because of  weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors .  Although the 
unemployment rate remains elevated, it  has declined somewhat since the summer, it 
remai ns elevated  substantially during the past year .  Household spending has 
continued to  and business fixed investment  advanced , and the housing sector has 
shown further signs of  improvement, but growth in business fixed investment has 
slowed .  Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective, apart from temporary variations that largely re flect fluctuations in energy 
prices.  Longer-term inflation exp ectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Co mmittee remains concerned that, without 
sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to 
generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.   The Committee expects 
that economic growth will return to a moderate pace and that the unemployment 
rate w ill decline toward levels the Co mmittee judges consistent with its dual 
mandate.   Furthermore, strains in global fi nancial markets continue to pose 
signific ant and the associated  downside risks to the economic outlook appear to 
have diminished .  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium 
term likely will run at or below  close to  its 2 percent objective.   
3. In light of the outlook for labor ma rkets and inflation, and its current 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of further asset purchases, the 
Committee decided to reduce the pace of its asset purchases.  In particular,  To 
support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure tha t inflation, over time, is at 
the rate most consistent with its dual mandate , the Committee will continue 
purchasing  purchase  additional agency mortgage-backed  securities at a pace of $40  
$20 billion per month and The Committee also will purchase  longer-term Treasury 
securities after its program to extend the average maturity  of its holdings of Treasury 
securities is completed at the end of the year, initially  at a pace of $45  $25 billion per 
month. The Committee is maintaining  its existing policy of  will continue to  
reinvesting  principal payments from its holdi ngs of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mo rtgage-backed securities and, in January, 
will resume  to rolling  over maturing Treasury securities  at auction.  Taken together, 
these actions will increase the Committee’s  holdings of longer-term securities and  
should maintain downward pressure on longer- term interest rates, support mortgage 
markets, and help to make  keep  broader financial conditions more  accommodative.

  4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If the economy develops as anticipated, the 
Committee expects to further reduce the pa ce of its asset purchases in coming 
months and to bring them to an end by midyear.  However,  if the outlook for  the 
labor market does not improve substantially  as ex pected or if inflation is projected 
to be appreciably below 2 percent , the Comm ittee will continue  is prepared to 
maintain or increase the pace of  its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage -
backed  longer-term  securities, and employ its other policy tools as ap propriate, until 
such improvement is achieved in  a context of price stability .  In determining the size, 
pace, and composition of its asset purchase s, the Committee will, as always, take 
appropriate account of the likely effi cacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appr opriate at least as 
long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, infla tion between one and 
two years ahead is projected to be no more  than a half percen tage point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  The Committ ee views these thresholds as consistent 
with its earlier date -based guidance.   In determining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Although output growth appears to have slowed substantia lly in the fourth quarter 
of 2012, the drop seems to have been caused la rgely or entirely by tr ansitory factors:  
sizable reductions in federal purchases,  inventory investment, and exports; plus 
disruptions to production in the aftermath of  Hurricane Sandy.  In contrast, the growth 
rate of private domestic final purchases (the  sum of personal consumption expenditures, 
business fixed investment, and residential i nvestment) apparently increased during the 
fourth quarter, reflecting double-digit growth  in business fixed i nvestment, residential 
investment, and consumer spending on durable goods (particularly mo tor vehicles).  The 
slowdown in output growth was not reflected in job growth to any substantial extent; total 
payrolls expanded at a pace of about 150,000 per month during the fourth quarter—only 
a bit below the third quarter pace—and growth  of private payrolls actually stepped up 
from the third quarter to the fourth.  Even so, the unemployment rate flattened out at 7.8 
percent during the fourth quarter, a level well above participants’ estimates of the longer-
run normal rate of unemployment.  Moreover,  policymakers may see other indicators of 
labor market conditions, including the fracti on of employees who are working part-time 
for economic reasons and the still very hi gh level of long-duration unemployment, as 
indicating that there is substa ntial slack in labor markets.  At the same time, underlying 
inflation appears to be running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective:  While the recent monthly readings on headlin e consumer price inflation were negative, 
the drop reflected declines in energy prices ; the inflation rate for non-energy goods and 
services and its 12-month moving average re mained positive but well below 2 percent.
1 
In light of the available information, the Committee might anticipate that the 
factors that generated sluggish output growth last quarter will not persist into this year.  
Moreover, policymakers might see the recent in dicators and the passage of the American 
Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) as suggesting no more than modest changes in the medium-
term outlook for economic activity relative to the outlook at the time of the December 
FOMC meeting, and hence may again conclude th at economic activity is likely to grow at 
a moderate rate consistent with a gra dual convergence to maximum employment over 
time if the Committee continues to implement the balance sheet and interest rate policies 
that it announced in December.  At the same time, the Committee might judge that there 
are still substantial downside risks to the economic outlook, both because the ATRA left 
                                                 
1 Similarly, core and trimmed m ean PCE inflation, and their 12-month moving averages, remained 
positive but well under 2 percent.

  a number of important fiscal policy issues unresolved and because financial strains in 
Europe, though currently off the front page, have not been fully addressed.  Policymakers 
also might observe that market-based indica tors of longer-term in flation expectations 
were essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period and remain near the middle of 
the range observed in recent years.  Accord ingly, participants may judge that inflation 
expectations remain well anchored.  If so, the Committee might conclude that continuing 
the recent pace of asset purchases for the time being, keeping the federal funds rate at its 
current low level, and maintaining the recently introduced threshold-based forward 
guidance for the funds rate, as in Alternative B, are all appropriate steps to promote 
substantial improvement in labor market cond itions and to help ensure that inflation 
converges to 2 percent over time. 
Some policymakers might see a still-more-accommodative policy stance as both 
warranted and necessary to generate a s ubstantial improvement in labor market 
conditions over time; they may judge that the benefits of a larger and longer-lasting flow 
of asset purchases that results in a considerable further expansion of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings  would be likely to outwei gh any costs.  Some other 
policymakers may read the economy’s resilience in the face of shocks during 2012 as 
evidence that the recovery has become self -sustaining, and anticip ate that growth in 
output and employment will increase over time even with a reduction in the pace of asset 
purchases.  Moreover, some participants ma y doubt that additional asset purchases would 
have an appreciable effect on the real economy, and think that the costs and risks 
associated with a sizable further expansion of the Committee’s secu rities holdings would 
be likely to outweigh the benef its.  All of these participants  may nevertheless agree that 
the Committee will have more information, at  the time of its March meeting, about the 
extent to which economic activity will rebound fr om its fourth quarter deceleration.  They 
also may agree that the Committee will have  a better understanding of the costs and 
benefits of large-scale asset purchases af ter completing the assessment of efficacy and 
costs that it will undertake during its March m eeting, and therefore will be in a better 
position to convey its thinking about the like ly path of future asset purchases.  
Accordingly, policymakers may consider it appropriate to announce that the Committee 
will continue asset purchases at their current pace while remaining alert for signs that the 
balance between the costs and benefits of asset purchases might be shifting. 
With respect to the forward guidanc e for the federal funds rate, even 
policymakers who are skeptical that quantitative thresholds enha nce the clarity and

  transparency of the Committee’s policy co mmunications may agree that it would be 
inappropriate to change or drop the thres hold language so soon after adopting it.  
However, the December statement included a transitional sentence saying that the 
Committee saw the thresholds as consistent with  its earlier date-based  guidance; the draft 
alternatives for this meeting drop that sentence  in order to allow the thresholds to guide 
market expectations regard ing the time of liftoff. 
The Desk’s latest survey of primary dealer s indicates that most dealers expect the 
flow-based asset purchases to end in the fourth quarter of 2013 or first quarter of 2014; as 
before, only a few dealers expect purchases to end before the fourth quarter of this year 
and no dealer expects purchases to end by midyear.  The median dealer expects the 
Committee to continue purchasing agency-b acked MBS at a pace of $40 billion per 
month and longer-term Treasury securities at  a pace of $45 billion per month until the 
end of this year—implying a $1 trillion incr ease in the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings during 2013.  The median dealer also  expects the Committee to acquire another 
$60 billion of longer-term Treas ury securities, but no additio nal MBS, during the first 
quarter of 2014.  The survey shows no significa nt change in the expected path of the 
federal funds rate or in the most likely date of liftoff.  Thus, a statement along the lines of 
Alternative B would not surprise  market participants and seem s likely to generate little 
market reaction; it also would be unlikely to  alter market particip ants’ views on the likely 
pace or cumulative amount of future asset purchases.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
In light of the tax increases in the ATRA and the cuts in federal spending that are 
likely to come in the next few months—either  from sequestration or from future action by 
the Congress, some policymakers may see the medium-term outlook as weak enough, or 
the downside risks as large enough, to warra nt announcing further policy accommodation 
immediately, as in Alternative A.  With the unemployment rate well above their estimates 
of its longer-run normal level, long-duration unemployment still quite elevated, and trend inflation running below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, these participants may 
judge that the amount of policy accommodation provided by the Committee’s recent 
decisions regarding flow-based asset purchases  and quantitative thresh olds is unlikely to 
be sufficient to generate sa tisfactory progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  Moreove r, they may see the increases in longer-
term interest rates since the December FOMC meeting as counte rproductive, given that it 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

  does not appear to reflect an improvement in the modal economic outlook, and so may 
want to push back against the rise in rates.   
Though they may agree that there has b een some reduction in downside risks 
originating from the euro area in recent mont hs, some policymakers may continue to see 
risks from unresolved fiscal issues in the United States and judge that the risks to the 
economic outlook are still heavily weighted to the downside.  With the economy still well 
below maximum employment, inflation below target, and short-term inte rest rates at their 
effective lower bound, some participants might  judge that the consequences of a new 
adverse shock would be significantly more co stly than the consequences of providing 
more policy accommodation to spur faster growth and return inflation toward 2 percent 
and then discovering that economic growth or in flation rise more than expected.  If so, 
they may see the degree of uncertainty about  the outlook and the asymmetry in risks and 
potential costs as arguing for a furthe r increase in policy accommodation.   
If they hold these views, participants might favor Alternative A.  Specifically, 
they might see increasing the pace of a sset purchases to $100 billion per month 
(specifically, to $45 billion per month of agency MBS and $55 billion per month of 
longer-term Treasury securities ) as appropriate to promot e a more rapid decline in 
unemployment.2  Policymakers may anticipate that an increase in the pace of purchases 
would raise market participants’ expectations of the ultimate stock of  securities that the 
Federal Reserve will acquire under its flow-based purchase program, thereby putting additional downward pressure on longer-ter m interest rates and making financial 
conditions more accommodative.  Moreover,  some policymakers might think that 
stepping up purchases of agency MBS would he lp strengthen the re covery in the housing 
sector, not only by putting further downward pressure on mortgage rates but perhaps also 
by spurring mortgage originators to expand capac ity to process appli cations from a rising 
number of potential homebuyers.  Participants  may see a stronger recovery in the housing 
sector as generating additional benefits such  as raising consumer confidence, boosting 
household wealth, and easing the credit constraints facing some households.  
Policymakers also may judge that reducing the unemployment rate  threshold in the 
forward guidance to 5½ percent (from 6½ percent in the December statement) would push out investors’ expectation of the date on which short term interest rates might begin 
                                                 
2 The Desk anticipates that increasing the pace of agency MBS purchases to $45 billion per month 
and the pace of purchases of longe r-term Treasury securities to $55 billion per month would be feasible and 
would not disrupt market functioning.

  to rise—and, given the Committee’s stated exit principles, of the time at which asset sales 
might begin—and thus help to reduce longer- term interest rates and make broader 
financial conditions more accommodative.3     
An announcement along the lines of Alte rnative A certainly would surprise 
market participants.  Indeed, no dealer expects the FOMC to increase the pace of 
purchases during the first half of this year .  Increasing the monthly pace of purchases 
could prompt investors to revise  up their projections of the to tal amount of securities that 
the Federal Reserve will acquire  under its flow-based asset purchase program.  Reducing 
the unemployment threshold to 5½ percent w ould suggest a longer period of very low 
funds rates than dealers curre ntly expect.  Longer-term real  interest rates likely would 
decline if participants responded to a statement like Alternative A by increasing their 
projections of the cumulative increase in Federal Reserve securities holdings and flattening their expected path for the fede ral funds rate.  Inflation compensation and 
equity prices probably would rise, and the dollar could depreciat e.  However, if investors 
read the statement of Alternative A as i ndicating that the FOMC now has a gloomier 
outlook for growth and employment, equity pric es would rise less or could even decline. 
Moreover, changing one of the thresholds so  soon after adopting them might create 
confusion about the extent to which the Committee feels bound by its forward guidance 
and increase the volatility in asset prices. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some participants might see the recent data as suggesting that, after taking 
account of temporary factors, the underlying pace of gr owth in economic activity 
improved in recent months.  These policymakers might point to the apparent rebound in 
growth of business fixed investment during th e fourth quarter, and to  evidence of further 
                                                 
3 Simulations of FRB/US with thresholds in effect suggest that keeping the funds rate near zero 
until the unemployment rate reaches 5½ percent (or projected inflation reaches 2½ percent), and then 
switching to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, would re duce the unemployment rate by about 25 basis points 
in late 2014 and 40 basis points in late 2016, and return the economy to full employment two quarters 
sooner, relative to following the same approach with a 6½ percent threshold.  The simulations also suggest 
that setting the unemployment threshold at 5½ percent would also yield about 25 basis points higher inflation from 2014 th rough 2016 than if the threshold were 6½ pe rcent.  With the current staff forecast as 
the underlying baseline, the simulation of Alternative A with a 5½ percent threshold for unemployment and a 2½ percent threshold for projected inflation (and with securities purch ases at a pace of $100 billion per 
month through the middle of this year, followed by tapering to zero at year-end) produces outcomes for 
unemployment and inflation that are quite close to the constrained optimal control paths shown in the final 
set of charts in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of this Tealbook.

  improvement in the housing sector.  Indeed, after smoothing through the fluctuations in 
recent data, some policymakers may see the economy as likely to be on a sustainable 
course that will be associat ed with ongoing improvements in labor market conditions.  
Moreover, they may view financial strains in Europe—and the corresponding downside 
risks to the U.S. economy—as having eased furt her since December.  They also may see 
the ATRA as having substantially reduced uncer tainty about future tax rates—and thus as 
having reduced an impediment to growth—even if it left other fiscal issues unresolved 
for now.  If so, these policymakers might see the monetary policy actions that the 
Committee has set in train since Septembe r as likely to provide too much policy 
accommodation, leading to an undesirable rise in future inflation that could prove 
difficult to reverse.  As a result, they ma y choose to slow the pace of asset purchases 
immediately, to signal a high likelihood of furt her reductions in the pace of purchases in 
coming months, and to announce that the Comm ittee expects to end asset purchases by 
midyear if the economy develops as an ticipated, as in Alternative C.   
Some policymakers may regard the pote ntial benefits of additional asset 
purchases under present circumstances as like ly to be small and as unlikely to outweigh 
the associated costs.  They may be skeptical that additional purchases would have a significant effect on growth in output and employment.  For example, they may feel that 
lower longer-term interest rates would prompt  corporations to restructure their balance 
sheets but have little impact on their inve stment and hiring decisions.  Alternatively, 
participants might worry that further Federa l Reserve purchases of safe assets when 
interest rates are already qu ite low could lead to exce ssive risk-taking and other 
imbalances that might undermine financial stab ility over time.  Even if they judge that 
further asset purchases would offer some bene fit, participants may be concerned that 
anything more than a modest further increase in the size of the SOMA securities portfolio 
could greatly complicate exit from the curr ent highly accommodative policy stance.  In 
particular, they may be concer ned that selling an even larger MBS portfolio over three to 
five years—as envisioned in the exit prin ciples announced by the Committee in June 
2011—would prove difficult and would disrupt i ssuance of new MBS.  In addition, they 
might see further asset purchases as substantially raising the odds  that the Federal 
Reserve would realize significant losses duri ng the eventual normalization of policy, and 
be concerned about the potentially difficult co mmunications and political  issues that such 
losses could raise. Moreover, policymakers may worry that changing the exit strategy 
could weaken the credibility of the Committ ee’s future monetary policy announcements.  
Such concerns might lead policymakers to pr efer a policy action and associated statement

  like that in Alternative C.  Indeed, some par ticipants might prefer to end asset purchases 
immediately rather than tapering purchase s to midyear. Some other policymakers, 
however, might find it appropriate to slow the pace of purchases without stating that the 
Committee intends to reduce the pace to zero by midyear.  They might see doing so as 
giving the Committee more time to assess the efficacy, costs, and risks of its purchase 
program, or as reducing the risk that ongoing purchases will cause disruptions in market 
functioning.   
A statement like of Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to 
market participants and might well be inte rpreted as signaling a significantly earlier 
removal of policy accommodation than investor s had expected.  According to the Desk’s 
survey, most dealers expect purchases of l onger-term securities to continue at their 
present pace well beyond midyear.  Hence a statement along the lines of Alternative C 
likely would lead investors to mark down significantly their expectations of the 
Committee’s cumulative asset purchases and so cause an increase in longer-term yields.  
In addition, the changes to the Committee’s inflation outlook and its assessment of 
risks—in paragraph 2 of the statement— might cause an upward shift in market 
participants’ expectations of the likely path  for the federal funds rate, reinforcing the 
increase in intermediate- and long-term interest  rates.  Equity prices would probably fall, 
and the dollar might appreciate.

  LONG-RUN PROJECTIONS OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.  All three policy alternatives  include additional 
asset purchases in 2013.4  Alternative B continues purchases at the monthly rates that the 
Committee specified in its December statem ent, $45 billion per month of longer-term 
Treasury securities and $40 billion per month of agency MBS.  Alternative A increases 
the pace of securities purchas es, while Alternative C decreases the pace.  All three 
alternatives maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate and retain 
threshold-based forward guidance for th e funds rate based on the outlook for 
unemployment and inflation.  Projections unde r each scenario are based on assumptions 
about the trajectory of various components of  the balance sheet.  Details of these 
assumptions, as well as projections for each major component of the balance sheet, can 
be found in Explanatory Note D.5  
 
                                                 
4 As announced in December, th e Committee is assumed to main tain its policy of reinvesting 
principal payments from Treasury securities at auction.  It is also assumed to continue reinvesting principal 
payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS.  The effect of assuming 
reinvestment of Treasury securities at auction is very modest; as a result of the maturity extension program, 
there are currently less than $6 billion of Treasury s ecurities in the SOMA portfolio that mature before 
January 2016.   
5 The entire expected path of the portfolio has implications for the evolution of economic activity, 
interest rates and Federal Reserve income.  To the extent that market participants have different 
expectations for the size, pace, and composition of purc hases as well as the execution of the exit strategy 
than is assumed in these scenarios, the resulting eff ects on economic activity, interest rates and Federal 
Reserve income will differ from those presented here.

  For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue MBS purchases at $40 bi llion per month and purchases of longer-
term Treasury securities of $45 billion per month through June 2013.  These roughly 
$500 billion in additional purchases in 2013, wh en combined with the $250 billion in 
purchases from October through December 2012, imply a total expansion of SOMA 
holdings of longer-term secu rities of about $750 billion.6  This scenario might be viewed 
as roughly consistent with the description of asset purchases in the statement language of 
Alternative B.7  Overall, under this scenario, SOMA  securities holdi ngs are about $3.3 
trillion at the end of December 2013. 
In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in December 2015, as in the staff forecast.8  The date of liftoff is a 
key determinant of the trajectory of the ba lance sheet.  In June 2015, six months before 
the first increase in the target federal funds rate, all reinvest ment is assumed to cease, and 
the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  In J une 2016, six months afte r the initia l increase 
in the target federal funds rate, the Comm ittee begins to sell its holdings of agency 
securities at a pace that reduces the amount of these securities in the portfolio to zero in 
five years, that is, by May 2021.  Through thes e redemptions and sales, the size of the 
portfolio is normalized by May 2019.9, 10  The balance sheet then  begins to expand, with 
                                                 
6 Although the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities increases by about $750 
billion between October 2012 and June 2013, total secur ities holdings increase by less because of the asset 
sales and redemptions under the maturity extension program. 
7 The statement indicates that the Committee will continue asset purchases until a substantial 
improvement in the outlook for the labor market is achiev ed in a context of price stability.  It also notes that 
the Committee will “take appr opriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”  In the 
staff economic outlook, by mid-2013, there will be acc umulating evidence of a pickup in economic growth 
and an outlook for substantial improvement in the unemployment rate, which is projected to decline from 
near 7¾ percent in mid-2013 to 7¼ percent in mid-2014 and to 7 percent in late 2014.  Alternatively, by mid-2013, the Committee could end the purchase prog ram based on its assessment of the efficacy and costs 
of additional asset purchases.   
8 At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is projected to be just below 6.5 percent, and core 
PCE inflation is expected to be 1.7 percent.  This lifto ff date for the federal funds rate is two months later 
than that assumed in the balance sheet projections  for Alternative B in th e December Tealbook.   
9 The tools to drain reserve balances (reverse re purchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
10 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts 
to its longer-run trend level, determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and 
a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of re serve balances that is assumed to be necessary to

  increases in SOMA holdings essentially matc hing the growth of Federal Reserve Bank 
capital and currency in circulation.  Total assets are $2.6 trillion at the end of 2025.   
The additional purchases of securities  through the middle of 2013 significantly 
increase the level of SOMA holdings and reserve balances  through the medium term.  
Sales of agency MBS after the federal funds rate increases are proj ected to result in 
realized capital losses.11  These capital losses in conjunction with the rise in interest 
expense on reserve balances substantially reduce Federal Reserve net income; however, 
Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive and no 
deferred asset is recorded.  
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Co mmittee is assumed to step-up the pace of 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to $55 billion per month and of agency 
MBS to $45 billion per month, starting in February.  Around midyear, the Committee is 
assumed to begin to taper purchases and at  year-end it stops all purchases.  These 
purchases total $1 trillion in 2013, which, when combined with the $250 billion in 
purchases from October through Decemb er 2012, ultimately expand the SOMA 
portfolio’s holdings of longe r-term securities by about $1.25 tril lion.  This scenario might 
be viewed as roughly consistent with the desc riptions of asset purchases in the statement 
language of Alternative A.12  The Committee continues reinvesting principal payments 
from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS and maintains its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  In th is scenario, SOMA security 
holdings increase to $3.8 trillion.  In the Altern ative A scenario, we assume that the first 
increase in the target federal funds rate is  pushed out to July 2016, consistent with the 
reduction in the threshold for the unemploym ent rate to 5½ percent in the statement 
language.  In January 2016, six months prior to the assumed first increase in the federal funds rate, all reinvestments are projected to cease and the SOMA portfolio begins to 
contract.  Six months after the lift off of the federal funds ra te, sales of agency securities 
                                                                                                                                                 
conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  A higher 
steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead to an earlier normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet. 
11 Under Reserve Bank accounting, securities held  in the SOMA portfolio are recorded on an 
amortized cost basis.  As a result, realized losses an d gains on securities sold a ffect the Federal Reserve’s 
net income; unrealized losses and gains are not reflected in net income.   
12 Under the staff’s baseline forecast, by late 2013 , the unemployment rate will have fallen to 7.6 
percent and real GDP will be expanding at about a 3 percent annual rate.  The outlook for labor market conditions as of late 2013 would include a half percentage point decline in the unemployment rate through 
late 2014 and a one and a quarter percentage point decline through late 2015.  Alternative A provides more 
policy accommodation than in the staff forecasts, suggesting an even stronger outlook.

  begin and continue for five years.  The si ze of the portfolio is  normalized by January 
2020—about three-and-a-half years after sales begin, and somewhat longer than the 
timeframe anticipated in the exit strategy principles.13     
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of reserve balances.  As the federal funds  rate rises in 2016, 2017, and 2018, the interest 
expense on reserve balances increases quickly.  The interest expense combined with the 
losses realized on the sales of agency MBS resu lt in a very low level of remittances to the 
Treasury in 2018, but no defe rred asset is recorded.14  
For the scenario that corresponds to Alte rnative C, the Committee is assumed to 
decrease the pace of purchases of longer-t erm Treasury securities to $25 billion per 
month and of agency MBS to $20 billion per month in February and March.  In the 
second quarter, the Committee further reduces its purchase pace and completes all 
purchases by the end of June.  The purchases total $250 billion in 2013, resulting in 
cumulative purchases of $500 billion in longer-term securities since October 2012.  In this scenario, the fe deral funds rate is assumed to lift off in December 2014, one year 
earlier than in Alternative B.
15  Corresponding to this earlier increase in the federal funds 
rate, reinvestment of principal from maturing or prepaying securities end and 
redemptions begin in June 2014, and the portfolio  begins to contract.  Sales of agency 
securities commence in June 2015 and last for five years.  SOMA securities holdings in 
this scenario peak at $3.0 trillion, and the size of the balance sheet is normalized in 
September 2018, eight months earli er than under Alternative B. 
Across scenarios, the peak amount of rese rve balances and th e level of reserve 
balances outstanding at lifto ff are directly related to the magnitude of assumed asset 
purchases.  Under Alternative A, reserve bala nces peak at about $2.7 trillion, while under 
Alternative B, reserve balances peak at $2.2 trillion.  Under Alte rnative C, reserve 
                                                 
13 In Alternative A, MBS are sold over a five-year period in order to be consistent with the timing 
assumed in Alternative B.  If sales were assumed to  be completed over about three and a half years, the 
portfolio would normalize in three years.  However, the sales pace implied by this strategy could possibly 
be near the upper-end of the sustainable pace of sales that would preserve market functioning. 
14 Relative to the December Tealbo ok Alternative A, this projection does not record a deferred 
asset.  This change reflects the staff’s downward revi sion to long-run potential GDP growth, which implies 
slightly lower interest rate paths from 2017 onward relative to the last Tealbook; the lower interest rate 
paths reduce projected realized capital losses rela tive to projections in the December Tealbook.  
15 The scaling back of the asset purchase progra m may be seen as consistent with a stronger 
economy than in the baseline, suggesting that it would be appropriate to raise the funds rate sooner than 
under the baseline projection.

  balances rise from their current level to $1.9 trillion.  For the s cenario corresponding to 
Alternative A, reserve balances are $2.2 trilli on when the federal funds rate lifts off from 
its lower bound in July 2016.  For the scenario  corresponding to Alte rnative B, reserve 
balances are $1.9 trillion when the federal funds rate lifts off from its lower bound in 
December 2015.  For the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, reserve balances are 
$1.7 trillion when the federal funds rate lifts off from its lower bound in December 2014.   
In the scenario corresponding to Altern ative B, the monetary base increases 
significantly from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase program and the accompanying increase in reserve balances.  Once exit begi ns, the monetary base shrinks rapidly through 
the second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting a decline in reserve bala nces as securities 
are redeemed or sold.  Starting in the thir d quarter of 2019, after reserve balances are 
assumed to have stabilized at $25 billion, th e monetary base begins to expand, in line 
with the growth of Federal Reserve notes in circulation.  Unde r Alternative A, the 
monetary base increases from 2012 to 2014 as the level of reserve balances climbs in 
concert with the expansion of  the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The base then 
contracts during the exit until after the si ze of the portfolio is normalized.  Under 
Alternative C, the monetary base increas es from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase 
program and then contracts, on net, until after the size of the portfolio is normalized.

  DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY FORECASTS  
Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to expand over the forecast period 
ending in 2015 at an average annual rate of 3¾ percent, about one pe rcentage point lower 
than in 2012, as growth of federal governme nt debt steps down and private nonfinancial 
debt accelerates somewhat.  We forecast that  nonfinancial business debt will grow at a 
moderate rate over the projection period, consistent with the anticipated pace of 
investment spending.  Having contracted for the past five years, home mortgage debt is 
expected to grow slowly over the forecast period, as still tig ht financing conditions and a 
substantial amount of negative home equity ar e expected to continue to weigh on debt 
growth.  Meanwhile, we project that consum er credit will grow at a robust pace over the 
forecast horizon, reflecting continued strong demand for student and auto loans and a 
pickup in spending on consumer durables. 
Commercial bank credit is expected to in crease moderately over the forecast 
period.  Core loans—the sum of commercial  and industrial (C&I), real estate, and 
consumer loans—are projected to rise gra dually through 2015.  Following rapid growth 
in 2012, we anticipate that C&I loans will expa nd more in line with nominal GDP growth 
over the medium term.  Commercial real estate  loans are projected to accelerate modestly 
over the forecast period, as several factors that are currently restraining growth—high 
vacancy rates, depressed prices for commerc ial properties, and the poor credit quality of 
existing loans—are likely to ease somewhat.  The growth rates of re sidential real estate 
loans on banks’ books and consumer loans on ba nks’ books are both expected to step up 
slightly from their currently weak paces, reflecting some further gradual easing of 
standards and terms on such loans as th e economy strengthens.  Banks’ securities 
holdings are projected to rise more slowly during the forecast period than they did in 
2012 as deposit growth ebbs and demand for bank loans strengthens. 
In the first half of 2013, we expect grow th in both M2 and its largest component, 
liquid deposits, to be moderate in comparis on with the rapid expansion observed over 
recent years as investors gradually react to the expiration of the unlimited FDIC 
insurance on noninterest-beari ng transaction depos its, thereby dampening growth of M2 
assets.16  Subsequently, M2 is forecast to conti nue to grow at a pace below that of 
                                                 
16 The Dodd-Frank Act provided temporary, unlimited deposit insurance coverage for 
noninterest-bearing transaction accounts at FDIC-insur ed institutions from December 31, 2010, through  
December 31, 2012.  For additiona l background, see the box “Expir ation of Unlimited FDIC Deposit 
Insurance” in the Financial Developments section of Tealbook Book A.

  nominal income, as the expected improvement  in financial and economic conditions over 
the forecast period encourages investors to reallocate their portfo lios away from M2 
assets and toward riskier invest ments.  M2 is projected to contract toward the end of 2015 
in response to the anticipated increase in short-term market in terest rates and the 
accompanying rise in the opportunity cost of holding money.

  DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued in Decemb er appears on the next page, followed by 
drafts for a January directive that correspond to each of th e policy alternatives.  These 
drafts suggest a number of updates to make th e language of the directive consistent with 
the Committee’s post-meeting statements. 
The draft directive for Alternative B inst ructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month and to continue 
purchasing longer-term Treasury se curities at a pace of about $45 billion per month.  The 
draft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to purchase additional agency MBS at a 
pace of about $45 billion per month and to pur chase longer-term Treasury securities at a 
pace of about $55 billion per month.  The draf t directive for Alternative C instructs the 
Desk to purchases agency MBS at a pace of about $20 billion per month and to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of  about $25 billion per month.  None of the 
directives specifies an end-date for purchase s, but the draft statement for Alternative C 
indicates that the Committee expects to end purchases by midyear.  All three of the draft 
directives direct the Desk to continue th e current practice of reinvesting principal 
payments on all agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  All th ree also instruct the 
Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

Explanatory Notes
A. Policy Rules Used in “Monetary Policy Strategies”
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in "Monetary 
Policy  Strategies." In the table, \( R_t\) denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter \( t\), while 
the right-hand-side  variables include the staff's projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three  quarters ahead (\( \pi_t\) and \( \pi_{t+3|t}\)), the output gap estimate 
for the current period as well as its  one-quarter-ahead forecast (\( gap_t\) and \( gap_{t+1|t}\)), and the 
forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual  change in the output gap (\( \Delta^4gap_{t+3|t}\)). The 
value of policymakers' long-run inflation objective,  denoted \( \pi^*\), is 2 percent. The nominal 
income targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap, which  is defined as the difference between 
nominal income \( yn_t\) (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP)  and a target value \( yn^*_t\) 
(100 times the log of target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set  equal to potential real 
GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, target   nominal GDP grows 
2 percentage points per year faster than potential GDP.
T aylor (1993) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\)
T aylor (1999) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\)
Inertial T aylor (1999) rule \( R _t = 0.85R _{t-1}+0.15\left(2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)
O utcom e-based rule\ (  R _ t  =  
1 . 2 R _ { t - 1 } - 0 . 3 9 R _ { t - 2 } + 0 . 1 9 [ 0 . 5 4 + 1 . 7 3 \ p i _ t + 3 . 6 6 g a p _ t - 2 . 7 2 g a p _ { t - 1 } ] \ )
F irst-difference rule \( R _ t =  R _ { t-1 } + 0 .5 (\p i_ { t+ 3 |t} -\p i^ * )+ 0 .5 \D elta^ 4 g ap _ { t+ 3 |t} \)
N om inal incom e targeting rule \( R_t = 0.75R_{t-1}+0.25(2+\pi_t+yn_t-yn^*_t)\)
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff. 1 The outcome- 
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q1-2006:Q4. The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model. 2 The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, and the long-run 
intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set at 2 percent for the same reason. The 2 percent
1 See Erceg and others (2012).
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised the long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2 V percent to 2 percent. The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change.

real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run, quarterly real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for

B. Estimates of the Equilib rium and Actual Real Rates 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using the projection for the economy of 
FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends 
on a very broad array of economic factors, some of  which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  The estimate reported is the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, 
which is generated after the path s of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so 
that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date.

C. FRB/US Model Simulations 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

D. Long-Run Projections of the Ba lance Sheet and Monetary Base 
This explanatory note presents the assumptions  underlying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Long-Run Projections of the Bala nce Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as 
projections for each major component of the balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from January 2013 
to December 2025.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on December 31, 2012.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the tables that 
follow the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in D ecember 2015.  This date of liftoff is consistent 
with the current staff economic forecast and the thresholds described in the December 2012 
FOMC statement, and it is two months later than  assumed in the balance sheet projections for 
Alternative B in the December Tealbook.  Th e projections for the scenario corresponding to 
Alternative A assume the target federal funds rate  lifts off in July 2016, consistent with the 
thresholds described in the proposed Alternativ e A statement language and seven months later 
than in Alternative B.  The projections for th e scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume the 
target federal funds rate lifts off in December 2014,  a year earlier than in Alternative B.  In each 
case, the balance sheet projections assume that no u se of short-term draining tools is necessary to 
achieve the projected path for the target federal funds rate.3 
  
                                                 
3 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreements were used to drain reserves prior to raising the 
federal funds rate, the composition of liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse 
repurchase agreements would be matched by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, 
these draining tools would be wound down as the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so 
that the projected paths for Treasury securities presented here remain valid.

ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B  are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue purc hases of Treasury securities at a pace of 
$45 billion per month and purchases of MBS at a pace of $40 billion per month 
through June.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The pur chases between October 2012 and June 2013 
expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of  longer-term securities by about $750 
billion.   
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS.  
o Starting in June 2015—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency  MBS and agency debt securities in June 
2016, six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the target federal 
funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by May 2021. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections from the Tealbook.
4  The 
projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee is as sumed to increase the 
monthly pace of purchases to $55 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $45 billion of MBS from February through June  2013.  After June 2013, the pace of 
purchases slows, and purchases end in December 2013.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average dura tion of about nine years.  These purchases 
expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of  longer-term securities by $1.25 trillion 
between October 2012 and December 2013.  In  addition, the Committee is assumed to 
maintain its existing policy of reinvesting pr incipal payments from its holdings of agency 
debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  In January 2016, six months prior to the assumed 
increase in the target federal funds rate in  July 2016, principal payments from all 
securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  Sales of agency securities begin in January 2017 and continue for five years. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed decrease the 
monthly pace of purchases to $25 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $20 
                                                 
4 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of January 22, 2013.

billion MBS in February and March 2013.   After March 2013, the pace of purchases 
slows further, and purchases end in June 2013.  The Treasury securities purchased are 
assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by $500 billion between October 
2012 and June 2013.  The FOMC continues to reinvest the proceeds from principal payments on its agency securities holdings in agency MBS until June 2014—six months 
prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate under this alternative.  Starting in June 2014, all securities are allowed to  roll off the portfolio as they mature or 
prepay.  The Federal Reserve begins to se ll agency MBS and agency debt securities in 
June 2015.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by May 2020.    
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which these securities are 
purchased will generally exceed their face va lue, with a larger premium for longer-
maturity securities.  As a result, in Alternatives A, B, and C, premiums are boosted by roughly $38 billion, $24 billion, and $6 billion, respectively, by the time asset purchases 
end relative to a scenario without these Tr easury securities purchases.  The increase in 
premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.   
 The asset purchases under all three alternatives put downward pressure on market interest 
rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.   
 The current and near-term market values of new agency MBS purchases are assumed to 
be four percent above face value.  As a r esult, for Alternatives A, B, and C, the $572 
billion, $360 billion, and $230 billion of agency MBS purchases, respectively, will cause 
unamortized premiums on the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet to rise by roughly $23 
billion, $14 billion, and $9 billi on, respectively, relative to a scenario without these MBS 
purchases.  The increase in premiums is refl ected in higher total assets and in higher 
reserve balances. 
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is assumed to decline, as draws under the recent foreign central bank swap auctions mature, a nd is assumed to return to zero in 2014.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  
Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.

 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about  $1 billion currently to zero in 2015.  
Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by the 
LLC and the U.S. Treasury’s initial funding.  On January 15, the Board of Governors 
approved the elimination of the U.S. Treasury's funding commitment and the repayment of the initial funding amount plus accrued inter est.  Additionally, the Board of Governors 
approved the disbursement of contingent in terest payments from TALF LLC to Treasury 
and FRBNY that equal, approximately, the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the amount of outstanding TALF loans.  Th e first payment occurs in February, and 
payments will continue as TALF loans are repa id.  In this projection, the LLC is assumed 
not to purchase any asset-backed securities.  (It  would have to make such purchases if an 
asset-backed security were received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero in 2016.   
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 
currency through 2015.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) is assumed to be around $70 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international 
accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that 
point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion. The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast 
period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
5 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
                                                 
5 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date  of normalization of the size of the balance sheet 
and the size of the SO MA portfolio.  Growth in Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two 
years; however, even if Federal Reserve capital were assumed to be constant, normalization only would be 
pushed later by about a quarter.

 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  The alternatives do not presently record a deferred asset.   
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS6 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note 
is negative 117 basis points in the current quarter.  The effect wanes over time as the 
length of time the securities will be held by the Federal Reserve shortens and as securities 
subsequently roll off the portfolio or are sold until the size of the portfolio is normalized. 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous te rm premium effect is negative 109 basis 
points.  This estimate is between the term premium effect associated with a $1.25 trillion 
purchase program and the term premium effect associated with a $750 billion purchase program. Over the first half of this year, as market participants come to realize that the purchases will end in June, the term premium effect converges to on e associated with a 
$750 billion purchase program.  Over the remai nder of the projection period, the term 
premium effect declines slowly toward zer o, reflecting the actual and anticipated 
normalization of the portfolio.    
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 80 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchases in 2013 
and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A. 
 
 
 
                                                 
6 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the 
Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs” by Li and Wei, FEDS working paper #37, 2012.
