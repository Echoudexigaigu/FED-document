The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from six policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013.  (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of the rules are 
discussed below.)  As shown in the left-hand columns, four out of the six rules keep the 
federal funds rate at the effective lower bound in both the second and third quarters of 
2013.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which puts re latively little weight on the output gap, 
prescribes an average federal funds rate of about 100 basis points ne xt quarter followed 
by a further increase in the th ird quarter.  The first-differenc e rule, which responds to the 
expected change in the output gap, prescribes an average fede ral funds rate of just under 
25 basis points in the second quarter, followed by nearly 50 basis points in the subsequent 
quarter.  
The right-hand columns display the policy rule prescriptions that arise in the 
absence of the lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.  The inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule and the outcome-based  rule prescribe federal funds rates that are near zero for 
the next two quarters, while th e Taylor (1999) rule and the no minal income targeting rule 
prescribe negative values for the federal funds rate.  The more-accommodative prescriptions arising from the latter two rules reflect their stronger immediate response to 
the staff’s estimate of the output gap, which remains appreciably negative.
1 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key  Elements of the Staff Projection.”  As 
described in Book A of the Tealbook, the staff’s outlook for economic activity is 
essentially unchanged from the January Teal book, with the effects of slightly better 
incoming data offsetting those of somewhat tig hter near-term fiscal  policy assumptions.  
With the outlook for economic activity and in flation largely unchanged, the near-term 
1 Although the rule prescriptions are not constrained to be at or above the lower bound, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nomina l income targeting rule, and the first-difference rule 
all include and place substantial weight on the lagged actual federal funds rate, which is subject to the 
lower-bound constraint.

federal funds rate prescriptions from the unc onstrained rules are sim ilarly close to those 
in the January Tealbook.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US model when conditioned on the staff’s 
outlook for the economy.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained, would return output to  potential in twelve quarters.  Consistent 
with the staff’s marginally revised projection of the output gap in 2015, the r* estimate 
for the current quarter is onl y about 5 basis points higher th an in the January Tealbook.  
As in previous rounds, the estimate of r*—currently about ¾percent—remains below 
the estimated actual real federal funds rate of about 1.4 percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations (using the FRB/US m odel) that incorp orate the endogenous 
responses of inflation and the output gap to the paths of the federal funds rate prescribed 
by the different policy rules under the assumption that the funds rate is constrained by the 
effective lower bound.  The model is adjusted to match the staff’s baseline outlook for the 
economy and then simulated usi ng the different policy rules.2  Each rule is implemented 
from the second quarter of 2013 onward, under th e assumption that financial markets as 
well as price- and wage-setters fully understa nd and anticipate the implications for future 
real activity, inflation, and in terest rates of following that rule instead of the baseline 
policy.  The exhibit also displays the impli cations of the Tealbook baseline policy, which 
keeps the federal funds rate at its effectiv e lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and projected inflation between one and two 
years ahead is less than 2.5 pe rcent; once either of these thre sholds is crossed, the federal 
funds rate in the baseline projection follows the prescription of the inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule.  (Alternative policy rule simulations augmented with thresholds are discussed 
below.)  
2 The staff’s baseline forecast inco rporates the effects of the larg e-scale asset purchase programs 
that the FOMC has undertaken in recent years.  The staff baseline also assumes that the FOMC will 
purchase a total of $500 billion in longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS during 2013, and it incorporates some “disappointment” on the part of fina ncial market participants as they gradually come to 
recognize that, contrary to what they  currently appear to expect, purchase s will not rise above that level.  
Based on these assumptions, all of the policy rule simulations discussed here and on later pages incorporate 
the projected effects of these balan ce sheet policies; the rule s themselves are not directly adjusted for the 
effects of balance sheet policies.

 In the Tealbook baseline, th e federal funds rate depart s from the effective lower 
bound in the fourth quarter of 2015, as in the January Tealbook.  Subsequently, the 
federal funds rate increases to 3 percent by the beginning of 2018 and reaches 3¾ percent 
by the end of 2020.  The unemployment rate de clines below its threshold value of 6.5 
percent in the fourth quarter of  2015 and is expected to conver ge to the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate of unemployment by 2017.3  Headline inflation is projected to rise 
gradually over time and then to level off at 2 percent by 2018.   
In the absence of thresholds, the various  policy rules all call for tightening to 
commence appreciably earlier than in the Teal book baseline.  As a result, most of the 
rules imply a real federal funds rate path that is pe rsistently above th at in the baseline 
forecast, leading to higher unemployment and lower inflation through most of the decade.  An exception is the nominal income targe ting rule.  Under this rule, policymakers 
credibly promise to keep the real federal funds  rate persistently belo w baseline later in the 
decade, thereby generating stronge r future real activity and hi gher inflation.  These future 
developments in turn stimulate real activity  and inflation in the near term, because 
forward-looking financial market participants price them into asset prices today, thereby 
lowering real bond yields, boosting equity pr ices, and putting downward pressure on the 
real exchange rate.  Moreover, this mechan ism is amplified by the increase in near-term 
inflation that results from higher expectations for future in flation, which in turn lowers 
the real federal funds rate over the next few years and so increases the downward 
pressure on real long-term  interest rates today.
4  All told, the persistently more-
accommodative stance of monetary policy that re sults from this strategy stimulates real 
activity and generates a distinctly more ra pid decline in unemployment than in the 
Tealbook baseline.  As with the other policy ru les, the simulations of the nominal income 
targeting rule embed the assumption that financial markets and pric e- and wage-setters 
recognize that policymakers will adhere to the rule in the future.  This assumption is 
particularly important for the nominal income  targeting rule because that rule implies 
inflation in excess of the 2 percent goal even after the output gap is closed. 
                                                 
3 The staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment declines from about 6 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 5¼ percent by the en d of 2017.  It is assumed to remain at this level 
thereafter. 
4 As described in the Appendix included at the end of this section, the nominal income targeting 
rule responds to the nominal income gap defined as the difference between nominal GDP and target 
nominal GDP.  For the rule simulated here, target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to potential real 
GDP in 2007:Q4 times the GDP deflator in that quarte r; subsequently, target nominal GDP grows at a rate 
that is 2 percentage points above that of potential real GDP.

The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which policy rules are subj ect to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.  For each of the ru les, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and projected inflation between one and two 
years ahead is less than 2.5 percent.  In each  of the simulations discussed below, crossing 
the unemployment threshold is the catalyst for switching to the specified rule.  Financial 
markets and price- and wage-setters are assu med to understand that policy will switch to 
the specified rule when one of the threshold conditions is crossed and to view this switch 
as permanent and fully credible.  
The simulations with thresholds bring out several important properties of the 
rules.  First, because all of  the policy rules without thresholds shown in the previous 
exhibit imply a departure of the federal funds  rate from the effective lower bound before 
either threshold is crossed, imposing thresholds uniformly leads to a more-accomodative policy.  The imposition of thresholds alters  economic outcomes least for the nominal 
income targeting rule because this rule prescribes the latest departure from the effective 
lower bound when no thresholds are impose d.  Second, the conduct of policy after the 
threshold is crossed exerts a major influen ce on the effective stimulus provided by the 
threshold strategy.  In particular, post-cros sing policy rules that entail a more gradual 
increase in the federal funds rate, such as the nominal income targeting rule and the first-
difference rule, imply a more rapid decline in unemployment before the threshold is 
crossed.  As a result, these rules lead to an earlier crossing of the threshold and an earlier  
departure of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound.  Third, the 
effectiveness of threshold-augm ented rules rests heavily on th e ability of policymakers to 
credibly commit to a particular rule after a threshold is crossed, and on the assumption of 
model-consistent expectations. 
The fourth exhibit, “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares optimal control simulations derive d for this Tealbook with those shown in 
January.
5  In these simulations, policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on 
keeping headline PCE inflation close to th e Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the 
5 The optimal policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described above.

unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing cha nges in the federal funds rate.  
The simulations indicate that, with the fe deral funds rate constrained to remain 
positive, the optimal control path does not rise above the effective lower bound until the 
fourth quarter of 2015, the same as in the sta ff’s current baseline forecast and also in the 
optimal control exercise shown in the Ja nuary Tealbook.  Subsequently, the optimal 
control path for the federal funds rate rises to 3 percent by the middl e of 2018 and to just 
below 4 percent by the end of the 2020.6 
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal c ontrol policy promotes a stronger economic 
recovery while allowing inflation to rise no more than ½ percentage point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent goal.  As a result, the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent 
in the second quarter of 2015 and falls to 6 percent by the time the federal funds rate 
leaves the effective lower bound at the end of 2015; thereaf ter, the unemployment rate 
declines to 4¾ percent by the end of 2017, temporarily undershooting the staff’s estimate 
of the long-term natural rate of unemployment.   Inflation increases more rapidly than in 
the Tealbook baseline and reaches the Committee’s 2 percent objective by the second 
half of 2016.  Thereafter, inflation overshoot s the 2 percent target by about ¼ percentage 
point before gradually moving back toward 2 percent.  The earlie r achievement of the 
Committee’s assumed objectives occurs be cause policymakers respond to the lower 
bound constraint by committing for an extended period of time to a response to inflation that is less forceful than under the baseline path, thereby boosting inflation expectations 
and reducing real inte rest rates in the s hort and medium run. 
In the absence of the lower-bound constrai nt, the optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate would gradually decline to about ¼percent by the beginning of 2014 
and return to positive territory by mid-2015.  Under this unconstrained policy, the 
unemployment rate would decline more ra pidly than under the optimal constrained 
policy.  Inflation would increase to 2 per cent by the second half of 2016, a pattern much 
6 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

like that in the constrained simulation.  In subsequent years, inflation would slightly 
exceed the 2 percent objective, but by somewhat less than in the constrained case. 
In the policy rule and optimal control si mulations discussed above, it is assumed 
that the FOMC can influen ce actual inflation today by altering private agents’ 
expectations for future monetary  policy and thus their expectations for future real activity 
and inflation.  However, our understanding of  wage and price dynamics is imperfect, and 
there may be limits on the FOMC’s ability to push up near-term inflation by promising to 
be more accommodative later in the decade.  To  illustrate this possibility, we consider a 
setting of the FRB/US mode l in which inflation move s up only as real economic 
improvement occurs, so wage and price inflation initially rise less than in the simulations 
discussed on the previous page.  The fifth exhibit, “Constrained Optimal Control Policy 
under Alternative Inflation Pro cesses,” compares the constrained optimal control policy 
under this assumption for wage-price dyna mics with the corresponding policy that 
obtains when we maintain our usual assumption that expectations of future policy actions 
and their economic effects do directly affect  inflation today.  By assumption in both 
cases, financial market participants have model-consistent expectations and the real interest rates relevant for household and bus iness spending decisions accurately reflect 
the future course of inflation.  
Compared with the simulation under our st andard assumption for wage and price 
dynamics, inflation under the more inertial assumption is lower over the medium term.  
As a result, optimal control policy results in  an average level of the real funds rate 
through the end of the decade that is somewh at above that obtained when policymakers 
can influence near-term inflation through expect ational effects.  Neve rtheless, given that 
policymakers continue to enjoy perfect credibility, an optimal control strategy under these conditions is able to put downward pre ssure on real long-term interest rates today 
by keeping the path of the real funds ra te noticeably below baseline beyond 2015.  
Moreover, optimal control policy partially comp ensates for the more inertial nature of 
inflation by keeping the real  funds rate beyond 2020 lower than it otherwise would be 
(not shown).  As a result, optimal policy is st ill able to boost real activity to almost the 
same extent as when inflation responds di rectly to guidance about future monetary 
policy.

at its effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and
projected one-year-ahead inflation is less than 2.5 percent. Once either of these thresholds is crossed, the federal
funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified rule. Policy in the Tealbook baseline also uses these threshold
conditions and switches to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule once either of these thresholds is crossed.

 Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies.”  In the table, 	ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, while the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( gap t and gap t+1|t), and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective, denoted π*, is 2 percent.  The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
݊ݕ௧ (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ݊ݕ∗
௧ (100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by th e GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP. 
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured promin ently in recent analysis by Board staff.
1  The outcome-
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q12006:Q4.  The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a lo ng-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model.2  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, and the long-run 
                                                 
1 See Erceg and others (2012). 
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised th e long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2¼ percent to 2 percent.  The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change. Taylor (1993) rule ܴ௧ൌ2൅ߨ௧൅0.5ሺߨ௧െߨ∗ሻ൅0.5݌ܽ݃ ௧

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run, quarterly real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated outcome-based rule, and the nominal in come targeting rule include the lagged policy 
rate as a right-hand-side variable.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook” report rule prescrip tions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff 
outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far this quarter.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using the projection for the economy of 
FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends 
on a very broad array of economic factors, some of  which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  The estimate reported is the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, 
which is generated after the path s of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so 
that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  As always, the Co mmittee could blend elements of the draft 
statements to construct its desired statement. 
In summarizing recent economic developmen ts, all of the alternatives note that 
growth in economic activity has increased follo wing a pause late last year, but they differ 
in their readings of the indicators of econom ic activity and their assessments of labor 
market conditions.  Alternative B indicates that incoming data suggest “a return to 
moderate economic growth” while  Alternative A simply indi cates that economic growth 
“has resumed.”  Alternative C offers a somewhat more positive ch aracterization of the 
recent performance of the economy by stating that “the pace of economic growth has 
picked up.”  Alternatives B and C observe that the housing sector  “has strengthened 
further;” Alternative A cites “further improvement,” as in the January statement.  
Alternatives A and B acknowledge that “f iscal policy has become somewhat more 
restrictive,” while Alternative C does not mention fiscal restraint.  Regarding the recent 
news on the labor market, Alternative B states  that “labor market conditions have shown 
signs of improvement in recent months.”  As in previous FOMC statements, Alternatives 
A and B reiterate that the unemployment rate “remains elevated;” in contrast, Alternative C states that unemployment, “though elevat ed, has declined,” and emphasizes that 
employment has been expanding at a “solid” pa ce.  All three alternatives indicate that 
inflation “has been running somewhat belo w the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart 
from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices” and that 
longer-term inflation expectations  “have remained stable.”   
In characterizing the economic outlook, Alternative B contin ues to state that, with 
appropriate policy accommodation, the Committ ee expects economic growth to proceed 
at a moderate pace and the unemployment ra te to decline gradually toward mandate-
consistent levels.  In light of its more  positive reading of the recent economic data, 
Alternative C indicates that , with appropriate policy a ccommodation, economic growth 
will “pick up further over time.”  In contrast, Alternative A says that, “without further” 
policy accommodation, economic growth “mi ght not be strong enough to generate 
sustained improvement in labor market c onditions.”  With respect to inflation, 
Alternative B maintains the formulation used in January, stating that the Committee 
Alternatives

 “anticipates that inflation over the medium term  likely will run at or below its 2 percent 
objective.”  Alternative A indicates that me dium-term inflation likely will be “somewhat 
below” its 2 percent objective while Alternativ e C says that inflati on is likely to run 
“close to” its 2 percent objective over the medium term. 
The draft statements for Alternatives A and B continue to note downside risks to 
the economic outlook.  While Alternative B doe s not mention specific risks, Alternative 
A points to strains in global financial markets and to “unres olved fiscal issues” as posing 
downside risks to the economic outlook.  In a break from rece nt statements, Alternative C 
says that the Committee “sees the risks to bot h economic growth and inflation as roughly 
balanced.” 
Alternative B continues purchases of agency MBS and longer-term Treasury 
securities at the same monthly rates as t hose the Committee specified in January.  In 
contrast, Alternative C would reduce the m onthly flows of purchases of both agency 
MBS and longer-term Treasury securities to $30 billion per month.  Alternative A would 
increase the combined pace of securities purchases to $100 billion per month.  In 
explaining the Committee’s balance sheet policy, Alternatives B and C clarify that its 
decisions about the pace of asset purchases are based on both its “outlook for the labor 
market and inflation” and its “current assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of 
additional asset purchases.”  In contrast, Alte rnative A states that the more rapid pace of 
asset purchases should “put a dditional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates” 
and is intended to support a stronger economic recovery.   
Regarding the Committee’s forward guidance about its purchase program, all of 
the alternatives state that the Committee will continue its securities  purchases until “the 
outlook for the labor market has improved substa ntially in a context of price stability.” 
The proposed statement for Alternative B frames the Committee’s future decisions about 
the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases in terms of the Committee’s 
evaluation of their likely efficacy and costs, as  in recent statements, but adds “as well as 
the extent of progress toward its economic obj ectives.”  Alternative C states, instead, that 
the Committee “is prepared to increase or re duce the pace of purchases if the outlook for 
the labor market or inflation changes, with the purpose of maintaining appropriate policy 
accommodation.”  Alternative A uses much the same language as the January statement. 
Alternatives

 All three alternatives would maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate and retain quantitative th reshold-based forward guidance for the funds 
rate.  As in January, Alternatives B and C w ould keep the unemployment rate threshold at 
6½ percent, while Alternative A would lower th is threshold to 5½ pe rcent.  All of the 
alternatives would retain the 2½ percent th reshold for projected inflation between one 
and two years ahead. 
The following table summarizes key elements of the alternative statements.  The 
summary table is followed by complete draf ts of the three statements and then by 
arguments for each alternative.

 JANUARY FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December 
suggests that growth in economic activity pa used in recent months, in large part 
because of weather-rela ted disruptions and other transitory factors.  Employment has 
continued to expand at a moderate pace but the unemployment  rate remains elevated.  
Household spending and business fixed inve stment advanced, and the housing sector 
has shown further improvement.  Inflati on has been running somewhat below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary varia tions that largely reflect 
fluctuations in energy prices.  Longer-term  inflation expectations have remained 
stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the 
unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  Although strains in global financial markets have 
eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that  inflation over the medium term likely 
will run at or below its 2 percent objective. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue 
purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed  securities at a pace of $40 billion per 
month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on  longer-term interest rates, support mortga ge markets, and help to make broader 
financial conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If th e outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until such improvement is achieved in a contex t of price stability.  In determining the 
size, pace, and composition of its asset purch ases, the Committee will, as always, take 
appropriate account of the likely effi cacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appr opriate at least as 
long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, infla tion between one and 
two years ahead is projected to be no more  than a half percen tage point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations

 continue to be well anchored.  In dete rmining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other 
information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and in flation of 2 percent.

following a pause late last year .  Although employment has continued to expand at 
a moderate pace, but the unem ployment rate  remains elevated.  Household spending 
and business fixed investment advanced, a nd the housing sector has shown further 
improvement , but fiscal policy has beco me somewhat more restrictive.  Inflation 
has been running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from 
temporary variations that la rgely reflect fluctuations in  energy prices.  Longer-term 
inflation expectations ha ve remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum

Moreover,  strains in global financial markets hav e eased somewhat, the Committee 
continues to see and unresolved fiscal issues pose  downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee also an ticipates that  inflation over the medium term likely 
will run at o r somewhat  below its 2 percent objective.  
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will c ontinue 
purchasing additional increase the pace at which it purchases  agency mortgage-
backed securities at a pace of $40 to $45 billion per month, and longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of $45 to $55 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining 
its existing policy of reinves ting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt 
and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions 
will further increase the Committee’s hold ings of longer-term securities and

accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals

 FOMC  STATEMENT —M ARCH 2013  ALTERNATIVE B 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in Decem ber 
January  suggests that a return to moderate economic growth in econom ic activity 
paused in recent months, in large part b ecause of weather-rela ted disruptions and 
other transitory factors following a pause late last year.  Employment has continued 
to expand at a m oderate pace  Labor market conditions have shown signs of 
improvement in recent months  but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  
Household spending and business fixed inve stment advanced, and the housing sector 
has shown strengthened  further im provement, but fiscal policy has become 
somewhat more restrictive .  Inflation has been running somewhat below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary varia tions that largely reflect 
fluctuations in energy prices.  Longer-term  inflation expectations have remained 
stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the 
unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges 
consistent with its dual mandate.  Although strains in global financial markets have 
eased somewhat,  The Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic 
outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that  inflation over the medium term likely 
will run at or below its 2 percent objective.  
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate  Based on its outlook for the 
labor market and inflation, and on its cu rrent assessment of th e likely efficacy 
and costs of additional asset purchases , the Committee will decided to continue 
purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed  securities at a pace of $40 billion per 
month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage mark ets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative , thereby supporting a stronger economic 
recovery and helping to ensure that inflat ion, over time, is at the rate most 
consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate .  
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  If th e outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially,  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and 
agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until su ch improvement is achieved the outlook for the labor market has improved 
substantially  in a context of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and 
composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, continue to  take 
appropriate account of the likely effi cacy and costs of such purchases as well as the 
extent of progress tow ard its economic objectives .

 5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appr opriate at least as 
long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, infla tion between one and

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may continue to expect the pace of economic recovery to be 
moderate and inflation to be subdued for some  time.  In light of the recent favorable 
indicators of labor market conditions, participants might judge that the outlook has 
improved, but only modestly.  And, based on curr ent information, they may conclude that 
the potential benefits of continued purchases of longer-term securities outweigh the costs.  
If so, they might wish to continue acquiring longer-term securities at the same pace as in 
recent months, and choose to make an announcement along the lines of Alternative B.  
FOMC participants may regard economi c developments over the intermeeting 
period as broadly consistent with their assessments of the outlook at the time of the 
January meeting.  They may also read th e incoming data on inflation and inflation 
expectations as being consiste nt with their earlier views th at inflation over the medium 
term likely will run at or below the Committ ee’s longer-run objective.  The recent data on 
payrolls and spending, in conjunction with the improvement in sentiment in domestic 
financial markets, may have given policymakers somewhat greater assurance that private demand will increase at a rate sufficient to generate a gradual decline in unemployment 
going forward.  However, policymakers may see the effects of sequestration as likely to 
hold back growth of spending by both the public and private s ectors over coming 
quarters.  Moreover, with a number of fiscal matters yet to be resolved, participants may 
worry about the possibility of additional fiscal drag on economic activity.  Policymakers may also see a continuing risk of an adverse financial shock originati ng in the euro area.  
In light of these concerns, the Committee may judge it appropriate to continue on the 
current policy trajectory in order to maintain  support for the economic recovery and help 
ensure that inflation, over time, is at the ra te most consistent with the Committee’s dual 
mandate. 
 Some policymakers may have read the incoming information as confirming a 
return to moderate economic growth but nonethel ess view the data as not yet indicating a 
substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and thus may judge it 
premature to adjust the purchase program.  Others may have been encouraged by recent 
economic news, but be skeptical that the availa ble data clearly signal a sustained return to 
moderate economic growth, part icularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the near-
term effects of sequestration.  These participants may prefer to wait for more information on the recent and near-term pe rformance of the economy before making any adjustment

 to the stance of policy.  Accordingly, partic ipants might favor a statement that includes a 
reference to the signs of improvements in labor market conditions in recent months, 
balanced by recognition of their concerns th at the unemployment rate remains elevated 
and that fiscal policy has beco me somewhat more restrictive, as in Alternative B.   
In light of their review of the likely efficacy and costs of asset purchases, some 
participants may judge that th e asset purchases are yielding the expected benefits in terms 
of supporting aggregate demand and should be continued in order to strengthen the 
moderate economic recovery.1  Moreover, they may judge that the Committee can 
continue to purchase additional longer-term secu rities at the current pace for some time 
without disrupting market functioning.2  Nonetheless, they may agree that the post-
meeting statement should more clearly indicat e that the Committee will be evaluating the 
efficacy and costs of its purchases on an ongoing basis, and want to leave open the 
possibility that as the Committee sees progr ess toward its economic objectives, purchases 
could be scaled back or even stopped in comi ng quarters if its future assessments were to 
indicate that the costs associated with the pr ogram exceed the benefits.  If so, participants 
may favor language like that in para graphs 3 and 4 of Alternative B. 
Some policymakers might remain worried that  inflation expectations could rise if 
asset purchases continue much longer at the current pace, especially if economic growth 
continues to strengthen, but they may see risk-management considerations as supporting 
the existing policy stance for the time being.  In particular, they may worry that the 
effective lower bound on the funds rate could bind severely if a move toward tighter 
policy proved premature and led to a substant ial deterioration in the economic outlook.  
In contrast, with considerable economic slack prevailing, and with inflation below levels deemed appropriate over the l onger run, participants might be  reasonably confident that 
they would be able to firm policy sufficien tly quickly to avoid a significant run-up in 
inflation in the event of surprisingly strong economic growth or rising inflation expectations.  Other policymakers who have been worried that the large size of the

 Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would contribu te to increased inflat ion expectations may 
see that risk as lower in light of th e continued subdued readings on inflation.  
The Desk’s latest survey of primary d ealers indicates that the median dealer 
expects the Committee to continue purcha sing agency-backed MBS at a pace of $40 
billion per month and longer-term Treasury secu rities at a pace of $45 billion per month 
until the end of this year—implying a $1 tr illion increase in the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings during 2013.  The median  dealer also expects the Committee to 
acquire another $60 billion of longer-term Tr easury securities, but no additional MBS, 
during the first quarter of 2014.  Measures of dealers’ uncertainty and disagreement about 
the likely total amount of the Federal Reserv e’s asset holdings have declined somewhat 
since January.  Meanwhile, the survey shows that the median dealer still sees the third 
quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of the first increase in  the federal funds rate; it 
also shows no significant change  in respondents' expected path of the federal funds rate 
following lift-off.  Thus, the asset purchase a nd interest rate decisions of Alternative B 
would not surprise market participants and seem  likely to generate little market reaction.  
However, the size and nature of the ma rket reaction to the new language in 
Alternative B is difficult to predict.  For example, the upda ted assessment of labor market 
conditions in the first paragraph might lead some market participants to conclude that the Committee sees the recent data  as being on a path to substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market, resulting in a downward shift in market participants’ 
expectations regarding the ultimate size of the purchase program.  This effect could be 
reinforced by the changes in paragraph 3, which give greater prominence to the 
Committee’s assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases, and also by the changes in the final sent ence in paragraph 4, which notes that the 
Committee will take account of the extent of progress toward its economic objectives as 
well as the likely efficacy and costs of its purchases when considering changes to its 
purchase program.  The new reference to fiscal restraint in paragraph 1 might offset such 
effects to some extent, as might the more upbeat formulation in the second sentence of 
paragraph 4.  Nonetheless, the result could still be a modest rise in longer-term interest 
rates, somewhat lower stock prices, and a fi rming of the dollar.  Starting with this 
meeting, the time gap between the release of the post-meeting statement and the 
Chairman’s quarterly press briefing has been  reduced to 30 minutes , which could also 
influence the market res ponse to the statement.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some participants may see the incoming data over the inte rmeeting period as 
confirming that, although employment is expanding and economic growth has resumed 
after the fourth quarter lull, the rate of ec onomic expansion and the pace of the decline in 
unemployment will continue to be unacceptably slow.  Indeed, despite the pickup in 
hiring and the decline in the unemployment ra te in February, policymakers may still view 
indicators of labor market conditions, including the low labor force pa rticipation rate and 
the high levels of long-duration unemploymen t and individuals working part time for 
economic reasons, as suggesting that only m odest fundamental improvement is being 
made.  And even with asset purchases continuing at their present monthly pace, some 
participants might judge that the deviation of employment from th eir assessment of its 
maximum level would remain sufficiently larg e to warrant more aggressive policy action 
at this time.  In light of the continuing substantial slack in the labor market, some 
participants may also see a sizable risk that the skills and labor force attachment of long-term unemployed workers will erode, with an adverse effect on the economy’s longer-run economic potential.  In addition, some policymak ers may judge that inflation is likely to 
run appreciably below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent over the next several years.  Accordingly, some policymak ers might prefer Alternative A, which both 
increases the pace of purchases and lowers  the forward guidance threshold for the 
unemployment rate to 5½ percent.   
Some participants may conclude that the incoming information on domestic 
economic activity has become somewhat brighter , but continue to judge that risks to the 
outlook stemming from U.S. fiscal policy and the fiscal and banking strains in the euro 
area are substantial and skewed to the downsid e.  Moreover, members may see the effects 
of a new adverse shock as likely to be signi ficantly more costly and more difficult to 
mitigate than the consequences of economic performance or inflation surprising to the upside.  If so, they may see the degree of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the 
asymmetry in risks and potential costs of a prolonged period of subpar economic performance as pointing to the need for fu rther accommodation.  Some participants may 
judge that an effective way of increasing ac commodation would be to  lower the threshold 
for the unemployment rate in the Committee’ s forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate, thereby indicating a determination to keep  short-term interest rates near zero for 
longer.

 In addition, policymakers may view recent economic developments and their 
assessment of the benefits of purchases of longer-term securities as arguing for an 
increase in asset purchases to  help strengthen the recovery  in the labor market.  In 
particular, they may feel that boosting aggregate demand would generate ancillary 
benefits in the labor market such as raisi ng labor force participa tion and reducing long-
duration unemployment.  Furthermore, some participants may see incoming data as confirming that the purchases made by the Committee since September are delivering 
somewhat greater benefits than they had an ticipated, and without generating appreciable 
costs.  They may therefore conc lude that it is appropriate to step up the rate of purchases.  
Some policymakers may be concerned that ad ditional asset purchases could lead to a 
reduction in remittances to zero and result in a deferred asset.
3  Nonetheless, they may 
see that risk as offset by the very high likelihood that the overall fiscal  effect of additional 
asset purchases will be positive, because such purchases will help spur stronger 
macroeconomic outcomes.4   
An announcement like Alternative A that ra ised purchases of agency mortgage-
backed securities and longer-t erm Treasury securities to a combined pace of $100 billion 
per month would come as a considerable surpri se to market participants.  As a result, 
investors likely would mark up their expectations for the to tal amount of securities that 
the Federal Reserve will acquire  under its flow-based program.  Moreover, according to 
the latest survey, dealers do not expect the threshold language to be changed, so the 5½ 
percent unemployment threshold in Alternative A implies a longer period of very low 
short-term interest rates than dealers curren tly expect.  Therefore,  longer-term interest 
rates likely would decline, inflation compensa tion and equity prices might rise, and the 
                                                 
3 The Committee may also consider a number of approaches that help forestall the possibility of 
zero remittances and a deferred asset; these include the implementation of changes in its remittances policy 
to smooth over time the level of remittances to the Treasury, as well as holding securities for a longer 
period than envisioned in the Commi ttee’s exit principles.  For an analys is of possible remittance policies, 
see the memo titled “Alternatives for Federal Reserve Re mittance Policy” (by S. Allison, S. Carpenter, J. 
Clouse, W. English, G. Evans, J. Faust, J. Huther, J.  Ihrig, E. Klee, M. Leahy, and L. Mize of the Federal 
Reserve Board, and J. Remache of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the Committee 
(corrected) on March 12, 2013.  For an analysis of possible changes to the exit strategy, see the memo 
entitled “Exit Strategy Considerations” (by K. Femia and J. Remache of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York, and J Ihrig, J. Kandrac, E. Klee, and C. Miller of the Federal Reserve Board) that was sent to the 
Committee on March 5, 2013.   
4 Such a judgment would be in line with the staff analysis provided in the memo titled “Fiscal 
Implications of Additional Large- Scale Asset Purchases for the Federal Government and the Federal 
Reserve” (by J. Clouse, W. English, J.  Faust, J. Ihrig, J. Huther, E. Klee,  M. Leahy, and D. Reifschneider of 
the Federal Reserve Board, and J. Remache of the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the

 dollar could depreciate.  However, if invest ors read the statement of Alternative A as 
indicating that the FOMC has a relative ly gloomy outlook for economic growth and 
employment, equity prices might not rise or could even decline.  In addition, changing 
one of the numerical thresholds so soon after adopting it might create significant 
confusion among investors about the extent  to which the Committee feels bound by its 
forward guidance, potentially increasi ng volatility in asset prices.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may view the information received since the January meeting as 
indicating that the ec onomic recovery has gained tracti on and that economic growth is 
likely to pick up over time.  In particular, recent months have witnessed an improvement 
in employment growth and a substan tial rebound in hours worked.  In addition, 
policymakers may now judge the risks to ec onomic growth to be roughly balanced, and 
that overall financial conditions in the Un ited States—with higher equity prices and a 
decline in volatility in recent months—are  very supportive of economic growth.  As a 
result, they might judge it appropriate to  provide less accommoda tion by reducing the 
pace of asset purchases and the total size of the purchase program.   
Some participants may view such a re duction in the pace of purchases as an 
appropriate response to an improved econom ic outlook.  Some others may view a 
reduction as an appropriate initial step toward stopping purchases.  They may think it likely that the recent pace of labor market  gains will continue and will result in a 
substantial improvement in the outlook re latively soon, and might see dialing back 
purchases as an effective way of communica ting to the public that the purchase program 
is probably nearing its end.  S till other participants may favor  bringing the program to an 
end, but they might view an immediate cessa tion of the program as undesirable on the 
grounds that such an abrupt change c ould trigger significan t though short-lived 
disruptions in financial markets.   
Alternatively, some participants might be  concerned that, while core inflation 
seems likely to decline somewhat in the fi rst quarter of this year and inflation 
expectations remain well anchored, the r ecent increase in gasoline prices and the 
resulting boost to headline inflation, coming at a time when  monetary policy is highly 
accommodative and the Federal Reserve’s bala nce sheet remains exceptionally large, 
might raise inflation expectations.  Moreove r, in an environment in which economic 
activity is picking up, the risk that infl ation will exceed the Committee’s longer-run 
Alternatives

 objective now may appear higher than it di d last year.  Against this backdrop, 
policymakers may judge that a timely reduction in the pace of purchas es is necessary to 
prevent an undesirable increase in future inflation that could undermine the public’s 
confidence in the Committee’s commitme nt to its longer-run inflation goal. 
Some policymakers may be skeptical th at the downward pressure on longer-term 
interest rates from the current program of Treasury and agency MBS purchases is having 
a significant effect on macroeconomic out comes.  Alternatively, they may have 
concluded that output and empl oyment are close to their equilibrium levels, and so see 
little, if any, need for additional policy accomm odation.  Some participants may judge the 
prospective costs of further pur chases to be significant.  In particular, some members 
might see further asset purchases as raising th e odds that the Federal Reserve will realize 
significant losses during exit and be worried  about the communications and political 
issues that such losses could raise.  Or they may worry that further purchases by the 
Federal Reserve of safe assets when longer-te rm interest rates are already quite low could 
lead to excessive risk-taking on the part of investors.  Such behavior might undermine 
financial stability over time, thereby putting th e achievement of the dual mandate at risk, 
particularly if supervisory tool s are not sufficiently effective to avoid such an outcome.    
In addition, policymakers may be concerned about the potential effects of further 
asset purchases on the functioning of particular financial markets.  In light of these 
considerations, they might conclude that m oving toward a less accommodative stance of 
policy sooner than indicated by the Committee’s January statement would be appropriate.  Moreover, they might want to make clear that  they are prepared either to increase the 
pace of purchases or to reduce the pace further,  as appropriate, if the outlook for the labor 
market or inflation changes.  If so, the Committee might prefer a statement like 
Alternative C, including the ne w language in paragraph 4.  
A statement like Alternative C would come as a considerable surprise to market 
participants and might well be interpreted as signaling not only smaller total asset purchases but also a significantly earlier re moval of policy accommodation than investors 
had expected.  The Desk’s surv ey indicates that primary deal ers still expect purchases of 
longer-term securities to con tinue at their present pace beyond  mid-year.  Accordingly, a 
statement along the lines of Alternative C would likely lead investors to mark down 
significantly their expectations of the Comm ittee’s cumulative asset purchases, and so 
would cause a sizable upward shif t in market participant’s exp ectations of the likely path

 for longer-term yields.  Moreover, the announc ement of a balanced assessment of the 
risks to the outlook for both growth and infl ation—as in paragraph 2—might cause an 
upward shift in market participants’ expectations of  the likely path for the federal funds 
rate, reinforcing the increase in intermediate- and longer-term interest rates.  However, 
the upward movement in longer-te rm interest rates might be attenuated to some degree by 
the indication, in paragraph 4, that the Committee is prepared to increase the pace of its 
purchases if the outlook worsens.  In addition, if market participants inferred from the 
statement that the key factor motivating th e Committee to reduce the size of its asset 
purchase program was its assessment of the balance between the efficacy and costs of asset purchases, they might push out their e xpected timing of the first increase in the 
federal funds rate, which would also attenuate the effect on yields.  That said, longer-term 
rates would rise, equity pri ces would probably fall, and th e dollar might appreciate.

 DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued in Janu ary appears on the next page, followed by 
drafts for a March directive that correspond to each of th e policy alternatives.  These 
drafts suggest a number of updates to make th e language of the directive consistent with 
the Committee’s post-meeting statements. 
The draft directive for Alternative B inst ructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency MBS at a pace of about $40 billion per month and to continue 
purchasing longer-term Treasury se curities at a pace of about $45 billion per month.  The 
draft directive for Alternative A directs the Desk to purchase additional agency MBS at a

payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and of 
rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

 Projections 
DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY  
Domestic nonfinancial sect or debt expanded at an a nnual rate of 4¾ percent in 
2012, reflecting continued strong growth in fede ral government debt and a solid rise in 
private nonfinancial debt.  For the forecas t period ending in 2015, we project that 
domestic nonfinancial debt will expand at  a slower rate—about 3½ percent each year—
with a slight acceleration in private debt offset  by a slowing in the growth of federal debt 
as the deficit trends lower.  We expect th at growth of nonfinancial business debt will 
diminish over the projection period as co rporate bond issuance steps down from the 
unusually strong pace seen in 2012.  Followi ng a moderate contraction in 2012, home 
mortgage debt is expected to increase slowly over the forecast period as tight lending 
standards ease somewhat and house prices rise further, leadi ng to a gradual decline in the 
number of homeowners who are “underwater.”  We project consumer credit to rise at a 
strong pace over the forecast period, driven by continued robust demand for student and 
auto loans and growth in sp ending on consumer durables. 
Commercial bank credit is anticipated to increase at a moderate pace over the 
forecast period, a bit above its 3¾ percent ra te of expansion in 2012.  Core loans—the 
sum of commercial and industrial (C&I), real estate, and consumer loans—are projected 
to rise at a gradually increasing pace, led by a pickup in real estate and consumer loans.  
In particular, after decreasing in each year since 2009, commercial r eal estate loans are 
projected to increase modestly this year and then to accelerate a bit through 2015 as 
current restraints—high vacancy rates and the poor credit quality of existing loans in this 
sector—ease somewhat.  Similarly, the sta ff anticipates that th e expansion of both 
residential real estate and consumer lo ans on banks’ books will pick up from their 
currently weak pace, reflecting both higher loan demand as the condition of households’ 
balance sheets continues to improve and a gr adual easing of standards and terms on such 
loans.  In contrast, the rapid growth in C& I loans observed in recent quarters is expected 
to moderate over the next three years and to be more in line with the rise in nominal business investment.  Over the forecast pe riod, the growth rate of banks’ securities 
holdings is expected to dimini sh relative to 2012, as deposit growth ebbs and demand for 
bank loans strengthens.

   On balance, M2 is projected to increase at a pace below that of nominal income 
over the forecast period.  For the remainder of 2013 and through 2014, we expect growth 
of M2 and its largest component, liquid depos its, to moderate relative to the rapid 
expansion observed over recent years .  We anticipate that a gradual improvement in 
global financial conditions will encourage invest ors to shift their portfolios away from the 
safe and liquid assets in M2 toward riskier financial assets.   M2 growth is expected to 
slow further toward the end of 2015 in respons e to the projected increase in short-term 
market interest rates and the accompanying rise in the opportunity cost of holding money.

   BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.  All three policy alternatives  include additional 
asset purchases.1  Alternative B continues purchases  of $45 billion per month of longer-
term Treasury securities and $40 billion pe r month of agency MBS.  Alternative A 
increases the pace of securitie s purchases, while Alternativ e C decreases the pace.  All 
three alternatives maintain the 0 to ¼ percen t target range for the federal funds rate and 
retain threshold-based forward guidance for the funds rate based on the unemployment 
rate and the outlook for inflation.  Proj ections under each scenario are based on 
assumptions about the trajectory of va rious components of the balance sheet.2  Details of 
these assumptions, as well as projections fo r each major component of the balance sheet, 
can be found in the Appendix that follows this section.3  
 
    
 
 
                                                 
1 The Committee is assumed to maintain for now its existing policy of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities at auction and of reinvesting prin cipal payments from agency MBS and agency debt 
securities into agency MBS.  The effect of assumi ng that maturing Treasury securities are rolled over at 
auction is very modest; as a result of the maturity extension program, there are cu rrently less than $5 billion 
of Treasury securities in the SOMA portfolio  that mature before January 2016.   
2 The projections assume that the Committee follows an exit strategy consistent with exit 
principles articulated in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting.  For alternative assumptions about 
the exit of unconventional monetary policy and the implications for the evolution of the balance sheet, see 
the memo by K. Femia, J. Ihrig, J. Kandrac, E. Klee, C. Miller, and J. Re mache, titled “Exit Strategy 
Considerations,” which was distributed to the Committee on March 5, 2013.  
3 The entire expected path of the portfolio has implications for the evolution of interest rates, 
economic activity, and Federal Reserve income.  To the extent that market participants have different 
expectations for the size, pace, and composition of purc hases as well as the execution of the exit strategy 
than assumed in these scenarios, the resulting effect s on interest rates, eco nomic activity, and Federal 
Reserve income will differ fr om those presented here.

   For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue agency MBS purchases at a pace of $40 b illion per month and 
longer-term Treasury securities purchases of $45 billion per month through June 2013.  
The purchases total about $500 billion in 2013.  This scenario might be viewed as 
consistent with the description of asset purchases in the statement language of  
Alternative B.4  Overall, under this scenario, SOMA  securities holdi ngs are about $3.3 
trillion at the end of December 2013. 
In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in December 2015, as in the staff forecast.5  Given the exit principles 
adopted by the Committee in June 2011, the date of liftoff is a key determinant of the 
trajectory of the balance sheet.  In June 2015, six months before the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate, all reinvestment is assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio 
begins to contract.  In June 2016, six months after the initial increase in the target federal 
funds rate, the Committee begins to sell its hold ings of agency securities at a pace that 
reduces the amount of these secu rities in the portfolio to zero over five years, that is, by 
May 2021.  Through these redemptions and sales, the size of the portfolio is normalized by April 2019.
6, 7  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA 
                                                 
4 The statement indicates that the Committee intends to continue its asset purchases until the 
outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  It also notes that the 
Committee will continue to “take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”  
In the staff economic outlook, by mid-2013, there will be accumulating evidence of a pickup in economic 
growth and an outlook for substantial improvement in the unemployment rate, which is projected to decline 
from near 7¾ percent in mid-2013 to 7¼ percent in mid-2014 and to 7 percent in late 2014.  Alternatively, 
by mid-2013, the Committee could end the purchase program based on its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases.   
5 At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is projected to be just below 6.5 percent, and core 
PCE inflation is expected to be 1.7 percent.  This lifto ff date for the federal funds rate is the same as that 
assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the January Tealbook.   
6 The tools to drain reserve balances (reverse re purchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the 
balance sheet. 
7 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, determined largely by cu rrency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and a 
projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of re serve balances that is assumed to be necessary to 
conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  A higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead to an earlier normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet.

   holdings essentially matching the growth of Federal Reserve Bank capital and currency in 
circulation.  Total assets are $2.6 trillion at the end of 2025.   
The additional purchases of securities  through the middle of 2013 increase the 
level of SOMA holdings and re serve balances through the medi um term.  Sales of agency 
MBS after the first increase in the federal funds  rate are projected to  result in realized 
capital losses.8  These capital losses, in  conjunction with the rise in interest expense on 
reserve balances, substantia lly reduce Federal Reserve net income; however, Federal 
Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive and no deferred 
asset is recorded.  
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Co mmittee is assumed to step-up the pace of 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to $55 billion per month and of agency 
MBS to $45 billion per month for the next tw o quarters.  Around the end of the third 
quarter, the Committee is assumed to begin to taper purchases and in January 2014 it 
completes all purchases.  These purchases to tal $1 trillion in 2013 and early 2014.  This 
scenario might be viewed as consistent with  the descriptions of asset purchases in the 
statement language of Alternative A.9  The Committee continues reinvesting principal 
payments from agency MBS and agency debt  securities into agency MBS and maintains 
its policy of rolling over maturi ng Treasury securities at aucti on.  In this scenario, SOMA 
securities holdings increase to a peak of $3.8 trillion.  In the Alte rnative A scenario, we 
assume that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is pushed out to July 2016, 
roughly consistent with the reduction in the threshold for the unemployment rate to 5½ 
percent and the added monetary stimulus fr om the increased asset purchases in this 
alternative.  In January 2016, si x months prior to the assumed first increase in the federal 
funds rate, all reinvestments are projected to cease and the SOMA portfolio begins to 
contract.  Six months after the liftoff of the federal funds rate , sales of agency securities 
begin and continue for five years.  The si ze of the portfolio is normalized by November 
2019—a little less than three year s after the start of sales a nd within the timeframe noted 
in the June 2011 exit strategy principles.   
                                                 
8 Under Reserve Bank accounting, securities held in  the domestic SOMA portfolio are recorded on 
an amortized cost basis.  As a result, realized lo sses and gains on securities sold affect the Federal 
Reserve’s reported net income; unrealized losses and gains are not reflected in net income.   
9 Under the staff’s baseline forecast, by early 2 014, the unemployment rate will have fallen to 7½ 
percent and real GDP will be expanding at about a 2¾ percent annual rate.  Moreover, the unemployment 
rate is projected to decline to 7 percent by late 2014 and to 6¼ by late 2015.  Alternative A provides more 
policy accommodation than assumed in the staff forecast, suggesting an even stronger outlook.

   The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of the SOMA portfolio and re serve balances.  As the federal funds rate rises in 2016, 
2017, and 2018, the interest expense on reserve balances increases substantially.  The 
interest expense, combined with the losses re alized on the sales of agency MBS, result in 
a very low level of remittances to the Treas ury in 2018, but no deferred asset is recorded.  
For the scenario that corresponds to A lternative C, the Committee decreases the 
pace of purchases of both longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS to $30 billion 
per month for April.  In May, the Committee is assumed to furthe r reduce its purchase 
pace and to cease all purchases by the middle of  June.  The purchases total $350 billion in 
2013.10  In this scenario, the federal funds rate  is assumed to lift off in December 2014, 
one year earlier than in Alternative B.11  Corresponding to this earlier increase in the 
federal funds rate, reinvestment of principal from maturing or prepay ing securities ends 
and redemptions begin in June 2014, and the por tfolio begins to contract.  Sales of 
agency securities commence in June 2015 and last for five years.  SOMA securities 
holdings in this scenario peak at $3.1 tril lion, and the size of the balance sheet is 
normalized in September 2018, seven months  earlier than und er Alternative B.  
Across scenarios, the peak amount of rese rve balances and th e level of reserve 
balances outstanding at lifto ff are directly related to the magnitude of assumed asset 
purchases.  Under Alternative A, reserve bala nces peak at about $2.6 trillion, while under 
Alternative B, reserve balances peak at $2.2 trillion.  Under Alte rnative C, reserve 
balances rise from their current level to $2.0 trillion.  For the s cenario corresponding to 
Alternative A, reserve balances are $2.2 trilli on when the federal funds rate lifts off from 
its lower bound in July 2016.  For the scenario  corresponding to Alte rnative B, reserve 
balances are $1.9 trillion when the federal funds rate lifts off from its lower bound in 
December 2015.  For the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, reserve balances are 
$1.8 trillion when the federal funds rate lift s off from its lower bound in December 2014.   
                                                 
10 The scaling back of the asset purchase progra m may be seen as consistent with a stronger 
economic outlook than in the baseline. 
11 The scenario assumes that the Committee raises th e federal funds rate before either the threshold 
for the unemployment rate or the threshold for projected inflation is crossed, perhaps because longer-term 
inflation expectations become unanchored or becaus e the Committee concludes that a federal funds rate 
target at the zero lower bound was resulting in financial imbalances that were detrimental to future financial stability.

   In the scenario corresponding to Altern ative B, the monetary base increases 
significantly from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase program and the accompanying 
increase in reserve balances.  Once exit begi ns, the monetary base shrinks rapidly through 
the second quarter of 2019, primarily reflecting a decline in reserve bala nces as securities 
are redeemed or sold.  Starting in the thir d quarter of 2019, after reserve balances are 
assumed to have stabilized at $25 billion, th e monetary base begins to expand, in line 
with the growth of currency in circulation.  Under Alternative A, the monetary base increases from 2012 to 2014 as the level of rese rve balances climbs in concert with the 
expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sh eet.  The base then contracts during the exit 
period until about one quarter after the size of the portfolio is normalized.  Under 
Alternative C, the monetary base increas es from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase 
program and then contracts, on net, until about one quarter after the size of the portfolio is normalized.

Appendix 
This appendix presents the assumptions underl ying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from March 2013 
to December 2025.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on February 28, 2013.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the tables that follow the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in D ecember 2015.  This date of liftoff is consistent 
with the current staff economic forecast and the thresholds described in the January 2013 FOMC 
statement, and it is the same as assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the 
January Tealbook.  The projections for the scenar io corresponding to Alternative A assume the 
target federal funds rate lifts off in July 2016,  roughly consistent with the thresholds and the 
added monetary stimulus from the increased  asset purchases described in the proposed 
Alternative A statement language and seven months later than in Alternative B.  The projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume  the target federal funds rate lifts off in 
December 2014, a year earlier than in Alternative B.  In each case, the balance sheet projections assume that no use of short-term draining tools is  necessary to achieve the projected path for the 
target federal funds rate.

1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreements were used to drain reserves prior to raising the 
federal funds rate, the composition of liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse 
repurchase agreements would be matched by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, 
these draining tools would be wound down as the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so 
that the projected paths for Treasury securities presented here remain valid.

 ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B  are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue purc hases of Treasury securities at a pace of 
$45 billion per month and purchases of agency MBS at a pace of $40 billion per 
month through June.  The Treasury securiti es purchased are assumed to have an 
average duration of about nine years.  The purchases in 2013 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $500 billion.   
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS.  
o Starting in June 2015—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency  MBS and agency debt securities in June 
2016, six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the target federal 
funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by May 2021. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections from the Tealbook.
2  The 
projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee is as sumed to increase the 
monthly pace of purchases to $55 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $45 billion of agency MBS from April through August 2013.  After August 2013, the pace of purchases slows, and purchases end in January  2014.  The Treasury securities purchased 
are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by $1 trillion in 2013 and early 2014.  In addi tion, the Committee is assumed to maintain its existing policy of 
reinvesting pr incipal payments from its holdi ngs of agency debt and agency MBS in 
agency  MBS.  Starting in January 2016, six months prior to the assumed increase in the 
target federal funds rate in July 2016, principal payments from all securities are allowed 
to roll off  the portfolio.  Sales of agency securities begin in January 2017 and continue 
for five years. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed to decrease the 
monthly pace of purchases to $30 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $30 billion of agency MBS in April 2013.  After April 2013, the pace of purchases slows 
                                                 
2 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of March 11, 2013.

 further, and purchases end in June 2013.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed 
to have an average duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA 
portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securi ties by $350 billion in 2013.  The FOMC 
continues to reinvest the proceeds from pr incipal payments on its agency securities 
holdings in agency MBS until June 2014—six  months prior to the assumed increase in 
the target federal funds rate unde r this alternative.  Starting in June 2014, all securities are 
allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency MBS and agency debt securities in  June 2015.  Holdings of agency securities 
are reduced over five years and reach zero by May 2020.   
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases securities will generally exceed their face value, with a larger premium for 
longer-maturity securities.  As a result, in Alternatives A, B, and C, premiums are boosted by roughly $25 billion, $ 12 billion, and $2 billion, respectively, by the time asset 
purchases end relative to a scenario without  these Treasury securities purchases.  The 
increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.   
 The current and near-term market values of new agency MBS purchases are assumed to 
be four percent above face value.  As a r esult, for Alternatives A, B, and C, the $374 
billion, $160 billion, and $88 billion of agency MBS purchases, respectively, will cause 
unamortized premiums on the Federal Reserve ’s balance sheet to rise by roughly $15 
billion, $6 billion, and $4 billion, respectively, relative to a scenario without these MBS purchases.  The increase in premiums is refl ected in higher total assets and in higher 
reserve balances.  
 The asset purchases under all three alternatives put downward pressure on market interest 
rates, in particular primary and secondary mortgage rates.   
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is assumed to decline, as draws under the recent foreign central bank swap auctions mature, a nd is assumed to return to zero in 2014.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  
Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is assumed 
to stay constant at $24 billion.  
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.

  The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $500 million currently to zero in 2015.  
Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by the 
LLC.  On January  15, the Board of Governors approved the elimination of the U.S. 
Treasury 's funding commitment and the repa yment of the initial funding amount plus 
accrued inter est.  Additionally, the Board of  Governors approved the disbursement of 
contingent interest pay ments from TALF LLC to Treasury and FRBNY that equal, 
approxim ately, the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the amount of outstanding 
TALF loans.  The first payment occurre d in February, and additional payments are 
expected to occur on a m onthly basis.  In this projection, the LLC is assumed not to 
purchase any  asset-backed securities.  (It would have to make such purchases if an asset-
backed securi ty were received by the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York in connection 
with a decision of a borr ower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero in 2016.   
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow in line with the staff forecast for money stock 
currency through 2015.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes in circulation grow at the same rate as nominal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements ( RRPs) is assumed to be around $100 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
3 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital 
                                                 
3 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet, the size of the SOMA portfolio, and the level of  annual remittances to the Treasury.  Growth in 
Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two years; if Federal Reserve capital were assumed to 
grow at 10 percent per year, the normalization date would be roughly unchanged, the size of SOMA would 
be a bit smaller after normalization, and annual remittances would, on net, be modestly larger.

 items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  In this Tealbook, none of th e alternatives result in a deferred asset.   
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS4 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note 
is negative 117 basis points in the current quarter.  The effect wanes over time as the 
length of time the securities will be held by the Federal Reserve shortens and as securities 
subsequently roll off the portfolio or are sold until the size of the portfolio is normalized.5 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous te rm premium effect is negative 107 basis 
points.  This estimate is between the term premium effect associated with $1 trillion of purchases in 2013 and the term premium effect associated with $500 billion of purchases. Over the first half of this year, as market participants come to realize that the purchases will end in June, the term premium effect converges to one associated with $500 billion 
of purchases in 2013.  Over the remainder of the projection period, the term premium effect declines slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated normalization of the portfolio.   
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 81 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchases in 2013 
and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A. 
 
 
                                                 
4 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the 
Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs” by C. Li and M. Wei, FEDS working paper #37, 
2012. 
5 The staff projection of the term premium eff ect assumes that the Committee follows an exit 
strategy consistent with the exit principles articulated in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting.  If 
market participants anticipate a different exit strategy , the staff estimate of the term premium effect may 
not be the same as those priced in market rates.  For example, if market participants believe MBS will not 
be sold, then the term premium effect implicit in market rates will be more negative than the staff’s 
estimate.
