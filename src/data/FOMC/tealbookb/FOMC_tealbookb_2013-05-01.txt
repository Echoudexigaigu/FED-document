The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from six policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013 and 2014.  (Medium-term prescriptions de rived from dynamic simulations of the 
rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the le ft-hand columns, four of the six rules keep 
the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound in both the second a nd third quarters of 
2013.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which puts re latively little weight on the output gap, 
prescribes a federal funds rate of about 100 basis points this quarte r and 130 basis points 
next quarter.  The first-difference rule, which responds to the exp ected change in the 
output gap, prescribes a federal funds rate of  about 20 basis points this quarter and 50 
basis points next quarter.  
The right-hand columns display the near-ter m prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.1  For the next two quarters, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based rule  prescribe federal funds rates that are near 
zero, while the Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income  targeting rule prescribe 
markedly negative values for the federal funds rate.  The more-accommodative 
prescriptions arising from the latter two rules reflect their stronger short-run response to 
the staff’s estimate of the output gap, which remains appreciably negative.  
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key  Elements of the Staff Projection.”  As 
described in Book A of the Tealbook, the estim ated output gap is 20 to 30 basis points 
narrower through the first quarter of 2016 than  in the March Tealbook, largely reflecting 
modest downward revisions to levels of potentia l real GDP over recent years.  In contrast, 
the staff forecast for future growth in potential  output is essentially  unrevised, as is the 
outlook for inflation. 
                                                 
1 Although the rule prescriptions are not constrained to be at or above the lower bound, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nomina l income targeting rule, and the first-difference rule 
all place substantial weight on the lagged actual fede ral funds rate, which is s ubject to the lower-bound 
constraint.

Estimates of r* may change at the beginning of a quarter even when the staff outlook is unchanged because the twelve-quarter horizon covered by 
the calculation has rolled forward one quarter. Therefore, whenever the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the memo includes a third column 
labeled "Current Quarter Estimate as of Previous Tealbook."

The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US model after adjusting the model to 
replicate the staff’s economic forecast.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real 
federal funds rate that, if maintained, would return output to potential in 12 quarters.  
Consistent with the staff’s revised assessment of the output gap, the r* estimate for the 
current quarter is about 10 basi s points higher than the current quarter estimate as of the 
March Tealbook.  As has been true since October of 2008, the estimate of r*—currently 
about percent—remains below the estimated actua l real federal funds rate of about 
1.1 percent.  Since last September, the estimated value of r*  has risen about 0.9 
percentage point, reflecting (among other th ings) a larger-than-anticipated improvement 
in labor market conditions, additional a sset purchases, and the moving 12-quarter 
evaluation window. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model that incorporate endogenous responses of 
inflation and the output gap to having the fede ral funds rate follow the paths prescribed 
by the different policy rules, under the assumpti on that the funds rate is constrained by 
the effective lower bound.2  (Alternative policy rule simulations augmented with 
thresholds are discussed below.)   Each ru le is applied from the second quarter of 2013 
onward, under the assumptions that  financial market participants as well as price- and 
wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follo w that rule, and that agents fully understand 
and anticipate the implications of the rule for future real activity, inflation, and interest 
rates.  The exhibit also displays the implications of following the Tealbook baseline policy, which keeps the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points 
as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and average infl ation five to eight 
quarters hence is projected to be less than  2.5 percent; after either  of these variables 
crosses its threshold, the federal funds rate  in the baseline projection follows the 
prescription of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.   
                                                 
2 The staff’s baseline forecast in corporates the macro economic effects of the large-scale asset 
purchase programs that the FOMC has undertaken in  recent years and now assumes that the FOMC will 
purchase a total of $750 billion in longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS during 2013; it also 
incorporates some learning on the part of financial ma rket participants as they gradually come to recognize 
that cumulative purchases will not be as large as they currently expect.  Based on these assumptions, all of 
the policy rule simulations discussed here and on la ter pages incorporate the projected effects of these 
balance sheet policies; the rules th emselves are not directly adjusted  for the effects of balance sheet 
policies.

Under the baseline policy, the unemploymen t rate falls below its threshold during 
the third quarter of 2015; with the resulting switch to the iner tial Taylor rule, the federal 
funds rate rises above ¼ percen t in the fourth quarter of 2015,  the same quarter as in the 
March Tealbook.  Subsequently, the federal fund s rate increases steadily to 3 percent by 
the beginning of 2018 and then slowly rises to nearly 3¾ percent by the end of 2020.  The 
unemployment rate is expected to gradually decline to just above the staff’s estimate of 
the long-term natural rate of unemployment of 5¼ percent by 2018.3  Headline inflation 
rises gradually and settles in at 2 percent from late-2017 on.   
Without thresholds, the different policy rules all call for tightening to begin 
appreciably earlier than under th e Tealbook baseline.  As a resu lt, most of the rules cause 
the real federal funds rate to be persistently higher than in  the baseline forecast, thereby 
resulting in higher unemployment and lower in flation through most of the decade.  The 
exception to this pattern is the nominal in come targeting rule.  Because this policy 
promises to keep the real federal funds rate  persistently below ba seline later in the 
decade, it generates stronger future real ac tivity and higher future inflation.  Indeed, in 
the simulations, the nominal income targeting rule generates inflation above the 2 percent 
goal and unemployment below the natural rate for several ye ars late in the decade.  
Because the public fully anticipat es these developments, long-term real interest rates are 
lower today than under the baseline policy, which in turn makes overall financial 
conditions more accommodative immediately and stimulates real activity in the near 
term.  In addition, greater resource utiliz ation in the short r un and higher expected 
inflation in the future act to boost near-term inflation.  These results depend importantly 
on the assumption that policymakers will adhere  to the rule in the future and that 
policymakers and the public fully understand th e implications of this commitment for the 
path of the economy.   
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which policy rules are subj ect to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.4  For each of the rules, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and aver age inflation five to eight quarters hence 
                                                 
3 The staff’s estimate of the effective natural rate of unemployment declines from about 6 percent 
in the fourth quarter of 2013 to 5¼ percent by the en d of 2017.  It is assumed to remain at this level 
thereafter. 
4 Because the inertial Taylor (1999) with thres holds and the Tealbook baseline are one and the 
same, their results are not shown separately.

is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  Fi nancial market particip ants and price- and 
wage-setters are assumed to understand that poli cy will switch to the specified rule when 
one of the threshold conditions is crossed and to view this switch as permanent and fully 
credible.  In each of the simulations discussed below, crossing the unemployment 
threshold turns out to be the catalyst for switching to the specified rule. 
The simulations with thresholds bring out several important properties of the 
rules.  First, imposing the thresholds post pones the departure of th e federal funds rate 
from the effective lower bound for all five rules.   In all but one instance, the departure is 
postponed by a year or more; for the nominal income targeting rule, the delay is a single 
quarter.  In these simulations, a later departure from the lower bound results in more 
rapid convergence to maximum employment but typically has little e ffect on the path of 
inflation.5  Second, the conduct of policy after the threshold is crossed exerts a major 
influence on the amount of stimulus implied by the threshold strategy.  In particular, post-
crossing policy rules that entail a more gradual increase in the federa l funds rate, such as 
the nominal income targeting rule and the first-difference rule, imply a more rapid 
decline in the unemployment rate before the threshold is crossed.  As a result, these rules lead to an earlier crossing of the threshold and an earlier departur e of the federal funds 
rate from the effective lower bound.  Third, the effectiveness of threshold-augmented 
rules rests heavily on policymakers’ ability to  make a credible commitment to follow a 
particular rule after a threshol d is crossed, and on the private sector’s ability to anticipate 
the paths for the federal funds  rate, real activity, and infl ation implied by that rule. 
The fourth exhibit, “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those based on the March forecast.
6  Policymakers are assumed to place equal 
weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on 
keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’ s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing cha nges in the federal funds rate.  
                                                 
5 An exception is the case of the first difference rule, in which the thresholds combined with the 
rule’s high degree of interest-rate smoothing imply that policy will remain accommodative for an extended 
period of time, which boosts expected future inflation and in turn near-term inflation. 
6 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 2.  The optimal control simulations do not incorporate thresholds.

The simulations indicate that, with the fe deral funds rate constrained to remain 
positive, the optimal control path rises above the effective lower bound in the third 
quarter of 2015, one quarter before liftoff in the staff’s current baseline forecast and in 
the optimal control exercise shown in th e March Tealbook.  Subsequently, the optimal 
control path for the federal funds rate rises to 3 percent by the middl e of 2018 and to just 
below 4 percent by the end of 2020.7 
Although optimal control implies an earlier departure from the lower bound than 
the staff’s baseline outlook, it generates a lower average path  for the real federal funds 
rate that promotes a stronger recovery a nd an earlier achievement of the Committee’s 
assumed objectives.  In particular, the unemp loyment rate drops be low 6.5 percent in the 
first quarter of 2015 and falls to about 6 percen t by the time the federal funds rate leaves 
the effective lower bound; thereafter, the unemp loyment rate declines  to 4.9 percent by 
the end of 2017, temporarily undershooting the st aff’s estimate of the long-term natural 
rate of unemployment.  Inflation reache s the Committee’s 2 percent objective by the 
second half of 2016 and subsequently overshoot s it by about ¼ percentage point before 
gradually moving back toward 2 percent.  The earlier achievement of the Committee’s 
assumed objectives occurs because, given current circumstances, the optimal control 
policy credibly promises to remain highly ac commodative for even longer than under the 
baseline policy, thereby yiel ding more favorable near-ter m expectational effects on 
financial conditions, real act ivity, and inflation.    
In the absence of the lower-bound constrai nt, the optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate would decline to about 1 percent by the beginning of 2014 and 
become positive again in the second quarter  of 2015.  The unconstrained policy would 
bring the unemployment rate down a little faster over the next few years and 
subsequently would keep the unemployment rate  a little closer to the natural rate than 
would be the case under the constrained policy.  The path for inflation is quite similar for 
the unconstrained and co nstrained policies.  
                                                 
7 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

The optimal control policy concept presen ted in “Constrained vs. Unconstrained 
Optimal Control Policy,” corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers 
make choices today that effec tively constrain policy choices in future periods.  The fifth 
exhibit, “Optimal Control Policy: Commitment vs. Discretion,” compares the commitment results with the outcomes simulated from an alternative optimality concept—discretion.  Under discretion, policymakers cannot credibly commit to carrying 
out a plan that requires them to make futu re choices that would be suboptimal at that 
future time, limiting their ability to influen ce private-sector expectations regarding the 
federal funds rate and other variables.  In stead, the private sector knows that future 
Committees will always reoptimize without rega rd for past policymakers’ promises, and 
this behavior leads to less stimulative policy in current circumstances.  Accordingly, 
under discretion, the Committee raises the fede ral funds rate a bit sooner and keeps 
monetary policy somewhat less accommodative than under commitment, so the unemployment rate does not fall as much below its natural rate and in flation does not rise 
as much above the 2 percent objective. 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under A lternative Policies without Thresholds” 
and “Outcomes under Alternativ e Policies with Thresholds,” tabulate the simulation 
results for key variables under each policy ru le discussed above, with and without 
thresholds.

Appendix
Policy  Rules  Used in “M onetary  Policy  Strategies ”
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in "Monetary 
Policy Strategies." In the table, \ (  R _ t \ )  denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter \ (  t \ ) . while the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( \(  \p i_ t \ )  a n d  \ (  \ p i _ { t + 3 |t } \ ) ) , the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast (\( g a p _ t\) a n d  \( g a p _ { t+ 1 |t} \)), and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( \ (  \ D e l t a ^ 4 g a p _ { t + 3 | t } \ ) ) .  The value of policymakers' 
long-run inflation objective, denoted \ (  \ p i ^ * \ ) ,  is 2 percent. The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
\ (  y n _ t \ )  (100 times the log o f the level of nominal GDP) and a target value \ (  y n ^ * _ t \ )  (100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff s estimate of 
potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff s estimate of 
potential GDP.
Taylor (1993) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\)
Taylor (1999) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\)
Inertial Taylor (1999) rule \( R_t = 0.85R_{t-1}+0.15\left(2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)
O utcom e-based rule\ (  R _ t =
1 . 2 R _ { t - 1 } - 0 . 3 9 R _ { t - 2 } + 0 . 1 9 [ 0 . 5 4 + 1 . 7 3 \ p i _ t + 3 . 6 6 g a p _ t - 2 . 7 2 g a p _ { t - 1 } ] \ )
First-difference rule \( R _t = R _{t-1}+ 0.5(\pi_{t+ 3|t}\-\pi^*)+ 0.5( \D elta^4gap_{t+ 3|t}\)
Nom inal incom e targeting rule \( R_t = 0.75R_{t-1}+0.25(2+\pi_t+yn_t-yn^*_t)\)
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff1  The outcome- 
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q1-2006:Q4. The intercept o f the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model.2  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, and the long-run
1 See Erceg and others (2012).
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised the long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2'/i percent to 2 percent. The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change.

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run, quarterly real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated outcome-based rule, and the nominal in come targeting rule include the lagged policy 
rate as a right-hand-side variable.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook” report rule prescrip tions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff 
outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far this quarter.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarters using the projection for the economy of 
FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends 
on a very broad array of economic factors, some of  which take the form of projected values of the 
model’s exogenous variables.  The estimate reported is the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, 
which is generated after the path s of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so 
that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  All three would c ontinue to increase the Federal Reserve’s 
holdings of agency-backed MBS and longer-te rm Treasury securities,  but at different 
rates:  Alternative B would continue securi ties purchases at the pace that the Committee 
specified in its March statement ($85 billi on per month, in total); Alternative A would 
increase the pace to a total of $100 billion pe r month; and Alternative C would expand 
asset holdings at a slower pace of $60 billi on per month.  The three draft statements again 
repeat the stopping condition that the Committ ee “will continue its purchases of Treasury 
and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.”  They also reiterate that “in determining the size, pace, and composition of its 
asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely 
efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as  the extent of progress toward its economic 
objectives.”  All three alternatives would ma intain the 0 to ¼ percent target range and 
threshold-based forward guidance for the federa l funds rate.  Alternatives B and C would 
keep the unemployment rate threshold at 6½ percent, while Alternative A would lower 
that threshold to 5½ percent and state that the Committee “intends to maintain” a highly 
accommodative policy for a considerable time (rather than “expects that” a highly accommodative policy will be appropriate for a considerable time, as in Alternatives B 
and C).  All of the alterna tives would retain the 2½ percent threshold for projected 
inflation between one and two years ahead.  And all would keep the language indicating 
that the Committee will also c onsider other information, incl uding additional measures of 
labor market conditions, indicators of infla tion pressures and infla tion expectations, and 
readings on financial developments, when ma king decisions about how long to maintain 
such a level of accommodation. 
The draft statement for Alternative B is unchanged from the March statement 
except for updating the summary of incoming economic information.  In particular, it 
begins by observing that “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace” and 
goes on to indicate that labor market condi tions “have shown some improvement in 
recent months, on balance,” but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  In contrast, the 
draft statement for Alternative A states that  the “pace of improvement in labor market 
conditions appears to have slowed.”  The draf t statement for Alternative C offers a more

positive characterization of the incoming data, saying that they “confirm” a return to 
moderate economic growth.  Moreover, the draft statement for Alternative C, while acknowledging that the unemployment rate re mains elevated, emphasizes the decline in 
the unemployment rate and observes that “other indicators of labor market conditions 
have shown additional improvement in recent  months.”  All the alternatives again 
indicate that household spending and business fixed investment have advanced and that 
the housing sector has strengthened further.   Alternatives A and B acknowledge that 
“fiscal policy is restraining ec onomic growth,” while Alterna tive C indicates that fiscal 
policy “is somewhat more restrictive.”  Altern atives B and C indicate that inflation “has 
been running somewhat below the Committee’s longer-run objective, apart from 
temporary variations that largel y reflect fluctuations in ener gy prices,” while Alternative 
A says inflation has been running “below” (rather than “somewhat below”) the longer-
run goal.  All three say, as in previous statem ents, that longer-term inflation expectations 
have remained stable.    
Alternative B repeats the March statem ent’s assessment of the medium-term 
outlook, indicating that, with appropriat e policy accommodation, the Committee expects 
that economic growth will proceed at a mode rate pace and the unemployment rate will 
decline gradually toward mandate-consistent levels.  In light of its more positive reading 
of the recent economic data, Alternative C states that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth “will proceed at a moderate pace in coming quarters and then pick up,” and that the unemployment rate “will continue to decline” toward 
mandate-consistent levels.  In contrast, Alte rnative A says that, “absent further policy 
accommodation,” economic growth “might not be strong enough to generate sustained 
improvement in labor market conditions.”   
With respect to the outlook for inflation, Alternative B maintains the formulation 
used in March, stating that the Committee “an ticipates that inflation over the medium 
term likely will run at or below its 2 percen t objective.”  Alternative A indicates that, 
without further policy accommodation, medium-t erm inflation “likely would continue to 
run below” the Committee’s 2 percent objective,  while Alternative C says that inflation 
“will run close to” the 2 percent objective ov er the medium term.  Finally, the draft 
statements for Alternatives A and B, like the March statement, refer to downside risks to 
the economic outlook, while Alternative C says that the Committee “sees the risks to both 
economic growth and inflation as roughly balanced.”

MARCH FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January 
suggests a return to m oderate economic gr owth following a pause late last year.  
Labor m arket conditions have shown signs of  improvement in recent months but the 
unem ployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed 
investm ent advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal 
policy has becom e somewhat more restrictiv e.  Inflation has been running somewhat 
below the C ommittee’s longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that 
largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices .  Longer-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the 
unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee continues to see downside risks to 
the economic outlook.  The Committee also anti cipates that inflation over the medium 
term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to 
continue purchasing additional agency mort gage-backed securities at a pace of $40 
billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per 
month.  The Committee is maintaining its ex isting policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage mark ets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securiti es, and employ its other policy tools as 
appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a 
context of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely 
efficacy and costs of such purchases as we ll as the extent of progress toward its 
economic objectives. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appr opriate at least as 
long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, infla tion between one and 
two years ahead is projected to be no more  than a half percen tage point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations

continue to be well anchored.  In dete rmining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other 
information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

FOMC STATEMENT —A PRIL-MAY 2013 ALTERNATIVE A 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January 
March  suggests a return to moderate that economic growth following a pause late

months .  However, the pace of improvement in  labor market conditions have 
shown signs of improvement in recent months but appears to have slowed, and  the 
unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed 
investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal 
policy has become somewhat more restrictive is restraining economic growth .  
Inflation has been running somewhat be low the Committee’s longer-run objective, 
apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctu ations in energy prices.  
Longer-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stabil ity.  The Committee expects judges that, with 
appropriate without further policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at

Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate might not be strong enough to 
generate a sustained improvement in labor market conditions and  The 
Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will would 
continue to  run below its 2 percent objective.  Moreover,  the Committee continues 
to see downside risks to the economic outlook.   
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to 
continue purchasing additional will increase the pace at which it purchases agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 to [ $45 ]  billion per month and longer-
term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 to [ $55 ] billion per month.  The Committee 
is maintaining its existing policy of reinve sting principal payments from its holdings 
of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at  auction.  Taken together, 
these actions will increase the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
more quickly and  should maintain put additional  downward pressure on longer-
term interest rates, support mortgage mark ets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securiti es, and employ its other policy tools as

FOMC STATEMENT —A PRIL-MAY 2013 ALTERNATIVE C 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January 
March  suggests confirms  a return to moderate economic growth following a pause 
late last year.  Labor market conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent 
months but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Although the unemployment 
rate remains elevated, it has declined further, and other indicators of labor 
market conditions have shown addi tional improvement in recent months. 
Household spending and business fixed inve stment advanced, and the housing sector 
has strengthened further, but fiscal policy has become is somewhat more restrictive.  
Inflation has been running somewhat be low the Committee’s longer-run objective,

Longer-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum

accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace in coming 
quarters and then pick up,  and the unemployment rate will gradually continue to 
decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The 
Committee continues to see downside risk s to the economic outlook.  The Committee 
also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below close 
to its 2 percent objective.  The Committee sees the risks to both economic growth 
and inflation as roughly balanced. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time,

at a pace of $40 [ $30 ] billion per month and longer-t erm Treasury securities at a 
pace of $45 [ $30 ] billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing 
policy of reinvesting principal payments from  its holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auc tion.  Taken together, these actions will increase 
the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities by $60 billion per month and 
should maintain sustain downward pressure on longer-t erm interest rates, support

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee may see the information received during the intermeeting period 
as pointing, on balance, to essentially the same medium-run paths for economic activity 
and unemployment that it expected at the tim e of the March meeting.  The information 
received during the intermeeting period has b een mixed.  The most recent readings on 
household spending and employment have been  disappointing while other data indicate 
further improvement in the housing sector and aggregate economic activity is estimated 
to have increased at a solid pace during the fi rst quarter.  Moreover, broader trends in the 
data over the past few months show moderate  gains in payroll employment and a gradual 
decline in the unemployment rate.  Looking ahead, policymakers may be concerned that 
the effects of sequestration are likely to re duce economic growth in coming quarters, but 
see little effect on the medium-term outlook, particularly in light of more favorable 
financial conditions.  In short, they may not yet see substantial improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market.  In addition, they may anticipate th at, with the U.S. 
economy still operating below potential, and with energy and commodity prices generally 
having declined from their earlier peaks, in flation is likely to remain somewhat below 
levels judged most consistent with the dual mandate, aside from short -run variations that 
reflect fluctuations in en ergy prices.  Furthermore, based on current information 
regarding the likely efficacy and costs of asset purchases, policymakers may conclude 
that the potential benefits of continuing to pur chase longer-term securities at the current 
pace outweigh the costs.  If so, they might  wish to continue expanding the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securities at the same pace as in recent months, and 
choose to make an announcement along the lines of Alternative B.  
Some participants might see the recent data as disappointing,  and as increasing 
the likelihood that it will become appropria te to adopt a still- more accommodative policy 
stance to generate a substantial improveme nt in labor market conditions and raise 
inflation toward 2 percent in coming years.  Th ey may judge that the likely benefits of a 
larger—and longer-lasting—flow of  asset purchases that result s in a considerable further 
expansion of the Federal Reserve’s securitie s holdings would outweigh the likely costs.  
They also may judge that it would be a ppropriate to lower the unemployment rate 
threshold in the Committee’s forward guidance as another way to make policy more 
accommodative.  Nevertheless, in view of the inherent noisiness of monthly data, 
policymakers may decide to maintain the stance of policy embodied  in Alternative B 
until more data are in hand.   
Alternatives

Some other participants may judge that the economic recovery has become self-
sustaining despite temporary restraining factors, and that moving toward a less 
accommodative policy stance would likely be appropriate to avoi d the risks of an 
undesirable increase in inflation over the me dium run.  However, with the unemployment 
rate still well above participants’ estimates of its long-run normal level, recent gains in 
payrolls only moderate, and inflation apparently quite subdued, they may not see a need 
to slow the pace of purchases immediatel y.  Some participants might judge that 
continuing the current pace of asset purchas es is likely to provide some additional 
accommodation, but also see the size of the balance sheet as approaching the level 
beyond which the potential costs of further e xpansion would outweigh potential benefits, 
and thus want to slow or end purchases soon.  But they may be reluctant to slow purchases without clear evidence of sustaine d improvement in labor market conditions 
and so prefer to continue the current rate of  purchases for now in the expectation that the 
economic data will improve in coming months. 
A policy decision along the lines of Altern ative B would be largely in line with 
the expectations of market participants and so would pr obably have little impact on 
market participants’ expectations about future asset purchases and th e target federal funds 
rate or on market prices.  According to the Desk’s latest survey, primary dealers do not 
see major changes in the statement as likely at this meeting, though they anticipate some 
recognition of the disappointing economic data.  In particular , the median dealer expects 
the Committee to continue purchasing agency-backed MBS at a pace of $40 billion per 
month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The 
median dealer also expects purchases to cont inue at their current pace through the end of 
this year, followed by some tapering during the first quarter of next year, raising the total 
amount of longer-term securities held in the SOMA by about $1.3 trilli on relative to their 
level at the end of 2012.  In addition, the survey indicates  that the median dealer 
continues to anticipate that the Committee will maintain its current target for the federal 
funds rate until the third quarter of 2015. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some participants may believe that without a shift to a still more-accommodative 
policy stance, economic growth will not be adeq uate to return the unemployment rate to 
its mandate-consistent level within the next few years.  In particular, they may expect that 
economic activity is unlikely to expand at an above-potential rate in coming quarters, 
Alternatives

particularly in light of the substantial near-t erm fiscal drag now expected.  Participants 
also may judge that inflation has not only been running persiste ntly below target but also 
that it has being trending lowe r since last fall and is likely to continue edging down.  
Moreover, they may read current indicators of the health of labor ma rkets, including the 
decline in the labor force pa rticipation rate, th e persistence of a high level of long-
duration unemployment, and th e still-elevated unemploym ent rate as showing only 
modest improvement in labor market conditions.  With the inflation outlook subdued and 
progress in restoring maximum employment unsatisfactory, some policymakers may 
conclude that a balanced approach to achie ving both sides of the dual mandate requires 
additional monetary stimulus.   
In addition to an unsatisfactory modal outlook, policymakers may also judge that 
downside risks to that outlook—whether from  U.S. fiscal issues  or financial and 
economic conditions abroad—remain sizable.  Moreover, continued uncertainty about 
fiscal policy could restrain household spendi ng and business investment over the rest of 
this year more signifi cantly than appears to ha ve been the case thus far.  In addition, with 
the recent reduction in oi l prices likely to reduce headlin e inflation further in the near 
term, and against a backdrop of still-substantial resource slac k and contained wage costs, 
policymakers may see increasing downside risk s to the outlook for inflation; they may 
also see little risk that infla tion or inflation expectations wi ll move up.  As a result, with 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound, some pa rticipants may want to add 
more accommodation now in order to put the economy on a stronger footing in the event 
that greater headwinds materialize in  the near or medium term.    
If policymakers wished to provide additional accommoda tion, relative to 
Alternative B, they might prefer Alternative A, under whic h the pace of purchases is 
stepped up and the threshold for the unemplo yment rate in the forward guidance is 
lowered to 5½ percent.  Some participan ts may judge that increasing the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of longer-term securitie s more quickly would result in market 
participants’ raising their estimates of the total amount the Federal Reserve will buy and 
therefore lead to a reduction in longer-term interest rates.  That reduction would provide 
additional support to interest-sensitive sectors,  and could, in particular, help strengthen 
the ongoing recovery in the housing sector.  They  may expect that more robust growth in 
the housing sector would increase consumer confidence and support consumer spending, 
given the importance of housing wealth to consumers’ balance sheets.  These participants 
may view the benefits of greater purchases as  likely to outweigh the costs.  In addition, 
Alternatives   
  
  
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
April 25, 2013
Page 34 of 64

some participants may judge that lowering th e threshold for the unemployment rate in the 
Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate from 6½ to 5½ percent—thereby 
indicating a determination to keep short-term in terest rates near zero  longer even longer 
than investors currently anticip ate—would be an effective way of reinforcing the greater 
accommodation today.  Consequently, they may prefer the forward guidance in 
Alternative A, which modifies the fo rward guidance not only by reducing the 
unemployment threshold but also by saying th at the Committee “intends to maintain” 
(rather than “currently anticipates”) a hi ghly accommodative policy stance to support 
“faster progress” toward maximum em ployment and price stability.   
An announcement like Alternative A, wh ich increases purchases of agency 
mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities to a combined pace of 
$100 billion per month, would come as a consider able surprise to market participants.  
According to the Desk survey, no dealer’s  modal forecast anticipates the announcement 
of such a program at the current meeting.  Hence, in response to a statement like 
Alternative A, investors likely would increase  their expectations fo r the total amount of 
securities that the Federal Reserve will acqui re under its flow-based program.  Moreover, 
dealers do not appear to expect any change in the thresh old language; consequently, the 
5½ percent unemployment thres hold in Alternative A would signal a longer period of 
very low short-term interest rates than deal ers currently expect.  Therefore, longer-term 
interest rates likely would decline, inflati on compensation and equity prices might rise, 
and the exchange value of the dollar probably would decline.  If, however, investors read 
the statement of Alternative A as indicating that the FOMC has become more pessimistic 
about the outlook for economic growth and em ployment than market participants had 
been assuming, equity prices might not rise or  could even decline.  In addition, changing 
one of the numerical thresholds so soon afte r their adoption might create some confusion 
among investors about the extent to which the Committee feels bound by its forward 
guidance, potentially boosting the volatility of asset prices and the risk premiums built into market yields.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some participants might see the recent data as confirming moderate economic 
growth, even in the face of more restrictive fiscal policy, and conclude that the economic 
recovery is on a firm footing.  Moreover, th ey may anticipate that economic growth will 
pick up over time as the near-term effects of th e shift in fiscal policy wane.  In support of 
Alternatives

that view, policymakers might point to the average of recent months’ employment 
growth, the solid increase in consumer spending in the first quarter, and further signs of 
improvement in the housing market.  Ind eed, after smoothing through the month-to-
month fluctuations in recent data, policymakers may see the economic recovery as having 
achieved a self-sustaining c ourse that is likely to be associated with ongoing 
improvements in labor market conditions.  In addition, they may judge that the level of potential output is lower than  the staff estimates, that the risks to economic growth are 
roughly balanced, and that overall financial c onditions in the United States are highly 
supportive of economic growth.  As a result, they may no longer see it as appropriate to 
purchase securities at the current pace.     
Some participants may view a reduction in the pace of purchases as an 
appropriate response to the improvement in the economic outlook since September.  
Alternatively, some policymakers may be skeptical that the downward pressure on 
longer-term interest rates from the current program of purchases of Treasury securities 
and agency MBS is substantial, or that it is having a significant effect on macroeconomic 
outcomes.  And while inflation expectations have remained well anchored to date, some policymakers might nonetheless be concerned that the Federal Reserve’s large and 
growing balance sheet tilts the risks toward  higher expected inflation, perhaps because 
the size of the balance sheet could be s een by the public as making exit from policy 
accommodation difficult.  Participants may also worry that further purchases by the 
Federal Reserve when longer-term interest ra tes are already quite low could lead to 
excessive risk-taking in financial markets.  Such behavior might undermine financial stability over time, thereby putting the achievement of the dual mandate at risk, 
particularly if supervisory t ools are not sufficiently effective to avoid such an outcome.  
For these reasons, policymakers might cons ider it appropriate to begin scaling 
back purchases at this meeting and to point  to an improvement in the outlook for labor 
market conditions since the Committee began th e flow-based asset purchase program as a 
way of communicating to the public that the program is  probably nearing its end.

1 For an analysis of several issues to consider when contemplating an ad justment of the pace of 
asset purchases in response to ch anges in the economic outlook or in the assessment of the efficacy and 
costs of purchases, see the memo titled “Changing th e Pace of Asset Purchases” (by S. Carpenter, W. 
English, S. Meyer, W. Nelson, D. Reifschneider, and R. Tetlow of the Federal Reserve Board, and J. 
Egelhof, S. Friedman, L. Logan, and S. Potter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to

participants may favor bringing the program to an end quickly, but they might judge that 
tapering purchases would be better than an immediate cessation of the program, on the 
grounds that an abrupt end could trigger si gnificant though short-lived disruptions in 
financial markets.  If so, they might prefer a statement like Alternative C.  
The Desk’s survey indicates that the me dian dealer expects purchases of longer-
term securities to continue at their present pace until the end of this year, then at a slower pace during the early part of ne xt year.  Accordingly, a statement like Alternative C likely 
would come as a considerable surprise to market participants.  The slower pace of 
purchases likely would be seen as signaling smaller total asset purchases than investors 
had expected, and so probably cause longer-term  yields to rise.  However, this upward 
movement might be attenuated to some degree by the indication, in paragraph 4, that the Committee will continue to take account of the extent of progress toward its economic 
objectives as it determines the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases.  The extent to which longer-term interest rate s would increase would also depend on how the 
policy decision affects investors’ outlook for th e economy and, in light of the quantitative 
thresholds, for the federal funds rate.  That  said, on balance longer-term interest rates 
could rise substantially, equity prices lik ely would fall, and the dollar would probably 
appreciate.

The directive that was issued in Marc h appears on the next page, followed by 
drafts for an April-May direc tive that correspond to each of the policy alternatives.  The 
directive for Alternative B is unchanged; th e drafts for Alternatives A and C suggest 
modest updates to make the language of the directive consistent with the corresponding 
post-meeting statement. 
The draft directive for Alternative B inst ructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency mortgage-backed securities  at a pace of about $40 billion per month 
and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion 
per month.  The draft directiv e for Alternative A directs the Desk to purchase additional 
agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $45 billion per month, and to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $55 billion per month, beginning in May.  The draft directive for A lternative C instructs the Desk to purchase 
agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, and to 
purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, beginning in May.  All three of th e draft directives direct the Desk to maintain the current 
policy of reinvesting principal payments from  its holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.

Projections 
DEBT, BANK CREDIT , AND MONEY 
Domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to have in creased at an annual rate 
of 5¼ percent in the first quarter of 2013, dr iven by a significant expansion in federal 
government debt and a moderate rise in private nonfinancial debt.  We expect growth in 
domestic nonfinancial debt to average 3½ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, slower than its pace in the first quarter , as federal debt advances less rapidly and 
private debt decelerates a bit.  Nonfinancial business debt is  expected to increase at a 
moderate pace over the forecast period, refl ecting favorable financing conditions and 
increasing capital expenditures; growth in th is debt aggregate slows somewhat over the 
forecast period in response to the projected rise in interest rates.  After contracting for the 
past five years, the level of  home mortgage debt is anti cipated to bottom out in 2013 and 
edge up during the subsequent two years.  Ri sing house prices and declining foreclosures 
should help support the modest projected expansion in home mortgage debt, although 
continued tight credit conditi ons for borrowers with subpar credit scores and the 
overhang of negative home equity are anticipa ted to damp the increase.  Meanwhile, we 
project consumer credit to accelerate over th e forecast period, from a growth rate of 6¾ 
percent in the first quarter of  this year to about 7¾ percent in 2015, driven by continued 
strong demand for student loans and a pi ckup in spending on consumer durables. 
Commercial bank credit is anticipated to increase at a moderate pace over the 
forecast period, slightly faster than its 3¾ percent rate of expansion in 2012.  The rapid 
growth in commercial and industr ial loans in recent quarters is  expected to moderate over 
the next few years to a level more in line with the rise in nominal GDP .  In contrast, real 
estate and consumer loans are projected to rise at a gradually increasing pace.  In 
particular, the staff anticipates that commercia l real estate loans, after decreasing every 
year since 2009, will increase modestly this ye ar and then accelerate a bit through the end 
of the forecast period as high vacancy rates on certain property types edge lower and the 
credit quality of existing loans in this sector improves somewhat.  Similarly, the 
expansions in both residentia l real estate and consumer loans on banks’ books, which are 
currently weak, are expected to pick up as standards and terms on such loans gradually 
ease for some borrowers and an improvement in household balance sheets boosts demand.  Meanwhile, the growth rate in banks’ securities holdings is ex pected to be a bit

below that posted in 2012, because deposits  are projected to ebb and demand for bank 
loans to strengthen. 
On balance, M2 is projected to increase at a pace below that of nominal income 
over the forecast period.  For the remainder of 2013 and through 2014, we expect growth 
of M2 and its largest component, liquid depos its, to moderate relative to the rapid 
expansion observed over recent years, with  a gradual improvement in global financial 
conditions encouraging investors to shift thei r portfolios away from the safe and liquid 
assets in M2 toward riskier financial assets.  M2 is expected to contract in the second half 
of 2015 in response to the projected increase in  short-term market interest rates and the 
accompanying rise in the opportunity cost of holding money.

BALANCE SHEET AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to interpretations of Alternatives A,  B, and C.  All three alternatives include 
additional asset purchases, though the pace and amount of purchases differ.1  Alternative 
B continues purchases at the current pace th rough June; purchases are then tapered to 
zero by year-end.  Alternative A increases th e pace of purchases be ginning in May and 
continues the purchases somewhat longer, while Alternative C decreases the pace and 
ends purchases earlier.  All three alternatives maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate and re tain threshold-based forward guidance for the funds rate 
based on the unemployment rate and the outlook for inflation.   
 Projections under each scenar io are based on assumptions about the trajectory of 
various components of the balance sheet.2  Details of these assumptions, as well as 
1 The Committee is assumed to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and 
reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS until six 
months before the first increase in the federal funds rate.  The effect of assuming that maturing Treasury 
securities are rolled over at auction is very modest; as a result of the maturity ex tension program, there are 
currently less than $5 billion of Treasury securities in th e SOMA portfolio that mature before January 2016.   
2 The projections assume that the Committee follows an exit strategy consistent with the principles 
articulated in the minutes of the Ju ne 2011 FOMC meeting.  Other strategies, such as not selling MBS or 
selling short-dated Treasury securities,  could be considered.  See the memo titled “Possible Revisions to the 
Committee’s Exit Strategy Principles” (b y J. Clouse, W. English, J. Faust, E. Klee, L. Logan, and S. Meyer 
of the Federal Reserve Board and J. Remache and S. Po tter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that 
was sent to the Committee on April 22, 2013, for more on this issue.  The implications for the evolution of the balance sheet associated with possible revisions to the exit strategy principles are found in the March 5, 
2013, memo by K. Femia, J. Ihrig, J. Kandrac, E. Klee, C. Miller, and J. Remache, titled “Exit Strategy 
Considerations.”

projections for each major component of the balance sheet, can be found in the Appendix 
that follows this section.3 
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and 
of longer-term Treasury securi ties by $45 billion per month through June 2013.  Unlike 
in March, when purchases were assumed to end at mid-year, the staff’s baseline 
forecast—and our assumption for Alternative B—now assumes that purchases continue 
to year-end, but at a steadily decreasing pace.  These purchas es total $750 billion in 2013.  
This scenario might be viewed as consistent with the description of asset purchases in the 
statement language of Alternative B.4  Overall, under this scenario, SOMA securities 
holdings will be about $3.5 tril lion at the end of December 2013. 
In the Alternative B scenario, we assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in October 2015, as  in the staff forecast in Tealbook Book A.5  Given 
the exit strategy principles adopted by the Committee in June 2011, the date of liftoff is a 
key determinant of the trajectory of the ba lance sheet.  In April 2015, six months before 
the first increase in the target federal funds rate, all reinvest ment is assumed to cease, and 
the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  In April 2016, six mont hs after th e initial 
increase in the target federal funds rate, th e Committee begins to sell its holdings of 
agency securities at a pace that reduces the amount of these securitie s in the portfolio to 
zero over five years, that is , by March 2021.  Through these redemptions and sales, the  
3 The entire expected path of the portfolio has implications for the evolution of interest rates, the 
economy, and Federal Reserve income.  If market par ticipants have different expectations for the size, 
pace, and composition of purchases and for the exit strategy than assumed in  these scenarios, the effects on 
interest rates, economic activity, and Federal Rese rve income will differ from those presented here.   
4 The statement indicates that the Committee intends to continue its asset purchases until the 
outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  It also notes that the 
Committee will continue to “take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as 
well as the extent of progress toward its economic objec tives.”  If the economy evolves as the staff projects, 
by late 2013 there will be accumulating evidence of a pickup in economic growth and an outlook for substantial improvement in the unemployment rate, which is projected to decline from nearly 7½ percent in late 2013 to a bit below 7¼ percent in mid-2014 and to just under 7 percent in late 2014.  Alternatively, by late 2013, the Committee could end the purchase progra m based on its assessment of the likely efficacy and 
costs of additional asset purchases. 
5 At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is projected to be about 6¼ percent, and core PCE 
inflation is expected to be 1¾ percent.  This liftoff da te for the federal funds rate is in the same quarter as 
that assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative B in the March Tealbook.

size of the portfolio is normalized by May 2019.6,7  The balance sheet then begins to 
expand, with increases in SOMA holdings esse ntially matching the growth of currency in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  Total assets are $2.6 tr illion at the end of 
2025.   
The additional asset purchases increase the level of SOMA holdings and reserve 
balances from their already elevated levels.  Sales of agency MBS after the first increase 
in the federal funds rate are projected to result in reali zed capital losses.8  These capital 
losses, in conjunction with the rise in intere st expense on reserve ba lances, substantially 
reduce Federal Reserve net income; however, Federal Reserve remittances to the 
Treasury are projected to remain positive but low, and no deferred asset is recorded. 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Co mmittee is assumed to step up the pace of 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to $55 billion per month and of additional 
agency MBS to $45 billion per month beginning with the month of May through the third 
quarter of this year.  At th e beginning of the fourth quart er, the Committee is assumed to 
begin to reduce the pace, and in early 2014 it ends the purchase program.  These 
purchases total about $1.25 tr illion in 2013 and early 2014.  This scenario might be 
viewed as consistent with the descriptions of  asset purchases in the statement language of 
Alternative A.9  In this scenario, SOMA securities holdings increase to a peak of slightly 
more than $4 trillion.  In the Alternative A s cenario, the first increase in the target federal 
funds rate occurs in mid-2016, consistent with the reduction in the threshold for the 
6 Temporary reserve draining tools (reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented. Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of 
Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse 
repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
7 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, determined largely by cu rrency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and a 
projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of re serve balances that is assumed to be necessary to 
conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion. A higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead to an earlier normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet. 
8 Under Reserve Bank accounting, securities held in  the domestic SOMA portfolio are recorded on 
an amortized cost basis.  As a result, realized lo sses and gains on securities sold affect the Federal 
Reserve’s reported net income; unrealized losses and gains are not reflected in net income.   
9 Under the staff’s baseline forecast, the unemployment rate will have fallen to 7¼ percent early in 
2014, and real GDP will be expanding at an annual rate of about 2¾ percent. Moreover, the unemployment 
rate is projected to decline to just under 7 percent by  late 2014 and to 6¼ by late 2015.  Alternative A 
provides more policy accommodation than assumed in  the staff forecast, sugge sting an even stronger 
outlook.

unemployment rate to 5½ percent and the a dded monetary stimulus from the increased 
asset purchases in this alternative.  In la te 2015, all reinvestments are projected to cease 
and the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  Six months after the liftoff of the federal 
funds rate, sales of agency securi ties begin; they continue for five years.  The size of the 
portfolio is normalized a little mo re than three years after the start of sa les, slightly longer 
than the timeframe anticipated in the June 2011 exit strategy principles.10 
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of the SOMA portfolio and reserve balances.  As the federal funds rate rises after liftoff, 
the interest expense on reserv e balances increases quickly.  The interest expense and 
losses realized on the sales of agency MBS result in an operating loss, which causes 
remittances to the Treasury to cease and a small deferred asset to be recorded on the 
balance sheet for several years,  peaking at about $7 billion.  
For the scenario that corresponds to A lternative C, the Committee immediately 
announces a decrease in the pace of purchases of both longer-term Treasury securities 
and additional agency MBS to $30 billion per month.11  The Committee is assumed to 
further reduce the pace in subsequent meetings and to cease purchases by the end of 
September.  Purchases tota l about $500 billion in 2013.12  In this scenario, the federal  
10 In Alternative A, MBS are sold over a five-year period in order to be consistent with the timing 
assumed in Alternative B.  If sales were assumed to be completed over about four and a half years, the 
portfolio would normalize in three years, within the tim eframe noted in the 2011 exit strategy principles.  
However, the sales pace implied by this strategy could be near the maximum pace that would be 
sustainable without disrupting market functioning. 
11 The staff assumes that the main effect of asset purchases on financial conditions comes from the 
expected size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio over time.  As a result, the macroeconomic effects of a change in the pace of pu rchases will depend importantly on how the change 
influences investors’ expectations of the evolution of the overall size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.  For reference, see the memo titled “Changing the Pace of Asset Purchases” (by S. Carpenter, W. English, S. Meyer, W. Nelson, D. Re ifschneider, and R. Tetlow of the Federal Reserve 
Board, and J. Egelhof, S. Friedman, L. Logan, and S. Potter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that 
was sent to the Committee on April 22, 2013. 
12 The scaling back of the asset purchase program may be seen as consistent with policymakers 
seeing the economic recovery as having reached a self-sustaining course based on the improvement in its outlook for the labor market since last September when the Committee first tied its decision about additional asset purchases to the outlook for labor market conditions.  Alternatively, by September 2013, 
the Committee could end the purchase program based on its assessment that the prospective costs of further 
purchases are significant.

funds rate is assumed to lift off about one year earlier than  in Alternative B.13 
Corresponding to this earlier incr ease in the federal funds rate , reinvestment of principal 
from maturing or prepaying securities e nds and redemptions begin in 2014, and the 
portfolio begins to contract.  Sales of agen cy securities commence six months after liftoff 
and last for five years.  SOMA securities hold ings in this scenario  peak at $3.3 trillion, 
and the size of the balance sheet is norma lized about one-half year earlier than under 
Alternative B. 
There are differences across the scenarios’  peak amount of reserve balances and 
the level of reserve balances at liftoff, which are directly related to the magnitude of 
assumed asset purchases.14  Reserve balances peak at a bout $2.9 trillion, $2.3 trillion, and 
$2.1 trillion under Alternatives A, B, and C, respectively.  When the federal funds rate 
lifts off from its lower bound, reserve balances are $2.5 trillion, $2.2 trillion, and $2 
trillion under Alternatives A,  B, and C, respectively. 
In the scenario corresponding to Altern ative B, the monetary base increases 
significantly from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase program and the accompanying 
increase in reserve balances.  Once exit begi ns, the monetary base shrinks rapidly through 
mid-2019, primarily reflecting a decline in rese rve balances as securities are redeemed 
and sold.  Starting in late 2019, after reserve balan ces are assumed to have stabilized at 
$25 billion, the monetary base begins to expand, in line with the growth of currency in circulation.  Under Alternative A, the moneta ry base increases even more quickly from 
2012 to 2014 than under Alternative B as the leve l of reserve balances climbs in concert 
with the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The monetary base then 
contracts during the exit period until the si ze of the portfolio is normalized.  Under 
Alternative C, the monetary base increas es from 2012 to 2013 because of the purchase 
program and then contracts, on net, until about one quarter after the size of the portfolio 
is normalized.   
13 The scenario assumes that the Committee raises th e federal funds rate before either the threshold 
for the unemployment rate or the threshold for projected inflation is crossed, perhaps because policymakers 
are concerned that longer-term inflation expectations would become unanchored if policy is not tightened or because the Committee concludes that  continuing to keep the federal funds rate target at the zero lower 
bound would undermine future financial stability. 
14 The level of reserve balances is also contingent on the evolution of other balance sheet items.

Appendix 
This appendix presents the assumptions underl ying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet and Monetary Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
The balance sheet projections are constructe d at a monthly frequency from April 2013 to 
December 2025.  The few balance sheet items th at are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on March 29, 2013.  The projections for 
all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the tables that 
follow the bullet points. 
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in Oct ober 2015.  This date of liftoff is consistent with 
the current staff economic forecast and the th resholds described in the March 2013 FOMC 
statement, and it is in the same quarter as assume d in the balance sheet projections for Alternative 
B in the March Tealbook. In the projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the 
first increase in the target federal funds rate o ccurs in mid-2016, consistent with the reduction in 
the threshold for the unemployment rate to 5½ pe rcent and the added monetary stimulus from the 
increased asset purchases described in the proposed Alternative A statement language.  The projections for the scenario corresponding to Alte rnative C assume the target federal funds rate 
lifts off about one year earlier than in Alternativ e B.  In each case, the balance sheet projections 
assume no use of short-term draining tools to achie ve the projected path for the target federal 
funds rate.
1 
1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreements were used to drain reserves prior to raising the 
federal funds rate, the composition of liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse 
repurchase agreements would be matched by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, 
these draining tools would be wound down as the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so 
that the projected paths for Treasury securities presented here remain valid.

ASSETS 
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by 
$40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by $45 billion per month through June 2013.  After June 2013, purchases are assumed to continue, but 
at a steadily decreasing rate, concluding by the end of the year.  The Treasury 
securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years. 
The purchases in 2013 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $750 billion.  
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS. 
o Starting in April 2015—six months prior to  the assumed increase in the target federal 
funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or 
prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency  MBS and agency debt securities in April 
2016, six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the target federal 
funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero 
by March 2021. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections from the Tealbook.
2  The 
projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee is as sumed to increase the 
monthly pace of purchases to $55 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $45 billion of additional agency MBS beginning with the month of May through September 
2013.  After September 2013, the pace of purchases slows, and purchases end in April 2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by about $1.25 trillion in 2013 and early 2014.  In addition, the Committee is assumed to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Starting in late 2015, principal payments from all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  Sales of agency securities begin six months after the lif toff of the federal funds rate and continue

 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed to decrease the 
monthly pace of purchases to $30 billion of  longer-term Treasury securities and 
$30 billion of additional agency MBS beginning  with the month of May 2013.  After 
May, the pace of purchases slows further, and purchases end in September 2013.  The 
Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine 
years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities 
by about $500 billion in 2013.  The FOMC  continues to reinvest the proceeds from 
principal payments on its agency securities holdings in agency MBS until early 2014.  
Thereafter, all securities are allowed to roll o ff the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  
The Federal Reserve begins to sell agency MBS and agency debt securities six months 
after liftoff.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and reach zero by 2020.  
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases securities will generally exceed their face value, with a larger premium for 
longer-maturity securities.  As a result, in Alternatives A, B, and C, premiums are boosted by roughly $35 billion, $ 17 billion, and $8 billion, respectively, by the time asset 
purchases end relative to a scenario without  these Treasury securities purchases.  The 
increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.  
 The current and near-term market values of new agency MBS purchases are assumed to 
be 4 percent above face value.  As a result, fo r Alternatives A, B, and C, the $445 billion, 
$270 billion, and $134 billion of agency MBS purchases, respectively, will cause 
premiums on the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet to rise by roughly $18 billion, $11 
billion, and $5 billion, respectively, relativ e to a scenario without these MBS purchases.  
The increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.  
 The asset purchases put downward pressure on longer-term market interest rates, 
including primary and secondary mortgage rates.  
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is assumed to decline, as draws under the recent 
foreign central bank swap auctions mature, and is  projected to return to zero by the end of 
2014.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  
Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is assumed 
to stay constant at $24 billion.

Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 
 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $400 million currently to zero in 2015.  
Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by the 
LLC.  On January 15, the Board of Governors approved the elimination of the U.S. Treasury’s funding commitment and the repa yment of the initial funding amount plus 
accrued interest.  Additionally, the Board of  Governors approved the disbursement of 
contingent interest payments from TALF LLC to Treasury and FRBNY that equal, approximately, the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the amount of outstanding TALF loans.  The first payment occurred in  February, and additional payments are 
expected to occur on a monthly basis.  In this projection, the LLC is assumed not to 
purchase any asset-backed securities.  (It would have to make such purchases if an asset-
backed security were received by the Fede ral Reserve Bank of New York in connection 
with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero in 2016.  
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL 
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to grow at an average annual rate of 
6 percent through 2015, in line with the staff forecast.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes 
in circulation grow at the same rate as nom inal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements ( RRPs) is assumed to be around $100 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
3 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
3 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet, the size of the SOMA portfolio, and the level of  annual remittances to the Treasury.  Growth in 
Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two years; if Federal Reserve capital were assumed to 
grow at 10 percent per year, the normalization date would be roughly unchanged, the size of SOMA would 
be a bit smaller after normalization, and annual remittances would, on net, be modestly larger.

Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of 
Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  In Alternative A, a small deferred asset is recorded on the balance sheet for several years, peaking at about $7 billion.  
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS4 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note 
is negative 123 basis points in the current quarter.  The effect wanes over time as the 
length of time the securities will be held by the Federal Reserve shortens and as securities 
subsequently roll off the portfolio or are sold until the size of the portfolio is normalized.5 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous te rm premium effect is negative 114 basis 
points.  This estimate is between the term pr emium effect associated with $1.25 trillion of 
purchases in 2013 and 2014 and the term premium effect associated with $750 billion of 
purchases in 2013. By the fourth quarter of th is year, as market participants come to 
realize that the purchases will end in Decemb er, the term premium effect converges to 
one associated with $750 billion of purchases in 2013.  Over the remainder of the 
projection period, the term premium effect declines slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated normalization of the portfolio.  
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 84 basis points.  The effect is 
less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchases in 2013 
and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternatives B and A. 
4 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the 
Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs” by C. Li and M. Wei, FEDS working paper #37, 
2012. 
5 The staff projection of the term premium eff ect assumes that the Committee follows an exit 
strategy consistent with the exit principles articulated in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting.  If 
market participants anticipate a different exit strategy , the staff estimate of the term premium effect may 
not be the same as those priced in market rates.  Fo r example, if market participants believe agency MBS 
will not be sold, then the term premium effect implicit in market rates will be more negative than the staff’s 
estimate.
