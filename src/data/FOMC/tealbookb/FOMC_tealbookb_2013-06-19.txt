Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the fede ral funds rate from six policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013 and 2014.  (Medium-term prescriptions de rived from dynamic simulations of the 
rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the le ft-hand columns, four of the six rules keep 
the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound in both the third and fourth quarters of 
2013.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which puts re latively little weight on the output gap, 
prescribes a federal funds rate of about 75 ba sis points next quarter followed by a further 
increase in the fourth quarter.  The first-di fference rule, which responds to the expected 
change in the output gap, prescribes a federa l funds rate of about 40 basis points in the 
third quarter and about 80 basis poi nts in the subsequent quarter.  
The right-hand columns display the near-ter m prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.1  For the next two quarters, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based ru le prescribe federal funds rates just below 
zero.  In contrast, the Taylor (1999) rule, wh ich responds more strongly to the staff’s 
estimate of the current output gap, and the nom inal income targeting rule, which responds 
also to the cumulative shortfall of inflation below the assumed 2 percent target since 
2008, prescribe markedly more negative values for the federal funds rate. 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key Elements of the Staff Projection.”  Since the 
last Tealbook, the staff has made several revi sions to its historical  and projected supply-
side assumptions, incorporating both a faster decline in the natural rate of unemployment 
and a slightly more pronounced fall in  trend labor force participation.2  These changes in 
                                                 
1 Four of these rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nominal income 
targeting rule, and the first-difference rule—all place subs tantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed thus far this quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table are indirectly affected by 
the lower bound.

  supply-side assumptions extend back to the st art of 2011.  On net, these revisions imply a 
slightly wider unemployment gap over the medium term, consistent with the trajectory 
for the output gap—which is now about 20 to 40 basis points wider through 2015—
shown in the bottom left panel of the exhibi t.  Though the unemployment gap is slightly 
wider, the unemployment rate—not shown on th e exhibit—is now expected to cross the 
FOMC’s 6½ percent threshold in the first quart er of 2015, two quarters earlier than in the 
April Tealbook.  As shown in the bottom right panel, the staff’s forecast for inflation is essentially unrevised, except for a small dow nward revision to the near-term projection 
that reflects primarily the effects of  sequestration on medical costs.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated by the FRB/US mode l after adjusting it to replicate the 
staff’s economic forecast.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained, would return output to  potential in 12 quarters.  Consistent with 
the staff’s unchanged assessment that the output gap will essentially close by late 2016, the r* estimate for the current qu arter is little changed from the April Tealbook.  As has 
been true since late 2008, the estimate of r*—currently about 1.40percent—remains 
below the estimated actual real federal funds rate of 1.15 percent.  Since last September, 
the estimated value of r* has risen by about 100 basis points, reflecting (among other 
things) a considerable reduction, on net, in the staff’s estimate of the level of potential 
GDP; the shift forward in the 12-quarter ev aluation window toward a more advanced 
stage of the economic recovery; and the stim ulus provided by additi onal asset purchases. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model that incorporate endogenous responses of 
inflation and the output gap implied by having the federal funds rate follow the paths 
prescribed by the different policy rules, under the assumption that the funds rate is 
constrained by the effective lower bound.

Open Market Committee (June 7, 2013).  The staff now estimates that the natural rate rose from 5 percent 
prior to the recession to 6 percent in late 2009, but that improvements since that time in labor market 
functioning, together with permanent departures from the labor force of some of the long-term unemployed, have lowered it to 5¾ percent currently.  The staff anticipates that these forces will continue 
to reduce the natural rate un til it reaches its long-ru n level of 5¼ percent in late 2015, two years earlier than 
in the previous Tealbook.   
3 The staff’s baseline forecast in corporates the macro economic effects of the large-scale asset 
purchase programs that the FOMC has undertaken in recent years, and it embeds the assumption that the FOMC will purchase a total of $750 billion in long er-term Treasury securities and agency MBS during

  incorporate thresholds are discussed below.)  Each rule is applied from the third quarter 
of 2013 onward, under the assumptions that financia l market participants as well as price- 
and wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follow that rule and that agents fully 
understand and anticipate the implic ations of the rule for futu re real activity, inflation, 
and interest rates.   
The exhibit also displays the implica tions of following the Tealbook baseline 
policy.  That policy keeps the federal funds ra te at its effective lower bound of 12.5 basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is a bove 6.5 percent and averag e inflation five to 
eight quarters hence is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  After either of these 
variables crosses its threshold, the federal funds rate in the baseline projection follows the 
prescription of the inertial Tayl or (1999) rule.  In the cu rrent baseline projection, the 
unemployment rate falls below its threshold during the first quarte r of 2015, two quarters 
earlier than in April; this steeper decline pr imarily reflects the staff’s reassessment of the 
pace of improvement in labor market functioning.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate rises 
above ¼ percent in mid-2015, and then climbs to 2¼ percent by late 2016 and to nearly 4 
percent late in the de cade.  Under this assumed funds rate path, the unemployment rate is 
projected to gradually decline towards the staff’s estimate of the long-term natural rate of 
unemployment of 5¼ percent by late 2017, acco mpanied by a gradual rise in headline 
inflation to 2 percent over the same period.4 
Without thresholds, the different policy ru les mostly call for tightening to begin 
appreciably earlier than under th e Tealbook baseline.  As a resu lt, most of the rules cause 
                                                                                                                                                 
2013; it also incorporates some learni ng on the part of financial market participants as they gradually come 
to recognize that cumulative purchases will not be as large as they currently expect.  Based on these 
assumptions, all of the policy rule simulations discussed here and on later pages incorporate the projected 
effects of these balance sheet policies; the rules them selves are not directly ad justed for the effects of 
balance sheet policies.   
4 Compared with the April Tealbook, the baseline path for the federal funds rate is somewhat 
higher until late in the decade, reflecting the net effect of two opposing forces.  On the one hand, the staff’s 
supply-side revisions imply somewhat more slack, on average, over the medium term, and by itself this 
change would make the projected path of the funds rate lower than in the April baseline.  On the other hand, because of the rule’s partial adjustment feature, the fact that the funds rate starts to adjust upwards two quarters earlier than in the Apr il baseline contributes to a higher funds rate path not only during the 
second half of 2015 but also for the next few years.  On balance, the latter effect dominates and the baseline 
path for the funds rate is persistently higher than in the previous Tealbook through the end of the decade.  
However, because the projected pace of tightening after lifto ff is now less rapid than in the previous 
Tealbook (reflecting in part the re visions to the output gap), the difference between the current and April 
paths narrows markedly between 2015 and 2017.

  the real federal funds rate to be persistently higher than in  the baseline forecast, thereby 
resulting in higher unemployment and lower in flation through most of the decade.   
The exception to this pattern is the nomina l income targeting rule.  Because this 
policy keeps the real federal funds rate pers istently below baseline for the rest of the 
decade, it generates stronger fu ture real activity and higher fu ture inflation.  With markets 
assumed to fully anticipate these developments , longer-term real interest rates are lower 
today than under the baseline policy, which in turn makes overall financial conditions 
more accommodative today and stimulates real activity in the near term.  In addition, 
greater resource utilization in the short run and higher expect ed future inflation act to 
boost near-term inflation.  As has been true for some time, the outcomes for inflation and 
unemployment simulated from the nominal inco me targeting rule are similar in some 
ways to the optimal control paths described further below.  In particular, as in the optimal 
control simulations, the nominal income targ eting rule generates inflation above the 2 
percent goal and unemployment below the natural rate for several years later in the 
decade.   
For each of the simulated rules, the results depend importantly on the assumption 
that policymakers will adhere to the rule in the future and that policymakers and the 
public fully understand the implications of this commitment for the path of the economy.  
The crucial role of this commitment and its  assumed credibility can be appreciated by 
noting the striking similarity in the paths of the nominal federal funds rate under the baseline and the nominal income targeting rule , which stands in contrast to the marked 
difference in outcomes for inflation and unemployment in the two simulations.  Compared with the baseline forecast, the nomin al income targeting rule generates a more 
rapid recovery in the unemploymen t rate and a quicker increase in inflation to 2 percent.  
These differences in outcomes result from the assumed commitments to very different reaction functions for interest -rate policy—in particular the promise under the nominal 
income targeting rule to adjust the nominal federal funds rate until the rule’s target for 
nominal GDP has been achieved—and not from  the small differences in the simulated 
paths for the nominal  federal funds rate shown in the exhibits.

  The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which policy rules are subj ect to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.5  For each of the rules, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and aver age inflation five to eight quarters hence 
is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  Fi nancial market particip ants and price- and 
wage-setters are assumed to understand that poli cy will switch to the specified rule when 
one of the threshold conditions is crossed and to view this switch as permanent and fully 
credible.  In each of the simulations discussed below, crossing the unemployment 
threshold turns out to be the catalyst for switching to the specified rule. 
The simulations with thresholds bring out several important properties of the 
rules.  First, imposing the thresholds post pones the departure of th e federal funds rate 
from the effective lower bound for all of the rules except the nomina l income targeting 
rule.  In these cases, the depa rture is postponed by a year or  more, resulting in a more-
rapid convergence to maximum employment but with typically little effect on the path of inflation.
6  All of the threshold-augmented rules prescribe the first increase in the federal 
funds rate around mid-2015. 
Second, the nominal income targeting rule currently generates the same 
prescriptions for the federal funds rate, and the same outcomes for inflation and 
unemployment, whether thresholds are imposed or not.  
Third, the conduct of policy af ter the threshold is crossed exerts a major influence 
on the amount of stimulus implied by the threshold strategy.  In particular, policy rules 
that entail relatively swift increases in the real federal funds rate  after the unemployment 
threshold has been crossed—such as the Tayl or (1993) rule and th e Taylor (1999) rule—
imply an overall more gradual decline in the un employment rate than the other rules.  As 
a result, these rules lead to a later crossing of the threshold and a later departure of the 
federal funds rate from the effective lower bound.   
                                                 
5 Because the inertial Taylor (1999) with threshol ds and the Tealbook baseline are the same, their 
results are not shown separately. 
6 An exception is the case of the first-difference rule, in which the thresholds combined with the 
rule’s high degree of interest-rate smoothing imply that policy will remain accommodative for an extended 
period of time, boosting expected future inflation and consequently near-term inflation.

  Finally, the effectiveness of threshold-augmented rules rests heavily on 
policymakers’ ability to make a credible commitment to follow a particular rule after a 
threshold is crossed, and on the private sector ’s ability to anticipate the paths for the 
federal funds rate, real activity, a nd inflation implied by that rule. 
The fourth exhibit, “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those based on the April forecast.7  Policymakers are assumed to place equal 
weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’ s estimate of the effective natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.
8  
The simulations indicate that, with the fe deral funds rate constrained to remain 
positive, the optimal control path for the federa l funds rate rises above the effective lower 
bound in the third quarter of 2015—the same  quarter as in the April Tealbook.  
Subsequently, the optimal control path for th e federal funds rate rises to 3 percent by 
early 2018 and to almost 4 percent by the end of 2020.9  The path for the federal funds 
rate prescribed by optimal control thus re mains at the effective lower bound for one 
quarter longer than in the Tealbook baseline projection and rises a little more gradually 
over the following year. 
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal c ontrol policy promotes a stronger economic 
recovery while allowing inflation to rise  only about ¼ percentage point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent goal.  In particular , the unemployment rate drops below 6½ 
percent by late 2014 and reaches 5½ percent by th e time the federal funds rate leaves its 
effective lower bound; thereafter,  the unemployment rate dec lines to 4¾ percent by early 
2017, thus running below the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployment for a 
                                                 
7 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 3. 
8 The optimal control simulations do not incorporate thresholds. 
9 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

  time.10  Inflation reaches the Committee’s 2 percent objective by early 2016 and 
subsequently rises to about 2¼ percent before  gradually moving back toward 2 percent.  
The swifter achievement of the Committee’s assumed objectives occurs because the 
optimal control policy credibly promises to remain highly accommodative for even 
longer than under the baseline policy, there by yielding more favorable effects in the 
current circumstances on financial conditions, re al activity, and inflation in the near term 
through effects on the private sector’s expectations about future policy. 
In the absence of the lower-bound constrai nt, the optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate would decline to about 1 percent by late 2013 and become positive 
again by mid-2015, rising thereafter a little quick er than in the case of constrained policy.  
The unconstrained policy would bring the unemployment rate down a little faster over the 
next few years and subsequently would keep th e unemployment rate a li ttle closer to the 
natural rate than would be the case under the constrained policy.  The path for inflation is 
quite similar for the unconstrain ed and constrained policies.  
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under A lternative Policies without Thresholds” 
and “Outcomes under Alternativ e Policies with Thresholds,” tabulate the simulation 
results for key variables under each policy ru le discussed above, with and without 
thresholds.  
                                                 
10 The policy prescriptions from optimal control are little changed from those in the previous 
Tealbook even though the simulated trajectory for the unemployment rate is noticeably lower than before 
because—as discussed above—the staff expects the natural rate of unemployment to decline more rapidly 
than before.

1. With the exception of constrained optimal control, monetary policy is specified to keep the federal funds rate
at its effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and
projected one-year-ahead inflation is less than 2.5 percent. Once either of these thresholds is crossed, the federal
funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified rule. Policy in the Tealbook baseline also uses these threshold
conditions and switches to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule once either of these thresholds is crossed.

Appendix
Policy  Rules  Used in “Monetary  Policy  Strategies ”
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in "Monetary Policy 
  Strategies." In the table, \( R_t\) denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter \( t\). while t  he 
right-hand-side variables include the staff s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation for   the 
current quarter and three quarters ahead (\( \pi_t\) and \( \pi_{t+3|t}\)), the output gap estimate for the 
  current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast (\( gap_t\) and \( gap_{t+1|t}\)), and the forecast 
of   the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap (\( \Delta^4gap_{t+3|t}\)). The value of  
policymakers' long-run inflation objective, denoted \( \pi^*\), is 2 percent. The nominal income   
targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal  
income \( yn_t\) (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value \( yn^*_t\) (100 times  
the log of target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff s estimate 
of  potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target  nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff s estimate of 
potential GDP.
Taylor (1993) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\)
Taylor (1999) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\)
inertial Taylor (1999) rule \( R _t = 0.85R _{t-1}+0.15\left(2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)
O utcom e-based rule\( R_t = 1.2R_{t-1}-0.39R_{t-2}+0.19[0.54+1.73\pi_t 
+3.66gap_t-2.72gap_{t-1}]\)
First-difference rule \( R _ t =  R _ { t-1 } + 0 .5 (\p i_ { t+ 3 |t} \-\p i^ * )+ 0 .5 ( \D e lta ^ 4 g a p _ { t+ 3 |t} \)
Nominal income targeting rule \( R_t = 0.75R_{t-1}+0.25(2+\pi_t+yn_t-yn^*_t)\)
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff.1  The outcome- 
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q1-2006:Q4. The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model. 2 The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules, and the long-run
1 See Erceg and others (2012).
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised the long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2 V percent to 2 percent. The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change.
Authorized for Public Release
   
intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run, quarterly real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated outcome-based rule, and the nominal in come targeting rule include the lagged policy 
rate as a right-hand-side variable.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook” report rule prescrip tions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff 
outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarter s using the output projection from FRB/US, the 
staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very 
broad array of economic factors, some of which ta ke the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhi bit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

 Monetary Policy Alternatives  
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  As always, the Co mmittee could blend elements of the draft 
statements to construct its desired statement. 
In summarizing recent economic developmen ts, all of the alternatives note that 
economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  As in the May FOMC 
statement, all of the alternatives state that “household spending and business fixed 
investment advanced, and the housing sector ha s strengthened furthe r.”  All characterize 
fiscal policy as restraining economic gr owth; Alternative A also notes slower 
manufacturing activity.  Alternative B indicates that there has been “further 
improvement” in labor market conditions in re cent months, while Alternative C indicates 
that labor market conditions have “conti nued to improve,” citing “ongoing gains in 
payroll employment.”  Alternative A offers a less positive characterization of the labor market, indicating that labor market condi tions have shown “some improvement,” on 
balance.  All three alternatives continue to characterize the unemployment rate as 
elevated.  In line with the previous FOMC statement, Alternatives B and C indicate that inflation “has been running somewhat be low the Committee’s l onger-run objective” and 
that longer-term inflation expectations “have remained stable.”  Alternative A also 
mentions the stability of infl ation expectations, but states that inflation has been running 
“below” its longer-run objective, “even apar t from” temporary variations in energy 
prices. 
In characterizing the economic outlook, bot h Alternatives B and C continue to 
state that, with appropria te policy accommodation, the Committee expects economic 
growth to proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate to decline gradually 
toward mandate-consistent levels.  Alternativ es B and C also continue to say that the 
Committee “anticipates that inflation over the me dium term likely will run at or below its 
2 percent objective.”  Altern ative B indicates that the dow nside risks to the outlook for 
the economy, and also the labor market, have diminished since the fall.  Alternative C 
interprets recent developments even more favorably, stating that downside risks have diminished, as in Alternative B, and a dding that “the Committee is becoming more 
confident that labor market conditions will co ntinue to improve over the medium run.”

   Alternative A takes a different approac h, indicating that the outlook, conditioned 
on “a balanced approach to fostering maximu m employment and price stability,” is for 
moderate growth, a gradually  declining unemployment rate , and inflation moving up to 
its 2 percent objective, “or even modestly hi gher for a time.”  Alternative A also retains 
the language that the Committee “continues to see downside risks to the economic 
outlook.” 
Regarding balance sheet policy, Alternatives A and B continue purchases of 
agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities  at the same monthly rates as those the 
Committee specified in May.  In contrast, A lternative C reduces the monthly flow of 
purchases of both agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities to [$35] billion each 
per month.  All of the alternatives again report that the Committee will continue its 
securities purchases “until the outlook for th e labor market has improved substantially in 
a context of price stability,” th at the Committee is prepared to  alter the pace of purchases 
“as the outlook for the labor market or inflat ion changes,” and that it “will continue to 
take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the 
extent of progress toward its economic objectives.”  In addition, the new language in Alternative B that points to “diminished” dow nside risks to the outlook for “the economy 
and the labor market” is intended to signal th at the Committee is prepared to reduce the 
pace of purchases if the data in coming m onths show continuing improvement in labor 
market conditions.  All three alternatives note that the Committee is maintaining its 
existing policy of reinvesting principal paymen ts from its holdings of agency debt and 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling ove r maturing Treasury securities at auction.  
In addition, Alternative A adds language declaring that the Committee now intends “to rely upon the paydowns of prin cipal rather than sales of  agency mortgage-backed 
securities when it eventually becomes a ppropriate to reduce its holdings of those 
securities.” 
All three alternatives would maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate and retain quantitative th reshold-based forward guidance for the funds 
rate.  All the alternatives would keep the 2½ percent threshold for projected inflation 
between one and two years ahead.  Altern atives B and C would also retain the 
unemployment rate threshold at 6½ percent, while Alternative A would lower this 
threshold to either 6 or 5½ percent.  Altern ative C states that the Committee “reaffirms” 
(rather than “currently anticipates”) that th e federal funds rate w ill remain exceptionally 
low at least until one of the thresholds is crossed; the use of “reaffirms” is meant to 
Alternatives

   emphasize that reducing the pace of asset purchases does not signal a change in the 
Committee’s reaction function for the federal funds rate.  Alternative A differs from 
Alternatives B and C in providing additiona l guidance about how the Committee plans to 
remove policy accommodation.  In particular , Alternative A notes that the Committee 
“expects… that it will be appropriate” to adjust  policy “gradually in order to foster strong 
growth in employment and inflation at 2 percent,  or [even] modestly higher for a time.”     
The following table summarizes key elements of the alternative statements.  The 
summary table is followed by complete draf ts of the three statements and then by 
arguments for each alternative.

 MAY FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor 
market conditions have shown some improve ment in recent months, on balance, but 
the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed 
investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal 
policy is restraining economic growth.  Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart fr om temporary variations that largely 
reflect fluctuations in en ergy prices.  Longer-term infl ation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee continues to see downside risks to 
the economic outlook.  The Committee also anti cipates that inflation over the medium 
term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to 
continue purchasing additional agency mort gage-backed securities at a pace of $40 
billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per 
month.  The Committee is maintaining its ex isting policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage mark ets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securiti es, and employ its other policy tools as 
appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a 
context of price stability.  The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace 
of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.  In de termining the size, pace, and composition of 
its asset purchases, the Committee will contin ue to take appropriate account of the 
likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appr opriate at least as 
long as the unemployment rate remains above  6½ percent, infla tion between one and

 two years ahead is projected to be no more  than a half percen tage point above the 
Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations 
continue to be well anchored.  In dete rmining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and in flation of 2 percent.

reinvesting principal payments from its  holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  In addition, the Committee now intends to 
rely upon paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency mortgage-backed 
securities when it eventually becomes a ppropriate to reduce its holdings of those

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Based on information received during th e intermeeting period, policymakers may 
continue to expect the pace of economic rec overy to be moderate, and inflation to be 
subdued, for some time.  The Committee may j udge that recent data point to modest 
further advances in consumer and business spending along with furt her recovery in the 
housing market, which are helping to offset the contraction in gove rnment spending that 
is restraining overall economic growth.  Recent indicators also suggest that labor market 
conditions have continued to improve, with pa yroll employment expanding moderately in 
April and May, although the unemployment ra te—at 7.6 percent in May—is still well 
above participants’ estimates of its long-run normal level.  Based on these developments, 
they may conclude that the outlook for the labor  market, while better than last September, 
has not yet “improved substantially.”  Moreover, the Committee may judge that progress 
towards its objectives is not yet sufficient to  warrant a reduction in the pace of purchases.  
With regard to inflation, participants might  see the incoming data as consistent with 
inflation running at or below the Committee’ s 2 percent objective in the medium run, 
particularly in light of still-considerable resource slack in the economy.  Against this 
backdrop and based on their current assessments  of the likely efficacy and costs of asset 
purchases, policymakers may conclude that th e likely benefits of continuing to purchase 
longer-term securities at  the current pace outweigh the potenti al costs.  If so, participants 
may wish to continue acquiring longer-term securities at the same pace as in recent months and to make an announcement along th e lines of Alternative B, which adds 
language that is intended to signal that the Committee is preparing to reduce the pace of 
purchases if the data in coming months show  sufficient further improvement in labor 
market conditions. 
Some participants may see the fact that  moderate economic growth has continued 
in the face of ongoing fiscal drag as an indication that the recovery  is gaining traction, 
and so they may judge it appropriate to slow th e pace of asset purchases in the near future 
to reduce the risk of an undesi rable increase in inflation over the medium run or of a 
buildup of excessive risk-taking in the financial sector.  However, with the 
unemployment rate still elevat ed, recent gains in payrol ls only moderate, inflation 
apparently quite subdued, and signs of fina ncial vulnerabilities in credit markets not 
widespread, they may not see a need to slow  the pace of purchases at this meeting.  
Furthermore, they may be unsure about whether the economy has experienced the full 
effects of the tighter fiscal policy put in plac e earlier this year and may view it as prudent 
Alternatives

 to wait for more information before deciding to adjust the pace of asset purchases.  Some 
participants may worry that the size of th e balance sheet could be nearing the level 
beyond which the costs of further expansion w ould outweigh benefits.  Nevertheless, they 
may conclude that that level has not yet been reached and prefer to acquire securities at 
the current pace while continuing to evaluate  the efficacy and costs of asset purchases, 
leaving open the possibility of dialing back or discontinuing purchases if their future 
assessments were to indicate that the marginal costs associated with the purchase program have begun to exceed the marginal benefits. 
Alternatively, some participants may c onclude that aggregate economic activity 
and labor market conditions have improved to some extent, but they may see a  
still-more-accommodative policy stance as a ttractive in order to generate a more-
substantial improvement in labor market c onditions and to move inflation toward 2 
percent more rapidly in coming years.  These pa rticipants may judge that the benefits of a 
longer-lasting—and likely larger—asset purchase program could outweigh the costs.  
They may even see other steps to provide additional accommodation, such as lowering 
the unemployment rate threshold, as potentially appropriate.  Neverthele ss, in view of the 
inherent noisiness of monthly data and the possi ble risks and costs associated with larger 
and more rapid asset purchases or th e other means of providing additional 
accommodation under consideration, policymakers may decide to maintain the existing pace of purchases, as in A lternative B, recognizing that doing so leaves open the 
possibility of increasing the pace of asset purchases, conti nuing the purchases for longer 
than currently expected by the Committee, or providing additional forward guidance 
about the federal funds rate if th e economic outlook were to weaken. 
According to the Desk’s latest survey, primary dealers do not expect major 
changes in the statement at this meeting.  The median dealer’s expectations for the 
cumulative increase in the SOMA in 2013 and 2014 and for the timing of reductions in 
the pace of asset purchases did not change appr eciably since the previous dealer survey.  
However, surveys of broader groups of ma rket participants, along with anecdotal 
evidence, indicate that many market participants now expect a reduction in the current pace of asset purchases to occur earlier than th ey had expected in April.  Altogether, this 
evidence suggests that a policy decision along the lines of Alte rnative B would largely be 
in line with many market participants’ expect ations; nevertheless, the new language that 
the Committee sees diminished downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the

 labor market could be somewhat surprising, a nd interest rates might move higher, equity 
prices could fall, and th e dollar could appreciate. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some participants might see the recent data as confirming prospects for sustained 
economic growth even in the face of more-re strictive fiscal policy, and so be more 
confident that the economic r ecovery is now on a firm footing.  Indeed, they may judge 
that the pace of expansion in private demand, despite the fi scal contraction, points to 
further improvement in the labor market outlook as the fiscal headwinds diminish.  In 
addition, some participants may now view the risks to economic growth as roughly 
balanced, with the near-term effects of this y ear’s shift in fiscal pol icy expected to wane 
and further improvements in the housing sect or and the labor mark et anticipated to 
generate additional gains in spending.  They may also judge that overall financial conditions, bolstered by the ongoi ng recovery in housing pric es and recent increases in 
equity prices, remain very supportive of economic growth.  Moreover,  some participants 
may now see a reduction in the pace of asset purchases as appropriate in light of the 
cumulative improvements in the outlook for th e economy and the labor market since last 
September.  In particular, given the declin e in the unemployment rate since last summer 
as well as ongoing gains in private payroll employment, part icipants may judge that a 
modest reduction in the pace of purchases would be consistent with the “varying the pace” language in the May FOMC statement.  Indeed, some policymakers may already 
see a substantial improvement in the outlook fo r the labor market, and so be inclined to 
bring the purchase program to a close.  Ho wever, particularly in light of the recent 
elevated market volatility, they  may think that it is better to taper the purchases, rather 
than simply end them now, out of concern that an unexpected abrupt end could cause market strains for a time.  For all of these reasons, participants mi ght prefer a statement 
like Alternative C that reduces the pace of pur chases of Treasury securities and agency 
MBS. 
Some policymakers may be skeptical that the current program of purchasing 
longer-term securities is reducing interest rates appreciably, or  that it is having a 
significant effect on macroeconomic outcome s.  Furthermore, they may judge the 
prospective costs of continuing purchases at  the current pace to be significant.  In 
particular, they may be concerned that furt her asset purchases coul d lead to excessive 
risk-taking in financial markets, undermine financial stability, and ultimately put the

 achievement of the dual mandate at risk.  Even if  participants see the costs of a still-larger 
balance sheet as highly uncertain, they may wish to proceed more slowly to accumulate 
more information about thos e costs and about the underlyi ng economic situation.  Other 
participants might be concerned that the Federal Reserve’s large and growing balance 
sheet may eventually contribute to an unhingi ng of long-term inflati on expectations.  In 
addition, some policymakers may worry that a statement along the lines of Alternative B 
could unwind the shift in  market expectations for the purchase program that followed the 
Chairman’s recent Congressional testimony, making it more difficult to reduce the pace 
of asset purchases in the future and so riski ng an undesirable increase  in inflation over the 
medium term. 
A decision to adopt a statement like Altern ative C at this meeting would come as 
a surprise to market participants and might be seen as an indication that the Committee 
will end asset purchases sooner and acquire an appreciably sma ller total stock of 
securities than market participants currently anticipate.  The effect of such a surprise 
might cause longer-term interest rates to ri se even further, reduce equity prices, and 
increase volatility in financial markets.  The extent of these effects would depend on how much the policy decision influenced i nvestors’ outlook for the economy and their 
expectations for the stance of m onetary policy going forward.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some participants may conclude that a balanced approach to achieving both 
components of the dual mandate requires a st ill-more-stimulative policy stance.  They 
may judge it likely that, without more- accommodative forward guidance about the 
federal funds rate or a larger  asset purchase program than  suggested by Alternative B, 
inflation would continue to run below the Co mmittee’s 2 percent target over the next few 
years, output and employment would grow at  no more than a m oderate rate, and the 
unemployment rate would remain unacceptably high in the medium term.  Moreover, they may see other labor market indicators, su ch as the low labor force participation rate 
and the high levels of long-duration unemplo yment and individuals working part-time for 
economic reasons, as indicating that there has been only modest fundamental improvement in labor market conditions.  C oncerns about the outlook may be reinforced 
by weak manufacturing activity a nd indicators of business conditions and sentiment that 
are at low or modest levels.  Accordingly, so me policymakers might prefer Alternative A, 
which provides more monetary acco mmodation than Alternative B.

 Some participants may not only judge that  the modal outlook is  unsatisfactory but 
also that downside risks to that outlook re main sizable.  Continued uncertainty about 
fiscal policy could restrain household spendi ng and business investment over the rest of 
this year more significantly than appears to have been the case to date, and fiscal and 
financial headwinds in Europe remain consid erable.  At the same time, with inflation 
recently falling further below 2 percent and measures of longer-term inflation 
compensation having declined over the inte rmeeting period, some policymakers may see 
little risk that inflation or inflation expect ations will move up; indeed, they may now be 
more concerned with downside risks to inflati on, especially in light of still-substantial 
resource slack and contained wage costs.  Policymakers may judge th at with the federal 
funds rate at its effective lower bound, a nd with already heavy reliance on forward 
guidance and asset purchases to provide accommodation, the Committee’s ability to address any downside shocks is limited.  As a result, policymakers may see the potential 
consequences of a new adverse shock as more costly than the consequences of providing more policy accommodation only to find that eco nomic growth or inflation rise more 
than expected.  If so, they may see the de gree of uncertainty a bout the outlook and the 
asymmetry in risks as arguing for providing greater policy stimulus now. 
Alternative A provides more accommodati on than Alternative B by lowering the 
forward guidance threshold for the unempl oyment rate and by  providing additional 
guidance about the eventual re moval of policy accommodation.
1  In particular, 
Alternative A says “the Committee expects th at when the time comes to reduce policy 
accommodation, it will be appropriate to do so gradually in order to foster stronger 
employment growth and inflati on at 2 percent, or [even] m odestly higher for a time.”  
Alternative A would also imply holding a larger stock of assets for a longer time than 
under Alternative B, by stating that the Co mmittee intends to rely on paydowns of 
principal rather than sales of agency MB S when it becomes appropriate to reduce its 
MBS holdings.  Some participants may view  a reduction in the unemployment threshold 
and an announcement that the Committee does not intend to sell MBS as an effective way 
to reinforce downward pressure  on longer-term interest rate s, provide more support to 
interest-sensitive sectors of the economy, a nd further strengthen the ongoing recovery in 
                                                 
1If the Committee chooses to reduce the unemployment threshold from 6½ percent to 6 percent, 
recent staff simulations of the FRB/US model suggest that such a reduction would postpone the departure 
of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound by two quarters.  The result would be a modestly 
more-rapid recovery in which the unemployment rate reaches the natural rate of unemployment about two 
quarters earlier along with a slightly quicker retu rn of inflation to its 2 percent objective.

 the housing sector.  In addition, some participan ts may expect that more robust growth in 
the housing sector will have the additiona l effect of boosting household net worth, 
increasing consumer confidence and furt her supporting consumer spending.   
An announcement like Alternative A would surprise market participants.  In 
response to a lower expected path of future short-term intere st rates, longer-term interest 
rates would likely decline, inflation compensa tion and equity prices might rise, and the 
dollar might depreciate.  If, however, invest ors took a statement like Alternative A to 
indicate that the FOMC has become more  pessimistic about the outlook for economic 
growth and employment than market participan ts had anticipated, equity prices might not 
rise or could even decline.  Changing th e threshold for the unemployment rate might 
create some confusion among investors about  the extent to which the Committee feels 
bound by its forward guidance, potentially boosting the volatility of asset prices and the 
risk premiums built into market yields.  Th e ability of forward guidance to achieve the 
Committee’s dual objectives might also be undercut if the public doubted that the 
Committee would credibly adhere to the policy in the future.

 Directive for June 2013 Alternative C  
Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial cond itions that will foster ma ximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks c onditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  Beginning 
with the month of July,  the Desk is directed to continue purchasing purchase  longer-
term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 $35 billion per month and to continue 
purchasing purchase  agency mortgage-backed secu rities at a pace of about $40 $35 
billion per month.  The Committee also direct s the Desk to engage in dollar roll and 
coupon swap transactions as necessary to faci litate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s 
agency mortgage-backed securities transact ions.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Tr easury securities into new issues and its 
policy of reinvesting principal payments on a ll agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortga ge-backed securities.  The Sy stem Open Market Account 
Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments 
regarding the System’s balance sheet that co uld affect the attainment over time of the 
Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

   Projections 
BANK CREDIT AND MONEY1  
Growth in commercial bank credit is projected to pick up gradually over the 
forecast period, reaching 5 percent in 2015.  The moderate acceleration reflects a 
strengthening in demand for bank loans as economic activity continues to improve, as 
well as some easing of credit conditions for r eal estate loans.  In  particular, the staff 
anticipates that commercial real estate lo ans, after decreasing ev ery year since 2009, will 
resume growing at a moderate rate, as high va cancy rates on certain property types edge 
lower and the credit quality of existing loans in  this sector improves further.  Similarly, 
growth of residential real estate loans carried on banks’ books is expected to move up 
somewhat as standards and terms on such lo ans gradually ease amid an improvement in 
household balance sheets and housing fundament als.  We anticipate that the pace of 
expansion of consumer loans will also incr ease, reflecting continued rapid growth of 
automobile loans and a modest acceleration in household spending on other consumer 
durables.  In contrast, the rapid growth of commercial and industrial loans observed 
through the first quarter of 2013 is expected to normalize over the next few years to a rate 
that is more in line with nominal GDP grow th.  Meanwhile, with demand for bank loans 
firming and deposit growth moderating, we e xpect banks’ holdings of securities to 
expand at a somewhat slow er pace than in 2012. 
M2 is projected to increase at a pace below that of nominal income through 2014 
and then contract in 2015.  Beginning later this year and through 2014, the growth of M2 
and its largest component, liquid deposits, is expected to moderate relative to the rapid 
expansion observed over recent years, with a gradual improvement in financial conditions 
encouraging investors to shift their portfolios away from the safe and liquid assets in M2 
and toward riskier financial assets.  In 2015, M2  is expected to decline in response to the 
projected increase in short-term market inte rest rates and the accompanying rise in the 
opportunity cost of holding money.

   BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to interpretations of Alternatives A,  B, and C.  All three alternatives include 
additional asset purchases, though the pace a nd cumulative amount of purchases differ.2  
Alternative B continues purchases at the curr ent pace through September, at which point 
the monthly purchases are reduced; purchases conclude by yea r-end.  Alternative A 
maintains the current pace of purchases through March 2014. Thereafter, purchases 
continue at a slower pace through June 2014.  Alternativ e C decreases the pace of 
purchases immediately and e nds purchases in August. 
Projections under each scenario are based on assumptions about the trajectory of 
various components of the balance sheet a nd the balance sheet normalization strategy.3  
The projections for Alternatives B and C assume that the Committee follows an exit 
strategy consistent with the pr inciples articulated in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC 
meeting, which includes sales of agency MBS over a five-year period.  The projections in 
Alternative A, on the other hand, assume no sales of agency MBS and that the SOMA 
portfolio declines only through the pa ssive redemption of SOMA assets.4  The 
accompanying box, “Alternative B without Agency MBS Sales,” discusses the 
implications of assuming no sales of agency MBS for the scenario corresponding to 
Alternative B.5  
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and 
of longer-term Treasury securi ties by $45 billion per month through September 2013, and 
                                                 
2 The Committee is assumed to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and 
reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS until six 
months before the first increase in the federal funds rate.  The effect of assuming that maturing Treasury 
securities are rolled over at auction is very modest; as a result of the maturity ex tension program, there are 
currently less than $5 billion of Treasury securities in the SOMA portfolio that mature before January 2016. 
3 Details of these assumptions, as well as proj ections for each major component of the balance 
sheet, can be found in the Appendix that follows this section. 
4 This assumption is consistent with the new la nguage for Alternative A that notes that the 
Committee now intends “to rely upon the paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency mortgage-backed securities when it eventually becomes approp riate to reduce its holdings of those securities.” 
5 The entire expected path of the portfolio has implications for the evolution of interest rates, the 
economy, and Federal Reserve income.  If market par ticipants have different expectations for the size, 
pace, and composition of purchases and for the exit strategy than assumed in  these scenarios, the effects on 
interest rates, economic activity, and Federal Reserv e income will also differ from those presented here.

  Alternative  B without Agency  MBS  Sales 
 
The balance sheet projection  for Alternative  B assumes  agency MBS are sold over 
five years, consistent  with  the June 2011 exit strategy principles.   In this box, we 
present a projection  for the balance sheet  under Alternative B  that compares  the 
staff’s standard exit  strategy assumptions  with the assumption  that agency MBS 
holdings decline only  through passive redemptions.1   
With no sales of agency MBS, payments  of principal on both agency and Treasury 
securities  are projected  to reduce SOMA holdings by approximately  $300 billion per 
year from 2015  to 2020.  This passive  decline in securities  holdings is a bit slower 
than  in Alternative  B, implying  that the size of the balan ce sheet normalizes  in mid‐
2020, a year later than  in the baseline  scenario, as shown in the chart below.  
Without sales of agency MBS, SOMA holdings of agency MBS are projected  to 
decline to about  $500  billion by the end of the projection  period in 2025, but might 
not fall to zero until 30 years after purchases  end depending  on the pace  of 
principal payments.

By not selling  agency MBS, realized capital losses  are eliminated,  but the less rapid 
normalization  of the balance  sheet implies that interest expense  on reserve 
balances is higher  in many years than  in Alternative  B.  On net, Federal Reserve net 
income is higher  than  under  Alternative  B because the elimination  of realized losse s 
more than  offsets the increase in interest expense.  Under the no MBS  sales 
scenario, annual  remittances  to the Treasury trough at $18 billion in 2018, 
noticeably  higher  than the near zero trough for remittances  projected  in Alternative  
B, shown in the figure  below.  On  net, not selling  agency MBS generates  about $45 
billion more in cumulative  remittances  between  2009 and 2025  than  if agency MBS 
were sold over  five years.

   then reduce these purchases through year-end.  Purchases total about $900 billion in 
2013, up from $750 billion assumed in the April Tealbook and in the staff forecast 
reviewed in the current Tealbook Book A.  Th is scenario might be viewed as broadly 
consistent with the description of asset purch ases in the statement language of Alternative 
B.6 
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” under 
the purchase program assumed in Alternative B,  SOMA securities hold ings peak at about 
$3.7 trillion in January 2014, with $2.1 trillion in Treasury securities holdings and $1.6 trillion in agency securities holdings.  Give n the exit strategy prin ciples adopted by the 
Committee in June 2011, the date of liftoff is a key determinant of the trajectory of the 
balance sheet.  Consistent with the 6½ pe rcent threshold for the unemployment rate, we 
assume that the first increase in the target fede ral funds rate is in May 2015, as in the staff 
forecast in Tealbook Book A.
7,8  In November 2014, six months  before the first increase 
in the target federal funds rate, all reinvestment is a ssumed to cease, and the SOMA 
portfolio begins to contract.  In November 2015, six months after th e initial increase in 
the target federal funds rate, the Committee begins to sell its holdings of agency 
securities at a pace that reduces the amount of these securities in the portfolio to zero over 
five years, that is, by Octobe r 2020.  Through these redemptions and sales, the size of the 
portfolio is normalized by May 2019.9,10  The balance sheet then  begins to expand, with 
                                                 
6 As discussed in the Monetary Policy Alternatives  section of Tealbook Book B, the wording of 
Alternative B is intended to suggest that the Committee could reduce the pace of purchases if the data in 
coming months show continuing improvement in labor market conditions. 
7 At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is projected to be below the 6½ percent threshold, 
and inflation is expected to be a bit below the Committee’s 2 percent objective in the medium run. 
8 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is tw o quarters earlier than that assumed in the balance 
sheet projections for Alternat ive B in the April Tealbook. 
9 Temporary reserve draining tools (reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of 
Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the 
balance sheet. 
10 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts 
to its longer-run trend level, determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and 
a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of re serve balances that is assumed to be necessary to 
conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  A higher 
steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead to an earlier normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet.

   increases in SOMA holdings e ssentially matching the growth  of currency in circulation 
and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  Total assets are $2.6 trillion at the end of 2025. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications for Federal 
Reserve income across the alternatives.  In the scenario for Alternative B, interest income 
rises until reinvestments cease and then decl ines as the SOMA portfolio begins to 
contract.  As the federal funds rate rises after liftoff, interest expense on reserve balances 
climbs.  Sales of agency MBS are project ed to result in realized capital losses.11  These 
capital losses, in conjunction with the rise in  interest expense on re serve balances and the 
decrease in interest income, substantially reduce Federal Reserve net income for a few 
years.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive over 
the entire projection period, but fall to very low levels for a number of years.  No 
deferred asset is accumulated.  Annual rem ittances peak at about $90 billion in 2014 and 
trough slightly above zero later in the decade.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 
through 2025 are about $810 billi on, well above the level that  would have been observed 
without the asset pu rchase programs. 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Treas ury securities and a dditional agency MBS 
through the first quarter of 2014.  At the be ginning of the second quarter of 2014, the 
Committee is assumed to begin stepping dow n the pace of purchases, and in mid-2014 it 
ends the purchase program.  Purchases to tal about $1.4 trillion over 2013 and the first 
half of 2014.  This scenario might be viewed as consistent with the descriptions of asset 
purchases in the statement language of Alternative A.12  In this scenario, SOMA 
securities holdings increase to a peak of  about $4.2 trillion.  The first increase in the 
target federal funds rate occurs in late 2015, later than in Alternat ive B because of the 5½ 
percent threshold for the unemployment ra te.  In mid-2015, all reinvestments are 
projected to cease and the SOMA portfolio begi ns to contract.  This scenario assumes 
MBS holdings are reduced through paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency 
MBS.  The size of the portfo lio is normalized in mid-2021, a bout two years later than in 
                                                 
11 Under Reserve Bank accounting, securities held in the domestic SOMA portfolio are recorded 
on an amortized cost basis.  As a result, realized losses and gains on securities sold affect the Federal 
Reserve’s reported net income; unrealized losses and gains are not reflected in net income. 
12 Under the projection for Alternative A, the unemployment rate will have fallen to under 7 
percent in mid-2014, inflation is expected to be around 1½ percent, and real GDP will be expanding at an 
annual rate of more than 3 percen t.  Moreover, the unemployment rate  is projected to decline further 
through 2015, while inflation is expected to tick up.

   the scenario corresponding to A lternative B, reflecting the la rger LSAP program, the later 
start to balance sheet normalization, and the lack of MBS sales. 
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of the SOMA portfolio and re serve balances in the near term.  Net interest income 
increases initially and then remains elevated until reinvest ments are assumed to end, and 
Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury peak at about $100 billion in 2015.  As the 
federal funds rate rises after liftoff, the inte rest expense on reserve balances increases.  
This rise in interest expense, paired with a decrease in interest income associated with a 
contracting portfolio, reduce Federal Reserve net income somewhat.  Federal Reserve 
remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive over the entire projection 
period and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances remain robust, and, 
from 2009 through 2025, are about $870 billion, so mewhat higher than under Alternative 
B. 
For the scenario that corresponds to Alternative C, the Committee announces a 
decrease in the pace of purchas es of both longer-term Treasur y securities and additional 
agency MBS to $35 billion per month beginning in July.13  The Committee is assumed to 
cease purchases by the end of August, with purchases totaling about $650 billion in 
2013.14  In this scenario, the federal funds rate is assumed to lift off in late 2014.15  
Corresponding to this earlier incr ease in the federal funds rate , reinvestment of principal 
                                                 
13 The staff assumes that the main effect of asset purchases on financial conditions comes from the 
expected size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio over time.  As a result, the 
macroeconomic effects of a change in the pace of pu rchases will depend importantly on how the change 
influences investors’ expectations of the evolution of the overall size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.  For reference, see the memo titled “Changing the Pace of Asset Purchases” (by S. Carpenter, W. English, S. Meyer, W. Nelson, D. Re ifschneider, and R. Tetlow of the Federal Reserve 
Board, and J. Egelhof, S. Friedman, L. Logan, and S. Potter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the Committee on April 22, 2013. 
14 The scaling back of the asset purchase program may be seen as consistent with policymakers 
seeing the economic recovery as having reached a self-sustaining course based on the improvement in its outlook for the labor market since last September when the Committee first tied its decision about 
additional asset purchases to the outlook for labor market conditions.  Alternatively, by August 2013, the 
Committee could end the purchase program based on its assessment that the prospective costs of further purchases are likely to outweigh the benefits. 
15 The scenario assumes that the Committee raises th e federal funds rate before either the threshold 
for the unemployment rate or the threshold for projected inflation is crossed, perhaps because policymakers are concerned that longer-term inflation expectations would become unanchored if policy is not tightened 
or because the Committee concludes that  continuing to keep the federal funds rate target at the zero lower 
bound would undermine future financial stability.

   from maturing or prepaying securities ends  and redemptions begin in mid-2014, and the 
portfolio begins to contract.  Sales of agen cy securities commence six months after liftoff 
and last for five years.  SOMA securities hold ings in this scenario  peak at $3.4 trillion, 
and the size of the balance sheet is norma lized about one-half year earlier than under 
Alternative B.  Federal Reserve remittances  to the Treasury are projected to remain 
positive throughout the projection period, and no de ferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative 
remittances from 2009 to 2025 are about $800 billion, somewhat less than under 
Alternative B. 
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases.16  Reserve balances peak at about $3.0 trillion, 
$2.5 trillion, and $2.3 trillion under Alternatives A, B, and C,  respectively.  When the 
federal funds rate lifts off from its lo wer bound, reserve balances are $2.8 trillion, $2.4 
trillion, and $2.2 trillion under Alternativ es A, B, and C, respectively. 
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternativ e Projections for the Monetary Base,” in 
the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base increases through early 
2014 because of the purchase program and th e accompanying increase in reserve 
balances.  Once exit begins, the monetary base shrinks, on net, through mid-2019, 
primarily reflecting redemptions and sales of  securities and the corresponding reduction 
in reserve balances.  Starting in late 2019, after reserve ba lances are assumed to have 
stabilized at $25 billion, the monetary base be gins to expand in line with the growth of 
currency in circulation.  Under Alternative A, the monetary base increases through mid-
2014, longer than under Alternative B, as the le vel of reserve balances climbs in concert 
with the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The monetary base then 
contracts during the exit period until the si ze of the portfolio is normalized.  Under 
Alternative C, the monetary base increases th rough the end of this year because of the 
purchase program and then contracts, on net, until about one quarter after the size of the 
portfolio is normalized. 
                                                 
16 The level of reserve balances is also contingent on the evolution of other balance sheet items.

Appendix 
This appendix presents the assumptions underl ying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet, Income, and Moneta ry Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from June 2013 to 
December 2025.  The few balance sheet items th at are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level ob served on May 31, 2013.  The projections for all 
major asset and liability categories under each scen ario are summarized in the tables that follow 
the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in May 2015.  This date of liftoff is consistent with the 
current staff economic forecast and the thresholds  described in the May 2013 FOMC statement, 
and it is two quarters earlier than assumed in the ba lance sheet projections for Alternative B in the 
April Tealbook.  In the projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the first 
increase in the target federal funds rate occurs in late 2015, consistent with a reduction in the 
threshold for the unemployment rate to 5½ percent.  The projections for the scenario 
corresponding to Alternative C assume the target fede ral funds rate lifts off in late 2014.  In each 
case, the balance sheet projections assume no use of short-term draining tools to achieve the 
projected path for the target federal funds rate.1 
  
                                                 
1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreemen ts were used to drain re serves, the composition of 
liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements would be matched 
by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, these draining tools would be wound down as 
the balance sheet returns to its steady state growth path, so that the projected paths for Treasury securities 
presented here would remain valid.

ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by 
$40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by $45 billion per month through September 2013.  After September 2013, purchases are assumed to continue, but at a steadily decreasing rate, concluding by the end of the year.  The 
Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine 
years.  The purchases in 2013 expand the SO MA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by about $900 billion.   
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS.  
o Starting in November 2014—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature 
or prepay. 
o The Federal Reserve begins to sell agen cy MBS and agency debt securities in 
November 2015, six months after the assumed date of the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate.  Holdings of agency securities are reduced over five years and 
reach zero by October 2020. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest ra te projections generated from the staff’s 
FRB/US model.
2  The projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying 
assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A,  the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Trea sury securities and additional agency MBS 
through March 2014.  Thereafter, the pace of purchases slows, and purchases end in June 
2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by about $1.4 trillion in 2013 and the first half of 2014.  In addition, the 
Committee is assumed to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Starting in mid-2015, principal payments from all securities are allowe d to roll off the portfolio.  This scenario 
does not entail sales of agency MBS, and as a result, the portfolio declines only through 
the passive redemption of SOMA assets. 
                                                 
2 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of June 10, 2013.

 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed to decrease the 
monthly pace of purchases to $35 billion of  longer-term Treasury securities and 
$35 billion of additional agency MBS beginning  in July 2013.  Purchases cease by the 
end of August.  The Treasury securities pur chased are assumed to have an average 
duration of about nine years.  These purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of 
longer-term securities by about $650 billion in  2013.  The FOMC continues to reinvest 
the proceeds from principal payments on its agency securities holdings in agency MBS 
until mid-2014.  Thereafter, all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The Federal Reserve be gins to sell agency MBS and agency debt 
securities six months after liftoff.  Holdings  of agency securities are reduced over five 
years and reach zero in 2020.   
 Because current and expected interest rates in  the near term are below the average coupon 
rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases securities will generally exceed their face value, with a larger premium for 
longer-maturity securities.  As a result, in Alternatives A, B, and C, premiums are boosted by roughly $18 billion, $9 billion, and $5 billion, respectively, by the time asset purchases end, relative to a scenario wit hout these Treasury securities purchases.  The 
increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.   
 The market value at which the Federa l Reserve purchases new agency MBS will 
generally exceed their face value.  As a r esult, for Alternatives A, B, and C, the $470 
billion, $230 billion, and $110 billion of agency MBS purchases, respectively, will cause 
premiums on the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet to rise by roughly $18 billion, $9 
billion, and $3 billion, respectively, relativ e to a scenario without these MBS purchases.  
The increase in premiums is reflected in higher total assets and in higher reserve balances.  
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is  assumed to decline gradually, reaching zero 
by the end of 2014.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is assumed 
to stay constant at $23 billion.  
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments.

 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $400 million currently to zero in 2015.  
Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by the 
LLC.  On January 15, 2013, the Board of Gove rnors approved the elimination of the U.S. 
Treasury’s funding commitment and the repa yment of the initial funding amount plus 
accrued interest.  Additionally, the Board of  Governors approved the disbursement of 
contingent interest payments from TALF LLC to Treasury and FRBNY that equal, approximately, the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the amount of outstanding TALF loans less funds reserved for future expenses of TALF LLC.  The first payment occurred in February, and additional payments occur on a monthly basis.  Consistent with 
events to date, the projections assume the LLC does not purchase any asset-backed securities.  (It would have to make such  purchases if an asset-backed security were 
received by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in connection with a decision of a 
borrower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC decline to zero in 2016. 
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to grow at an average annual rate of 
6 percent through 2015, in line with the staff forecast.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes 
in circulation grow at the same rate as nom inal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreements ( RRPs) is assumed to be around $100 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion as it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 15 percent per year , in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
3 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital 
                                                 
3 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet, the size of the SOMA portfolio after normalization, and the level of annual remittances to the 
Treasury.  Growth in Reserve Bank capital has been modest over the past two years; if Federal Reserve 
capital were assumed to grow at a slower rate, the norm alization date would be slightly later, the size of 
SOMA would be a bit smaller after normalization, an d annual remittances would, on net, be modestly 
larger.

items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to 
cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  In this Tealbook, none of th e alternatives result in a deferred asset.   
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS4 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note 
is negative 135 basis points in the current quarter. 5  The effect wanes over time as the 
length of time the securities will be held by  the Federal Reserve shortens and as securities 
subsequentl y roll off the portfolio until th e size of the portfolio is normalized. 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous te rm premium effect is negative 102 basis 
points.  Over the remainder of the projecti on period, the term premium effect declines 
slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual a nd anticipated normalization of the portfolio. 
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect is negative 90 basis points.  The effect is less negative than in Alternative B because there are fewer securities purchased in 2013 
and the liftoff date is earlier so asset sales begin sooner than under Alternative B. 
                                                 
4 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs” by C. Li and M. Wei, FEDS working paper 2012-37. 
5 The staff projection of the term premium effect depends on assumptions about the size of the 
asset purchase program and the balance sheet normalizat ion strategy.  If market participants anticipate a 
different sized program or a different exit strategy, the staff estimates of the term premium effect may not be the same as those priced in market rates.
