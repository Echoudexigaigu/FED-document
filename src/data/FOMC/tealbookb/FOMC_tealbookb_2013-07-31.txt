The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the fede ral funds rate from six policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013 and 2014.  (Medium-term prescriptions de rived from dynamic simulations of the 
rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the le ft-hand columns, four of the six rules keep 
the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound in both the third and fourth quarters of 
2013.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which puts re latively little weight on the output gap, 
prescribes a federal funds rate of about 70 ba sis points this quarter followed by a further 
increase in the fourth quarter.  The first-di fference rule, which responds to the expected 
change in the output gap, prescribes a fede ral funds rate of about 35 basis points this 
quarter and about 75 basis point s in the fourth quarter.  
The right-hand columns display the near-ter m prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.1  For the current and coming quarters, 
the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based rule prescribe federal funds rates 
just below zero.  In contrast, the Taylor (1999) rule, which does  not include a lagged 
value of the federal funds rate  and therefore responds more st rongly to the staff’s estimate 
of the current output gap, prescribes markedly  more negative values for the federal funds 
rate.  The nominal income targeting rule re sponds both to the curre nt estimate of the 
output gap as well as the cumulative shortfal l of inflation below the assumed 2 percent 
target since 2008.  As a result, this rule also  prescribes negative values for the federal 
funds rate for both the third and fourth quarters of 2013. 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key Elements of the St aff Projection.”  As shown in 
the bottom left panel of the exhibit, since the last Tealbook, the sta ff has revised down its 
                                                 
1 Four of these rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nominal income 
targeting rule, and the first-difference rule—place subs tantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed thus far this quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table are indirectly affected by 
the lower bound.

  estimate for the level of real GDP in the second quarter of 2013 and lowered its projected 
path over the medium term, implying slight ly wider output gap estimates through mid-
2017.  As indicated in the bottom right panel, the staff’s forecast for inflation is essentially unrevised si nce the last Tealbook.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated using the FRB/US model after adjusting it to replicate 
the staff’s economic forecast.  The short-run  r* estimate corresponds to the real federal 
funds rate that would, if maintained, return ou tput to potential in 12 quarters.  Consistent 
with the staff’s assessment that the output gap will essentially close by mid-2017, slightly 
later than in the previous Tealbook, the r* estimate for the current quarter is lower than in 
June.  As has been true since late 2008, the estimate of r*—currently about 
1.57percent—remains below the estimated actual real federal funds rate, which is now 
0.93 percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model that incorporate endogenous responses of 
inflation and the output gap implied by having the federal funds rate follow the paths 
prescribed by the different policy rules, under the assumption that the funds rate is 
constrained by the effective lower bound.
2  (Alternative policy rule simulations that 
incorporate thresholds are discussed below.)  Each rule is applied from the third quarter 
of 2013 onward, under the assumptions that financia l market participants as well as price- 
and wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follow that rule and that agents fully 
understand and anticipate the implic ations of the rule for futu re real activity, inflation, 
and interest rates.3   
                                                 
2 The staff’s baseline forecast inco rporates the macroeco nomic effects of the FOMC’s large-scale 
asset purchase programs. Specifically, it embeds the assumption that the FOMC  will purchase a total of 
about $1.2 trillion in longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS during 2013 and the first half of 
2014, with the pace of purchases dec lining in several steps beginning late r this year and reaching zero in 
the middle of next year.  Based on these assumptions, all of the policy-rule simulations discussed here and 
below incorporate the projected effect s of these balance sheet policies; the rules themselves, however, are 
not directly adjusted for the ef fects of balance sheet policies. 
3The procedure for generating outcomes under optimal control and alternative policy rules using 
FRB/US has changed since the June Tealbook.  Under the previous procedure, each  alternative policy rule 
was associated with different paths for term pr emiums, reflecting endogenous movements in these 
premiums that amplified the macroec onomic effects of changes in the federal funds rate.  The differences in 
the term premiums were estimated using an ad hoc redu ced-form relationship, which has not been stable in 
recent years; for the dynamic simulations shown here, we now assume that the term premiums have the

  The exhibit also displays the implica tions of following the Tealbook baseline 
policy.  That policy keeps the federal funds ra te at its effective lower bound of 12.5 basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is a bove 6.5 percent and averag e inflation five to 
eight quarters hence is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  After either of these 
variables crosses its threshold, the federal funds rate in the baseline projection follows the 
prescription of the inertial Tayl or (1999) rule.  In the cu rrent baseline projection, the 
unemployment rate falls below its thres hold during the second quarter of 2015, one 
quarter later than in the June baseline.  The federal funds ra te begins to rise from its 
effective lower bound in mid-2015, climbs to 3 percent by early 2018, and reaches 4 
percent by 2020.  Under this assu med funds rate path, the unem ployment rate is projected 
to decline gradually towards the staff’s es timate of the long-term natural rate of 
unemployment of 5.25 percent, reaching th at rate by mid-2018 and then decreasing 
further to about 5 percent by 2020; headline inflation rises gr adually to about 2 percent 
by early 2018. 
Without thresholds, most of the different policy rules call for tightening to begin 
earlier than under the Tealbook baseline, followed by steady increases in the nominal 
federal funds rate.  As a result, these rules put the real federal f unds rate persistently 
above the path implied by the baseline forecas t, policy settings that result in higher 
unemployment and lower inflation through mo st of the decade, compared with the 
baseline.  Despite beginning to tighten earlie r than under the baseline , the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule generates only slightly less favorable outcomes for unemployment and 
inflation because this rule prescribes only a very gradual pace of tightening.4 
By contrast, the nominal income targeting rule does not call for tightening earlier 
than under the Tealbook baseline.  This rule keeps the federal funds rate at the lower 
bound one quarter longer than under the baseline and generates a real federal funds rate 
persistently below baseline fo r the rest of the decade, thereby inducing stronger future 
real activity and higher future  inflation.  Markets are assu med to fully anticipate these 
                                                                                                                                                 
same values as in the baseline.  This change in assumptions makes inflation and unemployment somewhat 
less responsive to changes in the federal funds rate than  was the case in earlier Tealbooks.  It also affects 
the estimates of the short-run r*, though the effects are small: the previous Tealbook reported an estimate 
of r* of 1.38 percent for 2013:Q2 compared with 1.47 percent using the new model assumptions. 
4 The Taylor (1999) rule, which does not seek to smooth the path for the nominal interest rate, also 
prescribes the first increase in the federal funds rate  two quarters earlier than in the baseline path.  But 
without inertia, the Taylor ( 1999) rule prescribes markedly more ra pid increases in the nominal funds rate 
thereafter, causing the real funds rate to be pe rsistently higher than under the baseline policy.

  developments, so longer-term real interest rates are lower today than under the baseline 
policy.  In turn, overall financial conditi ons are more accommodative today and real 
activity is stronger in the near term.  In a ddition, greater resource ut ilization in the short 
run and higher expected future inflation both boost inflation in the near term.   
In general, the results depend importantly on the assumption that policymakers 
will credibly adhere to the simulated rule in the future and that the public fully anticipates 
the paths for the federal funds rate, real activity, and inflati on implied by the rule.  This 
assumption is particularly critical in the cas e of the nominal income targeting rule, which 
is associated with outcomes in which infla tion is allowed to run modestly above the  
2 percent goal for several years, even  after the output gap is closed.   
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which the policy rules are s ubject to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.  For each of the ru les, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and aver age inflation five to eight quarters hence 
is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  Fi nancial market particip ants and price- and 
wage-setters are assumed to understand that poli cy will switch to the specified rule when 
one of the threshold conditions is crossed and to view this switch as permanent and fully 
credible.  In each of the simulations discussed below, crossing the unemployment 
threshold turns out to be the catalyst for switching to the specified rule. 
For all of the rules except the nominal income targeting rule, imposing the 
thresholds leads to a departure of the fede ral funds rate from the effective lower bound 
that is later than that show n in the second exhibit.  In  these cases, the threshold-
augmented rules prescribe th e first increase in the fede ral funds rate around mid-2015, 
between two quarters and two years later than the same rules without thresholds.  
The threshold strategy has the largest effects on the departure date under the 
Taylor (1993) and the first-difference rules.  In particular, without thresholds these rules 
depart from the zero bound by the end of this year, and imposing the thresholds 
postpones the departure from the zero bound by more than a year.  As a result, 
unemployment declines faster and inflation is  lower when the thresholds are imposed on 
these rules.  In contrast, the threshold stra tegy only postpones departur e by three quarters 
or less under the Taylor (1999) , the inertial Taylor (1999), and the outcome-based rules, 
and such a strategy generate s little difference in the outcomes for unemployment and

  inflation compared with t hose generated by the same rules without the thresholds.5  
Because the nominal income targeting rule does not prescribe raising the federal funds 
rate above its effective lower bound until after the unemployment rate falls below 
6.5 percent, imposing the thresholds on the nom inal income targeting rule does not alter 
this rule’s prescribed departure date from the lower bound, and outcomes for inflation 
and unemployment are not affected. 
These simulation results illustrate the importa nce of the policy that is expected to 
be followed after a threshold is crossed for the economic consequen ces of the threshold-
based forward guidance. 
The fourth exhibit, “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those based on the June forecast.6  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights 
on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 per cent goal, on keeping 
the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, 
and on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate.7  
The simulations indicate that, with the fe deral funds rate constrained to remain 
positive, the optimal control path for the federa l funds rate rises above the effective lower 
bound in the second quarter of 2016—two quarter s later than in the optimal control 
simulations based on the June baseline.8  Subsequently, the optim al control path for the 
federal funds rate rises to 3 percent by early 2018 and to 4 percent by late 2019.9  The 
                                                 
5 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with threshol ds corresponds to the Tealbook baseline in the 
exhibit. 
6 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance-sheet policies 
described in footnote 2. 
7 The optimal control simulations do not incorporate thresholds. 
8 The way policy simulations are generated with the FRB/US model has changed since June, as 
described in footnote 3.  Under the new assumptions, changes to the federal funds rate path do not have an 
additional effect through endogenous term premium movements.  The paths labeled “Previous Tealbook” 
in the exhibit have been generated under the new mode l assumptions using the June baseline forecast.  In 
that simulation, the departure from the lower bound occu rs in 2015:Q4, one quarter later than reported in 
the June Tealbook.   
9 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because

  federal funds rate prescribed by optimal control thus remains at the effective lower bound 
for three quarters longer than in the Teal book baseline projection and rises a bit more 
gradually over the following year. 
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal c ontrol policy promotes a stronger economic 
recovery, while inflation peaks only about one-quarter percenta ge point above the 
Committee’s 2 percent goal.  In particular , the unemployment rate drops below  
6.5 percent by early 2015 and reaches 5.25 percent around the time the federal funds rate leaves its effective lowe r bound in the second quarter of 2016; thereafter, the 
unemployment rate declines to 4.75 percen t by 2018, thus running below the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate of unemployment for a time.  Inflation reaches the Committee’s 2 percent objective by late 2016 and subsequently rises to about  
2.25 percent before gradually moving back toward 2 percent.  The swifter achievement of 
the Committee’s assumed objectives occurs be cause the optimal control policy credibly 
promises to remain highly accommodative for even longer than under the baseline policy.  
In current circumstances, this generates—th rough its impact on th e private sector’s 
expectations of future mone tary policy and its future consequences for the economy— 
more favorable effects on financial conditions , real activity, and inflation in the near 
term. 
In the absence of the lower-bound constrai nt, the optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate would decline to about 1.5 percent by mid-2014 and become positive 
again by early 2016.  The unconstrained policy would bring the unemployment rate down 
a bit faster over the next few years and subsequently would keep the unemployment rate a bit closer to the natural rate than woul d be the case under the constrained policy.  The 
path for inflation is quite similar for th e unconstrained and cons trained policies.  
The optimal control policy concept presen ted in “Constrained vs. Unconstrained 
Optimal Control Policy,” corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers make choices today that effec tively constrain policy choices in future periods.  The fifth 
exhibit, “Optimal Control Policy: Commitment vs. Discretion,” compares the commitment results with the outcomes simulated from an alternative optimality 
                                                                                                                                                 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

  concept—discretion.  Under discretion, policymakers cannot credibly commit to carrying 
out a plan that requires them to make futu re choices that would be suboptimal at that 
future time, which limits their ability to infl uence private-sector expectations regarding 
the federal funds rate and othe r variables.  Instead, the private sector knows that future 
Committees will always reoptimize without rega rd for past policymakers’ promises, and 
this behavior leads to less stimulative polic y in current circumstan ces.  Under discretion, 
the Committee raises the federal funds rate  two quarters sooner and keeps monetary 
policy somewhat less accommodative than under commitment, so the unemployment rate does not fall as much below its natural rate and inflation does not rise as much above the 
2 percent objective.  
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under A lternative Policies without Thresholds” 
and “Outcomes under Alternativ e Policies with Thresholds,” tabulate the simulation 
results for key variables under each policy ru le discussed above, with and without 
thresholds.

  Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies.”  In the table, 	ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, while the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( gap t and gap t+1|t), and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ 
long-run inflation objective, denoted π*, is 2 percent.  The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
݊ݕ௧ (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ݊ݕ∗
௧ (100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by th e GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP. 
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured promin ently in recent analysis by Board staff.
1  The outcome-
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q12006:Q4.  The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a lo ng-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model.2  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules and the long-run 
                                                 
1 See Erceg and others (2012). 
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised th e long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2¼ percent to 2 percent.  The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change. Taylor (1993) rule ܴ௧ൌ2൅ߨ௧൅0.5ሺߨ௧െߨ∗ሻ൅0.5݌ܽ݃ ௧

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not de pend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run quarterly real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from these rules are calculated using Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated outcome-based rule, and the nominal in come targeting rule include the lagged policy 
rate as a right-hand-side variable.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook” report rule prescrip tions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff 
outlook, jumping off from the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the lines denoted “Previous Tealbook Outlook” report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarter s using the output projection from FRB/US, the 
staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very 
broad array of economic factors, some of which ta ke the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhi bit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

 Monetary Policy Alternatives  
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Alternative B ma intains the current stance of monetary 
policy.  In addition, Alternat ive B offers two possible ways to emphasize that the 
Committee’s decisions regarding asset purchases are distinct from its management of the 
future path of the federal funds rate.  A lternative A gives options for increasing policy 
accommodation by lowering the unemployment rate threshold for maintaining the current 
target range for the federal funds rate and by providing additional guidance about the 
Committee’s state-contingent intentions for the federal funds rate after a threshold is 
crossed.  Alternative A also includes a brie f summary of a state-contingent plan for 
moderating and subsequently ending asset purcha ses that is consistent with the discussion 
of the Committee’s intentions that the Chairm an presented in the June postmeeting press 
conference and in his testimony in connection with the July Monetary Policy Report.  
Alternative C reduces the pace of asset purchas es immediately; it also includes the state-
contingent plan for bringing them to a cl ose.  As always, th e Committee could blend 
elements of the draft statements to  construct its desired statement. 
In summarizing recent economic developments, Alternatives A and B note that 
economic activity has been expanding at a m odest pace, while Alternative C retains the 
“moderate pace” language of the June statement.  All three alternatives  characterize fiscal 
policy as a factor restraining economic growth, although Alternative C’s assessment of 
economic conditions downplays the role played by the fiscal situation.  Alternatives A 
and B note that “mortgage rates have risen so mewhat” since the previ ous meeting.  As in 
June, Alternative B indicates that labor market conditions have shown “further improvement in recent months, on balance.”  Alternative A, in contrast, offers a less 
positive characterization of the labor market.  But both Alternatives A and B continue to 
describe the unemployment rate  as elevated.  In assessing the improvement in the labor 
market, Alternative C emphasizes the “appreciable” (or “solid”)  gains in payroll 
employment.  As in the June FOMC statement,  Alternatives B and C indicate that “partly 
reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-
run objective,” but that longer-t erm inflation expectations “have remained stable.”  
Alternative A notes that inflation has b een running below the Committee’s goal “even 
though” longer-run inflation expectations have been stable.

   In characterizing the economic outlook, a ll three Alternatives say the Committee 
expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth “will pick up 
from its recent pace” and the unemployment ra te will decline gradually toward mandate-
consistent levels.  Alternative B offers a c hoice of repeating the June statement language 
indicating that the Committee anticipates that  inflation over the medium term likely will 
run “at or below” its 2 percent objective, or of stating an expectation that “with 
appropriate policy accommodation, inflation will move back toward its 2 percent 
objective over the medium term” and that the Committee “will pay close attention to 
inflation developments.”  Alternative C indicates that the Committee expects inflation 
over the medium term to run at 2 percent.  In contrast, Alternativ e A observes that “the 
persistence of very low inflation could pose risks to economic performance.”  Turning to 
risks to the real-side outlook, Alternatives A and B repeat  the June language expressing 
the Committee’s judgment that the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the 
labor market have diminished since the fall,  with Alternative A also cautioning that “a 
substantial tightening of fina ncial conditions would pose a ri sk to the economic outlook.”  
Alternative C offers a more sanguine view of the risks to th e outlook, not only stating that 
downside risks have diminished since the fall,  but also suggesting more confidence that 
labor market conditions will continue to improve over the medium run.  
With respect to balance sheet policy, A lternatives A and B maintain the asset 
purchase program at its current pace.  In contrast, Alternative C immediately reduces 
monthly purchases of longer-ter m Treasury securities and of agency MBS.  All of the 
alternatives again report that the Committee wi ll continue its securities purchases “until 
the outlook for the labor market has improve d substantially in a context of price 
stability,” and that in determining the size,  pace, and composition of  its asset purchases, 
the Committee “will continue to take appropr iate account of the likely efficacy and costs 
of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.”  
Alternatives A and C include new language that emphasizes that the Committee’s decisions regarding asset purchases “are not on a preset course.”  Alternative A then 
states more specifically the Committee’s exp ectation that it antic ipates “moderating the 
pace of its securities purch ases as economic conditions improve, but continuing 
purchases until the unemployment rate is abou t 7 percent, economic growth is sufficient 
to support continuing solid job gains, and infl ation is moving back toward its 2 percent 
longer-run goal.”  Alternativ e C uses similar language to  describe expectations for 
“further reducing” and then eventually st opping the Committee’s securities purchases. 
Alternatives

   All of the alternatives maintain the 0 to  ¼ percent target range for the federal 
funds rate and retain quantita tive threshold-based forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate.  All keep the current th reshold for projected inflation;  Alternatives B and C would 
also retain the 6½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate.  To reinforce the 
separation of the Committee’s balance sheet  policy and its forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate, both Alternatives B a nd C state more direc tly that the Committee 
“continues to anticipate” (rather  than “currently anticipates”) that the federal funds rate 
will remain exceptionally low at least until one of the thresholds is crossed.  One version 
of paragraph 5 of Alternative B would st ate that a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy will remain a ppropriate “for the foreseeabl e future.”  The other option 
(B.5′ ) strengthens the Committee’s statement of  its view that a highly accommodative 
stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for some time by specifying that appropriate policy includes “very low short- term interest rates and ongoing, substantial 
Federal Reserve holdings of longer-term securities.”  Alternative A adds accommodation 
by lowering the unemployment threshold to either 6 or 5½ percent and by providing 
additional guidance about the Committee’s state-contingent plans for the federal funds 
rate after a threshold is crossed.  In partic ular, paragraph 5 in A lternative A notes that 
“increases in the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to  be gradual until the 
economy is nearing maximum employment” so long as inflation remains near 2 percent and inflation expectations remain well anchor ed.  Alternative A also bolsters the forward 
guidance by converting a sentence  in paragraph 5—from one that could be interpreted as 
encompassing reasons the Committee might raise the federal funds rate before a threshold 
has been crossed—into a sentence  that explicitly addresses th e considerations that will 
enter into the Committee’s decisi on to raise its federal funds ra te target “after a threshold 
has been crossed.”   
The following table summarizes key elements of the alternative statements.  The 
summary table is followed by complete draf ts of the three statements and then by 
arguments for each alternative.

    JUNE FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market 
conditions have shown further improvement  in recent months, on balance, but the 
unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed 
investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Partly reflecti ng transitory influences, 
inflation has been running below the Co mmittee’s longer-run objective, but longer-
term inflation expectations have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the downside risks to the 
outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall.  
The Committee also anticipates that infla tion over the medium term likely will run at 
or below its 2 pe rcent objective. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to 
continue purchasing additional agency mort gage-backed securities at a pace of $40 
billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per

remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that

    FOMC  STATEMENT —J ULY 2013  ALTERNATIVE A  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May June 
suggests that economic activity ha s been expanding at a m oderate modest  pace in 
recent months .  Although some  labor market conditions indicators  have shown 
further improvement, in recen t months, on balance, but the unemployment rate 
remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and 
the housing sector has strengthened further, but mortgage rates have risen 
somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining ec onomic growth.  Partly reflecting 
transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective, b ut even though longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will pro ceed at a moderate pick up from its 
recent  pace and the unemployment rate will gr adually decline toward levels the 
Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the 
downside risks to the outlook for the ec onomy and the labor market as having 
diminished since the fall , but a substantial tightening of financial conditions 
would pose a risk to the economic outlook .  The Committee also an ticipates that 
inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective 
recognizes that the persistence of very lo w inflation could pose risks to economic 
performance, but it anticipates that, with appropriate policy accommodation, 
inflation will move up to its 2 percent objective over the medium term, and 
possibly slightly higher for a time. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to 
continue purchasing additional agency mort gage-backed securities at a pace of $40 
billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per 
month.  The Committee is maintaining its ex isting policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage mark ets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securiti es, and employ its other policy tools as

efficacy and costs of such purchases as we ll as the extent of progress toward its 
economic objectives.  The Committee’s decisions regarding asset purchases are 
not on a preset course and will continue to be contingent on the incoming data.  
Specifically, as the Chairman has outlin ed, if the economy evolves about as 
expected, the Committee anticipates mo derating the pace of its securities 
purchases later this year, but continui ng purchases until the unemployment rate

    is about 7 percent, economic growth is sufficient to support continuing solid job 
gains, and inflation is m oving back toward its 2 percent longer-run goal.   The 
Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases as necessary  to 
maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor m arket or 
inflation changes.     
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee expects that a highly accommoda tive stance of monetary policy will 
remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and 
the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the 
target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and current ly anticipates that 
maintaining  this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be 
appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ [ 6 | 5½ ]  
percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a 
half percentage point above the Committ ee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-
term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodativ e stance of monetary policy after a threshold has 
been crossed , the Committee will also consider other information, including 
additional measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accomm odation, it will take a balanced approach 
consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 
percent.  Specifically, so long as inflation remains near the Committee’s longer-
run objective and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the 
federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual until the economy is 
nearing maximum employment.

    THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee might see the economic situ ation and outlook as little changed 
since the June meeting and so be inclined to  make only small changes to the statement at 
this meeting, as in Alternative B.  Based on information received during the intermeeting 
period, policymakers may see recen t growth in economic activity  as modest but continue 
to expect the pace of economic recovery to pi ck up during the second half of this year 
and to increase somewhat further next y ear.  They might view the recent data as 
indicating a continuing moderate expansion of  private domestic final purchases despite 
the drag from fiscal policy.  In particular, members may anticipate that the restraint on 
economic activity that has resulted from this  year’s tax increase s and contraction in 
government spending will diminish in coming quarters.  The Committee also might judge that labor market conditions have continued to improve, wi th payroll employment having 
expanded at a solid pace in recent months.  That said, members may still see the 
unemployment rate—which has remained ju st above 7.5 percent in recent months—as 
well above their estimates of its longer-run normal level and see labor force participation 
as still well below its trend level.  With re gard to inflation, participants might judge 
recent data as suggesting that inflation is likely to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective in the near term—partly reflecti ng transitory factors—notwithstanding the 
recent jump in gasoline prices.  While they ma y anticipate that inflation is likely to move 
up as transitory factors fade, they may conti nue to expect that in flation is unlikely to 
exceed 2 percent over the medium run, particular ly in light of still-considerable resource 
slack in the economy. 
Based on this or a similar interpretation of incoming information, policymakers 
may conclude that the outlook for the labor mark et, while better than last September, has 
not yet improved substantially.  In addition, they may judge that the projected pickup in 
economic growth and associated decline in  unemployment, while likely, is far from 
certain.  Moreover, members may think that progress towards the Committee’s objectives 
for employment and inflation is not yet suffi cient—and that further progress is not yet 
sufficiently certain—to warra nt an immediate reduction in  the pace of securities 
purchases.  Against this backdrop, and taking into account their current assessments of 
the efficacy and costs of asset purchases, policymakers may conclude that the likely 
benefits of acquiring longer-term securities co ntinue to outweigh the potential costs.  If 
so, the Committee might decide that it is appropriate to con tinue buying longer-term 
securities at the same p ace as in recent months.

    Some participants may see the moderate rise in private domestic spending and 
solid gains in private payrolls  in the face of ongoing fiscal dr ag as an indication that the 
recovery is gaining momentum, and so they might be inclined to slow the pace of asset 
purchases to avoid a buildup of excessive risk-t aking in the financial sector, or to lower 
the risk of an undesirably large increase in inflation over the medium run.  However, the 
recent increases in the level and volatility of  medium- and longer-term interest rates seem 
to have led market participants to pare back some of their leveraged investments in fixed-
income instruments.  Moreover, with the une mployment rate still el evated and inflation 
expected to remain low, policymakers may not see a need to slow the pace of purchases 
at this meeting.  They may also be unsure  about how quickly the restraint on economic 
growth stemming from the tighter fiscal policy put in place earlier this year will begin to 
wane, or about the extent to which the recen t increase in mortgage rates will hold back 
home sales and residential investment; as a result, they may think that it would be prudent to wait for more information before deciding when and how much to slow the pace of 
asset purchases. 
Alternatively, some participants may j udge that labor market conditions have 
been improving slowly, and that the rate of improvement is unlikely to pick up 
appreciably unless the Committee adopts a still-more accommodative policy stance.  
With inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, these 
participants may think that it could be appr opriate to provide addi tional monetary policy 
stimulus in order to generate a more-rapid im provement in labor market conditions and to 
ensure that inflation moves up toward 2 percen t in coming years.  These participants may 
judge that the benefits of a longer-lasting and larger asset purchas e program would likely 
outweigh the costs.  They also may see other steps to provide additional accommodation, 
such as reducing the unemployment rate th reshold in the Committ ee’s forward guidance 
about the federal funds rate, as likely to be he lpful and appropriate.  Nevertheless, in view 
of the inherent noisiness of monthly and quart erly data, and the uncer tainties associated 
with the various means of providing additi onal accommodation, these policymakers may 
prefer to maintain the existing pace of purchases at the current meeting while holding open the possibility of incr easing the amount of policy a ccommodation if growth in 
economic activity does not pick up in the near future or if the economic outlook were to 
weaken. 
If neither the current policy settings nor  the Committee’s state-contingent policy 
intentions have changed, members might concl ude that relatively small adjustments to the 
Alternatives

    postmeeting statement are required.  They might want to update the summaries of 
incoming information and the outlook in paragraphs 1 and 2 to take account of 
information received since the June meeting.  In addition, participants may be concerned 
that over the intermeeting period, as market part icipants intensified their focus on the date 
at which a reduction in the pace of purchases might begin, there was an undesirable shift 
upward in the expected path of the federal f unds rate.  In light of this development, 
policymakers may want to emphasize that the Committee’s decisions about its asset 
purchases and about the federal funds rate  are independent a nd to underscore the 
Committee’s intention to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy well after the 
asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  With that goal in 
mind, policymakers may choose to add the la nguage provided in paragraph B.5 or B.5′ .  
The former emphasizes that highly accommodative policy will be appropriate for “the foreseeable future;” the latter explains that  the policy will include “very low short-term 
interest rates and ongoing, substantial Fe deral Reserve holdings of longer-term 
securities.”
1  
According to the Desk’s latest survey of  the primary dealers, most dealers do not 
anticipate any material changes in  the statement or in the stan ce of policy at this meeting.  
Some expect the statement to note a weaker tone in recent economi c data, but only a few 
suggested that it would include an explicit discussion of the Committ ee’s state-contingent 
plans for asset purchases or any change to the forward guidance language.  Dealers 
continue to see the third quarter  of 2015 as the most likely date for the first increase in the 
federal funds rate, and they all anticipate that  when the first increase occurs the 
unemployment rate will be at or below 6½ perc ent.  The median dealer’s expectations for 
the cumulative increase in the SOMA in  2013 and 2014, at roughly $1.2 trillion, did not 
change appreciably compared with the survey prior to the June meeting.  However, most 
dealers now anticipate that the first reduction in the pace of asset purchases is likely to 
occur in September rather than December.  Altogether, this evidence suggests that a 
statement along the lines of Alternative B would largely be in line with market 
participants’ expectations and thus would be unlikely to cause sizable changes in interest 
rates, equity prices, or the forei gn exchange value of the dollar.

    THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some policymakers might view the con tinued moderate expansion in private 
domestic final demand and solid gains in private payrolls in the face of significant 
restraint from fiscal policy as reasons to be  confident that the economic recovery is now 
on a firm footing, and so judge that it is appropriate to begin reducing the pace of 
purchases at this meeting, as in Alternat ive C.  Participants may now see a high 
likelihood of sustained solid improvement in labor market conditions in coming quarters 
as the fiscal headwind diminishes.  In addi tion, they may judge that overall financial 
conditions, bolstered by the ongoi ng recovery in housing prices  and further increases in 
equity prices, will support stronger economic growth despite the recent increase in mortgage rates; they might observe that mortgage rates remain, in any event, at 
historically low levels.  More over, some participants may vi ew the risks to the outlook 
for a pickup in economic growth as roughly balanced, with downside risks from unresolved fiscal issues and slowing growth abroad offset  by upside risks from improving 
household balance sheets and ongoing easing in  bank lending standards and terms.  In 
addition, the most recent readings on consum er price inflation may have made some 
participants less worried about  downside risks to near-term inflation, even as they 
continue to see upside risks to medium-ter m inflation from the ongoing expansion of the 
Federal Reserve’s already-large balance sheet. 
A judgment that it is now appropriate to  reduce the pace of purchases might also 
reflect the cumulative improvements in the outlook for the economy and the labor market 
since last September.  In particular, part icipants may judge that the decline in the 
unemployment rate observed since last su mmer, along with the increase in average 
monthly gains in private payroll employment since that time, is consistent with the 
“extent of progress” language in paragraph 4 of the Committee’s recent postmeeting 
statements.  Moreover, some policymakers may already view the improvement in the 
outlook for the labor market as “substantial” and so be inclined to bring the purchase 
program to a close in short order.  However, particularly in light of the recent elevated 
financial market volatility, they  may think that it is better to taper the pace of purchases 
and to bring them to an end when specific economic conditions are met rather than 
simply ending them now.  They may view this  approach as prudent, being concerned that 
an unexpected and abrupt end to the program  could cause market strains for a time, 
especially if it is perceived as inconsistent with the projected path of purchases already laid out by the Chairman.  (See the accomp anying box, “Considerations Regarding the 
Alternatives

    Composition of Reductions in the Pace of Purchases,” for a discussion on how a tapering 
in the pace of purchases might be split between  Treasury securities and agency MBS.)   
Some other policymakers may want to reduce the pace of purchases at this 
meeting because they judge that the bene fits no longer outweigh the costs.  These 
participants may be skeptical that the asset purchase program is  having a significant 
effect on overall macroeconomic outcomes, or  they may judge that it is boosting housing 
construction at the expense of other types of  investment spending.  Furthermore, they 
may see the prospective costs of continuing pur chases at the current pace as sizable.  In 
particular, they may remain concerned that  further asset purchas es could lead to 
excessive risk-taking in financial markets, undermine financial stability, and ultimately 
put the achievement of the dual mandate at ri sk.  Even if these participants see the 
potential costs associated with a still-larger  balance sheet as highly uncertain, they may 
wish to slow the pace of purchases while th ey accumulate more information about those 
costs and about the underlying economic situation.  In addition, participants may see 
recent financial market developments as indi cating that the risk to market functioning 
implied by a continuation of the current rate of purchases may have increased somewhat.  
For example, they may be concerned that the recent rise in mortgage rates has, by discouraging MBS issuance, raised the danger that the current pace of agency MBS 
purchases could become excessive in relati on to new MBS supply.  Other participants 
might be concerned that the Federal Rese rve’s large and expanding balance sheet may 
eventually contribute to an upward drift—or even a sharp increase—in longer-term 
inflation expectations. 
For all of the reasons discussed above, policymakers might prefer a statement like 
Alternative C that immediately reduces the pace of securities purchases, indicates that the 
Committee will likely make further reductions in the pace of its purchases as economic 
conditions improve, and lays out a state-contingent plan—similar to the one outlined by 
the Chairman in recent policy communi cations—under which purchases end once 
specific economic conditions are fulfilled. 
A decision to adopt a statement like Altern ative C would come as a surprise to 
market participants, particularly in light of the Chairman’s recent remarks about the 
Committee’s plans for asset purchases, and likely  would be seen as an indication that the 
Committee will end asset purchases sooner and ac quire an appreciably smaller total stock 
of securities than market participants currently anticipate.  Such an unexpected policy

Considerations Regarding the Composition of Reductions in the
Pace of Purchases
In the press conference following the June FOMC meeting and in his Monetary Policy  
Report  testimony in July, the Chairman indicated that if the economy evolves in line 
w ith outcomes that the Committee sees as most likely, the FOMC would begin 
reducing the pace of purchases sometime later this year and end the purchase 
program in the middle of next year. The Chairman also indicated that the reduction in 
the pace of purchases would be taken in “ measured steps,”  but did not specify how 
the cuts would be apportioned between Treasury securities and agency mortgage- 
backed securities (MBS).
Market participants generally expect the pace of Treasury and MBS purchases to be 
reduced simultaneously. In response to the July Survey of Primary Dealers, the 
median expected monthly purchases of both asset types begin to be reduced in 
September and then decline in roughly proportional amounts, falling to zero in the 
middle of next year (see left figure).
Staff model estimates suggest that differences in how cuts to the total pace of 
purchases are allocated across Treasuries and MBS should have only small effects on 
financial conditions because such differences would have only small and roughly 
offsetting effects on the composition of the SOMA. For instance, if, rather than 
reducing purchases of both assets simultaneously, the FOMC first stopped buying 
Treasury securities and then later stopped buying MBS, the result would be about 
$150 billion more in MBS purchases and about $150 billion less in Treasury purchases. 
As seen in the right table, this path fo r purchases would lower estimated MBS yields 
and primary mortgage rates 6 and 8 basis points, respectively, while 10-year Treasury 
rates would rise 2 basis points. 1
1 These estimates are derived from “ Evaluating the Efficacy of the Federal Reserve's Large-Scale 
Asset Purchases,” a memo sent to the Committee on March 8, 2013 by B . Durdu, T. Laubach,

  Cutting MBS purchases  first and then Treasury  securities  would be estimated  to have 
roughly the opposite  effects on financial conditions.   Given the  small size of the 
estimated  financial effects, the macroeconomic  effects of such changes  would likely 
also be small.  
Nevertheless,  the Committee  might find  it desirable  to reduce  the pace of purchases  
in one asset class before reducing  the pace in the other, either because it judges that 
in current circumstances  the effects  of MBS and Treasury  purchases  differ by more 
than the staff  model estimates  or because it wishes to convey  information about  the 
Committee’s  intentions  regarding  conditions  in the two markets.  For  example,  if 
purchases  of MBS are seen as significantly  more efficacious  than purchases  of 
Treasuries, and  the Committee wants  to provide more support to the housing  
market—perhaps  in response  to the recent significant  rise in MBS yields and  primary 
mortgage  rates—the monthly  purchases  of Treasury  securities  could be reduced 
before purchases  of MBS.  Alternatively,  if the Committee wished  to provide relatively  
more support to the  non‐housing sectors of the economy  or was concerned  that MBS 
purchases  inappropriately  allocate credit to the housing sector, it  might wish  to end 
MBS purchases  more quickly than Treasury  purchases.    
Another reason the Comm ittee might choose to reduce  the pace of purchases  of one 
type of security before the other would be if constraints  in one of the markets 
materialized.  For  example,  the Committee  might be  concerned  that with the recent 
backup in rates and associated  decline in mortgage  refinancing,  the pace of MBS 
issuance could  fall by enough to constrain  the Desk’s ability to purchase MBS  at the 
current pace without adversely affecting  market functioning.   However,  Desk analysis 
suggests that capacity in the Treasury  and MBS markets should  not constrain  
anticipated  Federal Reserve purchases  at least through June 2014, and  so purchases  
should not cause significan t market functioning  issues.   
There are also a number  of reasons why the Committee  might prefer to reduce  the 
pace of purchases  of both Treasuries  and MBS in parallel.  First,  if restarting  purchases  
that had been stopped was seen as costly, then the Committee might prefer to  
continue purchasing  both types of assets as long as the flow‐based program  
continued  in case the economy  were to weaken and  increased  purchases  of one type 
or the other or both were called for.  A second  potential  shortcoming  of cutting 
purchases  of first one asset class and then the other is that the reductions in 
purchases  of each asset  class would have to occur more rapidly in order to reduce  
combined  purchases  along the same baseline path.  It is possible that such a rapid 
change in the pace of purchases  could put additional  upward pressure  on Treasury  
yields or MBS spreads,  at least for a time, as  market participants  adjust to the change.  
Finally, reducing  the pace of purchases  for both asset categories  in parallel is  arguably  
more straightforward  and evidently  is expected  by market participants,  so sequencing  
the cuts could risk causing confusion  about the Committee’s  monetary  policy 
intentions.

    change probably would cause market partic ipants to mark up the expected path for 
shorter-term interest rates as well.  Longer-term interest rate s would rise, equity prices 
would presumably fall, and the foreign ex change value of the dollar would likely 
increase.  Those moves could be larger or smaller, depending on how investors judged 
the implications of the state-contingent plan  for asset purchases for the timing of the end 
of the purchase program.  Volatility in financia l markets would rise, at least for a time.

    THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some policymakers may read the incoming information as indicating that growth 
in economic activity is, once again, “stuck in low gear” rather than picking up as 
anticipated and so be inclined to pr ovide additional policy accommodation, as in 
Alternative A.  They may note that the unemployment rate has leveled out of late and 
may see the still-low labor force participa tion rate, along with the high levels of long-
duration unemployment and individuals work ing part-time for economic reasons, as 
indicating that there has been  only modest fundamental improvement in labor market 
conditions since last summer.  In addition, some policymakers may view a higher degree 
of accommodation as necessary in order to offs et upward pressure on real interest rates 
arising from the decline in in flation expectations observed si nce the start of the current 
purchase program.  These policymakers may think it likely that, without a more-
accommodative stance of monetary policy th an offered by Alternative B, output and 
employment would pick up only slowly and e xpand at no more than moderate rates in 
coming years, leaving the unemployment rate unacceptably high in the medium term.  They may also anticipate that if the Co mmittee does not provide additional stimulus 
inflation would not return to the Committee’s 2 percent target  over the next few years and 
that expected inflation might well drift down over time.  For these reasons, some 
participants may conclude that achievi ng both maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation over an appropriate horizon requires greater po licy accommodation.  Moreover, 
some participants may judge that a balanced  approach to achieving both goals requires 
providing accommodation that is sufficient to bring projected inflation temporarily above 
2 percent.   
Some participants may judge not only that  the modal outlook is unsatisfactory but 
also that downside risks to that outlook re main sizable.  Another Congressional impasse 
on the federal debt limit or other aspects of fiscal policy could heighten policy 
uncertainty and further restrain household spending and business investment later this 
year.  Moreover, the recent increase in mortga ge rates could slow th e rise in residential 
investment, which has been a bright spot in the economy in recent quarters.  At the same 
time, with underlying inflation continuing to run below 2 percent, some policymakers may see little risk that inflation or inflation expectations will move up; indeed, they may 
now be more concerned with downside risks to  inflation, especially  in light of still-
substantial resource slack and contained wage gains.  Policymakers may judge that with 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound, and w ith already heavy reliance on

    forward guidance and asset purchases to provide accommodation, the Committee’s 
ability to address adverse economic shocks is limited.  As a result, policymakers may see 
the potential consequences of a new negative shock as more co stly than the consequences 
of a positive shock that could boost economic gr owth and inflation.  If so, they may see 
the degree of uncertainty about the outlook and the asymmetry in risks as arguing for 
providing greater policy stimulus now. 
Some policymakers may worry that the state-contingent plan for reducing the 
pace of asset purchases that the Chairman outlined has been taken by market participants 
to be a date-based commitment and want to cl arify that the pace of future purchases will 
depend on the evolving economic outlook.  Such policymakers might see merit in a 
statement that includes language like that in paragraph A.4, which indicates that the 
Committee intends to continue purchasing asse ts until the unemployment rate declines to 
7 percent, economic growth is sufficient to s upport continuing job gain s, and inflation is 
moving back toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.  In addition, they may 
wish to affirm that this outline of the Comm ittee’s state-contingent plan lines up with the 
Chairman’s postmeeting and intermeeting stat ements and so include in the statement 
language like the clause “as the Chairman ha s outlined” that appears in paragraph A.4. 
Alternative A provides more accommodati on than Alternative B by reducing the 
forward guidance threshold for the unempl oyment rate and by  providing additional 
guidance about the path of the federal funds rate after it ri ses from its effective lower 
bound.  In particular, paragraph 5 includes optio ns to cut the unemployment threshold to 
either 6 percent or 5½ percent.2  In addition, the end of the paragraph states: “So long as 
inflation remains near the Committee’s long er-run objective and infl ation expectations 
remain well anchored, increases in the federal fu nds rate, once they be gin, are likely to be 
gradual until the economy is nearing maximu m employment.”  Some participants may 
judge that a reduction in the unemploymen t threshold and an announcement that the 
                                                 
2 If the Committee chooses to reduce the unemployment threshold from 6½ percent to 6 percent, 
recent staff simulations of the FRB/US model suggest that such a reduction would postpone the departure 
of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound by two quarters.  The result would be a modestly 
more-rapid recovery in which the unemployment rate reaches the natural rate of unemployment about two 
quarters earlier along with a slightly faster return of inflation to its 2 percent objective.  For additional 
information about the staff’s analysis of these an d other potential changes in the Committee’s forward 
guidance, see the memo by B. Durdu, E. Engen,  S. Meyer, and R. Tetlow, titled “Some Possible 
Adjustments to the Committee’s Forward Guidance for the Federal Funds Rate,” sent to the Committee on July 23, 2013.

    Committee intends to raise the federal funds rate only gradually until the economy is 
approaching full employment—provi ded that inflation and infl ation expectations are well 
behaved—could help to reverse some of the r ecent run-up in longer-term interest rates 
and thereby support the housing a nd other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.  In 
addition, some participants may anticipate that supporting robust gr owth in the housing 
sector will have additional positive effects, boosting househ old net worth and increasing 
consumer confidence, thereby stimula ting additional consumer spending. 
An announcement along the lines of Alte rnative A would surprise market 
participants, though some market commentar y has noted the possibility that the 
Committee might lower the unemployment ra te threshold to provide more policy 
accommodation.  In response, longer-term intere st rates would likely decline, inflation 
compensation and equity prices might rise, a nd the dollar might depreciate.  If, however, 
investors took a statement like Alternative A to  indicate that the FOMC has become more 
pessimistic about the outlook for economi c growth and employment than market 
participants had anticipated, equi ty prices might not rise or could even decline.  Changing 
the threshold for the unemployment rate mi ght create some confusion among investors 
about the extent to which the Committee feels bound by its forward guidance, potentially 
boosting the volatility of asset prices and the ri sk premiums built into market yields.  And 
the state-contingent plan for future asset purch ases could move interest rates either up or 
down depending on whether market participan ts focused on the assertion that the 
Committee anticipates moderating the pace of purchases later this year or on the data-
contingency of the three-part test for stopping asset purchases.

    DIRECTIVE   
The directive that was issued after the June meeting appears on the next page, 
followed by drafts for a July directive that correspond to each of the policy alternatives.  
The directives for Alternatives A and B are unchanged; the draft for Alternative C 
includes some changes to make the directive for that alternative consistent with the 
corresponding post-meeting statement. 
The draft directives for Alternatives A and B instruct the Desk to continue 
purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed  securities at a pace of about $40 billion 
per month and to continue purchasing longer-te rm Treasury securities  at a pace of about 
$45 billion per month.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to 
purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about [$35 | $30] billion per 
month, and to purchase longer-term Treasury se curities at a pace of about [$40 | $30] 
billion per month, beginning in August.  All three of the draft directives direct the Desk 
to maintain the current policy of reinvesti ng principal payments from its holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

        Projections 
BANK CREDIT AND MONEY  
Growth in commercial bank credit is projected to pick up gradually over the 
forecast period, from 3 percent in 2013 to 5.25 percent in 2016.  The modest acceleration 
reflects increased demand for bank loans as th e economic recovery strengthens and some 
further easing of credit conditions  for real estate and consumer  loans.  In particular, the 
staff anticipates that commercia l real estate loans, after decreasing every year since 2009, 
will grow at a gradually increasing rate, as  high vacancy rates on certain property types 
edge lower and the credit quality of existing loans in this sector continues to improve.  
Similarly, growth of residentia l real estate loans carried on banks’ books is expected to 
increase somewhat as standards and terms on such loans ease amid a projected improvement in household balance sheets a nd further gains in house prices.  We 
anticipate that the pace of expansion of consum er loans will also pick up as a result of 
further increases in auto purchases and a steady rise in household spending on other 
consumer durables.  In contra st, we project growth in comm ercial and industrial loans, 
which has been fairly rapid in recent quarters, to slow slightly over the forecast period to 
a pace more in line with the growth in nominal income.  Meanwhile, as the demand for 
bank loans strengthens and deposit growth m oderates, we expect banks’ holdings of 
securities to expand at a slower pace than in 2012. 
M2 growth is projected to decline over the forecast period, falling below nominal 
income growth in 2014 and turning negative in mid-2015.  Beginning later this year, the 
growth of liquid deposits—the largest com ponent of M2—is expected to moderate 
relative to the rapid e xpansion observed over recent years.  This step-down in the growth 
of liquid deposits reflects a gradual improve ment in economic conditions that encourages 
investors to shift their portfolios away from  the safe and liquid assets in M2 toward 
riskier investments.  M2 growth is proj ected to turn negative in mid-2015 as the 
opportunity cost of holding M2 assets is in creased by the assumed rise in short-term 
market rates.

 BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.  A ll three alternatives include additional asset 
purchases, though the pace and cumulative amount of purchases differ across the 
alternatives.1  Alternative B continues purchases at the current monthly pace in the near 
term, but then moderates the pace later this year; the pace of purchases would be reduced 
in measured steps through th e first half of 2014, ending aroun d mid-year.  Alternative A 
maintains the current pace of pur chases through the end of this year.  Thereafter, the pace 
of purchases is reduced in several steps through December 2014.  Alternative C decreases 
the pace of purchases immediately a nd ends purchases in December 2013. 
Projections under each scenario are based on assumptions about the trajectory of 
various components of the balance sheet a nd the balance sheet normalization strategy.2  
The projections for all alternatives assume that the SOMA portfolio shrinks only through 
the passive redemption of SOMA assets; in particular, consistent with the strategy 
outlined in the press conference statement following the June FOMC meeting, no sales of 
agency MBS are incorporated in the balance sheet projections. 
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and 
of longer-term Treasury securities  by $45 billion per month into  the fall and then reduce 
the pace of these purchases gradually through June 2014.3  When purchases stop, the staff 
forecast projects the unemploymen t rate to stand at about 7 percent.  We assume equal 
                                                 
1 The Committee is assumed to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and 
reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS until six 
months before the first increase in  the federal funds rate.  The assumption that maturing Treasury securities 
are rolled over at auction has a very modest effect on the size of the SOMA  portfolio because, as a result of 
the maturity extension program, there are currently le ss than $5 billion of Treasury securities in the SOMA 
portfolio that mature before January 2016. 
2 Details of these assumptions, as well as proj ections for each major component of the balance 
sheet, can be found in the Appendix that follows this section. 
3 The staff assumes that the main effect of asset purchases on financial conditions is related to the 
expected size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio over time.  As a result, the macroeconomic effects of a change in the pace of pu rchases will depend importantly on how the change 
influences investors’ expectations of the evolution of the overall size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.  For reference, see the memo titled “Changing the Pace of Asset Purchases” (by S. Carpenter, W. English, S. Meyer, W. Nelson, D. Re ifschneider, and R. Tetlow of the Federal Reserve 
Board, and J. Egelhof, S. Friedman, L. Logan, and S. Potter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the Committee on April 22, 2013.

 reductions in purchases of Treasury securi ties and agency MBS.  (See the box titled 
“Considerations Regarding the Composition of Reductions in the Pace of Purchases” for 
a discussion of the potential effects of different Treasury and MBS pace reductions.)  
Under these assumptions, purchases total abou t $1.2 trillion over 2013 and the first half 
of 2014, up from $900 billion assumed in  the June Tealbook Alternative B.4 
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” SOMA 
securities holdings under the purchase program assumed in Alternative B peak at about 
$4 trillion in February 2015, with $2.3 trilli on in Treasury securities holdings and $1.7 
trillion in agency securities holdings.  As in the staff forecast in Tealbook Book A, we 
assume that the first increase in the ta rget federal funds rate is in August 2015.5  In 
February 2015, six months before the first in crease in the target fe deral funds rate, all 
reinvestments are assumed to cease, and th e SOMA portfolio begins to contract.6 
Through these redemptions, the size of the portfolio is normalized by April 2021, two 
years later than in June Alternative B, wh ich assumed a smaller level of purchases and 
included MBS sales.7  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA 
holdings essentially matching the growth of currency in circulation and Federal Reserve 
Bank capital.8  Total assets are $2.5 trillion at the end of 2025, with a l ittle more than 
$500 billion in MBS holdings rema ining in the SOMA portfolio. 
                                                 
4 The balance sheet scenario assumed for Alternative B is consistent with the state-contingent plan 
for securities purchases laid out by the Chairman  in recent communications and discussed by the 
Committee at its June meeting, as well as with the cu rrent staff forecast presented in Tealbook Book A. 
5 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is one quarter later than that assumed in the balance 
sheet projections for Alternative B in the June Tealbook.  At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is 
projected to have fallen below the Committee’s 6.5 percent threshold, and inflation is expected to be moving towards the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
6 Temporary reserve draining tools (reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
7 The normalization assumptions in the June Tealbook Alternative B projection were in line with 
the exit strategy outlined in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting, which incorporated MBS sales over three to five years.  The change to no MBS sales in the current baseline delays the date of 
normalization five quarters.  The larger size of the LSAP program in the current Alternative B projection 
pushes out normalization another three quarters.   
8 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve 
capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve ba lances.  In this Tealbook, we lowered the long-run 
growth rate for capital paid-in from 15 percent to 12.5 percent.  (See the memo titled “Change to the

 The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications for Federal 
Reserve income across the alternatives.  Unde r Alternative B, interest income rises until 
reinvestments cease and then declines as the SOMA portfolio begins to contract through 
paydowns of principal.  As the federal funds rate rises after liftoff,  interest expense on 
reserve balances climbs.  As a result, Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury 
decline, although they are projected to remain positive over the entire projection period.  
Annual remittances peak at about $100 billion in 2014 and trough at $22 billion later in 
the decade and no deferred asset is recorded in  this scenario.  The trough in remittances is 
about $20 billion higher than the projected trough  in Alternative B in the June Tealbook, 
which included MBS sales and, hence, record ed realized capital losses.  Cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $970 billion, well above the level that 
would have been observed without  the asset purchase programs. 
As interest rates rise in the scenario for Alternative B, the market value of the 
SOMA portfolio falls and this reduces the unr ealized gain position of the portfolio.  The 
substantial rise in interest rates over the pa st few months, for example, has reduced the 
unrealized gain position of the portfolio from  about $185 billion at the end of the first 
quarter of this year to $35 billi on at the end of the second quarter.9  At the end of 2013, 
the portfolio is estimated to  report an unrealized loss of about $60 billion, a $50 billion 
larger loss than projected in the June Tealbook.  The effect of the r ecent rise in interest 
rates on cumulative remittances depends on the entire projected path of the federal funds 
rate and longer term rates.  Given the modest changes to these interest rates in the medium- and longer-term staff projection (see the “Interpretations of Developments in 
Key Financial Markets” box in the Domestic Economic Development and Outlook 
section of Tealbook Book A), projected cumu lative remittances are only marginally 
affected. 
                                                                                                                                                 
Assumption for Capital Paid-in for Balance Sheet and Income Projections” for details.)  The projected 
timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve 
balances that is assumed to be necessary to conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of 
reserve balances to be $25 billion.  A higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead to an earlier normalization of the size of the balance sheet. 
9 The Federal Reserve reports the unrealized gain/loss position to the public with a lag in the 
“Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financia l Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .  The second quarter figure 
will be published on August 23.

 In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Treas ury securities and a dditional agency MBS 
through the end of 2013.  At the beginning of 2014, the Committee is assumed to begin 
reducing the pace of purchases and completing the purchase program at the end of the 
year.  Under these assumptions, purchases total about $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014.  
The more accommodative policy stance would be  consistent with a projection of the 
macroeconomy that is a bit weaker than in the staff forecast or a desire on the part of the 
Committee to provide more accommodation.  In th is scenario, SOMA securities holdings 
increase to a peak of about $4.3 trillion in  September 2015.  The first increase in the 
target federal funds rate occurs in the thir d quarter of 2016—later than in Alternative B—
because of the assumed 5.5 percent threshold for the unemployment rate.  In February 
2016, all reinvestments are projected to ceas e, and the SOMA portfolio begins to 
contract.  As in Alternative B, this scen ario assumes MBS holdings are only reduced 
through paydowns of principal.  The size of the portfolio is normalized at the end of 2021, about two quarters later than in the s cenario corresponding to Alternative B, 
reflecting the larger asset purchase program and the later start to balance sheet 
normalization. 
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of the SOMA portfolio and re serve balances in the near term.  Net interest income 
increases initially and then remains elevated until reinvest ments are assumed to end, and 
annual Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury peak at $107 billion in 2015.  As the 
federal funds rate rises after liftoff, the inte rest expense on reserve balances increases, 
reducing Federal Reserve net income somewhat.  Federal Reserve remittances to the 
Treasury are projected to remain positive over the entire projection period and no 
deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances remain robust, and from 2009 through 2025, they are about $985 billion, an amount slightly higher than that projected under Alternative B. 
For the scenario that corresponds to A lternative C, the Committee announces an 
immediate reduction of monthly purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities and of 
agency MBS by $10 billion each.  The Committee is assumed to cease purchases by the 
end of 2013, which brings purchases to about $84 0 billion for the year.  The scaling back 
of the asset purchase program may be seen as consistent with a projection for the 
macroeconomy that is a bit stronger than in th e staff forecast or with  an assessment that 
the prospective costs of further purchases are likely to outweigh the benefits.  In this

 scenario, the federal funds rate is assumed to lift off in ear ly 2015.  Corresponding to this 
earlier increase in the federal funds rate, reinvestment of principal from maturing or 
prepaying securities ends and redemptions begin in late 2014, causing the portfolio to 
begin to contract.  SOMA secu rities holdings in this scen ario peak at $3.6 trillion in 
August 2014, and the size of the balance sheet is normalized about th ree quarters earlier 
than under Alternative B.  Federal Reserve re mittances to the Treas ury are projected to 
remain positive throughout the projection pe riod and no deferred asset is recorded.  
Cumulative remittances from 2009 to 2025 are about $950 billion, a litt le less than under 
Alternative B. 
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases.10  Reserve balances peak  at about $3 trillion, $2.8 
trillion, and $2.5 trillion under Alte rnatives A, B, and C, respectively.  When the federal 
funds rate lifts off from its lower bound, re serve balances are $2.7 trillion, $2.7 trillion, 
and $2.4 trillion under Alternatives A, B, and C, respectively. 
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternativ e Projections for the Monetary Base,” in 
the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base increases through the 
third quarter of 2014 because of the purchase program and the accompanying increase in 
reserve balances.  Once exit begins, the mone tary base shrinks, on net, through mid-2021, 
primarily because of redempti ons of securities and the co rresponding reduction in reserve 
balances.  Starting in mid-2021, after reserve balances are assumed to have stabilized at 
$25 billion, the monetary base begins to expa nd in line with the growth of currency in 
circulation.  Under Alternative A, the mone tary base increases through late 2014, as the 
level of reserve balances climbs in concert with the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet.  The monetary base then cont racts during the exit period until the size of 
the portfolio is normalized.  Under Alternativ e C, the monetary base increases through 
early 2014 because of the purchase program and then contracts, on net, until the size of 
the portfolio is normalized. 
                                                 
10 The level of reserve balances is also contingent on the evolution of other balance sheet items.

  Appendix 
This appendix presents the assumptions underl ying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet, Income, and Moneta ry Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are constructe d at a monthly frequency from July 2013 to 
December 2025.  The few balance sheet items th at are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level ob served on June 28, 2013.  The projections for all 
major asset and liability categories under each scen ario are summarized in the tables that follow 
the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in A ugust 2015.  This date of liftoff is consistent with 
the current staff economic forecast and the th resholds described in the June 2013 FOMC 
statement, and it is one quarter later than assumed in the balance sheet projections for Alternative 
B in the June Tealbook.  In the projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the 
first increase in the target federal funds rate occurs  in the third quarter of 2016, consistent with a 
reduction in the threshold for the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent.  The projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative C assume the target federal funds rate lifts off in early 
2015.  In each case, the balance sheet projections assume no use of short-term draining tools to 
achieve the projected path for the target federal funds rate.
1 
ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by 
$40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by $45 billion per month into the fall of 2013.  Then, purch ases are assumed to continue—though at a 
steadily decreasing pace—and conclude by mid-2014.  The Treasury securities 
purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The 
                                                 
1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreemen ts were used to drain re serves, the composition of 
liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements would be matched 
by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, these draining tools would be wound down as 
the balance sheet returns to its steady-state growth path , so that the projected paths for securities presented 
here would remain valid.

  Treasury and MBS purchases in 2013 and the first half of 2014 expand the SOMA 
portfolio’s holdings by about $1.2 trillion.  
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS.  
o Starting in February 2015—six months prior to the assumed increase in the target 
federal funds rate—all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The portfolio declines only through the passive redemption of SOMA assets. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest ra te projections generated from the staff’s 
FRB/US model.
2  The projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying 
assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A,  the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Trea sury securities and additional agency MBS 
until the end of 2013.  Thereafter, the pace of purchases is reduced in several steps and purchases end in December 2014.  The Treasu ry securities purchased are assumed to 
have an average duration of about nine years.  The Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $1.5 trillion in 2013 and 2014.  In addition, the Committee is assumed to maintain its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdi ngs of agency debt and agency MBS in 
agency MBS.  Starting in early 2016, princi pal payments from all securities are allowed 
to roll off the portfolio.  The portfolio d eclines only through the passive redemption of 
SOMA assets. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed to decrease the 
monthly pace of purchases to $35 billion of  longer-term Treasury securities and 
$30 billion of additional agency MBS beginning  in August 2013.  The pace of purchases 
is reduced again later this year and purchases cease by the end of this year.  The Treasury 
securities purchased are assumed to have an av erage duration of about nine years.  The 
Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by about $840 billion in 2013.  The FOMC continues to reinvest the proceeds 
from principal payments on its agency secu rities holdings in agency MBS until August 
2014, six months prior to the assumed increas e in the target federal funds rate.  
Thereafter, all securities are allowed to roll o ff the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  
The portfolio declines only through the passive redemption of SOMA assets.  
 If interest rates are below (above) the coupon rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the 
market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases securities will be greater (less) than 
their face value and the Federal Reserve record s a premium (discount).  In Alternative A, 
                                                 
2 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of July 22, 2013.

  Treasury purchases result in net premiums of roughly $4 billion, whereas in Alternatives 
B and C, net premiums are unchanged over the length of the purchase programs.  
 The market value at which the Federa l Reserve purchases new agency MBS will 
generally exceed their face value.  As a resu lt, for Alternatives A, B, and C, the premiums 
on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet will ri se by roughly $32 billion, $22 billion, and 
$10 billion, respectively, relative to a scenario without MBS purchases.   
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is  assumed to decline gradually, reaching zero 
by the end of 2014.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  
Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is assumed 
to stay constant at $23 billion.  
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 
 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $250 million currently to zero in 2015.  
Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by the LLC.
3  Consistent with events to date, th e projections assume the LLC does not purchase 
any asset-backed securities.  (It would have to make such purchases if an asset-backed 
security were received by the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York in connection with a 
decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC declin e from about $1.4 billion to zero in 2016. 
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to grow at an average annual rate of 
6 percent through 2015, in line with the staff forecast.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes 
in circulation grow at the same rate as nom inal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
                                                 
3 On January 15, 2013, the Board of Governors approved the elimination of the U.S. Treasury’s 
funding commitment and the repayment of the initial funding amount plus accrued interest.  Additionally, 
the Board of Governors approved the disbursement of contingent interest payments from TALF LLC to 
Treasury and FRBNY that equal, approximately, the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the 
amount of outstanding TALF loans less funds reserved for future expenses of TALF LLC.  The first 
payment occurred in February, and additional payments occur on a monthly basis.

   The level of reverse repurchase agreements ( RRPs) is assumed to be around $100 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international 
accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion because it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 12.5 percent per y ear, in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
4 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of 
Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital 
items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  In this Tealbook, none of th e alternatives result in a deferred asset.   
TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS5 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous te rm premium effect is negative 125 basis 
points.  Over the remainder of the projecti on period, the term premium effect declines 
slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated normalization of the portfolio.  
The contemporaneous term premium effect for Alternative B is roughly 20 basis points 
                                                 
4 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet, the size of the SOMA portfolio after normalization, and the level of annual remittances to the 
Treasury.  In this Tealbook, the staff lowered the long-run growth rate for capital paid-in from 15 percent to 
12.5 percent. See the memo titled “Change to the Assumption for Capital Paid-in for Balance Sheet and 
Income Projections” for details.  
5 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the

  more negative in this Tealbook compared with the June Tealbook as a result of the no 
MBS sales assumption, the larger purchase program, and the later liftoff for the federal 
funds rate.   
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury note 
is about negative 140 basis points in the current quarter. 6  The effect wanes over time as 
securities roll off the portfolio.  
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect  is about negative 110 basis points.  The 
effect is less negative than in Alternativ e B because there are fe wer securities purchased 
in 2013 and t he liftoff date is earlier, so the balance sheet starts contracting sooner than 
under Alternative B. 
                                                 
6 The staff projection of the term premium effect depends on assumptions about the size of the 
asset purchase program and the balance sheet normalizat ion strategy.  If market participants anticipate a 
different sized program or a different exit strategy, the staff estimates of the term premium effect may not 
be the same as those priced in market rates.
