Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the fede ral funds rate from six policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013 and 2014.  (Medium-term prescriptions de rived from dynamic simulations of the 
rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the le ft-hand columns, four of the six rules keep 
the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound in the next two quarters.  The Taylor 
(1993) rule, which puts relatively little weight on the outpu t gap, prescribes a federal 
funds rate of about 120 basis points in the co ming quarter and 130 basi s points in the first 
quarter of 2014.  The first-difference rule, whic h responds to the expected change in the 
output gap, prescribes a federal funds rate of  about 25 basis points for the coming quarter 
and about 50 basis points in the first quarter of 2014.  
The right-hand columns display the near-ter m prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.1   For the next two quarters, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based ru le prescribe federal funds rates around zero.  
In contrast, the Taylor (1999)  rule, which does not include a lagged value of the federal 
funds rate and responds more strongly to current inflation and the staff’s estimate of the 
current output gap, prescribes negative values  for the federal funds rate.  The nominal 
income targeting rule responds both to the cu rrent estimate of the output gap as well as 
the cumulative shortfall of in flation below the assumed 2 percent target since 2008.  As a 
result, this rule also prescribes negative valu es for the federal funds rate for the next two 
quarters. 
The Tealbook baseline projections for th e output gap and inflation are shown in 
the bottom half of the exhibit, titled “Key Elements of the St aff Projection.”  As shown in 
the bottom left panel, the staff’s projection fo r the output gap is narr ower in the near-term 
                                                 
1 Four of these rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nominal income 
targeting rule, and the first-difference rule—place subs tantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed thus far this quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table are indirectly affected by 
the lower bound.  The appendix provides further details.

than it was in the previous Tealbook, reflecti ng changes in the staff’s estimated level of 
potential output as well as the upward revision to GDP growth  for the first half of this 
year.  Over the medium-term, however, the staff expects economic conditions to improve 
at a somewhat more modest pace than in July so that from 20 15 onward, the projected 
output gap is generally close to the estimat e reported in the previous Tealbook.  As 
indicated in the bottom right panel, the staff forecast for inflation runs slightly below the 
July Tealbook projection, and therefore approaches the Committee’s 2 percent objective 
slightly more slowly.2 
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated using the FRB/US model after adjusting it to replicate 
the staff’s economic forecast.  The short-run  r* estimate of the equilibrium real federal 
funds rate corresponds to the rate that would, if  maintained, return output to potential in 
12 quarters.  Consistent w ith the staff’s modest downw ard revision to the economic 
outlook over the medium-term, the r*  estimate for the current quarter is only slightly 
lower than in July.  As has been tr ue since late 2008, the estimate of r*—currently about 
1.6percent—remains below the estimated actual real federal funds rate, which is now 
1.1 percent. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model that incorporate endogenous responses of 
inflation and the output gap implied by having the federal funds rate follow the paths 
prescribed by the different policy rules, under the assumption that the federal funds rate is 
constrained by the effective lower bound but  the Committee’s thresholds related to 
inflation and the unemployment rate are ignored.3  (Alternative policy rule simulations 
that incorporate thresholds ar e discussed below.)  Each rule  is applied from the fourth 
                                                 
2 As discussed in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section of Tealbook A, the 
revision to the inflation outlook largely reflects a methodological change implemented in this year’s annual 
revision to the national income and product account data, in which the Bureau of Economic Analysis changed their procedure for estimating the non-market component of the personal consumption 
expenditures price index. 
3 The staff’s baseline forecast inco rporates the macroeco nomic effects of the FOMC’s large-scale 
asset purchase programs.  Specifically, it embeds th e assumption that the FOMC  will purchase a total of 
about $1.2 trillion in longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS during 2013 and the first half of 
2014, with the pace of purchases dec lining in several steps beginning th is year and reaching zero in the 
middle of next year.  Based on these assumptions, all of the policy-rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the projected effect s of these balance sheet policies; the rules themselves, however, are 
not directly adjusted for the ef fects of balance sheet policies.

quarter of 2013 onward, under the assumptions that  financial market participants as well 
as price- and wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follow that rule and that agents 
fully understand and anticipate the implications  of the rule for future real activity, 
inflation, and interest rates.4   
The exhibit also displays the implica tions of following the Tealbook baseline 
policy.  That policy keeps the federal funds ra te at its effective lower bound of 12.5 basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is a bove 6.5 percent and averag e inflation five to 
eight quarters hence is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  After either of these 
variables crosses its threshold value, the federal funds ra te in the baseline projection 
follows the prescriptions of th e inertial Taylor (1999) rule .  In the current baseline 
projection, the unemployment rate falls below its threshold during the first quarter of 
2015, one quarter earlier than in the July T ealbook baseline.  The federal funds rate 
begins to rise from its effective lowe r bound in the second quarter of 2015, gradually 
climbs to 3 percent by 2018, and reaches 3.9 percent by the end of 2020.  Under this 
assumed policy rate path, the unemployment rate  is projected to d ecline slowly towards 
the staff’s estimate of the long-term natural rate of unemployment of 5.2 percent, which it 
reaches in the first half of 2017, and then decreases slightly further before settling back at the natural rate; headline inflation converges  gradually to 2 per cent by the end of the 
decade.   
Without thresholds, most of the policy ru les call for tightening to begin earlier 
than under the Tealbook baseline.  Four of the rules put the real  federal funds rate 
persistently above the path implied by the base line forecast, policy settings that result in 
higher unemployment and lower inflation through most of the decade, compared with the baseline.  Despite beginning to tighten earlie r than under the baseline , the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule generates only slightly less favorable outcomes for unemployment and 
basically the same path for inflation because this rule prescribes only a very gradual pace 
of tightening.

4 The FRB/US model used to generate the different simulations has changed since the July 
Tealbook so that the sectoral coverage corresponds to the revised national income and product account 
data, and its equations have been re-estimated based on the revised data.  Moreover, the model features a modified wage/price block.  These changes imply that inflation is somewhat less responsive to resource utilization, and that aggregate spending is somewhat less responsive to changes in the federal funds rate. 
5 The Taylor (1999) rule, which does not seek to smooth the path for the nominal interest rate, 
prescribes the first increase in the federal funds rate only one quarter earlier than the inertial Taylor (1999)

Only the nominal income targeting rule prescribes a later tightening than under 
the Tealbook baseline.  This rule keeps the federal funds rate at the lower bound until the 
third quarter of 2016 and generates a real fede ral funds rate persistently below baseline 
for the rest of the decade, thereby inducing st ronger future real activity and higher future 
inflation.  Markets are assumed to antic ipate these developments completely.  
Consequently, longer-term real interest rates are lower today than under the baseline 
policy.  These more-accommodative conditions result in a markedly lower trajectory for 
the unemployment rate.  In addition, greater resource utilization in the short run and 
higher expected future inflation both boost inflation in the near term.  
The results presented in these and subs equent simulations depend importantly on 
the assumption that policymakers will adhere to  the simulated rule in the future and that 
private sector expectations fully incorporat e the paths for the federal funds rate, real 
activity, and inflation implied by the rule.  This assumption plays a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targ eting rule, which is associated with outcomes 
in which inflation runs above the 2 percent long-run goal for some y ears, even after the 
output gap is closed.6   
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which the policy rules are s ubject to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.  For each of the ru les, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at its  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and aver age inflation five to eight quarters hence 
is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  Fi nancial market particip ants and price- and 
wage-setters are assumed to understand that the Committee will switch  to the specified 
rule when one of the threshold conditions is satisfied and to view this switch as 
permanent and fully credible.  In each of th e simulations discussed below, crossing the 
unemployment threshold turns out to be the ca talyst for switching to the specified rule. 
                                                                                                                                                 
rule.  But without inertia, the Taylor (1999) rule pres cribes a markedly more rapid increase in the nominal 
federal funds rate thereafter, causing the real federal funds rate to be persistently higher than under the 
baseline policy. 
6 Most of the policy rules imply a similar degree of accommodation as in the previous Tealbook.  
The exception is the nominal income targeting rule wh ich prescribes a departure of the federal funds rate 
from the effective lower bound three quarters later than  in July and implies a real federal funds rate path 
that is between 20 and 90 basis points lower from 2016 onward.  This change in policy prescription in part 
reflects the staff’s lower projected path of the GDP deflator resulting from this year’s revision in the 
national income and product account data, which affects the nominal income targeting rule but not the other rules.

For all of the rules except the nominal income targeting rule, imposing the 
thresholds leads to a later departure of the federal funds rate from the effective lower 
bound than that shown in the second exhibit.  In these cases, the threshold-augmented 
rules prescribe the first increase in the federa l funds rate in the fi rst half of 2015, between 
two quarters and two years later than is prescribed by the same rules without thresholds.  
The threshold strategy has the largest effects on the departure date under the 
Taylor (1993) and the first-difference rules.  In particular, without thresholds these rules 
depart from the zero bound by the end of this year in the case of th e Taylor (1993) rule 
and mid-2014 in the case of the first-differe nce rule.  Imposing the thresholds on these 
rules postpones the departure from the zer o bound by a year or more.  As a result, 
unemployment declines faster and inflation is  higher when the thresholds are imposed on 
these rules.  In contrast, the threshold st rategy postpones departure from the lower bound 
by only three quarters or less under the Taylor (1999), the inertial Taylor (1999), and the 
outcome-based rules, and such a strategy generates little difference in the outcomes for 
unemployment and inflation compared with those generated by the same rules without 
the thresholds.7  Because the nominal income targeti ng rule does not prescribe raising the 
federal funds rate above its effective lowe r bound until after the unemployment rate falls 
below 6.5 percent, imposing the thresholds on the nominal income targeting rule does not 
alter the date for this rule’s prescribed departure from the lower bound, and outcomes for inflation and unemployment are not affected.  
These simulation results illustrate that the economic consequences of threshold-
based forward guidance depend importantly on the policy that is exp ected to be followed 
after a threshold is crossed. 
The fourth exhibit, “Constrained vs. Unconstrained Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those reported in  the July Tealbook.
8  Policymakers are assumed to place equal 
weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in th e federal funds rate.  The optimal control 
                                                 
7 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with thresh olds corresponds to the Tealbook baseline. 
8 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance-sheet policies 
described in footnote 3.  The simulated policies do not incorporate thresholds.

concept presented here corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers 
make choices today that effectively cons train policy choices in future periods. 
The simulations indicate that the federa l funds rate implied by the constrained 
optimal control policy departs from the eff ective lower bound in the first quarter of 2016, 
one quarter earlier than in th e constrained optimal control si mulations in July, reflecting 
the staff’s somewhat narrower estimate of the current output gap.  Thereafter, the optimal 
control path for the federal funds rate is so mewhat flatter compared with the previous 
Tealbook, reflecting the downward revisi on to the staff’s economic outlook.9 
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal c ontrol policy promotes a slightly stronger 
economic recovery.10  In particular, the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent by 
the first quarter of 2015 and reaches 5.2 percen t—the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
of unemployment—in the third quarter of  2016; thereafter, the unemployment rate 
declines to 4.75 percen t by 2018 before returning essentially to the natural rate by the end 
of 2020.  In turn, the path of inflation is  higher than under the baseline, reaching the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective in the first ha lf of 2018 and subsequently rising slightly 
higher before gradually moving back toward 2 percent after 2020.  The swifter 
achievement of the Committee’s assumed object ives occurs because the optimal control 
policy credibly promises to remain highly ac commodative for even longer than under the 
baseline policy.  In current circumstances, this generates—through the response of the 
private sector’s expectations for future m onetary policy and the repercussions for the 
economy—more favorable effects on financial conditions, real activit y, and inflation in 
the near term.  
                                                 
9 As described in footnote 4, the FRB/US model used to compute the optimal control simulations 
has undergone several modifications that have reduced the sensitivity of real activity and inflation to 
changes in the federal funds rate.  These modifications  have only a modest effect for the optimal control 
paths of the federal funds rate and the unemployment  rate, but imply a noticeably lower optimal control 
path for inflation than if the simulations had been computed with the July version of FRB/US, reflecting th e 
reduced responsiveness of inflation to resource utilizati on.  The flatter optimal control path of the federal 
funds rate in the current simulation compared with th at in the previous Tealbook primarily reflects the 
downward revision to the staff’s economic outlook. 
10 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

In the absence of the lower-bound constrai nt, the optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate would decline to about 1 percent by late 2014 and become positive 
again in the first half of 2016.  The unconstrained policy w ould bring the unemployment 
rate down a bit faster over the next fe w years and subsequently would make the 
unemployment rate converge faster to the na tural rate than would be the case under the 
constrained policy.  The path for inflation under the unconstrained optimal control policy 
is nearly identical to the constrained policy.  
A feature of the constrained optimal contro l simulation is that the nominal federal 
funds rate converges only gradually towards it s long-run value of 4 percent.  This slow 
convergence reflects a number of factors in cluding adverse economic conditions that 
would make aggregate demand persistently weak if the interest rate returned quickly to 
its long-run natural level, and the fact that the policymaker’s objective function includes a 
term that penalizes changes in  the federal funds rate and t hus encourages interest rate 
smoothing.  To ascertain the role played by interest rate smoothing, the fifth exhibit, 
“Optimal Control Policy with Lower Weight on Interest Rate Smoothing under 
Commitment,” compares these results with the outcomes from an alternative optimal 
control simulation under commitment in which the penalty weight on the change in the 
federal funds rate is smaller.11   
The simulations indicate that sharpl y reducing the weight  on interest-rate 
smoothing in the policymaker’s objective func tion has a sizable effect on the optimal 
trajectory for the nominal federal funds rate but leads to only small differences in 
macroeconomic outcomes.  With minimal inte rest-rate smoothing, the policy rate lifts off 
from the effective lower bound la ter than in our standard si mulation, but then rises more 
rapidly toward its longer-run leve l.  As a consequence, the path  of long-term interest rates 
is barely affected, and the tw o simulations generate almost identical trajectories for the 
unemployment rate and inflation. 
For optimal control policy under commitment, the federal funds rate moves up 
from the effective lower bound later than w ithout commitment because policymakers aim 
to stimulate the economy by lowering real rate s in the current period via a promise that 
policy in the future will remain more accommoda tive.  To abstract from this effect, the 
                                                 
11 Specifically, the weight on changes in the federal funds rate in the objective function is reduced 
to one twentieth of its original weight.  Reduci ng the weight even further would cause convergence 
problems with the model.

sixth exhibit, “Optimal Control Policies wi th Lower Weight on In terest Rate Smoothing 
under Discretion,” considers the case of a lo wer weight on interest rate smoothing for 
optimal control polic y under discretion. 
Under discretion, policymakers cannot cred ibly commit to carrying out a plan 
involving future policy choices that would be suboptimal at the time these choices have 
to be implemented.  This assumption limits policymakers’ ability to influence private-
sector expectations of the fede ral funds rate and other variables in the present.  Instead, 
the private sector knows that future Committees will always make policy choices without 
regard for past policymaker promises, and this behavior leads to less stimulative policy in 
current circumstances.  The simulations show that under a discretionary optimal control 
policy that places the standard weight on th e interest-rate smoothing term, the federal 
funds rate departs from the lower bound in the third quarter of 2015, two quarters earlier 
than under commitment, and keeps monetary policy somewhat less accommodative thereafter, so the unemployment rate barely falls below its natural rate and inflation does 
not rise above the 2 percent objective.   
As was the case with optimal control under commitment, reducing the weight on 
interest-rate smoothing in the objective function of a disc retionary policymaker has a 
sizable effect on the optimal trajectory for th e policy rate but has only a small effect on 
economic outcomes.  In particular, with minimal weight on interest-rate smoothing, the 
nominal federal funds rate departs from th e effective lower bound later but increases 
more rapidly thereafter than under the disc retionary optimal control policy with equal 
weight on interest-rate smoothing.  The two policies imply almost identical paths for 
longer-term rates, and, as a re sult, the trajectories  for the unemployment rate and inflation 
are again quite similar.  Even under discretion and with minimal weight on interest rate 
smoothing, however, the federal funds rate reaches 3 percent only by the end of 2017, 
and it remains below its 4 percent longer-run level even at the end of 2020, suggesting 
that persistently weak aggregate demand is an important factor unde rlying the low level 
of the federal funds rate later this decade.   
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under Alte rnative Policies without Thresholds” and 
“Outcomes under Alternative Po licies with Thresholds,” ta bulate the simulation results 
for key variables under each policy rule disc ussed above, with and without thresholds.

Appendix
Policy  Rules  Used in "Monetary  Policy  Strategies "
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in "Monetary 
Policy Strategies." In the table, \ (  R _ t \ )  denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter \ (  t \ ) , while the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( \ (  \ p i _ t \ )  a n d  \ (  \ p i _ { t + 3 |t } \ ) ) , the output gap estimate for the 
current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( \(  g a p _ t\)  a n d  \(  g a p _ { t+ 1 |t} \) ) , and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( \ (  \ D e l t a ^ 4 g a p _ { t + 3 |t } \ ) ) .  The value of policymakers’  
long-run inflation objective, denoted \ (  \ p i ^ * \ ) ,  is 2 percent. The nominal income targeting rule 
responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal income 
\ (  y n _ t \ )  (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value \ (  y n ^ * _ t \ )  (100 times the log of 
target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff s estimate of 
potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, 
target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff’s estimate of 
potential GDP.
Taylor (1993) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\)
Taylor (1999) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\)
Inertial Taylor (1999) rule \( R _t = 0.85R _{t-1}+0.15\left(2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)
O utcom e-based rule\ (  R _ t  =  
1 . 2 R _ { t - 1 } - 0 . 3 9 R _ { t - 2 } + 0 . 1 9 [ 0 . 5 4 + 1 . 7 3 \ p i _ t + 3 . 6 6 g a p _ t - 2 . 7 2 g a p _ { t - 1 } ] \ )
First-difference rule \( R _ t =  R _ { t-1 }+ 0 .5 (\p i_ {t+ 3 |t}\-\p i^* )+ 0 .5 ( \D elta^4 g ap _ { t+ 3 |t}\)
Nom inal incom e targeting rule \( R_t = 0.75R_{t-1}+0.25(2+\pi_t+yn_t-yn^*_t)\)
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff. 1 The outcome- 
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q1-2006:Q4. The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model. 2 The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules and the long-run
1 See Erceg and others (2012).
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised the long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2 V percent to 2 percent. The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change.

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not de pend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run quarterly real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook Outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap, while using the same  lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook Outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarter s using the output projection from FRB/US, the 
staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very 
broad array of economic factors, some of which ta ke the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhi bit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simu lations of the FRB/US model.  The simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

 Monetary Policy Alternatives  
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Alternative B maintains the current monthly pace of 
purchases but indicates that the Committee is prepared to moderate the pace of 
purchases—potentially later this year—if it sees further evidence of improvement in 
labor market conditions and inflation movi ng toward its 2 percent longer-run goal.  
Alternative A also maintains the current p ace of asset purchases but suggests that the 
Committee is not as likely to reduce the pace of its purchases in the near term.  
Alternative C announces a modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases of $5 billion 
per month for agency MBS and also for Treasury securities.  Alternatives B and C retain 
the forward guidance for the federal funds rate  used in the Committee’s July statement.  
Alternative A augments that forwar d guidance on several dimensions. 
In summarizing recent economic developmen ts, all the alternatives characterize 
the recent pace of economic activity as “moderate,” and all cite fiscal policy as a factor restraining economic growth.  The further increase in mortga ge rates observed since July 
is also mentioned in all of the alternatives, but Alternative C suggests this development is 
not a source of much concern.  Alternatives A and B acknowle dge that some labor market 
indicators have continued to improve; Altern ative A, however, also notes the apparent 
slowing in job gains.  Alternative C presents  a more upbeat characterization of the labor 
market, referring to “continuing” gains in payrolls.  Alternatives A and B note that inflation has been running “below” the Co mmittee’s longer-term objective once changes 
in energy prices are excluded; Alternativ e C uses “somewhat below.”  All of the 
alternatives note that longer-term infla tion expectations have remained stable. 
In characterizing the economic outlook, a ll three alternatives say the Committee 
expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth “will pick up 
from its recent pace” and the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward its 
mandate-consistent level.  With respect to the risks to the outlook, al l of the alternatives 
reaffirm the Committee’s judgment that the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market have diminish ed since the fall of 2012.  Alternative A 
cautions, however, that “the tightening of financial conditio ns observed in recent months, 
if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market,” while Alternative B has optional language stating that the tigh tening of financial

 conditions is a source of concern.  Alternative C offers a more sanguine view of the risks 
to the outlook, indicating more confidence that  labor market conditions will continue to 
improve over the medium term.  All three alternatives indicate that the Committee 
anticipates that inflation will move back to ward its 2 percent objective over the medium 
term; Alternatives A and B repeat the July  statement’s language about the risks to 
economic performance that could result from inflation running persistently below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, while Alternative C omits that language. 
With respect to balance sheet policy, bot h Alternatives A and B indicate that, 
although labor market conditions have streng thened since the current asset purchase 
program began a year ago, the Committee has d ecided to continue the existing pace of its 
purchases, pending further evidence of economic improvement.  Alternative B states that 
if the Committee sees evidence of further progr ess toward its objectives, reductions in the 
pace of purchases would be appropriate.  Alte rnative A is more tentative about the near-
term prospect of a reduction in the pace of  purchases, stating that progress toward 
Committee objectives is “not yet sufficient to warrant an adjustment.”  Alternative C, on 
the other hand, indicates that the improvement in the labor market justifies “modest downward adjustments” in the Committee’s as set purchases, to $35 billion per month for 
agency MBS and $40 billion per month for Treasury securities.  All of the alternatives indicate that, while asset purchases are “not on a preset course,” fu rther progress toward 
Committee goals will likely lead  to reductions in asset purc hases.  Optional language in 
Alternative B provides continuity with earlier Committee communications by stating that 
reductions will likely occur “later this year .”  Alternative C states that the Committee 
plans to reduce purchases further if the Committ ee sees further progress toward its goals.  
In addition, one version of paragraph 4 in Alternative C indicate s that the Committee 
expects that by the time its asset purchases  end, the unemployment rate will be around 
7 percent and expected to decline further, and inflation will be moving back toward its 
2 percent longer-run goal.   Both versions of  Alternative C note that, while the flow of 
purchases has been reduced, the Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of 
securities will maintain downward pre ssure on longer-term interest rates.   
All of the alternatives maintain the 0 to  ¼ percent target range for the federal 
funds rate and the 2½ percent “ceiling” thresh old for projected inflation.  Alternatives B 
and C retain the 6½ percent threshold for the unemployment rate, while Alternative A 
lowers this threshold to 6 percent.  A lternative A also adds a second condition for 
projected inflation—an inflation “floor”—wh ereby the Committee indicates that it does

Committee, in determining when and how much to reduce policy accommodation, will 
include the labor force participation rate and the growth of employment among the range 
of labor market indicators that it will consider .  Finally, Alternative A indicates that the 
Committee currently anticipates that the federal funds rate  target consistent with 
achieving maximum employment and 2 percent in flation will rise only gradually for a 
significant period after the Committee be gins reducing policy accommodation.

 JULY FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests 
that economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the first half of the year.  
Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on 
balance, but the unemployment rate rema ins elevated.  Household spending and 
business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has been strengthening, 
but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic 
growth.  Partly reflecting tr ansitory influences, inflati on has been running below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, but longe r-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the downside risks to the 
outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall.  
The Committee recognizes that inflation pe rsistently below its 2 percent objective 
could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to  help ensure that inflation, over time, 
is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to 
continue purchasing additional agency mort gage-backed securities at a pace of $40 
billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per 
month.  The Committee is maintaining its ex isting policy of reinvesting principal 
payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in 
agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage mark ets, and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securiti es, and employ its other policy tools as 
appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a 
context of price stability.  The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace 
of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.  In de termining the size, pace, and composition of 
its asset purchases, the Committee will contin ue to take appropriate account of the 
likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery st rengthens.  In particular, the Committee 
decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and

 currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range fo r the federal funds rate will 
be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate  remains above 6½ percent, 
inflation between one and two years ahead is  projected to be no more than a half 
percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 
inflation expectations conti nue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to 
maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also 
consider other information, including additi onal measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and infla tion expectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and in flation of 2 percent.

pace during the first half of the year.  Some indicators of  labor market conditions 
have shown [  further ] improvement in recent months, on balance, but the

housing sector has been strengthening, but  mortgage rates have risen somewhat 
further and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Partly reflecting transitory 
influences  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has 
been running below the Committee’s longer -run objective, but longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the 
unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges 
consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the downside risks to the 
outlook for the economy and the labor mark et as having diminished since the last fall, 
but the tightening of financial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, 
could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market .  The 
Committee recognizes that infl ation persistently below its 2 percent objective could 
pose risks to economic performance, but it an ticipates that inflation will move back 
toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. The Committee judges that the improvement in the outlook for the labor market 
and the extent of progress toward its economic objectives since it began its 
current asset purchase program are not yet sufficient to warrant an adjustment 
in the pace at which it is adding to its holdings of longer-term securities.   To 
support a stronger economic recovery and to help  ensure that inflation, over time, is at 
the rate most consistent with its dual mandate  Accordingly, the Committee decided 
to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40

 labor market or inflation changes.  In de termining the size, pace, and composition of 
its asset purchases, the Committee will contin ue to take appropriate account of the 
likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its 
economic objectives.  At such time as the Commit tee sees sufficient progress 
toward its objectives for the labor market  and inflation, some moderation in the 
pace of its securities purchases will become appropriate.  Asset purchases are 
not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will 
remain contingent on the Committee’s economic outlook as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy  and costs of such purchases.  
5.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase 
program ends and the economic recovery st rengthens.  In particular, the Committee 
decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range fo r the federal funds rate will 
be appropriate at least as long as th e unemployment rate remains above 6½ 6 percent, 
inflation between one and two years ahead is  projected to be no more than a half 
percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 
inflation expectations conti nue to be well anchored.  Moreover, the Committee 
anticipates that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if inflation 
between one and two years ahead were projected to be below 1¾ percent.   In 
determining how long to maintain a highl y accommodative stance of monetary policy 
when to begin reducing policy accommodation and the appropriate pace at 
which to reduce accommodation , the Committee will also consider other 
inform ation, including additional measures of labor market conditions such as the 
labor force participation rate  and growth of employment , indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expect ations, and readings on fina ncial developments.  When 
the Committee decides to begin to rem ove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  In particular, the Committee cu rrently anticipates that the 
level of the federal funds rate consistent  with achieving its employment and price 
stability objectives will increase only gra dually for a significant period after the 
Committee begins reducing policy accommodation.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
If members judge that progress toward  the Committee’s objectives has been 
insufficient, or that continued progress is in sufficiently certain, to warrant a reduction in 
the pace of purchases, they may conclude that  it is appropriate to announce that asset 
purchases will continue at the current pace.   If so, the Committee might decide to 
announce, as in Alternative B, that it will continue buying longer-term securities at the 
same pace as in recent months and will await more evidence that the economy will 
evolve about as anticipated before adjusting the pace of its purchases. 
In particular, policymakers might judge that labor market conditions have, on 
balance, improved further, continuing the gradual strengthening in the labor market 
observed since the Committee began its asset purchase program a year ago.  But they 
may view the gains in payroll employment in July and August as having been weaker 
than anticipated.  Moreover, members may see the recent signals on labor utilization as 
unclear, noting that while the unemployment ra te came down in August, so too did labor 
force participation.  Policymakers may remain  unsure about how quickly the restraint on 
economic growth stemming from the tighter fi scal policy put in place earlier this year 
will begin to wane, or about the extent to wh ich the recent increase in mortgage rates will 
hold back home sales and residential inve stment.  Moreover, they might also be 
concerned that higher oil prices could damp  growth in consumer spending and make it 
less likely that economic activity  will pick up over the remainder of the year.  They might 
also conclude that the most recent data in dicate that inflation is  still running below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, once fluctuat ions due to changes in energy prices are 
excluded.  They may continue to judge that in flation is unlikely to exceed 2 percent over 
the medium term, particularly in light of s till-considerable resource slack in the economy. 
Some members may point to the moderate growth in the economy in the second 
quarter, as well as to continuing gains in  private payrolls an d declines in the 
unemployment rate in July and August in the face of ongoing fiscal drag, as evidence that 
the recovery is gaining traction.  Furthermore, they might be inclined  to slow the pace of 
asset purchases to limit the lik elihood of excessive risk-taking in the financial sector.  
However, increases in medium- and longer-term interest rates since the middle of the year may have already reduced risk-taking by spurring market particip ants to pare back 
some of their leveraged investments in fixe d-income instruments.  Some members may 
judge that continuing the cu rrent pace of purchases much longer would risk an

 undesirably large increase in in flation over the medium run, or a rise in longer-term 
inflation expectations.  But,  with the unemployment rate still elevated and expected 
inflation well anchored, policymakers may not rega rd it as imperative to slow the pace of 
purchases at this meeting.  Policymakers may worry that even a modest downward 
adjustment to the flow of purchases might lead to an undesirable further tightening of 
financial conditions; they may regard an announcement later in the year as less likely to 
trigger such a reaction, especially  if they anticipate that ther e will be clearer evidence of 
an improvement in economic conditions by that time and that Committee communications will have laid additional ground work for a moderation of purchases.  As 
a result, policymakers may think that it woul d be prudent to wait for more information 
before deciding when and how much to slow  the pace of asset purchases.  They may 
therefore prefer a statement li ke Alternative B.  Policymakers may see Alternative B as 
appropriately indicating that a moderation in  the pace of purchases is the next move, 
based on the language added to paragraph 4 and the removal of the July statement language that referred to the Committee’s opt ions to “increase or reduce” the pace of 
purchases.  If, in addition, policymakers judge  that the economy is evolving broadly as 
anticipated, they may wish to include the optional language in Alterna tive B that refers to 
“later this year” as the likely time at which the moderation of the pace of purchases begins.  If, however, they have become less confident about the outlook, members may 
prefer not to use this phrase. 
Some members may judge that labor mark et conditions have been improving very 
slowly and that the rate of improvement is  unlikely to pick up appreciably unless the 
Committee adopts a still-more accommodative policy stance, potentially including a 
higher, rather than a lower, pace of asset purchases.  Members also may think that it 
could well become necessary to provide additi onal monetary policy stimulus in order to 
ensure that inflation moves up toward 2 pe rcent in coming years.  These policymakers 
may judge that the benefits of continuing pur chases at least at their existing pace for a 
while longer outweigh the costs.  However, in view of the inherent noisiness of monthly 
and quarterly data, these members may regard it as appropriate to continue to indicate 
that a reduction in the pace of  purchases is likely if the economy continues to improve 
and to reaffirm the previously-announced thresholds for the forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  Such policymakers might  also judge that the modifications that 
Alternative B makes to the July statement, notably the indication that purchases are not 
on a preset course, leave the Committee well- positioned to increase the amount of policy

 accommodation if labor market conditions begi n to weaken or if the economic outlook 
deteriorates. 
According to the Desk’s late st survey, primary dealers c ontinue to view the third 
quarter of 2015 as the most likely date for the first increase in the federal funds rate, and 
they all anticipate that when the first increase  occurs the unemployment rate will be at or 
below 6½ percent.  For the September meeting, in the event that the Committee chooses 
to reduce the pace of asset purchases, dealers view the most likely outcome as a decision to reduce the pace of purchases per month by a total of $10 billion, with equal reductions 
in the pace of purchases for agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities.  That said, 
dealers also assign sizable odds to a Committee decision that leaves the rate of purchases 
unchanged.  Thus, the balance sheet po licy component of an announcement like 
Alternative B, in which purch ases are continued at their existing pace, would likely 
surprise markets to some extent.  Longer-term interest rates would likely decline, at least 
in real terms; inflation compensation and e quity prices might rise, and the dollar might 
depreciate.  Volatility might increase as investors digested the Committee’s communications and updated th eir assessment of the Committ ee’s reaction function.  The 
nature and extent of market reaction might well depend on whether the statement 
includes the phrase “later this  year,” suggesting that the Committee is still on the modal 
state-contingent path outlined in prior co mmunications, and on the information provided 
in the Summary of Economic Projections and in the postmeeting press conference.  If 
these communications, taken together, convey th at the Committee continues to see itself 
on the path described in ear lier communications, the mark et reaction would likely be 
modest, while if the communications imply that the Committee is following a more-accommodative reaction function than previ ously thought or saw the economy as on a 
materially weaker course than previously  anticipated, the reaction could be more 
pronounced.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
If policymakers judge that there has b een sufficient improvement in the labor 
market outlook since the Committee began its current purchase program a year ago to 
begin moving promptly toward ending the pr ogram, they might choos e to start dialing 
back purchases now and to issue a postmeeting statement along the lines of Alternative 
C.  Policymakers might view economic news over the intermeeting period as broadly 
consistent with the modal outlook for the ec onomy that underlay the discussions of their 
Alternatives

 contingent plan for asset purchases in the June and July Committee meetings.  These 
participants may therefore judge  that the correct course is  to use the occasion of the 
September meeting to make a modest dow nward adjustment to the pace of the 
Committee’s asset purchases, and to signal th at additional measured reductions in the 
pace of asset purchases would likely become appropriate if the Committee sees continuing improvement in labor market cond itions and if inflation is moving back 
toward its longer-run objective. 
Policymakers may see the expansion of payroll employment observed in recent 
months as establishing that the economy and labor market have sufficient momentum to 
make further progress toward the Committee’s objectives.  The renewed decline in the 
unemployment rate in July and August, in addition to the conti nued gains in private 
payrolls, might be cited as reinforcing the picture of ongoing labor market improvement.  
Policymakers may acknowledge that the recent slowing in job gains and the continuing weakness of the labor force part icipation rate create some uncertainty about the extent of 
strengthening in the la bor market.  However, policymaker s may judge that the behavior 
of the unemployment rate still provides a gene rally reliable indicat ion of overall labor 
market conditions.  Thus, they might continue to regard the labor market data received in 
recent months as, on balance, further confirmation of the strengthening of the labor market.  Participants might also cite the m oderate expansion of th e economy, especially 
in the face of significant restraint from fi scal policy, and the resilience of the housing 
market as evidence of sustainable economic improvement; they may judge that despite 
the recent increase in mortgage rates, hous ing market demand will continue to be 
supported by still-favorable home affordability.  In addition, the most recent readings on 
consumer price inflation may have made some  participants less worried about downside 
risks to near-term inflation.   
Some other policymakers may want to reduce the pace of purchases at this 
meeting because they judge that the benef its of additional purchases no longer outweigh 
the costs.  These participants may be skeptical  that the asset purchase program is having a 
significant effect on overall macroeconomic outcomes, or they may judge that it is 
supporting residential cons truction at the expense of other types of investment spending.  
Furthermore, they may see the prospective co sts of continuing purch ases at the current 
pace as sizable.  In particular, they may be  concerned that further asset purchases could 
lead to excessive risk-taking in financial markets, undermine financial stability, and ultimately put the achievement of the dual mandate  at risk.  If these participants see the 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 potential costs associated with a still-larger  balance sheet as highly uncertain, they may 
be willing to slow the pace of purchases in measured steps while more information 
accrues about those costs and about the underlying economic situation. 
Taking the evidence together, policymakers ma y conclude that it is appropriate to 
undertake at least a modest redu ction in the pace of purchas es at this meeting, as in 
Alternative C.  At the same time, policym akers favoring Alternative C could point out 
that it conditions additional measured reductions on evidence  of further progress toward 
the Committee’s goals.  Thus, a decision lik e Alternative C, although it would start 
dialing back purchases, would not put the Committee’s purchases on a preset course, and 
the Committee would retain the option of adjusting the size and timing of future adjustments in the pace of purchases if the outl ook for the labor market  deteriorated or if 
inflation seemed likely to fall persistently below the Committee’s longer-run goal. 
Some policymakers might see the improve ment in the labor market outlook and 
an evaluation of the benefits and costs of a sset purchases as providing a case for a larger 
step-down in the pace of purchases than the total reduction of $10 billion per month built 
into Alternative C.  They might neverthele ss decide to keep the total reduction to $10 
billion in September, after taking account of  the recent signs of softness in private 
spending and the danger of a sizable market reaction to an immediate major reduction in 
the pace of purchases. 
If policymakers wish to communicate mo re explicitly the link between the 
purchase program and economic developments, they may choose to use language like that in paragraph C.4 ′, which indicates that the Committee expects the economy to evolve 
in a way that implies additional measured reductions in purchase pace are likely in 
coming quarters, and lays out a version of the Committee’s state-contingent plan, in which purchases end as the unemployment rate moves down toward 7 percent and 
inflation moves back toward its longer-run goal .  However, other participants may prefer 
statement language, such as that in paragra ph C.4, that does not refer to the 7 percent 
value for the unemployment rate, perhaps because they are concerned about putting too

 much weight on the unemployment rate as  the single indicator of labor market 
conditions.1 
In general, gauging the market reaction to Alternative C is complicated by the 
wide range of views among market  participants about the likel y action at this meeting as 
well as by the potential for the first reduction in  purchases to have an  important signaling 
effect.  A decision to adopt a statement like Alternative C would surprise some, but not 
most, market participants.  As noted earlier , the Desk’s survey of the primary dealers 
indicates that a reduction of $5 billion for the pace of purchases of both agency MBS and 
Treasury securities is the medi an dealer expectation, although  dealers also assign sizable 
odds to a decision to maintain purchases at  their existing pace.  Thus, an announcement 
of a reduction in the pace of purchases like that in Altern ative C might not produce much 
market reaction.  If language like paragraph C.4 ′ were used in the announcement, 
however, investors might view the Committee as having a less-accommodative reaction 
function than market participants had previously thought, as the Committee has 
previously declined to put an explicit state- contingent plan for asset purchases into the 
postmeeting statement.  In response to this changed perception of Committee behavior, longer-term interest rates and inflation compensation might rise, equity prices might fall, 
and the dollar might appreciate.  Volatility might increase as investors digested the 
Committee’s communications and proceeded  to update their assessment of the 
Committee’s reaction function. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers may view the recent data as notably weaker than the Committee 
expected when it discussed its contingent pl an for asset purchases during its June and 
July meetings.  As a result, they may wish to continue purchases at their present pace and 
issue a statement that does not suggest that a reduction in the pace of purchases is likely 
in the near future, as in Alternative A.  These policymakers, while acknowledging that 
real GDP growth for the second quarter was revised up during the intermeeting period, might see the second quarter’s strength as te mporary.  In this connection, they might 
point to the fact that the sta ff’s projection for real GDP grow th over the next four quarters 
                                                 
1 The memo by B. Durdu, E. Engen, and J. Roberts, “Economic Conditions and the Federal 
Reserve’s Balance Sheet Under a Simple Rule to Guide Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” sent to the 
Committee on September 6, 2013, provides simulation analysis of the relationship between a simple policy 
rule for asset purchases and the behavior of the unemployment rate.

 now shows a slower pickup than in the Ju ly Tealbook.  Additionally, these policymakers 
may be skeptical that the declines in the une mployment rate registered in July and August 
will continue, inasmuch as they were accompanied by only modest gains in private 
payrolls and occurred against the background of a still-low and declining labor force 
participation rate and still- high levels of long-duration unemployment and of individuals 
working part time for economic reasons.  A ll told, some policymakers may judge that 
there has been only modest fundamental improvement in overall labor market conditions in the past year. 
In addition, some participants may conclude that financial market conditions have 
tightened substantially in recent months, with  mortgage rates having increased further, 
equity prices having moved down, and the fore ign exchange value of the dollar having 
appreciated in the intermeeting period.  Thes e participants may worry that the financial 
tightening could be sustained or become more severe, resulting in serious negative 
repercussions for the outlook, perhaps along the lines of the “Higher Interest Rates with 
Housing Spillovers” alternative simulati on in Tealbook Book A.  They may see a 
statement like Alternative A as more likely th an Alternative B to provide the amount of 
downward pressure on longer-term interest ra tes needed to contain the tightening in 
financial conditions, perhaps because they see Alternative B’s language as leaning toward 
an imminent reduction in the pace of purchases. 
Some participants may judge that a reduc tion in the unemployment threshold to 6 
percent, as in Alternative A, could help to  reverse some of the recent run-up in longer-
term interest rates and put the economic rec overy on a firmer footing.  Policymakers may 
also see a statement like Alternative A as useful because of the language providing a 
floor to the inflation threshold in the fo rward guidance for the federal funds rate.  
Participants may view such language as helping to unders core the message that the 
Committee is willing to defend its longer-term inflation goal from below as well as from 
above.  Moreover, they may regard the la nguage in paragraph 5 of Alternative A, 
indicating that the labor force participation ra te and growth of employment will enter the 
Committee’s decisions about “when to be gin reducing policy accommodation and the 
appropriate pace at which to reduce accommoda tion,” as helpful in providing concrete 
examples of indicators other than the unemployment rate that  the Committee considers in 
judging the evolution of  the labor market. 
Alternatives

 Moreover, some participants may conclude that a balanced approach to achieving 
both the Committee’s goals requires providing an amount of accommodation sufficient to 
bring projected inflation tem porarily above 2 percent.  A lternatively, policymakers may 
expect the equilibrium real rate of interest to be on a persistently low trajectory for 
several years ahead, reflecting continuing headwinds from the financial crisis; 
accordingly, they may conclude that, when  accommodation begins to be withdrawn, the 
setting of the nominal federal funds rate ta rget should take into account the subdued level 
of the equilibrium real federal funds rate.  In either case, policym akers might anticipate 
that the federal funds rate targ et consistent with achieving th e dual mandate will rise only 
gradually for a significant period after th e reduction of policy accommodation begins.  
Members may view statement language to this  effect, as in the fifth paragraph of 
Alternative A, as valuable in providing further clarity about th e Committee’s reaction 
function and, by lowering invest ors’ expectations of the po licy rate path, adding to the 
amount of policy accommodation currently being provided by the Committee.   
Some participants may judge not only that  the modal outlook is unsatisfactory but 
also that downside risks to that outlook re main sizable.  Such risks might go beyond those 
posed by recent financial market developmen ts; in particular, another Congressional 
impasse on the federal debt limit or the budget could elevate policy uncertainty and 
further restrain household spending and business investment later this year.  Heightened 
geopolitical concerns might also be seen as a factor that could lead to higher oil prices 
and lower consumer confidence.  At the sa me time, with underlying inflation continuing 
to run below 2 percent, some policymakers may see little risk that inflation or inflation 
expectations will move up; indeed, they might remain concerned about downside risks to inflation, especially in light of  still-substantial resource slack  and contained wage gains.  
If so, they may see the configuration of risk s as pointing to the need for greater policy 
stimulus now. 
An announcement along the lines of that in  Alternative A would surprise market 
participants; it could be perceived as a deferra l of the Committee’s intention to dial back 
asset purchases and could be viewed as at odds  with the widely held expectation that the 
start of tapering will be announced either at th e September meeting or sometime later this 
year.  Moreover, the changes to  the forward guidance would be  a significant surprise to 
markets, especially when announced alongs ide an unchanged purchase program.  In 
response to an announcement like that in Altern ative A, longer-term interest rates would 
likely decline, inflation compensation and equ ity prices might rise, and the dollar might

 depreciate.  If, however, inve stors took a statement like Alternative A as indicating that 
the FOMC has become more pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth and 
employment than market participants had an ticipated, or if they took the introduction of 
the inflation floor as signifying a heightened Committee concern that inflation might fall, 
equity prices might not rise or could even decline.  Volatility might well increase as 
investors revised their assessment of the Committee’s reaction function.

 DIRECTIVE   
The directive that was issued after the July meeting appears on the next page, 
followed by drafts for a September directive that correspond to each of the three policy 
alternatives.  The directives for Alternativ es A and B are unchanged; the directive for 
Alternative C includes changes to make it c onsistent with the corresponding postmeeting 
statement. 
The directives for Alternatives A and B instruct the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency mortgage-backed securities  at a pace of about $40 billion per month 
and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion 
per month.  The draft directiv e for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of a bout $35 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month, beginning in 
October.  All three of the draft directives dire ct the Desk to maintain the current policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-back ed securities and of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities at auction.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.  A ll three alternatives include additional asset 
purchases, though the pace and cumulative amount of purchases differ across the 
alternatives.1  Alternative B continues purchases at the current monthly pace in the near 
term but then moderates the pace later this year; the pace of purchases would be reduced 
further through the first half of 2014, and purchases would end by mid-year.2  Alternative 
C has a modest reduction in the pace of purchases immedi ately and additional measured 
reductions at later meetings, with purc hases ending in March 2014.  Alternative A 
maintains the current pace of purchases thr ough the end of this year; thereafter, it 
gradually reduces the pace of purchases, and brings the program to a close in December 
2014.   
Projections under each scenario are based on assumptions about the trajectory of 
various components of the balance sheet a nd the balance sheet normalization strategy.3  
The projections for all alternatives assume that the SOMA portfolio shrinks only through 
redemptions of Treasury securities and paydowns  of principal from MBS; consistent with 
the strategy outlined in the press conference statement following the June FOMC 
meeting, no sales of agency MBS are incorporated in the balance sheet projections. 
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and 
of longer-term Treasury securiti es by $45 billion per month into the fall, and then to 
                                                 
1 The Committee is assumed to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and 
reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS and agency debt securities into agency MBS until six 
months before the first increase in  the federal funds rate.  The assumption that maturing Treasury securities 
are rolled over at auction is not particularly important because, as a result of the maturity extension 
program, the SOMA portfolio currently holds less than $5 billion of Treasury securities that mature before 
January 2016. 
2 Slight deviations in the start date and the pace of reductions do not materially affect the balance 
sheet projections.   
3 Details of these assumptions, as well as proj ections for each major component of the balance 
sheet, can be found in the Appendix that follows this section.

 reduce the pace of these purchases gradually through June 2014.4  The staff projects that 
the unemployment rate will stand at about 7 percent when purchases stop.  Under these 
assumptions, purchases total about $1.2 trilli on over 2013 and the first half of 2014, as in 
the July Tealbook Alternative B.5 
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” SOMA 
securities holdings under the purchase program assumed for A lternative B peak at about 
$4 trillion in the fall of 2014, with $2.3 trillion in Treasury securities holdings and $1.7 
trillion in agency securities holdings.  As in the staff forecast in Tealbook Book A, we 
assume that the first increase in the target fe deral funds rate is in the second quarter of 
2015.6  Two quarters before the first increase  in the target federal funds rate, all 
reinvestments and rollovers are assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.
7  The size of the portfolio is normali zed by mid-2021, as in the projection for 
Alternative B in the July Tealbook.  The balance sheet th en begins to expand, with 
increases in SOMA holdings e ssentially matching the growth  of currency in circulation 
and Federal Reserve Bank capital.8  Total assets are $2.5 trill ion at the end of 2025, with 
a little more than $600 billion in MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio. 
                                                 
4 The staff assumes that the main effect of asset purchases on financial conditions is related to the 
expected size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio over time.  As a result, the 
macroeconomic effects of a change in the pace of pu rchases will depend importantly on how the change 
influences investors’ expectations of the evolution of the overall size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.  For reference, see the memo titled “Changing the Pace of Asset Purchases” (by S. Carpenter, W. English, S. Meyer, W. Nelson, D. Re ifschneider, and R. Tetlow of the Federal Reserve 
Board, and J. Egelhof, S. Friedman, L. Logan, and S. Potter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the Committee on April 22, 2013. 
5 The balance sheet scenario assumed for Alternative B is consistent with the state-contingent plan 
for securities purchases laid out by the Chairman  in recent communications and discussed by the 
Committee at its June meeting, as well as with the cu rrent staff forecast presented in Tealbook Book A. 
6 This liftoff date for the federal funds rate is one  quarter earlier than that assumed in the balance 
sheet projections for Alternative B in the July Tealbook.  At the time of liftoff, the unemployment rate is projected to have fallen below the Committee’s 6.5 percent threshold, and inflation is expected to be moving towards the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
7 Temporary reserve draining tools (reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
8 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve 
capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of 
the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be

 The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications for Federal 
Reserve income across the alternatives.  Unde r Alternative B, interest income rises until 
reinvestments cease and then declines as the SOMA portfolio begins to contract through 
redemptions and paydowns of principal.  As the federal funds rate  rises after liftoff, 
interest expense on reserve balances climbs.  As a result, Federal Reserve remittances to 
the Treasury decline, although they are pr ojected to remain positive over the entire 
projection period.  Annual remittances peak  at about $100 billion in 2014 and trough at 
$30 billion later in the decade, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1 trillion, well above the level that would have been 
observed without the asset purchase programs.  The effect of the recent rise in interest 
rates on cumulative remittances depends on the entire projected path of the federal funds 
rate and longer term rates.  Given the modest  changes to these assumed interest rate paths 
in the medium- and longer-term staff projec tion, projected cumulative remittances are 
only marginally affected. 
As interest rates have risen over the pa st several months, the unrealized gain 
position of the portfolio has declined.  The portfolio moved from a position of having an 
unrealized gain of $185 billion at the end of th e first quarter of this  year to a $35 billion 
gain position at the end of th e second quarter, and to an estimated $50 billion unrealized 
loss position at the end of August 2013.
9  For Alternative B, the portfolio is projected to 
report an unrealized loss  of about $130 billion at the end of  this year, a $7 0 billion larger 
loss than projected in the July Tealbook.  
In the scenario that we assume for Alternative C, the Committee announces an 
immediate reduction of monthly purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities and of 
agency MBS by $5 billion each.  The Committee is assumed to reduce the pace of these purchases to zero by March 2014, at which time th e unemployment rate is projected to be 
approaching 7 percent and inflation is head ed toward its 2 percent longer-run goal.  
Purchases total about $1 trillion in 2013 and 2014.  In this scenario, the federal funds rate 
                                                                                                                                                 
necessary to conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  
A higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, lead  to an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet. 
9 The Federal Reserve reports the change in the quarter-end unrealized gain/loss position of the 
SOMA portfolio to the public with a lag in the “F ederal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .  The August unrealized 
position is an estimate based on Board staff projections.

 is assumed to lift off in mid-2015, as in Altern ative B.  Reinvestment of principal from 
maturing or prepaying securities ends and re demptions begin at the end of 2014, causing 
the portfolio to begin to cont ract.  SOMA securities holdings  in this scenario peak at 
about $3.9 trillion in September 2014, and the size of the balance sheet is normalized by 
mid-2021 as in Alternative B.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive throughout the projection period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 to 2025 are slightly less than under Alternative B. 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS through 
the end of the year, to then  reduce purchases gradually, a nd to end purchases by the end 
of 2014.  Under these assumptions, purchase s total about $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 
2014.  This more accommodative policy stance than  in Alternative B would be consistent 
with a projection of the macroeconomy that is a bit weaker than in the staff forecast or a 
desire on the part of the Co mmittee to provide more accommodation.  In this scenario, 
SOMA securities holdings increase to a peak of about $4.3 trillion in March 2015.  The 
first increase in the target federal funds rate occurs in the fourth quarter of 2015—two 
quarters later than in Alternative B—when  the unemployment threshold and inflation 
floor included in Alternativ e A are projected to be cro ssed.  All reinvestments are 
projected to cease in the second quarter of  2015, so the SOMA portfolio begins to 
contract.  The size of the por tfolio is normalized at the end of 2021, about two quarters 
later than in the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, reflecting the larger asset 
purchase program and the later start to balance sheet normalization. 
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of the SOMA portfolio and re serve balances in the near term.  Net interest income 
increases initially and then remains elevated until reinvest ments are assumed to end, and 
annual Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury peak at $107 billion in 2015.  As the federal funds rate rises after liftoff, the inte rest expense on reserve balances increases, 
reducing Federal Reserve net income.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive over the entire projection peri od, and no deferred asset is 
recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are slightly higher than that 
projected under Alternative B. 
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
Projections

 magnitude of assumed asset purchases.10  Reserve balances peak  at about $3 trillion, $2.8 
trillion, and $2.7 trillion under Alte rnatives A, B, and C, respectively.  When the federal 
funds rate lifts off from its lower bound, rese rve balances are $3 tr illion, $2.7 trillion, and 
$2.6 trillion under Alternatives A,  B, and C, respectively. 
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternativ e Projections for the Monetary Base,” in 
the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base incr eases through the end 
of 2014 because of the purchase program and the accompanying increase in reserve 
balances.  Once exit begins, the monetary base shrinks, on net, through mid-2021, 
primarily because of redempti ons of securities and the co rresponding reduction in reserve 
balances.  Starting around mid-2021, after re serve balances are assumed to have 
stabilized at $25 billion, the monetary base be gins to expand in line with the growth of 
currency in circulation.  Under Alternative C, the monetary base increases through the 
end of 2014 because of the purchase program a nd then contracts, on net, until the size of 
the portfolio is normalized.  Projected increases in the monetary base are less than the increases under Alternative B, due to a sma ller program size and an earlier end date for 
the purchases.  Under Alterna tive A, the monetary base increases through early 2015, as 
the level of reserve balances climbs in concert with the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The monetary base then contracts during the exit period until 
the size of the portfolio is normalized.  
 
  
                                                 
10 The level of reserve balances is also contingent on the evolution of other balance sheet items.

M2 is estimated to have expanded bris kly over the third quarter, as investors 
apparently tilted their portfolios toward safe and liquid assets in M2 amid the sell-off in 
fixed income markets. We anticipate that M2  will grow more in line with nominal GDP 
for the remainder of 2013.  Beginning in 2014, M2 is projected to grow more slowly than 
nominal GDP in part because investors are assumed to reallocate a portion of their 
elevated M2 balances to riskier investments as financial and economic conditions improve; this shift in portfolio composition is  expected to persist through the remainder 
of the forecast horizon.
 11  M2 growth is further depressed in 2015 and 2016 as the 
opportunity cost of holding M2 assets is in creased by the assumed rise in short-term 
market rates.

 Appendix 
This appendix presents the assumptions underl ying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet, Income, and Moneta ry Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from September 
2013 to December 2025.  The few balance sheet ite ms that are not discussed below are assumed 
to be constant over the projection period at the level observed on August 30, 2013.  The 
projections for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the 
tables that follow the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in the second quarter of 2015.  This date of liftoff is 
consistent with the current staff economic forecast and the thresholds describ ed in the July 2013 
FOMC statement, and it is one quarter earlier than assumed in the balance sheet projections for 
Alternative B in the July Tealbook.  The projec tions for the scenario corresponding to Alternative 
C assume the same liftoff date as in Alternative B.  In the projections for the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the first increase in  the target federal funds rate occurs in the 
fourth quarter of 2015, in line with the 6 per cent threshold for the unemployment rate and the 
inflation rate floor of 1¾ percent.  In each case, the balance sheet projections assume no use of 
short-term draining tools to achieve the project ed path for the target federal funds rate.
1 
ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by 
$40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by $45 billion per month into the fall of 2013.  Then, purch ases are assumed to continue—though at a 
decreasing pace—and conclude by mid-2014 .  The Treasury securities purchased are 
assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The Treasury and MBS 
                                                 
1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreemen ts were used to drain re serves, the composition of 
liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements would be matched 
by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, these draining tools would be wound down as 
the balance sheet returns to its steady-state growth path , so that the projected paths for securities presented 
here would remain valid.

 purchases in 2013 and the first half of 2 014 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings 
by about $1.2 trillion.  
o The FOMC continues to reinvest the pro ceeds from principal payments on its agency 
securities holdings in agency MBS into the fourth quarter of 2014.  
o Starting late in the fourth quarter of 201 4—two quarters prior to the assumed increase 
in the target federal funds rate—all secur ities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as 
they mature or prepay.  The portfolio declines only through redemptions and 
paydowns of SOMA assets. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is  based on staff models using estimates of 
housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest ra te projections generated from the staff’s 
FRB/US model.
2  The projected rate of prepayment is sensitive to these underlying 
assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative C, the Committee is assumed to decrease the 
monthly pace of purchases to $40 billion of  longer-term Treasury securities and 
$35 billion of agency MBS beginning in October 2013.  The pace of purchases is reduced further later this year, and purchases end in the first quarter of 2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an av erage duration of about nine years.  The 
Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term 
securities by about $1 trillion in 2013 and 2014.   The FOMC continues to reinvest the 
proceeds from principal payments on its agency securities holdings in agency MBS until the end of 2014, six months prior to the assume d increase in the target federal funds rate.  
Thereafter, all securities are allowed to roll o ff the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  
The portfolio declines only through redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets.  
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A,  the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Trea sury securities and agency MBS until the 
end of 2013.  Thereafter, the pace of purchases is reduced in several steps, and purchases end in December 2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term s ecurities by about $1.5 trillion in 2013 and 
2014.  In addi tion, the Committee is assu med to maintain its existing policy of 
reinvesting pr incipal payments from its holdi ngs of agency debt and agency MBS in 
agency  MBS.  Starting in mid-2015—two quarters prior to the assumed increase in the 
target federal funds rate— principal paymen ts from all securities are allowed to roll off 
the portfoli o.  The portfolio declines only through redemptions a nd paydowns of SOMA 
asset s. 
 If interest rates are below (above) the coupon rate on outstanding Treasury securities, the 
market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases securities will be greater (less) than 
                                                 
2 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of September 9, 2013.

 their face value and the Federal Reserve records a premium (discount).  In all 
alternatives, net premiums are roughly unchanged over the length of the purchase programs.  
 The market value at which the Federa l Reserve purchases new agency MBS will 
generally exceed their face value.  As a result, MBS premiums under Alternatives A, B, and C, will rise by roughly $25 billion, $14 billion, and $12 billion, respectively. 
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is  assumed to decline gradually, reaching zero 
by the end of 2014.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reser ve buys coupon securities in addition to bills 
to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds coupon securities. 
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is assumed 
to stay constant at $23 billion.  
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to zero 
by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 
 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $200 million currently to zero in 2015.  
Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees collected by the LLC.
3  Consistent with events to date, th e projections assume the LLC does not purchase 
any asset-backed securities.  (It would have to make such purchases if an asset-backed 
security were received by the Federal Reserve  Bank of New York in connection with a 
decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC declin e from about $1.5 billion to zero in 2016. 
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to grow at an average annual rate of 
6 percent through 2015, in line with the staff forecast.  Afterwards, Federal Reserve notes 
in circulation grow at the same rate as nom inal GDP in the extended Tealbook projection. 
                                                 
3 On January 15, 2013, the Board of Governors approved the elimination of the U.S. Treasury’s 
funding commitment and the repayment of the initial funding amount plus accrued interest.  Additionally, 
the Board of Governors approved the disbursement of contingent interest payments from TALF LLC to 
Treasury and FRBNY that are approximately equal to the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the 
amount of outstanding TALF loans less funds reserved for future expenses of TALF LLC.  The first payment occurred in February, and additional payments occur on a monthly basis.

  The level of reverse repurchase agreements ( RRPs) is assumed to be around $100 billion, 
about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and international 
accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Gene ral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns until 
the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  At that point, the TGA drops back to its historical target level of $5 billion because it is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Federal Reserve capital grows 12.5 percent per y ear, in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
4 
 In general, increases in the level of Federa l Reserve assets are matched by higher levels 
of reserve balances.  All else equal, increase s in the levels of liability items, such as 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of 
Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital 
items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below $25 billion, purchases of 
Treasury securities are assumed in order to ma intain that level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equa te surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred 
asset would be recorded.  This deferred asset  is reported on the liability side of the 
balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability 
takes on a positive value when weekly cumulativ e earnings have not yet been distributed 
to the Treasury and takes on a negative valu e when earnings fall short of the expenses 
listed above.  In this Tealbook, none of th e alternatives result in a deferred asset.   
                                                 
4 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet, the size of the SOMA portfolio after normalization, and the level of annual remittances to the 
Treasury.

 TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS5,6 
 Under Alternative B, the contemporaneous term premium effect on the yield of the ten-
year Treasury note is about negative 121 basis points, slightly less negative than for 
Alternative B in the July Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the projection period, the term premium effect declines slowly toward zer o, reflecting the actual and anticipated 
normalization of the portfolio.  
 Under Alternative C, the term premium effect  is about negative 116 basis points.  The 
effect is less negative than in Alternativ e B because there are fe wer securities purchased 
than under Alternative B. 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium effect  is about negative 134 basis points in the 
current quarter.  The effect wanes over time as securities roll off the portfolio.  
 
                                                 
5 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in Li, Canlin and Min Wei (2013), “Term Structure 
Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs,” International Journal of Central Banking , vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 3-39 (also in FEDS working paper series, 
2012-37). 
6 The staff projection of the term premium effect depends on assumptions about the size of the 
asset purchase program and the balance sheet normalizat ion strategy.  If market participants anticipate a 
different sized program or a different exit strategy, the staff estimates of the term premium effect may not be the same as those priced in market rates.
