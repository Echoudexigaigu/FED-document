 Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the fede ral funds rate from six policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor  (1999) rule, the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the outcome-
based rule, the first-difference rule, and th e nominal income targeting rule.  These 
prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline projections for real activity and inflation in 
2013 and 2014.  (Medium-term prescriptions de rived from dynamic simulations of the 
rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the le ft-hand columns, four of the six rules keep 
the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound in the near term.  The Taylor (1993) 
rule, which puts relatively litt le weight on the output gap, prescribes a federal funds rate 
near 1 percent this quarter and 1¼ percent ne xt quarter.  The first- difference rule, which 
responds to the expected change in the output  gap, prescribes a federal funds rate of 
¼ percent this quarter and ½ per cent in the first quarter of 2014. 
The right-hand columns display the near-ter m prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.1   For this quarter and next, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule and the outcome-based rule prescribe federal funds rates near zero.  In 
contrast, the Taylor (1999) rule, which does not include a lagged value of the federal 
funds rate and thus responds more strongly to current inflation and th e staff’s estimate of 
the current output gap, prescribes moderately negative values for the federal funds rate.  
The nominal income targeting rule responds to  the current estimate of the output gap and 
the cumulative shortfall of inflation from the assumed 2 percent target since 2008.  As a 
result, this rule also calls for negative values  of the federal funds rate in the current and 
subsequent quarters. 
With the exception of the first-difference rule, all unconstrained rules call for 
slightly more accommodative monetary policy in the near term than they did in the 
September Tealbook because the staff revised dow n its estimate of GDP growth in 2013.  
As shown in the lower-left panel, this revision puts the staff’s curre nt-quarter estimate of 
                                                 
1 Four of these rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nominal income 
targeting rule, and the first-difference rule—place subs tantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed thus far this quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table are indirectly affected by 
the presence of the effective lower bound.  The appendix provides further details.

the output gap ¼ percentage point below the le vel projected last r ound.  Nonetheless, the 
effects of more favorable financial conditions  in 2014 and 2015 are forecast to offset the 
weaker economic growth anticipat ed for this year, and the output  gap is still projected to 
close by mid-2017.  Subsequently, output is expe cted to rise a bit further above potential 
than in the September Tealbook because the staff revised up sli ghtly its outlook for 
aggregate demand in the longer term.  As depi cted in the lower-right panel, the staff’s 
core inflation forecast is almost unchanged and thus plays an insignificant role in 
explaining revisions to th e rules’ prescriptions. 
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
short-run r* , which is generated using the FRB/US model after adjusting it to replicate 
the staff’s economic forecast.  The short-run  r* estimate of the equilibrium real federal 
funds rate corresponds to the rate that would, if  maintained, return output to potential in 
12 quarters.  The r* estimate for the current quarter, at 1.4 percent, is essentially 
unchanged from the September Tealbook.  As ha s been true since late 2008, the current 
estimate of the real federal funds rate, wh ich is also unchanged from the previous 
Tealbook at 1.1 percent, is above the estimate of r*. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model that incorporate endogenous responses of 
inflation and the output gap implied by having the federal funds rate follow the paths 
prescribed by the different policy rules, under the assumptions that the federal funds rate 
is constrained by the effective lower bound and that the Committee’s thresholds related to 
inflation and the unemployment rate are ignored.2  (Alternative policy rule simulations 
that incorporate thresholds ar e discussed below.)  Each rule  is applied from the fourth 
quarter of 2013 onward, under the assumptions that  financial market participants as well 
as price- and wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follow that rule and that agents 
fully understand and anticipate the implications  of the rule for future real activity, 
inflation, and interest rates. 
The exhibit also displays the implica tions of following the Tealbook baseline 
policy.  This policy keeps the federal funds ra te at an effective lower bound of 12.5 basis 
                                                 
2 The policy-rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  Fo r the current program, th e baseline forecast assumes 
that purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS will end in mid-2014 and total almost 
$1.3 trillion.

points as long as the unemployment rate is a bove 6.5 percent and averag e inflation five to 
eight quarters hence is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  After either of these 
variables crosses its threshold va lue, the federal funds rate fo llows the prescriptions of the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  The path of the federal funds rate under the current Tealbook 
baseline is similar to that in the Septem ber Tealbook.  A decline in the unemployment 
rate triggers a departure from the effec tive lower bound in the second quarter of 2015.  
The federal funds rate then rises about ¼ perc entage point per quarter over the next three 
years, reaching 2 percent in late 2016 and 3 percent in early 2018, before firming to 4 percent by 2020.  Under this  baseline policy, the unemplo yment rate continues to 
decline for a number of years after crossing its threshold, reaching th e staff’s estimate of 
the long-term natural rate of unemploymen t of 5.2 percent in mid-2017, while headline 
inflation slowly converges to the Committee’s long-run goal of 2 percent.
3 
Without thresholds, most of the policy ru les call for tightening to begin earlier 
than under the Tealbook baseline.  Four of the rules put the real  federal funds rate 
persistently above the path implied by the base line forecast, policy settings that result in 
higher unemployment and lower inflation than the baseline through most of the decade.  
Despite beginning to tighten earlier than under the baseline, the in ertial Taylor (1999) 
rule generates almost identical outcomes for the unemployment rate and inflation because 
real longer-term rates under th is rule are very similar to  those under the baseline policy.4 
Only the nominal income targeting rule prescribes a later tightening than under 
the Tealbook baseline.  This rule keeps the federal funds rate at the lower bound through 
the second quarter of 2016 and ge nerates a real federal funds  rate persistently below 
baseline for the rest of the decade, there by inducing stronger future real activity and 
higher future inflation.  Markets are a ssumed to anticipate these developments 
completely.  Accordingly, longer-term real interest rates are lower today than under the 
baseline policy.  These more-accommodative conditions result in a markedly lower 
                                                 
3 In the Tealbook baseline, the staff assumes that a number of slowly dissipating headwinds will 
continue to weigh on economic activity in 2016 and beyond, so that the federal funds rate only reaches its 
longer-run value of 4 percent several years after the closing of the output gap.  The box in Tealbook, Book A, “Headwinds and the Federal Funds Rate in 2016,”  provides details.  The same headwinds are assumed 
to be in force for all the dynamic simulations of policy rules in the FRB/US model. 
4 The Taylor (1999) rule, which does not seek to smooth the path for the nominal interest rate, also 
prescribes the first increase in the federal funds rate two quarters earlier than the baseline path.  But without 
inertia, the Taylor (1999) rule pres cribes a markedly more rapid rise in the nominal federal funds rate 
thereafter, causing the real federal funds rate to be persistently higher than under the baseline policy.

trajectory for the unemployment rate.  In additi on, greater resource util ization in the short 
run and higher expected fu ture inflation both boost inflation in the near term.  
The results presented in these and subs equent simulations depend importantly on 
the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to  the simulated rule in the future and that 
private sector expectations fully incorporat e the paths for the federal funds rate, real 
activity, and inflation implied by the rule.  Thes e assumptions play a pa rticularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targ eting rule, which is associated with outcomes 
in which inflation runs above the 2 percent long-run goal for some y ears, even after the 
output gap is closed. 
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Thresholds,” displays dynamic 
simulations in which the policy rules are s ubject to the thresholds that the Committee 
adopted in December 2012.  For each of the ru les, the thresholds are imposed by keeping 
the federal funds rate at an  effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the 
unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent and aver age inflation five to eight quarters hence 
is projected to be less than 2.5 percent.  Fi nancial market particip ants and price- and 
wage-setters are assumed to understand that the Committee will switch  to the specified 
rule when one of the threshold conditions is satisfied and to view this switch as 
permanent and fully credible.  In each of th e simulations discussed below, crossing the 
unemployment threshold is the catalyst for switching to the specified rule. 
As in the September Tealbook, the impos ition of the thresholds leads to a 
departure of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound in the second quarter of 
2015 for all of the rules except the nominal in come targeting rule.  This timing is the 
same as under the Tealbook baseline and is two to six quarters later than the first federal 
funds rate hike prescribed by the same rules without thresholds.  Because the nominal income targeting rule does not prescribe rais ing the federal funds rate above its effective 
lower bound until after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, imposing the thresholds on the nominal income targeting ru le does not alter the date for this rule’s 
prescribed departure from the lowe r bound, and outcomes for inflation and 
unemployment are not affected. 
The incorporation of thresholds has the largest effects on the departure date under 
the Taylor (1993) and the first-difference rule s.  In particular, without thresholds, the 
Taylor (1993) and the first-difference rules pr escribe a funds rate th at departs from the 
effective lower bound this quarter and next, respectively.  Imposing the thresholds on

these rules postpones the first federal funds rate hike by more than a year.  As a result, the 
unemployment rate declines more rapidly, a nd inflation is a touch higher, when the 
thresholds are imposed on the rules.  In  contrast, the threshold strategy postpones 
departure from the lower bound by only three quar ters or less under the Taylor (1999), 
the inertial Taylor (1999), and the outcome-based rules.  Such a delay generates relatively 
little difference in macroeconomic outcomes compared with those generated by these 
rules without thresholds.5 
The fourth exhibit, “Constr ained versus Unconstraine d Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those reported in the September Tealbook.6  Policymakers are assumed to place 
equal weights on keeping headline PCE inflatio n close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, 
on keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in th e federal funds rate.  The optimal control 
concept presented here corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers 
make choices today that effectively cons train policy choices in future periods.7 
The simulations indicate that the federa l funds rate implied by the constrained 
optimal control policy departs from the eff ective lower bound in the first quarter of 2016, 
the same quarter as in the September Tealbook.  Thereafter, the optimal control path for 
the federal funds rate rises gradually above that in the September Tealbook, reflecting the 
upward revision to the staff’s view of aggregate demand later in the decade. 
By generating a lower path for the real federal funds rate than in the staff’s 
baseline outlook, the constrained optimal c ontrol policy promotes a stronger economic 
recovery.8  In particular, the unemployment ra te drops below 6.5 percent by the first 
                                                 
5 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with thresh olds corresponds to the Tealbook baseline. 
6 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance-sheet policies 
described in footnote 2.  The simulated policies do not incorporate thresholds. 
7 The Monetary Policy Strategies section of the September 2013 Tealbook, Book B, provides 
optimal control simulations in which policymakers cannot credibly commit to carrying out a plan involving policy choices that would be suboptimal at the time these choices have to be implemented. 
8 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper-right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to compute the real rate for this illustrative purpose because 
it provides a less volatile measure of inflation expecta tions than does a four-quarter moving average of 
headline inflation.

quarter of 2015 and reaches 5.2 percent—the st aff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment—in the second half of 2016; the unemployment rate continues to decline 
thereafter, reaching 4.8 percent by late 2017 befo re returning to a little below the natural 
rate by the end of 2020.  In tu rn, the path of inflation is  roughly 0.1 percentage point 
higher than under the baseline, edging up a bove the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 
2019 before gradually moving back toward 2 percent after 2020.  The more-rapid 
improvement in the unemployment rate and in flation occurs because the optimal control 
policy credibly promises to remain highly ac commodative for even longer than under the 
baseline policy.  In current circumstances, th is promise generates—through the response 
of the private sector’s expectations for futu re monetary policy and the repercussions for 
the economy—more favorable effects on financia l conditions, real activity, and inflation 
in the near term.  
In the absence of the lower-bound constrai nt, the optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate would decline to about 1 percent below zero by late 2014 and become 
positive again in the first half of 2016.  The unconstrained policy would bring down the 
unemployment rate a bit faster than the cons trained policy over the next few years but 
lead to a nearly identical inflation path.  Th is similarity in inflation outcomes arises 
because inflation has a low sensitivity to  resource slack in the FRB/US model.9 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under A lternative Policies without Thresholds” 
and “Outcomes under Alternativ e Policies with Thresholds,” tabulate the simulation 
results for key variables under each policy ru le discussed above, with and without 
thresholds. 
                                                 
9 The FRB/US model has undergone several modifications since June that have reduced the 
responsiveness of inflation to resource utilization.  The model notably features a new wage/price block and 
has been re-estimated following a comprehensive revision to the national income and product accounts.  
These modifications have also lowered the sensitivity of aggregate spending to changes in the federal funds 
rate.

Appendix
Policy  Rules  Used in “Monetary  Policy  Strategies ”
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies.” In the table, \ (  R _ t \ )  denotes the effective nominal federal funds rate for quarter \ ( t\) , 
while the right-hand-side variables include the staf f s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( \ (  \ p i _ t \ )  a n d  \ (  \ p i _ { t + 3 |t } \ ) ) , the output gap estimate 
for the current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( \ (  g a p _ t\)  a n d  \(  g a p _ { t+ 1 |t} \) ) , and the forecast 
of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( \ (  \ D e l t a ^ 4 g a p _ { t + 3 |t } \ ) ) .  The value of 
policymakers’  long-run inflation objective, denoted \ (  \ p i ^ * \ ) , is 2 percent. The nominal income 
targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between 
nominal income \ (  y n _ t \ )  (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value \ (  y n ^ * \ )  (100 
times the log of target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staf f s 
estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; 
subsequently, target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staf f s 
estimate of potential GDP.
Taylor (1993) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\)
Taylor (1999) rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\)
inertial Taylor (1999) rule \( R _t = 0.85R _{t-1}+0.15\left(2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)
O utcom e-based rule\(  R _ t =  
1 . 2 R _ { t - 1 } - 0 . 3 9 R _ { t - 2 } + 0 . 1 9 [ 0 . 5 4 + 1 . 7 3 \ p i _ t + 3 . 6 6 g a p _ t - 2 . 7 2 g a p _ { t - 1 } ] \ )
First-difference rule \( R _ t =  R _ { t-1 } + 0 .5 (\p i_ { t+ 3 |t} \-\p i^ * )+ 0 .5 ( \D e lta ^ 4 g a p _ { t+ 3 |t} \)
Nominal income targeting rule \( R_t = 0.75R_{t-1}+0.25(2+\pi_t+yn_t-yn^*_t)\)
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff. 1 The outcome- 
based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q1-2006:Q4. The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 2 percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model. 2 The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules and the long-run
1 See Erceg and others (2012).
2 For the January 2013 Tealbook, the staff revised the long-run value of the real interest rate from 
2 V percent to 2 percent. The FRB/US model as well as the intercepts of the different policy rules have 
been adjusted to reflect this change.

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not de pend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook Outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap, while using the same  lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook Outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in twelve quarter s using an output projection from FRB/US, the 
staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very 
broad array of economic factors, some of which ta ke the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhi bit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

 Monetary Policy Alternatives   
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Alternative B maintains the current monthly pace of 
purchases, the current statement language about  the Committee’s criteria for adjusting the 
pace of purchases, and the current threshold-based forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate, but adds new language that provides  guidance about the medium-term outlook for 
the federal funds rate.  Alternative A also maintains the current pace of asset purchases, 
but suggests that the Committee is not as likely  to reduce the pace of its purchases in the 
near term and augments the forward guidance for the federal funds rate on several dimensions discussed further below.  A lternative C announces a reduction of $10 billion 
each in monthly purchases of agency MBS and Treasury securities and retains the 
forward guidance for the federal funds rate used in the Committee’s September 
statement.   
In summarizing recent economic developments, the alternatives characterize the 
recent pace of expansion in economic activity either as “moderate”— in Alternatives B 
and C—or “modest,” in Alterna tive A.  Alternatives A and B note that the effects of the 
temporary shutdown of the federal governme nt have made the evolution of economic 
conditions somewhat more difficult to asse ss, and offer optional language pointing to 
delays in releases of key da ta.  All three alternatives ci te fiscal policy as a factor 
restraining economic growth.  Alternatives A and B refer to a slow er recovery in the 
housing sector in response to  higher mortgage rates.  Both Alternatives A and B 
acknowledge that labor market indicators have shown “some” further improvement but 
also observe, as in the September statemen t, that the unemployment rate “remains 
elevated.”  Alternative C presents a more sanguine characterization of the labor market 
by noting that the unemployment rate, though sti ll elevated, has conti nued to decline.  
Alternatives A and B note that inflati on has been running “below” the Committee’s 
longer-run objective once cha nges in energy prices are ex cluded; Alternative C uses 
“somewhat below.”  All of the alternatives note that longer-term in flation expectations 
have remained stable. 
In characterizing the economic outlook, a ll three alternatives say the Committee 
expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth “will pick up 
from its recent pace” and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward its

mandate-consistent level.  With respect to the risks to the outlook, al l of the alternatives 
reaffirm the Committee’s judgment that the downside risks to the outlook for the 
economy and the labor market have diminish ed since the fall of 2012.  Alternative A 
notes that the tightening of financial conditions observed “since the spring” could slow 
the recovery, using similar la nguage to that in the September statement, whereas this 
reference has been removed from Alternative B.   In contrast, Altern ative C indicates that 
the Committee has become more confident that labor market conditions will continue to 
improve over the medium term.  All three alternatives indicate that the Committee 
anticipates that inflation will move back to ward its 2 percent objective over the medium 
term; Alternatives A and B repeat the Septem ber statement’s language about the risks to 
economic performance that could result from inflation running persistently below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective, while Alternative C omits that language. 
With respect to balance sheet policy, both Alternatives A and B state that, 
although labor market conditions have improved since the current asset purchase program 
began a year ago, the Committee has decided to  continue purchases at the existing pace 
pending further evidence of sustained im provement in economic activity and labor 
market conditions.  As in September, Alte rnative B indicates that when the Committee 
sees evidence of further progress toward its objectives, reductions in the pace of 
purchases will become appropriate, and speci fies that the Committee will be looking for 
such evidence “at its coming mee tings.”  Alternative A is mo re tentative about the near-
term prospect of a reduction in the pace of  purchases, saying that progress toward the 
Committee’s objectives is “not yet sufficient to warrant” an  adjustment and dropping the 
reference to “coming meetings.”  Alternativ e C, on the other hand, indicates that the 
improvement in the labor market justifies immediate “modest downward adjustments” in the Committee’s asset purchases, to $30 billion per month for agency MBS and 
$35 billion per month for Treasury securities; Alternative C also says that the Committee 
plans to reduce the pace of purchases “agai n” if incoming information continues to 
indicate further progress toward its goals. 
In addition, one version of paragraph 4 in Alternative C in dicates that the 
Committee expects to reduce the pace of futu re asset purchases either in proportion to 
gains in nonfarm payrolls or in proportion to  reductions in the une mployment rate.  The 
first option would continue asset purchase s until the level of nonfarm payrolls has 
increased by a given amount—perhaps 1½ million or 2 million—above its value in 
Alternatives

September 2013; the second option would cont inue purchases until the unemployment 
rate is ½ percentage  point below its value in September 2013. 
Alternatives A, B, and C all maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate, the 6½ percent thre shold for the unemployment rate, and the 
2½ percent “ceiling” threshold for projected infl ation; Alternative A also offers an option 
to lower the unemployment thre shold to 6 percent.  In addition, Alternative A adds a 
second condition for projected inflation—an inflation “floor”—whereby the Committee 
indicates that it does not  anticipate raising its fe deral funds rate target if inflation between 
one and two years ahead is projected to be below either 1½ or  2 percent.  Alternative A 
also states that the Committee, in determining how long to maintain an exceptionally low 
federal funds rate target on ce the unemployment rate reaches  6½ or 6 percent, will—if 
inflation remains well contained, as expect ed—consider a broad set of indicators, 
including the level and growth of employment, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial deve lopments.  Finally, Alternatives A and B 
indicate, with slightly different words, that the Committee anticipates that economic 
headwinds will abate only gradua lly, so that the federal funds rate will likely have to be 
kept “below its longer-run normal value for a considerable time” in order to achieve and 
maintain maximum employment and price stability. 
The following table summarizes key elements of the alternative statements.  The 
summary table is followed by complete draf ts of the three statements and then by 
arguments for each alternative.

 SEPTEMBER FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Some indicators of 
labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, but the 
unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed 
investment advanced, and the housing sect or has been strengt hening, but mortgage 
rates have risen further and fiscal policy is  restraining economic growth.  Apart from 
fluctuations due to changes in energy pr ices, inflation has been running below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, but longe r-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the downside risks to the 
outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last 
fall, but the tightening of fina ncial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, 
could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.  The Committee recognizes that infl ation persistently below its 2 percent objective could 
pose risks to economic performance, but it an ticipates that inflation will move back 
toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment, the Committee sees the 
improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset 
purchase program a year ago as consistent  with growing underlying strength in the 
broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that 
progress will be sustained before adjusti ng the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, 
the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its  holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should 
maintain downward pressure on longer-term in terest rates, support mortgage markets, 
and help to make broader financial condi tions more accommodative, which in turn 
should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  In judging when to moderate th e pace of asset purchases, the Committee 
will, at its coming meetings, assess whet her incoming information continues to 
support the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.  Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)
October 24, 2013

Authorized for Public Release
   
 will remain contingent on the Com mittee’s economic outlook as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase 
program ends and the economic recovery st rengthens.  In particular, the Committee 
decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range fo r the federal funds rate will 
be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate  remains above 6½ percent, 
inflation between one and two years ahead is  projected to be no more than a half 
percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 
inflation expectations conti nue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to 
maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also 
consider other information, including additi onal measures of labor market conditions, 
indicators of inflation pressures and infla tion expectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  When the Committee d ecides to begin to remove policy 
accommodation, it will take a balanced approach  consistent with its longer-run goals 
of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

 FOMC  STATEMENT —O CTOBER 2013  ALTERNATIVE A  
1. The effects of the temporary shutdown of the federal government [ , including 
delays in releases of some key data, ] have made the evolution of economic 
conditions during the intermeeting period  somewhat more difficult to assess.  
However, information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in 
July September generally  suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a 
moderate modest  pace.  Some Indicators of labor market conditions have shown 
some further improvement in recent months , but the unemployment rate remains 
elevated.  Available data suggest that household spending and business fixed 
investment advanced, and but that the recovery in  the housing sector has been 
strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further has slowed in response to 
higher mortgage rates.   and Fiscal policy is restra ining economic growth.  Apart 
from fluctuations due to changes in ener gy prices, inflation has been running below 
the Committee’s longer-run objective, but even though  longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the 
unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the downside risks to the 
outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last 
fall, but the tightening of financial co nditions observed in recent months since the 
spring , if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor 
market.  The Committee recognizes that infl ation persistently below its 2 percent 
objective could pose risks to economic performa nce, but it anticipa tes that inflation 
will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. Taking into account the extent of  federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year , the 
Committee sees the improvement in economic  activity and labor market conditions 
since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing 
underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to 
await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting judges that 
progress toward its objectives for the labor market and inflation is not yet 
sufficient to warrant reducing the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, the 
Committee decided to continue purchasi ng additional agency mortgage-backed 
securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its  holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should 
maintain downward pressure on longer-term in terest rates, support mortgage markets, 
and help to make broader financial condi tions more accommodative, which in turn 
should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over 
time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and

 agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  In judging when to moderate th e pace of asset purchases, the Committee 
will, at its coming meetings, assess whet her incoming information continues to 
support s the Committee’s expect ation of ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.   Asset 
purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace 
will remain contingent on the Com mittee’s economic outlook as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery st rengthens.  In particular, the Committee 
decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and 
currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range fo r the federal funds rate will 
be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above [ 6 | 6½ ]  
percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a 
half percentage point above the Committ ee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-
term inflation expectations c ontinue to be well anchored.  Once the unemployment 
rate reaches [ 6 | 6½ ] percent—and assuming that inflatio n remains well 
contained, as the Committee expects— the Committee will  also consider  other 
information  a broad set of indicators in determining how long to maintain a highly 
accommodat ive stance of monetary policy  an exceptionally low range for the 
federal funds rate.  Relevant factors will  include additional measures of labor 
market conditions such as the level and growth of employment, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  In any case, the Committee anticipates that it will not raise its 
target for the federal funds rate if inflation between one and two years ahead is 
projected to be below [ 1½ | 2 ] percent.  
6. When the Committee eventually decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, 
it will take a balanced ap proach consistent with to achieving its longer-run goals of 
maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  In addition, the Committee 
anticipates that the headwinds that have been restraining the economic recovery 
will abate only gradually.  For this reason, achieving and maintaining maximum 
employment and price stability will like ly require a patient policy approach that 
keeps the target for the federal funds rate below it s longer-run normal value for 
a considerable time.

 FOMC  STATEMENT —O CTOBER 2013  ALTERNATIVE B 
1. The effects of the temporary shutdown of the federal government [ , including 
delays in releases of some key data, ] have made the evolution of economic 
conditions during the intermeeting period  somewhat more difficult to assess.  
However, information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in 
July September generally  suggests that economic activity has been expanding 
continued to expand  at a moderate pace.  Some Indicators of labor market conditions 
have shown some  further improvement in recent months, but the unemployment rate 
remains elevated.  Available data suggest that  household spending and business 
fixed investment advanced, and while the recovery in  the housing sector has been 
strengthening, but mortgage rates have risen further slowed somewhat in recent 
months in response to higher mortgage rates.   and Fiscal policy is restraining 
econom ic growth.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation 
has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective,  but longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the 
unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the downside risks to the 
outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last  
fall, but the tightening of fina ncial conditions observed in recent months, if sustained, 
could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.  The 
Committee recognizes that infl ation persistently below its 2 percent objective could 
pose risks to economic performance, but it an ticipates that inflation will move back 
toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. Taking into account the extent of  federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year , the 
Committee sees the improvement in economic  activity and labor market conditions 
since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing 
underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, the Committee d ecided to continue purchasing additional 
agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term 
Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billi on per month.  The Committee is maintaining 
its existing policy of reinves ting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
In its September statement, the Committee indicated that it wanted to see more 
evidence that improvement in economic activ ity and labor market conditions will be 
sustained before adjusting the pace of asse t purchases.  If members judge that the 
incoming data have not provided sufficient  evidence of sustained improvement—perhaps 
because they see the available data as sugge sting somewhat slower economic growth than 
had been anticipated, or perhaps because of potential repercussions fr om the recent fiscal 
impasse—then they may again prefer to wait for additional information.  If so, they may 
conclude that it is appropriate to continue asset purchases at  the current pace for the time 
being and to release a statement along the lines of Alternative B. 
While policymakers might judge that labo r market conditions have, on balance, 
shown some further progress over the intermeeting period, they may also be dissatisfied with the recent pace of improvement in the la bor market and view the prospects for more 
rapid improvement as insufficiently certain.  In particular, they may observe that 
increases in consumer and business spendi ng and the gains in payroll employment 
observed in recent months have been weaker than anticipated.  Moreover, members may see the recent signals on labor utilization as unclear, noti ng that while the unemployment 
rate came down since June, labor force partic ipation declined almost as much.  Against 
the backdrop of the recent federal government shutdown and the consequent delays in releases of key economic data such as housi ng starts and new home sales for September 
and the first GDP estimate for the third qua rter, members might view the flow of 
incoming data as not adequate to allow a suffi ciently clear assessment of the recent pace 
of economic activity.  In addi tion, members might be concerned about the possibility of 
yet-to-be-seen spillover effect s of the shutdown itself, as well as the extent to which the 
risk of another fiscal stand- off next year might weigh on the confidence of consumers and 
businesses.  Policymakers may also remain  unsure about how quickly the restraint on 
economic growth stemming from the tighter fi scal policy put in place earlier this year 
will begin to wane.  Moreover, they may be concerned about the extent to which the net 
increase in mortgage rates seen since spri ng will hold back home sales and residential 
investment in coming quarters.  Assuming that the September CPI that will be published 
on the second day of the upcoming FOMC mee ting is in line with the staff forecast, 
participants might also conc lude that inflation is still running below the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, apart from fluctuations in energy pr ices.  Moreover, they may 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)
October 24, 2013
Page 29 of 64
Authorized for Public Release
   
 continue to judge that inflat ion is unlikely to exceed 2 percent over the medium term, 
particularly in light of  still-considerable resour ce slack in the economy. 
Furthermore, the Committee might find it useful to offer further guidance about 
the level of future interest  rates over the medium term by adding the new language shown 
in the final paragraph of A lternative B.  As suggested  by the Summary of Economic 
Projections released after the September FO MC meeting, some policymakers may expect 
the equilibrium real rate of interest to be  on a persistently low trajectory for the next 
several years, reflecting linge ring headwinds from the financ ial crisis; accordingly, they 
may conclude that, when accommodation begins to be withdrawn, the setting of the 
nominal federal funds rate target should take  into account the still- subdued level of the 
equilibrium real federal funds rate.  The langua ge in the new sixth pa ragraph at the end of 
Alternative B notes the Committee’s expect ation that economic headwinds will abate 
only gradually, concluding that the federal funds  rate will likely have to be kept “below 
its longer-run normal value for a considerable time” in order to achieve and maintain 
maximum employment and price stability.  Members may view such statement language 
as simply providing further clarity a bout the Committee’s reaction function.  
Alternatively, some members may see such lang uage as helping to anchor expectations 
regarding the policy path in advance of an anticipated cut in the pace of purchases in 
coming meetings. 
Some members may point to the moderate  growth in spending by consumers and 
businesses during the second and third quarters, as well as to continuing gains in private 
payrolls and declines in the unemployment rate, in the face of ongoing fiscal drag as 
evidence that the recovery is gaining traction and that the time for the first reduction in asset purchases has come.  Furthermore, they mi ght be inclined to slow the pace of asset 
purchases to limit the likelihood of excessive ri sk-taking in the fina ncial sector, although 
increases in medium- and longer-term interest rates since the middle of  the year may have 
already reduced risk-tak ing by spurring market participants  to pare back some of their 
leveraged investments in fixed-income inst ruments.  Some members may judge that 
continuing the current pace of purchases a ppreciably longer would risk an undesirably 
large increase in inflation over the medium run, or a rise in longer-term inflation 
expectations.  But, with the unemployment ra te still elevated, r ecent inflation subdued, 
and expected inflation well anchored, policym akers may not regard it as imperative to 
slow the pace of purchases at this meeting in  order to suppress inflation risks.  Moreover, 
some policymakers may worry that in light of  the Committee’s earlier stated intention to 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)
October 24, 2013
Page 30 of 64
Authorized for Public Release
   
 await further evidence of sustained progre ss towards its goals, and given that the 
available data did not clarify the outlook appr eciably, a reduction in asset purchases at 
this meeting might confuse observers and tr igger substantial mark et volatility.  These 
policymakers may regard an announcement at one of the upcoming meetings as less 
likely to trigger such a reacti on, especially if th ey anticipate that incoming data will 
provide clearer evidence of an improvemen t in economic conditions and that Committee 
communications will lay additional groundwork for a moderation of purchases.  As a 
result, policymakers may think that it woul d be prudent to wait for more information 
before deciding when and by how much to slow  the pace of asset purchases.  For similar 
reasons, at least some policymakers might also  want to defer changes in the Committee’s 
forward guidance, whether the optional language about a state- contingent path for future 
reductions in asset purchases shown in C.4 ′ or the new language in B.6.  They may 
therefore prefer a statement like Alternative B—possibly without the additional language at the end of paragraph B.6—as this alternative defers act ion at this meeting while 
indicating that a moderation in the pace of purchases is the likely next move. 
Some members may judge that labor mark et conditions have been improving very 
slowly and that the rate of improvement is  unlikely to pick up appreciably unless the 
Committee adopts a still-more accommodative policy stance, potentially including a 
higher, rather than a lower, pace of asset purchases.  Members also may think that it 
could well become necessary to provide additi onal monetary policy stimulus in order to 
ensure that inflation moves up toward 2 pe rcent in coming years.  These policymakers 
may judge that the benefits of continuing pur chases at least at their existing pace for a 
while longer outweigh the costs.  However, ta king into account the uncertainty attending 
the current trajectory of the economy, these members may regard it as appropriate to 
continue to indicate that a reduction in the pace of purchases is likely if the economy 
continues to improve and to reaffirm the pr eviously-announced thresholds for the forward 
guidance for the federal funds rate.  But these policymakers might also judge that 
Alternative B, particularly via its indicati on that purchases are not on a preset course, 
leaves the Committee well-positioned to in crease the amount of policy accommodation if 
labor market conditions begin to weaken or if the economic outlook deteriorates.  Some 
members may judge that it would be useful to provide additional forward guidance about 
the path of the federal funds rate along the lines of the new language added to the fifth 
paragraph of Alternative A.  Such language, by clarifying the Committee’s intentions regarding the federal funds rate, could cont ribute to lower long-term rates and more-
accommodative financial conditions.  But these members might also prefer to combine 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)
October 24, 2013
Page 31 of 64

 the introduction of such augmented funds rate  guidance with the fi rst reduction in the 
Committee’s asset purchases, w ith the aim of counteracti ng any undesired tightening of 
the public’s funds rate expectations that such a reduction might trigger. 
According to the Desk’s latest survey, primary dealers expect the postmeeting 
statement to be essentially unchanged at the October meeting apart from updating the 
economic assessment.  Thus, to the extent th at the statement language is little changed 
and purchases are continued at their existing pace, an announcement like Alternative B 
would be unlikely to surprise markets.  The additional language in  the sixth paragraph 
could, however, lower the expected policy path and decrease longer-term  interest rates.  
Overall, the effects on inflation compensation, equity prices, and the dollar would likely 
be small.  But if investors took the newly added reference to persistent headwinds as 
indicating that the FOMC has become more pessimistic about the outlook for economic 
growth and employment than market part icipants had anticipated—despite similar 
references in previous communications of  the Chairman and the Committee—equity 
prices and inflation compensation might decline. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
If policymakers judge that the improvement  in the labor market outlook since the 
Committee began its current purchase program a year ago has been sufficient to begin 
winding down the program promptly, they might  choose to start dialing back purchases 
now and to issue a postmeeting statement along the lines of Alterna tive C.  Policymakers 
might view economic news over the inte rmeeting period—despite delays in the 
publication of some key data releases—as br oadly consistent with the modal outlook for 
the economy that underlay the disc ussions of their contingent plan for asset purchases in 
their June meeting and subs equent public communications .  These participants may 
therefore judge that the correct  course is to make a modest downward adjustment to the 
pace of the Committee’s asset purchases at this meeting, and to signal that additional 
measured reductions in the pace of asset pur chases will be appropriate if the Committee 
sees continuing improvement in labor market conditions and if inflation is moving back 
toward its longer-run objective. 
Policymakers may view the expansion of payroll employment observed in recent 
months, along with the declin e in the unemployment rate from June to September, as 
establishing that the economy and the labor market have sufficient momentum to make 
further progress toward the Comm ittee’s objectives.  In particular, participants might cite 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)
October 24, 2013
Page 32 of 64
Authorized for Public Release
   
 the moderate expansion of the economy in th e face of significant re straint from fiscal 
policy as evidence that the recovery has become self-sustaining.  Moreover, they may 
judge that, despite the net increase in mortgage rates since the spring, housing demand will continue to be supported by still-favorable home affordability.  They also may view 
the decline in the unemployment rate over the pa st year and the solid growth in real gross 
domestic income as providing a more-accurate estimate of the underlying strength of the 
economy than is given by real GDP—along the lines of the “Faster Recovery” alternative 
simulation shown in Tealbook, Book A.  Polic ymakers may acknowledge that the recent 
moderation in job gains and th e continuing weakness of the la bor force participation rate 
create some uncertainty about the extent of strengthening in  the labor market, but still 
view the unemployment rate to be the most reliable indicator  of overall labor conditions.  
In addition, the available readings on consumer  price inflation and in flation expectations 
may have reduced participants’ concerns about th e risks of a further decline in inflation.   
Some other policymakers may want to m ove toward ending purchases at this 
meeting because they judge that the benef its of additional purchases no longer outweigh 
the costs.  Even if some participants we re willing to hold off reducing purchases in 
September out of concern for the possible e ffects of the then upcoming fiscal impasse, 
with the deal reached in mid-October and the easing in financial conditions over the 
intermeeting period, they may now  see a reduction in purchases as appropriate.  These 
participants may be skeptical that the asset purchase program is  having a significant 
effect on overall macroeconomic outcomes, or they may judge that it is supporting 
residential construction at the expense of  other types of investment spending.  
Furthermore, they may see the prospective co sts of continuing purch ases at the current 
pace as sizable.  In particular, they may be  concerned that further asset purchases could 
lead to excessive risk-taking in financial markets, undermine financial stability, and 
ultimately put the achievement of the dual mandate  at risk.  If these participants see the 
potential costs associated with a still-larg er balance sheet as hi ghly uncertain or are 
concerned about the reliability of incomi ng information on economic activity, they may 
be willing to slow the pace of purchases in measured steps while more information 
accrues about those costs and about th e underlying economic situation.   
Policymakers may want to continue to condition additional reductions in the pace 
of purchases on evidence of further progress toward the Committee’s goals.  In particular, if it chose the language in paragraph C.4, the Committee would retain the option of 
adjusting the size and timing of future reductions in the pace  of purchases if the outlook 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)

Page 33 of 64
Authorized for Public Release
   
 for the labor market or inflation were to ch ange appreciably.  Wh ile the language in C.4 ′ 
removes the explicit assertion th at purchases are not on a pres et course, it reaffirms that 
purchase will also remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for inflation as well as 
the likely efficacy and costs of purchases.  Similarly, policymakers may favor retaining 
the Committee’s threshold-based forward guida nce for the federal funds rate, as in 
Alternative C, to emphasize that policy remains appropr iately supportiv e of further 
economic expansion. 
If policymakers wish to communicate a direct link between labor market 
developments and changes in the pace of asset purchases, they may choose to use 
language like that in paragraph C.4 ′.  Paragraph C.4′  offers a state-contingent path for 
winding down the pace of future purchases th at depends on the improvement in one of 
two alternative measures of labor market conditions.  Specifically, one option of 
paragraph C.4 ′ states an intent to continue asse t purchases until nonfarm payrolls have 
increased by either 1½ or 2 million from thei r level in September 2013; the other option 
would see asset purchases continue until the unemployment rate has been reduced by ½ percentage point relative to its Septembe r level.  In each case, the monthly pace of 
future purchases would be reduced roughly in  proportion to progress towards the stated 
end point.  These options represent simple rule s that condition the course of future asset 
purchases on a single variable.  Policymakers who believe that readings on the unemployment rate are clouded by uncertainty about the trend in labo r force participation 
may prefer linking future reductions in the pace of asset purchases to job gains.  If the 
labor force participation rate continues to de cline, a faster reduction in purchases would 
result from conditioning future actions on achieving a given decrease in the unemployment rate than on given employment gains (and vice versa if some or all of the recent decline in participation should prove  to be cyclical and soon be reversed).
1   
Some participants who may not be ready to  reduce the pace of purchase at this 
meeting might still find the clarity of  the rules offered in paragraph C.4 ′ attractive.  Such 
policymakers might be inclined to adopt an intermediate position, choosing no change in

purchases at future meetings. 
                                                 
1 The memo by Bora Durdu and Thomas Laubach, “The Pros and Cons of Using Simple Rules for 
Communicating the Pace of Asset Purchases,” sent to the Committee on Octobe r 22, 2013, provides 
simulation analysis of simple policy rules for asset purch ases that are broadly consistent with the statement 
language proposed in C.4 ′.

 A decision to adopt a statement like Alte rnative C would surprise most market 
participants.  The unexpected early reduction in the pace of purchases would probably be 
read by investors as indicating that the Committee has a less-accommodative reaction 
function than previously thought.  In response to such a signal, longer-term interest rates 
would likely rise, equity pri ces and inflation compensation fall, and the dollar might 
appreciate.  The market effects of introduc ing additional language along the lines of 
paragraph C.4 ′ are less clear.  On the one hand, the Committee has previously declined to 
put an explicit state-contingent plan for a sset purchases into the postmeeting statement, 
and the new language could reinforce the pe rception of a less-a ccommodative reaction 
function because it prescribes only further reductions, not increases, in asset purchases.  
On the other hand, the size of the target ed improvements in payrolls or the 
unemployment rate may not be far from what  market participants currently expect, 
suggesting there may be little additional eff ect on asset prices from the adoption of 
paragraph C.4 ′.  That said, at least initially, asse t price volatility might increase as 
investors considered the Committee’s communications and updated their assessment of 
the Committee’s reaction function an d its outlook for the economy. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers may view the recent economic data as weaker than the Committee 
expected when it discussed its contingent plan  for asset purchases at its recent meetings; 
they may also be concerned about the persis tently low readings on inflation that have 
been observed for more than a year.  In a ddition, some policymakers may see an increase 
in near-term uncertainty arising from potential spillover effects of the temporary 
shutdown of the federal government.  As a result, they may wish to continue purchases at their present pace and issue a statement that does not suggest that a reduction in the pace 
of purchases is likely in the near future, as  in Alternative A.  These policymakers might 
point to weaker-than-expected incoming da ta on spending by consumers and businesses 
as a sign of potential weakness in the outlook.  In addition, they  may be skeptical that the 
declines in the unemployment rate registered in recent months will continue, inasmuch as 
they were accompanied by only modest gains in  private payrolls and occurred against the 
background of a very low labor force participation rate and still-high levels of long-
duration unemployment and of individuals wo rking part time for economic reasons.  All 
told, some policymakers may judge that there has been only modest fundamental 
improvement in overall labor mark et conditions in the past year.

 In addition, some participants may note that—despite the decline in longer-term 
interest rates over the intermee ting period—yields, in particular  mortgage rates, are still 
noticeably higher than they were in the spring.  These participants may worry that the 
financial tightening could be sustained or—in light of the only temporary resolution of 
the fiscal impasse—become more severe, along the lines of the “Kicking the Fiscal Can” 
alternative simulation shown in Tealbook, B ook A.  They may see a statement like 
Alternative A as more likely  than Alternative B to pr ovide the amount of downward 
pressure on longer-term interest rates needed  to counter the tightening in financial 
conditions, perhaps because they see Alterna tive B’s language as le aning toward a near-
term reduction in the pace of purchases. 
Some participants may judge not only that  the modal outlook is unsatisfactory but 
also that downside risks to that outlook re main sizable.  Such risks might go beyond those 
posed by recent financial market developmen ts.  In particular, another Congressional 
impasse on the federal debt limit or the budget could elevate policy uncertainty and 
further restrain household spending and busine ss investment around the turn of the year 
and into 2014.  At the same time, with unde rlying inflation con tinuing to run below 
2 percent, some policymakers may see little risk that inflation or inflation expectations will move up; indeed, they might remain concer ned not only about persistent shortfalls of 
inflation from 2 percent, but al so about further downside risks to inflation, especially in 
light of still-substantial resource slack and contained wage gains.  If so, they may see the 
configuration of risks as poi nting to the need for greater  policy stimulus now.  These 
policymakers may see Alternative A as provi ding such stimulus through communicating 
both an open-ended approach to asset purch ases and strengthening forward guidance 
regarding the future path of  the federal funds rate.   
Policymakers may see a statement like Altern ative A as desirable in part because 
of the additional language in paragraph 5 th at enhances the forward guidance about the 
federal funds rate.  Most simply, participants might want to lower the unemployment 
threshold to 6 percent in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term 
interest rates.  Alternativel y, participants may view the la nguage providing an inflation 
“floor” as underscoring the message that th e Committee is willing to defend its longer-
term inflation goal from below as well as fr om above.  In addition, they may regard the 
language in paragraph 5, indi cating that the level and grow th of employment, indicators 
about future inflation, and financial devel opments will enter the Committee’s decisions 
about “how long to maintain an exceptionally  low level of the federal funds rate,” as

 helpful in providing concrete examples of indicators other than the unemployment rate 
that the Committee considers in judging the evolution of economic activity and the labor 
market.  Such a change may also be seen as desirable because it removes the previously 
implied possibility that, in considering such indicators, the Committee might decide to 
increase its target for the federal funds rate be fore one of the thresholds has been crossed.  
For similar reasons as discussed in the case for Alternative B, policymakers might also 
want to adopt the language in th e new sixth paragraph added at the end of Alternative A.   
Expectations about the likely start of ta pering have recently moved out a bit, and 
about two-thirds of dealers do not expect the first reduction in asset purchases to occur 
before the Committee’s meeting in March next year.  Thus the elements of the statement 
language in Alternative A that suggest a somewhat later ini tial reduction in the pace of 
purchases than communicated in June might not  surprise market participants greatly.  
However, the changes to the forward guida nce would be unexpected, especially when 
announced alongside an unchanged purchase program.  Overall, in response to an 
announcement like that in Alternative A, longer- term interest rates would likely decline, 
inflation compensation and equity prices might rise, and the dollar mi ght depreciate.  If, 
however, investors took a statem ent like Alternative A as i ndicating that the FOMC has 
become more pessimistic about the economic  outlook than had been thought, equity 
prices might not rise or could even decline.

 DIRECTIVE   
The directive that was issued after th e September meeting appears on the next 
page, followed by drafts for an October dir ective that correspond to each of the three 
policy alternatives.  The directives for Alte rnatives A and B are unchanged; the directive 
for Alternative C includes changes to ma ke it consistent with the corresponding 
postmeeting statement. 
The directives for Alternatives A and B instruct the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency mortgage-backed securities  at a pace of about $40 billion per month 
and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $45 billion 
per month.  The draft directiv e for Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of a bout $30 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $35 billion per month, beginning in 
November.  All three of the draf t directives direct the Desk to maintain the current policy 
of reinvesting principal payments from its hol dings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-back ed securities and of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities at auction.

BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond in broad terms to Alte rnatives A, B, and C.  All three alternatives include 
additional asset purchases, though the pace a nd cumulative amount of purchases differ 
across the alternatives.  Alternative B continues purchases at the current monthly pace at 
this meeting, but then assumes that the Committee moderates the pace at coming meetings, ending the program by mid-2014.
1  Alternative C has a re duction in the pace of 
purchases immediately and addi tional measured reductions at later meetings, with 
purchases ending in March 2014.  Alternative A maintains th e current pace of purchases 
through early 2014, and then gradually reduces the pace of purchases, bringing the program to a close in December 2014.   
Projections under each scenario are based on assumptions about the trajectory of 
various components of the balance sheet a nd the balance sheet normalization strategy.
2  
The projections for all alternatives assume that the SOMA portfolio shrinks only through 
redemptions of Treasury securities and paydowns  of principal from MBS; consistent with 
the strategy outlined in the press conference statement following the June FOMC 
meeting, no sales of agency MBS are incorporated in the balance sheet projections. 
For the balance sheet scenar io that corresponds to Alte rnative B, the Committee is 
assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and 
of longer-term Treasury securiti es by $45 billion per month for the time being, and then 
to reduce the pace of both types of purchases gradually through June 2014.3  The staff 
1 Slight deviations in the start date and the pace of reductions do not materially affect the balance 
sheet projections.   
2 Details of these assumptions, as well as proj ections for each major component of the balance 
sheet, can be found in the Appendix that follows this section. 
3 The staff assumes that the main effect of asset purchases on financial conditions is related to the 
expected size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio over time.  As a result, the estimated 
macroeconomic effects of a change in the pace of pu rchases will depend importantly on how the change 
influences investors’ expectations of the evolution of the overall size and composition of the Federal 
Reserve’s portfolio.  For reference, see the memos titled “Considerations Regarding the Size and Composition of Reductions in the Pace of Asset Purchases” (by W. Nelson of the Federal Reserve Board, and J. Frost and N. Wuerffel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the Committee on 
October 17, 2013 and “Changing the Pace of Asset Purchases” (by S. Carpenter, W. English, S. Meyer, W. 
Nelson, D. Reifschneider, and R. Tetlow of the Fede ral Reserve Board, and J. Egelhof, S. Friedman,

projects that the unemployment rate will stand at about 7 pe rcent when purchases stop.  
Under these assumptions, purchases total abou t $1.3 trillion over 2013 and the first half 
of 2014, compared with $1.2 trillion in the September Tealbook Alternative B.4 
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” SOMA 
securities holdings under the purchase program assumed for A lternative B peak at about 
$4 trillion in late 2014, with $2.3 trillion in Treasury securities holdings and $1.7 trillion 
in agency securities holdings.  As in the staff forecast in Tealbook, Book A, we assume 
that the first increase in the target federal funds rate is in the second quarter of 2015, the 
same as in the September Tealbook.  Two quarter s before the first incr ease in the target 
federal funds rate, all reinvestments and ro llovers are assumed to cease, and the SOMA 
portfolio begins to contract.5  The size of the portfolio is normalized by mid-2021, the 
same as in the September Tealbook.  The ba lance sheet then begins to expand, with 
increases in SOMA holdings e ssentially matching the growth  of currency in circulation 
and Federal Reserve Bank capital.6  Total assets are $2.5 trill ion at the end of 2025, with 
about $590 billion in MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications for Federal 
Reserve income of the three alternatives.  Under Alternative B, interest income rises until reinvestments cease and then declines as the SOMA portfolio begins to contract through 
redemptions and paydowns of principal.  As the federal funds rate  rises after liftoff, 
interest expense on reserve balances climbs.  As a result, Federal Reserve remittances to 
                                                                                                                                                 
L. Logan, and S. Potter of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) that was sent to the Committee on April 
22, 2013. 
4 The balance sheet scenario assumed for Alternative B is consistent with the state-contingent plan 
for securities purchases laid out by the Chairman  in recent communications and discussed by the 
Committee at its June meeting, as well as with the cu rrent staff forecast presented in Tealbook Book A. 
5 Temporary reserve draining tools (reverse repurchase agreements and term deposits) are not 
modeled in any of the scenarios presented.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
6 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be 
necessary to conduct monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $25 billion.  However, ongoing regulatory and structural changes could indicate a higher steady-state for reserve 
balances.  A higher steady-state level for reserve bala nces would, all else equal, lead to an earlier 
normalization of the size of the balance sheet.

the Treasury decline, although they are pr ojected to remain positive over the entire 
projection period.  Annual remittances peak  at about $100 billion in 2014 and trough at 
about $20 billion later in the decade, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1 trillion, well above the level that would 
have been observed without the asset purchase programs.   
As interest rates fluctuate, so does the unrealized gain positio n of the portfolio.  
The portfolio moved from a position of having an unrealized gain of $180 billion at the 
end of the first quarter of this year to an estimated $20 billion unrealized gain  position at 
the end of September 2013.7  For Alternative B, the portfo lio is projecte d to report an 
unrealized loss of about $30 billion at the end of this year, a $100 billion smaller loss than projected in the September Tealbook, re flecting a downward revision to expected 
longer-term interest rates.   
In the scenario that we assume for Alternative C, the Committee announces an 
immediate reduction of monthly purchases of  longer-term Treasury securities and of 
agency MBS by $10 billion each.  The Committee is assumed to wind down these 
purchases to zero by March 2014.
8  Purchases total about $1.1 trillion in 2013 and 2014.  
In this scenario, the federal funds rate is  assumed to lift off in late 2014, two quarters 
earlier than in Alternative B.  Reinvestme nt of principal from maturing or prepaying 
securities ends and redemptions begin in  mid-2014, causing the portfolio to begin to 
contract.  SOMA securities hold ings in this scenario peak at about $3.8 trillion in June 
2014, and the size of the bala nce sheet is normalized by February 2021, two quarters 
earlier than in Alternative B.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive throughout the projection period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  
Cumulative remittances from 2009 to 2025 are slightly less than under Alternative B. 
In the scenario for Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue the 
current pace of purchases of longer-term Tr easury securities and agency MBS in coming 
                                                 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public with a la g in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly 
Financial Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .  The September unrealized 
gain position is an estimate based on Board staff projections.  
8 The assumption that purchases will end by Marc h 2014 is consistent with a view that the 
recovery is proceeding more strongly than in the staf f forecast or with greater  concern about the possible 
costs and risks associated  with asset purchases.

months, to then reduce purchases graduall y, and to end purchases by the end of 2014. 9  
Under these assumptions, purchases total about $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014.  In this 
scenario, SOMA securities holdings increase to a peak of about $4.3 trillion in June 2015.  
The first increase in the target federal funds rate is assumed to occur in the fourth quarter 
of 2015—two quarters later than in Alternative B.  All re investments are assumed to 
cease in the second quarter of 2015, so the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  The size of the portfolio is normalized in February 2022, about two quarters later than in the 
scenario corresponding to Alternative B, reflec ting the larger asset purchase program and 
the later start to balance sheet normalization. 
The additional purchases of securities in this scenario  substantially boost the level 
of the SOMA portfolio and re serve balances in the near term.  Net interest income 
increases initially and then remains elevated until reinvest ments are assumed to end, and 
annual Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury peak at $105 billion in 2015.  As the 
federal funds rate rises after liftoff, intere st expense on reserve balances increases, 
reducing Federal Reserve net income.  Nevert heless, Federal Reserve remittances to the 
Treasury are projected to remain positive over the entire projection period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative re mittances from 2009 through 2025 are slightly 
higher than under Alternative B. 
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases, although the level of reserve balances is also 
contingent on the evolution of other balance sh eet items.  Reserve balances peak at about 
$3.1 trillion, $2.9 trillion, and $2.7 trillion under Alternatives A, B, and C, respectively.  
When the federal funds rate lifts off from its lower bound, reserve balances are 
$3 trillion, $2.8 trillion, and $2.6 trillion under A lternatives A, B, and C, respectively. 
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternativ e Projections for the Monetary Base,” in 
the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base incr eases through the end 
of 2014 because of the purchase program and the accompanying increase in reserve 
balances.  Once exit begins, the monetary base shrinks, on net, into late 2021, primarily 
because of redemptions of securities and th e corresponding reduction in reserve balances.  
                                                 
9 This later conclusion to the purchases would be  consistent with progress toward the Committee’s 
objectives for the labor mark et and inflation occurring mo re gradually than in the staff forecast or with less 
concern about the possible costs and risks associated with asset purchases.

Starting around late 2021, after reserve balanc es are assumed to have stabilized at  
$25 billion, the monetary base begins to expa nd in line with the growth of currency in 
circulation.  Under the Altern ative C scenario, the monetary base increases through the 
third quarter of 2014 because of the purchase program and then contracts, on net, until 
the size of the portfolio is normalized.  Projec ted increases in the monetary base are less 
than the increases under Altern ative B, due to a smaller pr ogram size and an earlier end 
date for the purchases.  Under Alternative A,  the monetary base increases, on net, through 
early 2015, as the level of reserve balances cl imbs in concert with the expansion of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  The monetary  base then contracts during the exit period 
until the size of the portfolio is normalized.

MONEY  
After a modest increase in September, the staff estimates that M2 will rise more 
rapidly in October.  As discussed in the Financial Developments section of Book A, 
liquid deposit balances at banks likely surged temporarily during the debt ceiling standoff 
in mid-October.  Smoothing through the effects of that episode, growth of M2 is expected 
to slow gradually to a rate more in line with nominal GDP through the first quarter of 
next year.  Thereafter, M2 is projected to rise more slowly than nominal GDP in part 
because investors are assumed to reallocate a portion of their elevated M2 balances to 
riskier investments as financia l and economic conditions improve.10  M2 growth is 
further depressed in 2015 and 2016 as the proj ected rise in short- term market rates 
increases the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets. 
 
                                                 
10 The staff’s M2 forecast is constructed using th e staff’s forecast of nominal income growth and 
model-based estimates of interest rate effects, as well as judgmental adjustments.   Quarterly

Appendix 
This appendix presents the assumptions underl ying the projections provided in the 
section titled “Balance Sheet, Income, and Moneta ry Base,” as well as projections for each major 
component of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. 
GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS  
The balance sheet projections are construc ted at a monthly frequency from October 2013 
to December 2025.  The few balance sheet items that are not discussed below are assumed to be 
constant over the projection period at the level observed on September 30, 2013.  The projections 
for all major asset and liability categories under each scenario are summarized in the tables that 
follow the bullet points.  
The Tealbook projections for the scenario co rresponding to Alternative B assume that the 
target federal funds rate begins to increase in the second quarter of 2015.  This date of liftoff is 
consistent with the current staff economic forecast  and the thresholds described in the September 
2013 FOMC statement, and is unchanged from that assumed in the balance sheet projections for 
Alternative B in the September Tealbook.  The projections for the scenario corresponding to 
Alternative C assume a liftoff date in the fourth qua rter of 2014, two quarters earlier than that in 
Alternative B.  In the projections for the scen ario corresponding to Alternative A, the first 
increase in the target federal funds rate is assumed to occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 after a 
broad set of indicators have improved sufficiently and projected inflation between one and two years ahead is above its floor of 1½ percent.  In each case, the balance sheet projections assume 
no use of short-term draining tools to achieve the projected path for the target federal funds rate.
1 
ASSETS  
Treasury Securities, Agency Mortgage-Backe d Securities (MBS), and Agency Debt 
Securities 
 The assumptions under Alternative B are: 
o The Committee is assumed to continue expanding its holdings of agency MBS by $40 billion per month and of longer-term Treasury securities by  $45 billion per month at this meeting.  Purchases are reduced later this year and continue—though at a decreasing pace—through mid-2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of 
                                                 
1 If term deposits or reverse repurchase agreemen ts were used to drain re serves, the composition of 
liabilities would change:  Increases in term deposits and reverse repurchase agreements would be matched 
by corresponding declines in reserve balances.  Presumably, these draining tools would be wound down as 
the balance sheet returns to its steady-state growth path , so that the projected paths for securities presented 
here would remain valid.

about nine years.  The Treasury and MBS purchases in 2013 and the first half 
of 2014 expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings by about $1.3 trillion.  
o The Committee is assumed to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and reinvesting principal payments from agency MBS 
and agency debt securities into agency MBS until late 2014, six months before the first increase in the federal funds rate.  The assumption that maturing Treasury securities are rolled over at auction is not particularly important because, as a result of the maturity extension program, the SOMA portfolio currently holds less than $5 billion of Treasury securities that mature before January 2016.  
o Starting late in the fourth quarter of  2014—two quarters prior to the assumed 
increase in the target federal funds rate —all securities are allowed to roll off 
the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The portfolio declines only through redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets. 
o For agency MBS, the rate of prepayment is based on staff models using estimates of housing market factors from one of the Desk’s analytical providers, long-run average prepayment speeds of MBS, and interest rate projections generated from the staff’s FRB/US model.
2  The projected rate of 
prepayment is sensitive to these underlying assumptions. 
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternativ e C, the Committee is assumed to decrease 
the monthly pace of purchases to $35 billion of longer-term Treasury securities and $30 billion of agency MBS beginning in November 2013.  The pace of purchases is reduced further later this year, and purchases end in the first quarter of 2014.  The 
Treasury securities purchased are assumed to have an average duration of about nine 
years.  The Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $1.1 trillion in 2013 and 2014.  The FOMC continues to reinvest the proceeds from principal pa yments on its agency securities holdings in 
agency MBS until mid-2014, six months prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate.  Thereafter, all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio as they mature or prepay.  The portfolio declines only through redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets.  
 In the scenario corresponding to Alternative A, the Committee is assumed to continue 
the current pace of purchases of longer-ter m Treasury securities and agency MBS 
through 2013.  Over the course of 2014, the pace of purchases is reduced in several 
steps, and purchases end in December 2014.  The Treasury securities purchased are 
assumed to have an average duration of about nine years.  The Treasury and MBS purchases expand the SOMA portfolio’s hold ings of longer-term securities by about 
$1.5 trillion in 2013 and 2014.  In addition,  the Committee is assumed to maintain its 
                                                 
2 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of October 21, 2013.

existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt 
and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Starting in mid-2015—two quarters prior to the assumed increase in the target federal funds rate—principal payments from all securities are allowed to roll off the portfolio.  The portfolio declines only through redemptions and paydowns of SOMA assets. 
 If interest rates are below (above) the coupon rate on outstanding Treasury securities, 
the market value at which the Federal Reserve purchases such securities will be 
greater (less) than their face value a nd the Federal Reserve records a premium 
(discount).  In all alternatives, net prem iums are roughly unchanged over the length 
of the purchase programs.  
 The market value at which the Federa l Reserve purchases new agency MBS will 
generally exceed their face value.  As a result, MBS premiums under Alternatives A, 
B, and C, will rise by roughly $22 billion, $17 billion, and $10 billion, respectively. 
 The level of central bank liquidity swaps is assumed to decline gradually, reaching 
zero by the end of 2013.  
 In all three scenarios, once reserve balan ces drop to $25 billion, the Desk begins to 
purchase Treasury bills to maintain this level of reserve balances going forward.  Purchases of bills continue until such secu rities comprise one-third of the Federal 
Reserve’s total Treasury securities holdings—about the average share prior to the crisis.  Once this share is reached, the Federal Reserve buys coupon securities in 
addition to bills to maintain an approximate composition of the portfolio of one-third bills and two-thirds  coupon securities. 
 The level of foreign currency denominated assets held in the SOMA portfolio is 
assumed to stay constant at about $25 billion.  
Liquidity Programs and Credit Facilities 
 Credit through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) declines to 
zero by the end of 2015, reflecting loan maturities and prepayments. 
 The assets held by TALF LLC decline from about $100 million currently to zero in 
2015.  Assets held by TALF LLC consist of investments of commitment fees 
collected by  the LLC.3  Consistent with events to date, the projections assume the 
LLC does not purchase any asset-backed securiti es.  (It would have to make such 
purchases if an asset-backed security were received by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York in connection with a decision of a borrower not to repay a TALF loan.) 
                                                 
3 On January 15, 2013, the Board of Governors approved the elimination of the U.S. Treasury’s 
funding commitment and the repayment of the initial funding amount plus accrued interest.  Additionally, 
the Board of Governors approved the disbursement of contingent interest payments from TALF LLC to 
Treasury and FRBNY that are approximately equal to the excess of the TALF LLC cash balance over the 
amount of outstanding TALF loans less funds reserved for future expenses of TALF LLC.  The first payment occurred in February, and additional payments occur on a monthly basis.

 The assets held by Maiden Lane LLC declin e from about $1.5 billion to zero in 2016. 
LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL  
 Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to increase at an average annual rate 
of 6 percent through 2015, in line with the staff forecast.  Afterwards, Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation expand at the sa me rate as nominal GDP in the extended 
Tealbook projection. 
 The level of reverse repurchase agreemen ts (RRPs) is assumed to be around  
$100 billion, about the average level of RRPs associated with foreign official and 
international accounts observed over the past three years. 
 Balances held in the U.S. Treasury’s Ge neral Account (TGA) follow recent patterns 
until the assumed initial increase in the target federal funds rate in each alternative.  
At that point, the TGA drops back to its hi storical target level of $5 billion because it 
is assumed that the Treasury will implement a new cash management system and invest funds in excess of $5 billion.  The TGA remains constant at $5 billion over the remainder of the forecast period. 
 Federal Reserve capital rises 12.5 percent per y ear, in line with the average rate of the 
past ten years.
4 
 In general, increases in the level of Federal Reserve assets are matched by higher 
levels of reserve balances.  All else equal, increases in the levels of liability items, 
such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation or other liabilities, or increases in the level of Reserve Bank capital, drain reserve balances.  When increases in these liability or capital items would otherwise cause reserve balances to fall below        
$25 billion, purchases of Treasury securities ar e assumed in order to maintain that 
level of reserve balances. 
 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount 
necessary to cover operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-
in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  This  deferred asset is reported on the liability 
side of the balance sheet as “Interest on Federal Reserve notes due to U.S. Treasury.”  This liability takes on a positive value when weekly cumulative earnings have not yet been distributed to the Treasury and takes on a negative value when earnings fall short of the expenses listed above.  In this  Tealbook, none of the alternatives results 
in a deferred asset.   
                                                 
4 The annual growth rate of capital affects the date of normalization of the size of the balance 
sheet, the size of the SOMA portfolio after normalization, and the level of annual remittances to the 
Treasury.

TERM PREMIUM EFFECTS5,6 
 Under Alternative B, the term premium effect on the yield of the ten-year Treasury 
note in the fourth quarter of 2013 is about negative 120 basis points, slightly more 
negative than in Alternative B in the Sept ember Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the 
projection period, the term premium effect declines slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated normalization of the portfolio.  
 Under Alternative C, the term premium eff ect is about negative 110 basis points.  
The effect is less negative than in Alte rnative B because there are fewer securities 
purchased and liftoff is earlier than under Alternative B. 
 Under Alternative A, the term premium eff ect is about negative 130 basis points in 
the current quarter.  The effect is more negative than in Alternative B because more 
securities are purchased and liftoff is later than under Alternative B. 
 
                                                 
5 Staff estimates include all current and projected asset purchases and use the model outlined in the 
appendix of the memo titled “Possible MBS Large-S cale Asset Purchase Program” written by staff at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors and sent to the Committee on January 18, 
2012.  More details of the model can be found in Li, Canlin and Min Wei (2013), “Term Structure 
Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale Asset Purchase Programs,” International Journal of Central Banking , vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 3-39 (also in FEDS working paper series, 
2012-37). 
6 The staff projection of the term premium effect depends on assumptions about the size of the 
asset purchase program and the balance sheet normalizat ion strategy.  If market participants anticipate a 
different sized program or a different exit strategy, the staff estimates of the term premium effect may not be the same as those priced in market rates.
