The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federal funds rate from six different policy rules: 
the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the iner tial Taylor (1999) rule, the 
outcome-based rule, the first-difference rule , and the nominal income targeting rule.1  
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline proj ections for real activity and 
inflation in the near term.  (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations 
of the rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the left-hand columns, the prescriptions 
from four of the six rules are above the Committee’s current target range for the federal 
funds rate.  Specifically, the first-differe nce rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, and the 
outcome-based rule prescribe increases in the federal funds rate to values above ¼ 
percent in the second qu arter and to levels between ¾ and 1¼ percent in the third quarter.  
The Taylor (1993) rule, which places considerab ly less weight on the output gap than the 
other rules, calls for the federal funds rate to be about 1¾ percent in the second quarter 
and 2 percent in the third quarter.  The iner tial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a federal 
funds rate of ¼ percent by the third quarter. 
The right-hand columns display the near-ter m prescriptions in the absence of the 
lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.2  Of the six rules, only the nominal 
income targeting rule calls for negative po licy rates in the coming two quarters.  This 
more-accommodative prescription arises because th is rule responds not only to the staff’s 
estimates of the current output gap and cu rrent inflation but also to the cumulative 
shortfall of inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent objective since the end of 2007. 
As shown in the two lower panels of the exhibit, the staff changed its outlook for 
the output gap and inflation onl y a little relative to  the January Tealbook.  Consequently, 
the near-term prescriptions for all of th e rules are likewise little changed.   
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides detail on each of the six rules. 
2 Four of the rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the nominal income 
targeting rule, and the first-difference rule—place subs tantial weight on the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed thus far for the current quarter, the unconstra ined prescriptions shown in the table are indirectly 
affected by the presence of the effective lower bound.

The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model after 
adjusting it to reproduce the staff’s baseline forecast.  The estimated r* corresponds to 
the real federal funds rate th at would, if maintained, retu rn output to potential in 
12 quarters.  As in the January Tealbook, the r* estimate for the first quarter of 2014 is 
near –¾ percent, slightly higher than the –1 percent estimate of the current real federal 
funds rate.  
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations without Thresholds,” reports 
dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.3  These simulations incorporate the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the outpu t gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths prescribed by the different policy rules, under the assump tion that the federal 
funds rate is constrained by the effectiv e lower bound and without regard to the 
Committee’s threshold-based forward gui dance related to inflation and the 
unemployment rate.4  (Alternative policy rule simulations that take account of the 
thresholds are discussed below.)  Each rule  is applied from th e second quarter of 2014 
onward, under the assumptions that  financial market participants as well as price- and 
wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follo w that rule and that agents fully understand 
and anticipate the implications of the rule for future real activity, inflation, and interest 
rates. 
The second exhibit also displays the imp lications of following the baseline policy 
assumption adopted in this Tealbook.  As discussed in Tealbook Book A, this policy 
begins raising the federal funds rate fr om the assumed effective lower bound of 12½ 
basis points in the second quarter of 2015—the  same quarter as in the January Tealbook 
and two quarters after the projected end of the FOMC’s curr ent program of large scale 
asset purchases.  The assumed two-quarter la g between the end of a sset purchases and the 
departure from the effective lower bound is inte nded to be consistent with the guidance in 
                                                 
3 A few changes have been introduced to the FRB/US model for this Tealbook; however, these 
changes have only small effects on the simulations of the simple policy rules as well as the optimal control 
simulations discussed below.  Among the changes is the inclusion of gross domestic income as a variable in the model, changes in the specification of the equations determining the unemployment rate, and a change to the way interest on the federal debt is forecast. 
4 The policy rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  Fo r the current program, th e baseline forecast embeds 
the assumption that purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS continue to be reduced 
gradually, end in the second half of 2014, and tota l a bit less than $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014.

the FOMC’s recent postmeeting statement indicating that “a highly accommodative 
stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset 
purchase program ends.”  Once it rises above the effective lower bound, the baseline path 
for the federal funds rate follows the prescrip tions of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  
After the initial firming in the second quarter of 2015, the federal funds rate steadily 
increases by a little more than ¼ percentage point per quarter over the next few years, 
reaching almost 2½ percent at the end of 2016 and 4 percent by late 2018.  The 
unemployment rate reaches the staff’s esti mate of the long-term natural rate of 
unemployment of 5.2 percent by the end of 2016.  Headline inflation rises gradually, 
reaching 2 percent only in 2018.  
Without the thresholds, most of the polic y rules call for policy tightening to begin 
over the next couple of quarters.  Four of the rules put the real federal funds rate 
appreciably above the path implied by th e baseline forecast, leading to higher 
unemployment and lower inflation than in the baseline through most of the decade.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule calls for only a very gradual tightening beginning in the middle of this year; its prescriptions are nearly identical to the baseline from late 2016 
onward and the associated macroeconomic outcome s are similar to those in the baseline.  
Only the nominal income targeting rule prescribes a later onset of tightening than that in 
the Tealbook baseline.  This rule keeps the fe deral funds rate at th e effective lower bound 
until late 2015 and generates a re al federal funds rate persistently below the baseline for 
the rest of the decade, thereby leading to a stronger path for real activity as well as higher 
inflation. 
The results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to that rule in the future 
and that the private sector fully understands  the policy that will be pursued and its 
implications for real activity and inflation.  These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targ eting rule, which is associated with outcomes 
in which inflation runs somewhat above the 2 percent longer-run goal for some years, 
even after the output gap has closed. 
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with Current Thresholds and Forward 
Guidance,” displays simulations in which the policy rules are subject to the thresholds 
that the Committee adopted in December 2012, which have been implemented with an 
assumption about the enhanced forward guidance provided in the last two postmeeting

statements.  In particular, for each of the rule s, the federal funds rate is constrained to 
stay at the effective lower bound of 12½ basis points as long as the unemployment rate is 
6 percent or higher, the level of  the unemployment rate that, in  the baseline, also prevails 
in the quarter before the federal funds rate  departs from the effective lower bound.  (This 
constraint is meant to be consistent with the Committee’s recent statement from January 
that “it likely will be ap propriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds 
rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially 
if projected inflation conti nues to run below the Committee’ s 2 percent longe r-run goal.”)  
In subsequent quarters, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified 
rule.  As in the simulations without threshol ds, financial market participants and price- 
and wage-setters are assumed to understa nd that the Committee will switch to the 
specified rule once this condition is satisfied or the threshold for pr ojected inflation has 
been crossed, and to view this switch as permanent and fully credible.  For all of the 
simulations discussed below, the decline in the unemployment rate turns out to be the 
catalyst for the shift to the specified rule; projected inflation betw een one and two years 
ahead remains below 2 percent at the time of de parture of the federal funds rate from the 
effective lower bound in each simulation.  
For most rules, the imposition of the th resholds and additional forward guidance 
leads to a departure of the fe deral funds rate from the effective lower bound in the second 
quarter of 2015, the same quarter as in the January Tealbook and the staff’s current baseline.  The thresholds are not binding for the nominal income targeting rule:  Under this rule, the unemployment rate declines belo w 6 percent considerably ahead of the time 
that the federal funds rate is  raised above its effective lo wer bound.  For the other rules, 
imposing the thresholds and additional forw ard guidance postpones th e departure of the 
federal funds rate from the effective lower bound by about a year compared with the case 
of no thresholds and no additi onal forward guidance.  As a result, the unemployment rate 
generally declines a bit more rapi dly, and inflation is a touch higher.
  
The fourth exhibit, “Constr ained versus Unconstraine d Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those reported in  the January Tealbook.5  Policymakers are assumed to place equal 
weights on keeping headline PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on 
                                                 
5 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 4.  The simulated policies do not incorporate thresholds.

keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment, and on minimizing changes in th e federal funds rate.  The optimal control 
concept presented here corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers make decisions today that effectively c onstrain policy choices in future periods. 
Reflecting the fact that the staff outlook fo r inflation and slack in the economy is 
largely unchanged, the federal funds rate under the constrained optimal control path is almost identical to its count erpart in the January Tealbook.  As in January, the outcomes 
derived from the optimal control simulations are also similar to those associated with 
policy under the staff baseline.  In the simulations, which are subject to the usual caveats regarding expectations and commitment, the op timal federal funds rate departs from the 
lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, as in the staff’s baseline forecast, but rises 
relatively more slowly over subsequent year s.  The constrained optimal control policy 
implies a slightly lower path fo r the real federal funds rate ov er the next few years than in 
the staff’s baseline outlook; th ereafter the optimal-control path is slightly higher than the 
baseline path, implying, on net, only sma ll differences in the outcomes for the 
unemployment rate and inflation.
6 
As in the January Tealbook, the presence of the lower-bound constraint has only 
minor effects on the outcomes under optimal cont rol policy.  In the absence of the lower-
bound constraint, the optimal federal funds ra te would reach a minimum of only about 
negative 20 basis points in the seco nd half of 2014 and subsequently rise to levels that are 
similar to those in the constrained simulations.  Accordingly, the path for the real federal 
funds rate is only slightly lower than in  the constrained policy rate path, and the 
unconstrained policy would bring down the une mployment rate at about the same speed 
as the constrained policy and l ead to a nearly identical path  for inflation.  This result 
depends importantly on the presence of the pena lty on changes in the federal funds rate in 
policymakers’ quadratic objective function.  An objective function wi th a substantially 
smaller interest-rate smoothing term would imply a federal funds rate path that falls 
                                                 
6 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper-right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to com pute the real interest rate for this illustrative purpose 
because it provides a less volatile m easure of inflation expectations th an does a four-quarter moving 
average of headline inflation.

considerably below zero under the unconstraine d optimal policy, leading to a more rapid 
decline in the unemployment rate than under the constrained policy. 
The staff has included interest-rate smoot hing in the assumed loss function for the 
optimal control policy simulations in large pa rt because the assumption helps to keep the 
simulated variation and persistence of the fe deral funds rate close to their observed 
historical ranges.  The federal funds rate  may have typically moved gradually and 
persistently in the past because policymakers,  for a number of possible reasons, prefer not 
to adjust the rate sharply.  Different policym akers may have different tolerances for funds 
rate fluctuations, and thus they might consider different penalties on interest-rate 
smoothing as being more appropriate.  The fifth exhibit, “Optimal Control Policy with 
Minimal Weight on Interest-Rate Smoothi ng under Commitment,” examines how 
outcomes differ between an optimal control simu lation that features a substantially lower 
weight on the change in the federal funds  rate and the standard (equal-weight) 
parameterization of the objective function.7   
A lower weight on interest-rate smoothing implies an optimal policy in which the 
federal funds rate is raised above the lower bound about a year later than in the standard 
case but then rises more steeply.  However, th e profile of longer-term interest rates is 
essentially unchanged, as the effect of the lo wer federal funds rate in the near term is 
about offset by the effect of the higher level of  the funds rate in the intermediate-term.  
Because changes in federal funds rate po licy in the FRB/US model are primarily 
transmitted to aggregate demand via longer-term  interest rates, th e differences in the 
effects on the unemployment rate and on inflation are also small.8  
                                                 
7 In the case of minimal interest-rate smoothing, th e weight placed on changes in the funds rate is 
lowered to an essentially negligible value.  Specifi cally, while the standard si mulations place a weight of 
one-third on minimizing changes in the federal funds rate in the objective function, the minimal-smoothing 
case corresponds to a weight of about one fortieth on  this term.  Lowering the weight any further would 
lead to convergence problems for the simulations of the FRB/US model.  Simulations of optimal control 
under discretion with the alternate weights on interest-rate smoothing considered here yield very similar 
results to the respective results under commitment. 
8 This result is specific to conditions, such as in the current situation, in which the optimal funds 
rate path is constrained by the lower bound at least for some time to come.  In general, the effects of 
altering the weight placed on interest -rate smoothing can have material e ffects on the opti mal control paths 
for the unemployment rate and inflation as illustrated in the memo by Robert Tetlow, “Optimal Control 
Simulations with Minimal Penalty on the Change in the Funds Rate” (sent to the Committee on January 27, 
2014), which considered optimal control simulations  in the absence of the lower-bound constraint.

Taken at face value, these results suggest that, in current circumstances, the 
policies associated with great er and lesser degrees of inte rest-rate smoothing would serve 
equally well in achieving the Committee’s du al mandate of price stability and maximum 
employment.  It deserves emphasis, how ever, that in practice the communication 
strategies associated with these two objectiv e-function settings woul d likely need to be 
decidedly different, each presenting its own challenges. 
For the case with less inte rest-rate smoothing, the firs t increase in the federal 
funds rate is shifted further into the future; with more interest rate smoothing, the first 
increase occurs earlier and is followed by a period of relatively gradual tightening.  
Arguably, communications about th e conditions that would be associated with the later 
onset of tightening in the less-interest-rate smoothing case might pose less-formidable 
challenges than the provision of conditional guidance about the gradual firming of the 
federal funds rate once rate increases have  begun in the more-interest-rate-smoothing 
case, as that gradual tightening sequence c ontinues into the more distant future.  
However, if the post-lower-bound behavior of policy with less interest rate smoothing constitutes a more substantial break from pa st behavior, intensive communication efforts 
could be required for its su ccessful implementation as well.
9  If market participants did 
not expect such a steep increase after departing from the lower bound, current longer-
term rates would be different from those im plied by the simulations and may not achieve 
the intended outcomes for real activity and infl ation.  In addition, if market participants 
were surprised by the swift increases prescrib ed in this simulation, the adjustments in 
markets could potentially be quite disorderly.  Considering the sta ndard case with a high 
degree of interest-rate smoothing, effective communication would need to emphasize the 
conditions under which the slow pattern of increases in the federal funds rate would be appropriate in order to avoid a false sense of security among market participants.  If 
investors were to underestimate the extent to which future policy actions remain sensitive 
to surprises in incoming data under this state-contingent policy path, investors might take 
on excessively risky projects in their s earch for high yields, thereby undermining 
financial stability. 
                                                 
9 Specifically, this policy implies increasing the federal funds rate by about 400 basis points over a 
period of two years, as opposed to four years in the case with a substantial weight on interest-rate 
smoothing.  While the more gradual trajectory appears more aligned with current market expectations, the 
pace of increases prescribed by the simu lations with less interest-rate smoot hing is also consistent with the 
400 basis points increase in the federal funds rate seen most recently over the two-year period from mid-
2004 to mid-2006.

1. With the exception of constrained optimal control, monetary policy is specified to keep the federal funds rate
at an effective lower bound of 12.5 basis points as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.0 percent and
projected one-year-ahead inflation is less than 2.5 percent. Once either of these thresholds is crossed, the federal
funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified rule. Policy in the Tealbook baseline is consistent with these
threshold conditions.

Appendix
POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  Rt denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead  (nt and ^t+3|t), the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  as well as its one-quarter-ahead  forecast  (gapt and gapt +1|t), and the forecast  
of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the output  gap (A4gap t+3\t). The value  of 
policymakers'  long-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  n*, is 2 percent.  The nominal  income  
targeting  rule responds  to the nominal  income  gap, which  is defined  as the difference  between 
nominal  income  ynt (100 times  the log of the level of nominal  GDP)  and a target  value  yn‘t 
(100 times  the log of target  nominal  GDP). Target  nominal  GDP in 2007:Q4  is set equal  to the 
staff's  current  estimate  of potential  real GDP in that quarter  multiplied  by the GDP deflator  in 
that quarter;  subsequently,  target  nominal  GDP  grows  2 percentage  points  per year  faster  than the 
staff's  estimate  of potential  GDP.

The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in recent  analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
outcome-based  rule uses policy  reactions  estimated  using  real-time  data over  the sample  
1988:Q1 -2006:Q4.  The intercept  of the outcome-based  rule was chosen  so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent  long-run  inflation  objective  and a long-run  real interest  rate of 2 percent,  a value  
used in the FRB/US  model. 2 The intercepts  of the Taylor  (1993,  1999)  rules and the long-run
1 See Erceg  and others  (2012).
2 For the January  2013  Tealbook,  the staff revised  the long-run  value  of the real interest  rate from  
2% percent  to 2 percent.  The FRB/US  model  as well as the intercepts  of the different  policy  rules have 
been  adjusted  to reflect  this change.

intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not de pend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same  lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s 
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.   This estimate depends on a very broad array 
of economic factors, some of which take the fo rm of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables.  The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, which 
is generated after the paths of e xogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they 
match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the outpu t gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the 
extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

  Monetary Policy Alternatives  
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  The alternatives di ffer in their path fo r asset purchases and 
forward guidance and in their characterizat ion of the outlook for economic activity and 
inflation.  With the unemployment rate nearing 6½ percent, all three alternatives feature 
significant revisions to the forward guidance for the federal funds rate.  Alternative A 
offers an inflation floor.  Alternatives B and C offer qualitative gui dance that links the 
first increase in the federal funds rate to  progress toward the Committee’s employment 
and inflation objectives, with the draft statement for Alternative B also expressing the 
Committee’s view that the new guidance is full y consistent with th at in its previous 
statement.  
Under Alternative B, the Committee redu ces monthly purchases of both agency 
MBS and Treasury securities each by another $5 billion starting in April and signals that 
further reductions of that size are likely at  future meetings.  Under Alternative C, the 
Committee announces larger reductions in mont hly asset purchases and indicates that 
further reductions are likely.  For both of these alternatives , the draft statement includes a 
new sentence indicating that the Committee judges that there is “sufficient” underlying 
strength in the broader economy to suppor t “ongoing improvement in labor market 
conditions.”  Under Alternative A, the Committ ee would continue asset purchases at their 
current pace on the grounds that informati on received since late  January suggests a 
somewhat greater downside risk to the ou tlook for the labor market and inflation. 
The forward guidance for the federal f unds rate under Alternatives B and C 
includes new language for the fifth paragraph; it states that, in determining how long to 
maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will 
“assess progress—both realized and expect ed—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.”  Unde r both of these altern atives the Committee 
would go on to state that its assessment will “take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expectations, a nd readings on financial developments.” 
However, Alternatives B and C offer diffe rent language to replace the “well past 
the time that the unemployment rate declines  below 6½ percent” qualitative guidance that 
the Committee added to the December statement to indicate its thinking about the likely

 path of the federal funds rate  after the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent.  
Alternative B indicates that the Committee cont inues to anticipate maintaining the current 
target range “for a considerable time” after the asset purchase program ends, while 
Alternative C says “for some  time” after purchases end.  
In contrast, Alternative A replaces the threshold-based forward guidance language 
with an inflation floor, indicat ing that the Committee will maintain the current 0 to ¼ 
percent target range for the fe deral funds rate “at least as long as inflation between one 
and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent and longer-term inflation 
expectations continue to be  well anchored.”  Alternative A also contains language 
indicating that the Committee likely will maintain the current target for the federal funds rate “for a considerable time after th e asset purchase program ends.”   
All of the alternatives reiterate th at the Committee will take a “balanced 
approach” when it begins to remove policy accommodation, consistent with its longer-
run goals.  Alternative B provi des additional guidance, in a new sixth paragraph, stating 
that the Committee “currently anticipates that , even after employment and inflation are 
near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant 
keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as normal in the 
longer run.”  This language not only provides some guidance about the federal funds rate 
after liftoff, it also opens the option of target ing some short-term interest rate or rates 
other than the federal funds rate during normalization.  The new final paragraph of 
Alternative B states that the Committee’s “new guidance” is “fully consistent” with the 
“guidance in its pr evious statement.” 
The three policy alternatives have as b ackdrops different assessments of recent 
and prospective economic conditions.  Alterna tive B presents the view that the economic 
outlook has changed only modestly since the January meeting.  The draft statement for 
Alternative B observes that growth in ec onomic activity “slowed during the winter 
months, in part reflecting adverse weather condi tions.”  As in the January statement, the 
text for Alternative B states that “labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement,” while again obs erving that inflation “has been running 
below” the Committee’s longer-r un objective but that longer-te rm inflation expectations 
have remained stable.  However, in order to emphasize that the Committee’s assessment 
of the labor market situation depends on many variables, the outlook paragraph in 
Alternative B no longer focuses on the unempl oyment rate; it now indicates that the 
Alternatives

 Committee expects that, with appropriat e policy accommodation, economic activity will 
expand at a moderate pace, a nd “labor market conditions will continue to improve 
gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent  with its dual mandate.”  
The statement for Alternative B describes the risks to the outlook for the economy and 
the labor market as “nearly balanced” and it again notes the risks to economic 
performance posed by inflation being persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective. 
The draft statement for Alternative C offe rs a somewhat stronger characterization 
of the economic situation and outlook, setting up the larger  reduction in the pace of 
purchases.  The first paragraph of Alterna tive C observes that labor market conditions 
have shown further improvement, pointing in particular to payroll employment having 
expanded “at a solid pace,” and it puts greater emphasis on the diminution of fiscal 
restraint.  In addition, Alternative C dow nplays the recent softness in economic growth 
by indicating that “much of [it]  likely reflected adverse weat her conditions.”  Under this 
alternative, the Committee would emphasize the stability of longer-term inflation 
expectations and place less em phasis on actual inflation running below 2 percent.  The 
outlook paragraph for Alternative C, like that for Alternative B, omits the reference to the 
gradual decline in the unem ployment rate, replacing it w ith a broader reference to 
improvement in labor market conditions toward  those consistent with the dual mandate.  
Alternative C further indicates that the Comm ittee “continues to anticipate” that inflation 
will move back toward 2 percent over the medium term rather than suggesting that it is looking for evidence of such movement. 
Under Alternative A, the Committee w ould express greater concern about 
lackluster economic growth, low inflation, and the downside risks to the outlook for the labor market and inflation.  In particular, Alternative A says that the housing recovery 
“slowed further” while Alternative B says th at it “remained slow.”   The statement for 
Alternative A goes on to observe  that inflation has continued to run “well below” 2 
percent “even though” longer-term inflati on expectations have been stable.  
The following table summarizes key elements of the three alternative statements, 
followed by complete drafts of the statements and arguments for each alternative.

 JANUARY FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December 
indicates that growth in economic activity pi cked up in recent quart ers.  Labor market 
indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.  The 
unemployment rate declined but remains el evated.  Household spending and business 
fixed investment advanced more quickly in recent months, while the recovery in the 
housing sector slowed somewhat.  Fiscal  policy is restraining economic growth, 
although the extent of restrain t is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, but longe r-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Comm ittee sees the risks to the outlook for the 
economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced.  The 
Committee recognizes that infl ation persistently below its 2 percent objective could 
pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments 
carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment  since the inception of its 
current asset purchase program, the Committ ee continues to see the improvement in 
economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  In light of the cumulative 
progress toward maximum employment and th e improvement in the outlook for labor 
market conditions, the Committee decided to  make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in February, the Committee will add to its 
holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of $35 billion per m onth rather than $40 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term 
securities should maintain downward pressu re on longer-term interest rates, support 
mortgage markets, and help to make  broader financial conditions more 
accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help 
to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s 
dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward

 its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases 
in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a 
preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent 
on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  The Committee also reaffirmed its expectation that the curre nt exceptionally low target range for the 
federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the 
unemployment rate remains above 6½ percen t, inflation between one and two years 
ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectati ons continue to be well 
anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of 
monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including 
additional measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on  financial developments.  The Committee 
continues to anticipate, based on its assessmen t of these factors, that it likely will be 
appropriate to maintain the current target ra nge for the federal funds rate well past the 
time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Co mmittee’s 2 percent lo nger-run goal.  When 
the Committee decides to begin to rem ove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers might judge that inform ation received during the intermeeting 
period, after allowing for weather-related distor tions in the data, is broadly consistent 
with their expectations at the times of the December and January FOMC meetings, and 
share the staff’s assessment that the medium-term outlook for economic activity has 
changed only modestly.  In addition, policymakers may remain confident that there has 
not only been considerable cumulative progress toward maximum employment but also 
an appreciable improvement in the outl ook for labor market conditions since the 
inception of the Committee’s current asse t purchase program.  Moreover, although 
inflation has remained below the Committee’s longer-run objective, participants may note that indicators of medium- and longer-run inflation expectations have continued to 
be relatively stable over the intermeeting period.  With the unemployment rate nearing 
the 6½ percent threshold, participants may find it necessary and appropriate to clarify the 
Committee’s intentions regard ing adjustments to the fede ral funds rate after the 6½ 
percent unemployment rate threshold is reac hed, in order to ensure the continued 
effectiveness of the Committee’s forward gui dance.  Accordingly, policymakers may see 
the March meeting as an opportune occasion for introducing new forward guidance, especially in view of the fact  that the meeting will be followed by a press conference and 
that the unemployment rate c ould fall below 6½ percent prior to the April meeting.  As 
proposed under Alternative B, the Committee may therefore choose to combine a modest 
further reduction in the pace of asset purchas es with a revision to its forward guidance. 
In place of the current threshold-base d forward guidance, policymakers may 
prefer to use qualitative language to comm unicate the Committee’s intentions about the 
federal funds rate, thereby maintaining flexibility about th e timing and size of future 
adjustments in their target for that rate.  If policymakers favor qua litative guidance, they 
may want to point to the Committee’s assessment of “progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation” as the 
key factor that will influence their decision about when to raise th e federal funds rate 
above its effective lower bound.  This wording mi ght also be seen as  desirable because it 
adopts a characterization of the Committee’s policy decisionmaking that is not focused 
on a single labor market indicator, but focuses more broadly on the goals of “maximum 
employment” and 2 percent inflation.  Such a reference would be cons istent with the dual 
mandate and the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy 
Strategy (hereafter, Consensus Statement).

 The message that the amount of po licy accommodation depends on progress 
toward the Committee’s goals is reinforced by adding that it likely will be appropriate to 
maintain the current target range for the fede ral funds rate “for a considerable time after 
the asset purchase program ends.”  In pa rticular, because the asset purchases are 
themselves linked to economic progress, the indication that firming of the federal funds 
rate will not occur unt il after the purchase program ends  underscores the state-dependent 
nature of federal funds rate decisions even as it adds an element of calendar dependence.   
A new sixth paragraph in the draft st atement for Alternative B expands the 
Committee’s description of its conduct of po licy once the federal funds rate has been 
raised above its lower bound.  The paragraph retains the refe rence to taking a “balanced 
approach” to removing policy accommodati on, as in the Consensus Statement and 
previous FOMC statements, allowing for the possibility that the Committee may face a tradeoff in achieving the dual mandate goa ls when it begins to remove policy 
accommodation.  In light of the important economi c role of expectati ons for the path of 
interest rates, and with the fi rst increase in the federal funds  rate gradually approaching, 
the Committee may want to provide additional information about the likely course of the 
federal funds rate once it has left the lo wer bound.  As suggested by the Summary of 
Economic Projections released after the December FOMC meeting, policymakers may judge that it will be appropriate to keep th e federal funds rate well below its longer-run 
normal level for the next several years—perhaps reflecting one or more of the following factors:  a lower-than-normal equilibrium real interest rate, the asymmetric risks posed by 
the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate, a commitment to keeping the federal 
funds rate low in the medium term in order to spur more rapid ec onomic growth in the 
near term, or a judgment that the Committee should reduce the size of the balance sheet 
as it raises the funds rate.  If so, policym akers might wish to pr ovide such additional 
guidance by noting that “even after employ ment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, fo r some time, warrant keeping short-term 
interest rates below levels the Committ ee views as normal in the longer run.”  
Some participants may view the use of the phrase “short-term interest rates,” 
instead of specifically referring to the federal funds rate, as an  appropriate way of 
opening the option of targeting a different sh ort-term interest rate or rates during 
normalization.  However, other policymak ers, while supportin g the policy action 
embodied in Alternative B, ma y regard it as inappropriate for the Committee, at this 
stage, to add to the perception—in a way that will surely be noticed by market 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)

 participants—that it might not  continue to target the federal funds rate.  These 
policymakers may see further detailed Committee deliberation as warranted before any 
signal about the future operation of monetary policy is provided in the statement.  If so, 
they might favor language like that in Alterna tive B, but with “short-term interest rates” 
replaced by “the target federal funds rate.” 
The revisions to the forward guidance in Alternative B are not intended to 
indicate a change in the Committee’s thinki ng about the conditions that will warrant 
raising the federal funds rate or  the time at which it likely will become appropriate to do 
so.  The seventh paragraph of the draft st atement of Alternative B makes this point 
explicitly by stating that the revised forw ard guidance is “fully consistent” with the 
previous statement’s guidance.  Participants ma y view this paragraph as useful in limiting 
possible misinterpretations by market par ticipants of the new forward guidance and 
thereby reducing the likelihood of  undesired changes in financia l conditions in response 
to the release of the statement.  
Some policymakers may wish to emphasize that inflation has stayed low in recent 
months or, while acknowledging recent growth  in payroll employment, may judge that 
adverse weather conditions likely account for only part of the recent softness in economic 
activity, suggesting that the outlook for the labor market may have deteri orated.  In either 
case, participants may believe that it has beco me appropriate to provide greater monetary 
policy accommodation, perhaps by strengthenin g the forward guidance and continuing 
asset purchases at their current pace, as in Alternative A, rather than reducing the pace again as market participants expect.  Participants may see the inflation-floor form of 
forward guidance as desirable because it implie s that, even if employment is nearing the 
Committee’s assessment of its mandate-consistent level, accommodation will remain in 
place if necessary to ensure th at inflation will move up to 2 percent.  They may believe 
that in response to this language, investors w ould push back the date of the first hike in 
the federal funds rate, perhaps considerably, if inflation were  to continue to run below 2 
percent.  However, other policymakers may see financial market expectations regarding 
the future path of the federal funds rate as appropriately aligned with the Committee’s 
thinking at this time.  Consequently, they may be concerned that the adoption of an 
inflation floor, as in paragraph A.5, could c onfuse financial market participants about the 
Committee’s intentions, with possible unwelcome  volatility in financial markets.  In 
addition, some participants may be concerned th at an inflation floor would not provide an 
indication regarding the implications for polic y of an unexpected above-target inflation

 rate.  These policymakers may therefore judge that, as the economy transitions from 
extraordinary conditions to more ordinary times, it is appropriate for their forward 
guidance to shift from relianc e on numerical thresholds to qualitative language that 
reflects the Committee’s Consensus Statement. 
Alternatively, some policymakers may be concerned that maintaining very low 
rates for as long as suggested by the new forward guidance language in paragraph B.6 
could risk a rise in longer-ter m inflation expectations and an  undesirably large increase in 
inflation over the medium run.  They may al so worry that this forward guidance could 
lead to excessive risk-taking in the financ ial sector.  For these reasons, they may be 
inclined toward an earlier incr ease in the federal f unds rate than envisioned in Alternative 
B.  However, increases in medium- and longer- term interest rates si nce the middle of last 
year appear to have reduced risk-taking at least to so me extent by spurring market 
participants to pare back some of their le veraged positions in fixed-income markets.  
Moreover, as valuations in most asset markets appear to be broadly in line with historical 
norms, and the level of vulnerability of the financial system to potential adverse shocks is apparently at moderate levels, policymakers may think it unlikely th at sizable financial 
imbalances will arise from current polic y settings.  Consequently, with the 
unemployment rate still elevated, inflation be low 2 percent, and expected inflation well 
anchored, these policymakers may judge that th e risks of an increas e in inflation to a 
level persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term goal currently remains small and that the risks to financial stab ility of maintaining highly accommodative policy 
remain manageable.  Moreover, they may j udge that the language in paragraph B.5 
indicating that the Committee will consider fi nancial conditions, inflation pressures, and 
inflation expectations in determining how  long to maintain a highly accommodative 
stance of monetary policy provides the Committ ee with sufficient flexibility for attaining 
its long-run objectives.   
The likely market reaction to a statement li ke Alternative B is difficult to predict 
with confidence, particularly in light of the substantial of changes to the Committee’s 
forward guidance.  According to the Desk’s latest survey, all of  the primary dealers 
expect the Committee to announce a third $10 bi llion cut in the pace of asset purchases 
next week.  Moreover, most dealers expect this reduction to be accompanied by a 
modification of the forward guidance for the federal funds rate—either by deemphasizing 
the unemployment rate threshold or droppi ng it and replacing it with qualitative 
guidance.  Therefore, market participants  may not be surprised by a statement like 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)

 Alternative B and may view the stance of policy as broadly unchanged.  In that case, the 
effects of the announcement on financial market prices would be small.  There is a risk, 
however, that the move to more-qualitative forward guidance could be read by investors 
as suggesting that the Committee is pulling b ack from its earlier guidance, potentially 
boosting both the level and vol atility of longer-term intere st rates through increased 
uncertainty about the expected path of future short-term rates as well as higher term 
premiums.  The risk of this scenario is reduced by the inclusion in the postmeeting 
statement of paragraph B.7; it might be re duced still further if the postmeeting press 
conference emphasized that the Committee’s outlook for policy had not changed 
significantly and if this unchanged outl ook was confirmed by the March Summary of 
Economic Projections.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may view the expansion of payroll employment observed in recent 
months as establishing that the economy and the labor market have sufficient momentum 
to continue making significant progress to ward the Committee’s objective of maximum 
employment.  They may view adverse w eather conditions as masking the underlying 
strength in private-sector demand, and thus  place more weight on strong consumer and 
business confidence, as in the “Faster Recovery” scenario in Tealbook Book A.  
Participants may further cite last year’s moderate economic expansion in the face of 
significant fiscal restraint as evidence that th e recovery has become self-sustaining and is 
set to strengthen in the coming year as fiscal restraint cont inues to wane.  Alternatively, 
policymakers may have concluded that the slower-than-anticipated improvement in 
output and employment over much of the current  recovery largely reflects a step-down in 
trend productivity growth from its pre-crisis norm (a possibility suggested by the 
“Supply-Side Damage” alternative scenario in Tealbook Book A), coupled with a 
downward trend in the labor fo rce participation rate and a persistent increase in the 
natural rate of unemployment.  If so, they may judge that the level of potential output is 
significantly lower than the staff currently es timates and that the unemployment rate is 
not much above its longer-run normal level.  In addition, policymakers may view the recent stability of inflation readings as a sign that the temporary factors that put 
downward pressure on inflation for a time have begun to diminish; if so, they may anticipate that inflation will firm toward 2 percent in coming quarters, provided that 
longer-term inflation expectati ons remain stable.  Conseque ntly, policymakers may opt to 
issue a statement like that in Alternative C.  
Alternatives

 Some policymakers may worry that main taining a highly accommodative stance 
of policy for a protracted period could rais e the risk of an undesirable increase in 
inflation.  Thus, they may prefer making a la rger reduction in asset purchases at this 
meeting than under Alternative B, thereby moving up the end of the purchase program 
and raising the federal funds rate sooner th an under Alternative B.   In addition, some 
policymakers may not want to indicate that shor t-term interest rates are likely to be below 
average for some time.  Policymakers may simply  judge that short-term interest rates will 
not be below average, or they may be concerne d that such a forecast, if interpreted as an 
unconditional statement about future policy, could undermine the stability of financial 
markets over time or limit the Committee’s scope  to tighten policy more rapidly than 
under the baseline projection should such a tightening become appropriate.   
Based on the Survey of Primary Dealers,  a decision to adopt a statement like 
Alternative C would surprise market participants, as all deal ers expect a third $10 billion 
cut in the pace of tota l asset purchases.  A $20 billion reduc tion in the pace of purchases, 
along with the removal of the “measured step s” language from the fourth paragraph of 
the statement, likely would be interpreted by investors as a signal that the Committee is moving to end the asset purchas e program more quickly than previously anticipated.  In 
conjunction with the solidly positive characterization of the economy in the first 
paragraph of the draft statemen t for Alternative C, a larger-than-expected cut in the pace 
of purchases would probably lead market part icipants to pull forward their forecasts of 
the date on which the Committee will first increase  its target for the federal funds rate and 
perhaps also lead them to an ticipate a steeper path  for the federal funds rate during the 
period of policy firming.  In response, longer-te rm interest rates likely would rise, equity 
prices and inflation compen sation would fall, and the dollar would appreciate.  If, 
however, a statement like that in Alternative C led investors to become more confident 
about the economic outlook, inte rest rates and the dollar c ould rise more, and equity 
prices might not decline, and could even increase. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Inasmuch as inflation has lingered be low the Committee’s longer-run objective 
for almost two years and has shown little sign of moving back toward 2 percent, 
policymakers might be concerned that monetary policy is not sufficiently 
accommodative.  They also may see recent data as again disappointing their expectations 
that the economic recovery will strengthen.  In particular, they may point to weaker-than-

 expected fourth-quarter real  GDP growth and argue that unusually severe weather can 
account for only a portion of the softness in the first-quarter data.  Although 
policymakers may be encouraged by recent gains in private payroll employment, they 
could remain skeptical that significant grow th in employment can be sustained in the 
absence of a broader pickup in economic activit y.  Moreover, they may judge that the fall 
in the unemployment rate in recent quarters overstates the degree to which labor market 
slack has been removed, and see other indicators—for example, the number of 
individuals who are either long-term unemployed or work ing part time for economic 
reasons—as pointing toward the existence of considerable unused labor resources.  All 
told, policymakers may judge that there ha s not been sufficient progress towards the 
Committee’s objectives for the labor market and inflation to warrant reducing the pace of 
purchases at this meeting.  If so, they may prefer Alternative A.   
Policymakers may see a statement like that in Alternative A as desirable because 
it maintains the pace of asset purchases and exp licitly introduces a floor to inflation that 
is expressed in terms of the projected infl ation between one and tw o years ahead, stating 
that the federal funds rate will not be increased until inflation over that time frame is 
projected to be back at its mandate-consiste nt level.  They may view such a policy 
decision as appropriate in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term 
interest rates, thus helping to ensure that the recovery gains trac tion and that inflation 
moves up toward the Committee’ s longer-run goal.  In additi on, some participants may 
view an explicit inflation floor as desira ble because it provides assurance to the public 
and financial market participants that the Committee is committed to returning inflation 
to its 2 percent goal.   
Some participants may judge not only that  the modal outlook is unsatisfactory but 
also that downside risks to  the outlook for inflation, while  modest, remain large enough 
to be a concern.  In particular, with underlying inflation continui ng to run well below 2 
percent, some policymakers may be partic ularly concerned by the possibility that 
persistently low inflation c ould eventually lead to dec lines in longer-run inflation 
expectations, resulti ng in mutually reinforcing downw ard dynamics for inflation and 
economic activity along the lines of the “Low In flation” alternative scenario in Tealbook 
Book A.  If so, then they might favor the inflation-floor language in Alternative A 
because it would reinforce the Committee’s intention to defend its 2 percent inflation goal from below, and so help to avoid a sustained decline in infla tion.  In addition, some 
participants may judge that a further reduction in inflation in current  circumstances would 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)

Page 39 of 60

 have larger-than-usual advers e implications for the economy because the effective lower 
bound on interest rates limits the Committee’s scope to respond.  As a result, these 
participants may prefer to wait to reduce a sset purchases further until they have clear 
evidence that the first-quarter slowdown in  economic growth will prove temporary and 
that inflation will move back toward the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.    
An announcement like Alternative A would co me as a considerable surprise to 
market participants.  Investors likely would mark up their expectations for total asset 
purchases and push back the date of the first hike in the federal funds rate, perhaps by a 
considerable amount.  Therefore,  longer-term interest rates lik ely would decline, inflation 
compensation and equity prices might rise, a nd the dollar could depreciate.  However, if 
investors read the statement in Alternative A as reflecting a more downbeat assessment of 
the outlook for economic growth and inflation, eq uity prices might not rise or could even 
decline, and inflation compensation could fall.  In addition, in troducing new forward 
guidance language only in terms of infla tion might create significant confusion among 
investors about the extent to which the Committee feels bound by its earlier forward 
guidance, a development that could incr ease the volatility of  asset prices.

 DIRECTIVE   
The directive that was issued after the January meeting appears on the next page, 
followed by drafts for a Marc h directive that co rrespond to each of the three policy 
alternatives.  Each draft in cludes changes to make it consistent with th e corresponding 
postmeeting statement.   
The directive for Alternative A instructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency mortgage-backed securities  at a pace of about $30 billion per month 
and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $35 billion 
per month.  The draft directiv e for Alternative B instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of a bout $25 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion per month, beginning in 
April.  The draft directive for Alternativ e C instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of a bout $20 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of  about $25 billion per month, also beginning 
in April.  All three of the draft directives dire ct the Desk to maintain the current policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-back ed securities and of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities in to new issues.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.  A ll three alternatives include additional asset 
purchases, though the pace and cumulative amount of purchases differ across the 
alternatives.  Projections under each scenario are based on the staff’s assumptions about the trajectory of various components of the balance sheet and the balance sheet 
normalization strategy.
1  The projections associated with each of the policy alternatives 
assume that when the time comes to norma lize the balance sheet, the SOMA portfolio 
shrinks only through redemptions of Treasury securities and agency debt and paydowns 
of principal from agency MBS; consistent  with the strategy outlined in the press 
conference statement following the June 2013 FOMC meeting, no sales of agency MBS 
are contemplated. 
For the balance sheet scen ario that corresponds to Alternative B, monthly 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securi ties and of agency MBS are reduced by 
$5 billion each in April.  Th ereafter, monthly purchases of Treasury securities and agency 
MBS are each reduced further by $5 billion after subsequent FOMC meetings; purchases 
wind down to zero early in the fourth quarter of 2014.  U nder these assumptions, which 
are consistent with the staff baseline forecas t assumption, purchases total a bit less than 
$1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014, unchanged from A lternative B and the staff forecast in 
the January Tealbook.  
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” total 
assets under the purchase progr am assumed for Alternative B peak at about $4.5 trillion 
in the first quarter of 2015, with $2.4 trilli on in Treasury securities holdings and  
$1.7 trillion in agency MBS holdings.2  We assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in the second quarter of 2015, consistent with the staff forecast and 
unchanged from Alternative B of the January Tealbook.  At the time of liftoff, all reinvestments and rollovers of securities ar e assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio 
                                                 
1 Further information on the assumptions regard ing asset and liability categories not discussed 
here can be referenced in the appendix of the December 2013 Tealbook, Book B. 
2 Total assets peak after the end of the purchase program due to delayed settlement of agency 
MBS purchases.

begins to contract.3,4  The size of the portfolio is normalized by late 2021, as in the 
January Tealbook.5  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA 
holdings essentially matching the growth of currency in circulation and Federal Reserve 
Bank capital.  Total assets are $2.5 trillion at the e nd of 2025, with about $640 billion in 
agency MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications of balance 
sheet developments for Federal Reserve income.  Under Alternative B, interest income 
rises while purchases are ongoing, and subsequently  declines for a number of years as the 
SOMA portfolio contracts through redempti ons and paydowns of principal.  Although 
interest expense is quite sma ll in the near term, when the federal funds rate rises with 
reserve balances still quite elev ated, interest expense climbs.  As a result, Federal Reserve 
remittances to the Treasury remain robust in the near term but then decline markedly over the period from 2016 to 2018; nevertheless, rem ittances are projected to remain positive 
over the entire projection period.  Annual rem ittances peak at about $100 billion in 2014 
and trough at about $15 billion later in the decade, and no deferred asset is recorded.
6  
The Federal Reserve’s cumulative remitta nces from 2009 through 2025 are about $950 
billion, well above the level that would have been observed in the absence of the asset 
purchase programs.   
                                                 
3 Temporary reserve draining tools—reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) and term deposits—
are not modeled in any of the scenarios presented, although the model does assume RRPs associated with 
foreign official and international accounts will rema in around $100 b illion throughout the forecast period.    
Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reve rse repurchase agreements or term deposits—but 
would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
4 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of March 10, 2014. 
5 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be 
necessary to conduct monetary policy in the long run; cu rrently, we assume that level of reserve balances to 
be $25 billion, about where these balances stood prio r to the crisis.  However, ongoing regulatory and 
structural changes could lead to a higher demand for reserve balances in the new steady state.  A higher 
steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else eq ual, imply an earlier norma lization of the size of the 
balance sheet.  In addition, if the Committee were to select a different operating regime for monetary policy 
than was used prior to the crisis, the new normal size of the balance sheet could potentially be quite different than it was prior to the crisis.   
6 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  In this Tealbook, none of the alternatives re sults in the need to record a deferred asset.

The unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA  portfolio is importantly influenced 
by the level of interest rates.  Staff estimates that the portfolio was in an unrealized gain 
position of about $35 billion as of the end of February 2014.7  Reflecting the rise in 
interest rates over the project ion period, the position under Alternative B shifts to an 
unrealized loss in the near term and reaches a peak unrealized loss of about $360 billion at year-end 2017.  The unrealized loss positi on narrows through the remainder of the 
forecast period as securities mature and new securities are added at par. 
Under Alternative C, in April, the monthly pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities is reduced by $10 billion; the same is tr ue of purchases of agency 
MBS.  Purchases are assumed to wind down to zero by mid-2014.
8  Under this balance 
sheet scenario, purchases total about $1.3 trillion over 2013 and 2014, and the federal 
funds rate is assumed to lift off in late 2014.  Reinvestment of principal from maturing or 
prepaying securities ends and redemptions begi n in the fourth quarter of 2014 concurrent 
with the first increase in the federal funds rate.  Total assets in this scenario peak at about 
$4.3 trillion in the third quarter  of 2014, and the size of the balance sheet is normalized 
around the same time as in Alternative B.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury 
are projected to remain positive throughout th e projection period, and no deferred asset is 
recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 to 2025 are slightly lower than under 
Alternative B. 
In the scenario for Altern ative A, the current pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities and agency MBS is maintain ed in the near term and then is reduced 
gradually, with purchases ending in early 2015.9  Under these assumptions, purchases 
total about $1.7 trillion from 2013 to 2015.  In this scenario, total assets increase to a 
peak of about $4.7 trillion in the first quarter  of 2015.  The first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is assumed to occur in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the 
                                                 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public with a la g in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly 
Financial Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .   
8 The assumption that purchases will end by mid-2014  is consistent with a view that the recovery 
is proceeding more strongly than in the staff forecast or that the level of potentia l output is lower than the 
current staff estimate.  It is also consistent with a concern about the possible cost s or risks associated with 
asset purchases and keeping interest rates very low for a protracted period of time. 
9 This later conclusion to the purchases would be  consistent with progress toward the Committee’s 
objectives for the labor mark et and inflation occurring more gradually in the near term than in the staff 
forecast, or with a desire on the part of policymakers to return employment and inflation to mandate-consistent levels more rapidly than in the baseline.

expectation that inflation one to two years ahead is projected to  be below 2 percent 
through at least this time.  All reinvestments are assumed to cease at the time of the first 
increase in the federal funds rate, and then the SOMA portfolio begins to contract.  The 
size of the portfolio is normalized about two quarters later than in the scenario 
corresponding to Alternative B, reflecting the larger amount of asset purchases.  Federal 
Reserve remittances to the Treasury are pr ojected to remain pos itive over the entire 
projection period, and no deferred asset is r ecorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 
through 2025 are slightly highe r than under Alternative B. 
As shown in the exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the 10-Year Treasury Term 
Premium Effect,” under Alterna tive B, the effect of the Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
increase in asset holdings on th e term premium in ten-year yields in the first quarter of 
2014 is negative 126 basis points, about the sa me as under Alternative B in the January 
Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the projectio n period, the term premium effect declines 
slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated nor malization of the portfolio.  
Under Alternative C, the contemporaneous term premium effect is negative 119 basis 
points.  The effect is less negative than in A lternative B because there are fewer securities 
purchased than under Alternative B and the ba lance sheet begins to contract sooner.  
Under Alternative A, the term premium effect  is about negative 138 basis points in the 
current quarter.  The effect is more negative than in Alternative B because more 
securities are purchased a nd the balance sheet begins to contact later than under 
Alternative B.  
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases and th e timing of the liftoff of the federal funds 
rate, although the level of reserve balances is  also contingent on th e evolution of other 
balance sheet items.  Reserve balances peak at about $3.2 trillion and $3.0 trillion in early 
2015 under Alternatives A and B, respectively.  For Alternative C, re serve balances peak 
at about $2.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2014. 
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternativ e Projections for the Monetary Base,” in 
the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base increases on balance 
through the middle of 2015 because the purchas e program is accompanied by an increase 
in reserve balances.  Once exit begins, the monetary base shrinks, on net, through 2021, 
primarily because redemptions of securities  cause corresponding reductions in reserve 
balances.  Starting around mid-2022, after re serve balances are assumed to have

stabilized at $25 billion, the monetary base be gins to expand in line with the growth of 
currency in circulation.  Because the contours of the balance sheet are similar across the 
alternatives, the growth rates of the monetary base in Alte rnatives C and A are broadly 
similar to those under Alternative B.10 
  
                                                 
10 The projections for the monetary base depend critically on the FOMC’s use of various tools 
during the exit.  If, for example, the FOMC employs reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits 
extensively during the exit, the projected level of re serve balances and the monetary base could decline 
quite markedly in the out years.

After having grown significantly faster th an nominal GDP for several years, M2 
is projected to increase at nearly the same  rate as nominal GDP throughout the remainder 
of this year and then to c ontract modestly in 2015 and 2016.11  This pattern results 
primarily from the assumed increase in the targ et federal funds rate over the forecast 
horizon and the associated rise in the opport unity cost of holding M2.  In addition, the 
staff assumes that investors will shift their portfolios away from the safe and liquid assets 
in M2 toward riskier non-M2 assets as the economic recovery progresses.12   
 
                                                 
11 The staff’s M2 forecast is constructed using th e staff’s forecast of nominal income growth and 
model-based estimates of interest rate effects with judgmental adjustments. 
12 The monetary aggregates could be affected by tools that the Federal Reserve employs during the 
normalization period, although the size and direction of such effects are difficult to judge.  In these 
projections, we do not take account of such effects. Quarterly
