The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federal funds rate from six different policy rules: 
the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the iner tial Taylor (1999) rule, the 
outcome-based rule, the first-difference rule , and the nominal income targeting rule.1 
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline proj ections for real activity and 
inflation in the near term.  The intercepts of the rules, where applicable, have been set to 
2 percent, the same as the long-run equilibrium  value of the real interest rate in the 
Tealbook extension.  (Medium-te rm prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of 
the rules are discussed below.)  As shown in  the left-hand columns, the prescriptions 
from four of the six rules are above the Committee’s current target range for the federal 
funds rate.  Specifically, the (non-inertial) Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, 
and the first-difference rule pr escribe increases in the federa l funds rate to values above 
¼ percent in the current quarter and to le vels between ¾ and 1¼ percent in the third 
quarter.  The Taylor (1993) rule, which places considerably  less weight on the output gap 
than the other rules, calls for an increase in  the federal funds rate to 1¾ percent this 
quarter and a further rise, to 2 percent, next quarter.  Both the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the nominal income targeting rule prescr ibe a federal funds rate within the current 
target range in the near term, although the effective lower bound is  only binding in the 
latter case. 
The right-hand columns display the rules’ near-term prescriptions in the absence 
of the lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.
2  Of the six rules, only the 
nominal income targeting rule calls for negati ve policy rates this qua rter and next.  This 
more-accommodative prescription arises because the rule responds not only to the staff’s 
estimates of the output gap and inflation in th e current quarter but also to the cumulative 
shortfalls of inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective since the end 
of 2007. 
1 The appendix to this section provides detail on each of the six rules. 
2 Four of the rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the first-difference 
rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—place substantial weight on  the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed last quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table are indirectly affected by the 
presence of the effective lower bound.

1. For rules that have the lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook outlook" report rule prescriptions 
based on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the realized value for the policy rate last quarter. 
2. Estimates of r* may change at the beginning of a quarter even when the staff outlook is unchanged because the twelve-quarter horizon 
covered by the calculation has rolled forward one quarter. Therefore, whenever the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the memo 
includes a third column labeled "Current Quarter Estimate as of Previous Tealbook."

As the lower panels of the exhibit show, the staff’s projections for the output gap 
and inflation have changed little since th e March round, which explains why the near-
term prescriptions for all of the rules are likewise little changed. 
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model after 
adjusting it to reproduce the staff’s baseline forecast.  The estimated r* corresponds to 
the real federal funds rate th at would, if maintained, retu rn output to potential in 
12 quarters.  As in the March Tealbook, the r* estimate for the second quarter of 2014, at 
–0.9 percent, is slightly higher than the –1.0 pe rcent estimate of the current real federal 
funds rate. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model.  These simulations refl ect the endogenous respons es of inflation and 
the output gap when the federal funds rate  follows the paths implied by the different 
policy rules, under the assumption that the federal funds rate is subject to an effective 
lower bound of 12½ basis points.3  For these simulations, no attempt is made to capture 
the Committee’s forward guidance, reaffirm ed in March, that “it likely will be 
appropriate to maintain the current target  range for the federal funds rate for a 
considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.”  (Alte rnative policy rule 
simulations that take account of  this guidance are discussed be low.)  Each rule is applied 
from the current quarter onward, under the assump tions that financial market participants 
as well as price- and wage-setters believe that the FOMC will follow that rule and that 
agents fully understand and anticip ate the implications of the rule for future real activity, 
inflation, and interest rates. 
The second exhibit also displays the imp lications of following the baseline policy 
assumptions adopted in this Tealbook.  In forming the Tealbook baseline, the staff assumed that the federal funds rate would fi rst depart from the effective lower bound two 
quarters after the end of the asset purchase program and then follow the prescriptions of 
the inertial Taylor (1999) rule .  As in March, the first rate  hike under the baseline policy 
occurs in the second quarter of 2015.  Thereafter,  the federal funds rate steadily increases 
3 The policy rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  For the current program, the simulations embed the 
assumption that purchases of longer-term Treasury s ecurities and agency MBS will conclude before the end 
of this year, with cumulative purchases close to $1.5 trillion.

by slightly more than ¼ percentage point pe r quarter over the next few years, reaching 
2½ percent at the end of 2016 and 4 percent by the second half of 2018. 
Four of the rules call for po licy tightening to begin this quarter and are associated 
with real federal funds rate paths that si gnificantly exceed the corresponding path in the 
baseline over the next few years, leading to higher unemployment and lower inflation 
through most of the decade.  The inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule calls for a more gradual 
tightening commencing next quarter; its prescrip tions for the federal funds rate are nearly 
identical to those under the Tealbook baseline  from late 2016 onward and result in very 
similar macroeconomic outcomes.  Only the no minal income targeting rule implies a later 
inception of tightening than assumed in the Tealbook baseline.  This rule keeps the 
federal funds rate at the effective lo wer bound until the final quarter of 2015 and 
generates a real federal funds ra te that runs persistently below that in the baseline for the 
rest of the decade, thereby leading to st ronger real activity a nd higher inflation. 
The results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to that rule in the future 
and that the private sector fully understands  the policy that will be pursued and its 
implications for real activity and inflation.  These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targeting rule, which generates outcomes in which unemployment runs markedly below the natu ral rate, doing so for several years after 
inflation has moved above the Committee’s longer-run goal. 
As noted above, the policy rules in the si mulations do not take into account the 
Committee’s forward guidance, and most of these rules involve departures from the 
effective lower bound that occur about a year earlier than suggested by recent FOMC communications.  For the purposes of most a lternative scenarios shown in the Risks and 
Uncertainties section of Tealbook, Book A, the delay between the end of asset purchases 
and the first federal funds rate hike was implemented by imposing a 6 percent unemployment rate threshold.  Using an economic threshold captures the Committee’s 
intent that policy be data-dependent; a valu e of 6 percent was c hosen because in the 
Tealbook baseline the unemployment rate crosses that level just befo re firming begins.  
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with 6 Percent Unemployment Rate 
Threshold,” reports results obtained when each  policy rule is subject to this assumed 
threshold.  Financial market participants a nd price- and wage-setters are assumed to 
understand that the Committee will switch to the specified rule in the quarter following

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit keep the federal funds rate at an effective lower bound of 12½ basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is 6 percent or more. Thereafter, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified rule. In addition, the simulations are based on rules that respond to core inflation. This choice of rule specification was made in light of the tendency for current and near-term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation rates as predictors of the medium-term behavior of headline inflation.

the observation of an unemployment rate of 6 percent, and to view this switch as 
permanent and fully credible. 
For most of the rules, imposing the 6 percent threshold postpones the first 
increase in the policy rate by around four quarters, implying that  the policy rate leaves the 
lower bound at a time close to that in the staff baseline.4  These delays typically have 
small macroeconomic effects, however, because the real federal funds rate moves back to 
the no-threshold path quickly enough that the longer-term real  rates that subsequently 
influence economic activity in the FRB/US  model are not appreciably altered by 
imposing the unemployment rate threshold.  On ly for the first-difference rule does the 
threshold imply significantly different outcome s.  For this rule, the threshold delays 
departure from the effective lower bound w ithout materially changing the pace of 
tightening over the subsequent few years.  As a result, the path of the real federal funds 
rate is lower over the simulation period, causing longer-term real rates to also be lower 
than otherwise. 
The fourth exhibit, “Constr ained versus Unconstraine d Optimal Control Policy,” 
compares the optimal control simulations de rived using this Tealbook’s baseline forecast 
with those reported in March.5  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on 
keeping headline PCE inflation close to th e Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the 
unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate  of the natural rate of unemployment, and 
on minimizing changes in the federal funds ra te.  The optimal cont rol concept presented 
here corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers make decisions 
today that effectively constrain pol icy choices in future periods. 
Reflecting a largely unchanged staff outl ook for inflation and slack, the federal 
funds rate under the constrained optimal control path is similar over the next several 
years to its counterpart in the March Tealbook; the implications for unemployment and 
inflation are similarly unchanged.  The outcomes derived from the optimal control simulations are also quite similar to those a ssociated with the current Tealbook baseline.  
4 Imposing the threshold has no effect on the nominal income targeting rule simulations because, 
under that rule, the unemployment rate is already below 6 percent by the time policymakers would want to 
start raising the federal funds rate. 
5 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 3.  The simulated policies do not incorporate the 6 percent unemployment rate 
threshold.

In these simulations, which are subject to th e usual caveats regarding expectations and 
commitment, the optimal federal funds rate departs from the lower bound in the second 
quarter of 2015 and reaches 2½ percent in early 2017, as is the case in the staff baseline.  
Although the federal funds rate in the constrained optimal c ontrol simulation is initially 
slightly below and then sli ghtly above the corresponding pa th in the baseline, these 
differences have only limited implications for the unemployment rate and inflation.6 
As in the March Tealbook, the presence of the lower-bound constraint has only 
minor effects on the outcomes under optimal cont rol policy.  In the absence of the lower-
bound constraint, the optimal federal funds ra te would reach a minimum of only about 
negative ¼ percent in th e second half of 2014 and subsequen tly rise to levels that are 
similar to those in the constrained simulations.  Accordingly, the path for the real federal 
funds rate is only slightly lower than the c onstrained policy rate pa th.  The unconstrained 
policy would bring down the unemployment ra te at about the same speed as the 
constrained policy and lead to a ne arly identical path for inflation.7 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes unde r Alternative Policies” and “Outcomes 
under Alternative Po licies with 6 Percent Unemploymen t Rate Threshold,” tabulate the 
simulation results for key variables under each of the policy rules discussed above. 
6 Although the loss function uses headline inflation in stead of core inflation,  the real federal funds 
rate shown in the upper-right panel of the exhibit, as in the other simulations reported in this section, is 
calculated as the difference between the nominal federa l funds rate and a four-quarter moving average of 
core PCE inflation.  Core PCE inflation is used to com pute the real interest rate for this illustrative purpose 
because it provides a less volatile m easure of inflation expectations th an does a four-quarter moving 
average of headline inflation. 
7 This result depends importantly on the presence of a penalty on changes in the federal funds rate 
in policymakers’ quadratic objective function.  The staff has included a penalty of the assumed value in 
large part because the assumption helps to keep the simulated variation and persistence of the federal funds 
rate close to their observed historical ranges.  An objective function with a substantially smaller interest-
rate smoothing term would imply a federal funds rate path that falls considerably below zero for a time 
under the unconstrained optimal policy, prompting a more rapid decline in the unemployment rate than 
under the constrained policy.  The path for inflation would be essentially unchanged.

Appendix
POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  [math] denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead  [math],  the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  as well as its one-quarter-ahead  forecast  [math] , and the forecast  
of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the output  gap [math] . The value  of 
policymakers'  long-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  [math] , is 2 percent.  The nominal  income  
targeting  rule responds  to the nominal  income  gap, which  is defined  as the difference  between 
nominal  income  [math] (100 times  the log of the level of nominal  GDP)  and a target  value  [math] 
(100 times  the log of target  nominal  GDP). Target  nominal  GDP in 2007:Q4  is set equal  to the 
staff's  current  estimate  of potential  real GDP in that quarter  multiplied  by the GDP deflator  in 
that quarter;  subsequently,  target  nominal  GDP  grows  2 percentage  points  per year  faster  than the 
staff's  estimate  of potential  GDP.
Taylor  (1993)  rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\) 
Taylor  (1999)  rule \( R_t = 2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\) 
Inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule \( R_t = 0.85R_{t-1}+0.15\left(2+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)
Outcome-based  rule\( R _ t = 
1.2R_{t-1}-0.39R_{t-2}+0.19[0.54+1.73\pi_t+3.66gap_t-2.72gap_{t-1}]\)
First-difference  rule \( R_t = R_{t-1}+0.5(\pi_{t+3|t}-\pi^*)+0.5\Delta^4gap_{t+3|t}\) 
Nominal  income  targeting  rule \( R_t = 0.75R_{t-1}+0.25(2+\pi_t+yn_t-yn^*_t)\)
The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in recent  analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
outcome-based  rule uses policy  reactions  estimated  using  real-time  data over  the sample  
1988:Q1 -2006:Q4. The intercept  of the outcome-based  rule was chosen  so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent  long-run  inflation  objective  and a long-run  real interest  rate of 2 percent,  a value  
used in the FRB/US  model. 2 The intercepts  of the Taylor  (1993,  1999)  rules and the long-run
1 See Erceg  and others  (2012).
2 For the January  2013  Tealbook,  the staff revised  the long-run  value  of the real interest  rate from  
2 1/4 percent  to 2 percent.  The FRB/US model  as well as the intercepts  of the different  policy  rules have 
been  adjusted  to reflect  this change.
Authorized for Public Release
intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set  at 2 percent for the same reason.  The 2 percent 
real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  The 
prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not de pend on the level of the output gap or the long-
run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same  lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s 
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.   This estimate depends on a very broad array 
of economic factors, some of which take the fo rm of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables.  The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, which 
is generated after the paths of e xogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they 
match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the outpu t gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the 
extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
 This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  With respect to balance sheet policy, Alternative B reduces 
monthly purchases of agency MBS and Treasur y securities by anot her $5 billion each and 
signals that further reductions  of that size are likely at  future meetings.  Under 
Alternative C, the Committee would reduce purchases of agency MBS and Treasury 
securities by $10 billion each while suggesting that additi onal reductions are likely.  
Under Alternative A, the Committee would main tain the current pace of asset purchases 
“and await additional information bearing on the outlook for economic activity, the labor 
market, and inflation.” 
All of the alternatives retain the Ma rch statement’s forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate.  Alternative A adds an inflation floor, under which the Committee 
would maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate “at least as long as 
inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent, provided 
that longer-term inflation expecta tions remain well anchored.”   
Under each alternative, the Committee w ould repeat its intention to take a 
“balanced approach” when it begins to re move policy accommodation.  The Committee 
would also reiterate that it “currently antic ipates that, even after employment and 
inflation are near mandate-consistent leve ls, economic conditions may, for some time, 
warrant keeping the target federal funds rate  below levels the Committee views as normal 
in the longer run.”     
In characterizing current conditions and the economic ou tlook, Alternative B 
indicates that economic growth “has picked up recently, after havi ng slowed during the 
winter.”  These words aim to convey confid ence about the prospects for economic growth 
over the rest of the year while acknowledging the weakness in th e first quarter.  
Alternative C states that “ec onomic activity is picking up as the effects of unusually 
severe winter weather and othe r transitory factors fade.”  Both Alternatives B and C 
observe that household spending “appears to be rising more quickly.”  Alternative A 
expresses greater concern about the economy by  noting that growth in economic activity 
“slowed sharply” during the winter, and that  inflation continues to run “well below” 
2 percent “even though longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.”  As in

the March statement, under Alternatives A a nd B the Committee would state that “labor 
market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.”  Alternative 
C offers a somewhat stronger characterization of  the labor market, pointing, in particular, 
to “payroll employment expanding at a solid pace.”  All three of the Alternatives affirm 
the Committee’s modal forecast that, with  appropriate policy accommodation, economic 
activity will expand at a mode rate pace and labor market conditions will continue to 
improve gradually. 
Under each alternative the Committee would state that it recognizes the risks 
associated with inflation running persistently  below 2 percent and is monitoring inflation 
developments carefully.  Under Alternativ e B, no elaboration is given, while under 
Alternative A the Committee would add that it “anticipates that inflation will gradually 
return to 2 percent,” and unde r Alternative C, it would st ate that it “continues to 
anticipate that inflation will move back to ward its objective over the medium term.” 
The seventh paragraph of the March stat ement—which indicated that the revised 
forward guidance did not represent a change in the Committee’s policy intentions as set 
forth in its recent statements—is dro pped in all three alternatives.   
Subsequent pages present complete drafts of the statements and arguments for 
each alternative.

MARCH 2014 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January 
indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part 
reflecting adverse weather conditions.  Labor  market indicators were mixed but on 
balance showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, however, remains 
elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, 
while the recovery in the hous ing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining 
economic growth, although the extent of rest raint is diminishing.  Inflation has been 
running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at  a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will continue to improve gra dually, moving toward those the Committee 
judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.  The Committee recognizes 
that inflation persistently below its 2 pe rcent objective could pose risks to economic 
performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that 
inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. The Committee currently j udges that there is sufficien t underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing improveme nt in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement 
in the outlook for labor market conditions  since the inception of  the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in April, the Committee will add to its 
holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of $30 billion per m onth rather than $35 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressu re on longer-term interest rates, support 
mortgage markets, and help to make  broader financial conditions more 
accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s 
dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases 
in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a

preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent 
on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determin ing how long to maintain the current 
0 to ¼ percent target range for the fe deral funds rate, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expecte d—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  The Committee continues to  anticipate, based on its assessment of 
these factors, that it likely will be appropria te to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate for a considerable ti me after the asset purchase program ends, 
especially if projected in flation continues to run be low the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run goal, and provided that longer-t erm inflation expectations remain well 
anchored. 
6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run. 
7. With the unemployment rate nearing 6½ percent, the Committee has updated its 
forward guidance.  The change in the Committee’s guidance does not indicate any 
change in the Committee’s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.

for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.  The Committee recognizes 
that inflation persistently below its 2 pe rcent objective could pose risks to economic 
performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that 
inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. The Committee currently j udges that there is sufficien t underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing improveme nt in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement 
in the outlook for labor market conditions  since the inception of  the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in April May, the Committee will add to 
its holdings of agency mortgage-b acked securities at a pace of $25 $20 billion per 
month rather than $30 $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-
term Treasury securities at a pace of $30 $25 billion per month rather than 
$35 $30 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its  holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets,  and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic 
recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases

in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a 
preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent 
on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determin ing how long to maintain the current 
0 to ¼ percent target range for the fe deral funds rate, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expecte d—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  The Committee continues to  anticipate, based on its assessment of 
these factors, that it likely will be appropria te to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate for a considerable ti me after the asset purchase program ends, 
especially if projected inflation contin ues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run goal, and provided that longer-t erm inflation expectations remain well 
anchored.
 6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run. 
7. With the unemployment rate nearing 6½ percent, the Committee has updated its 
forward guidance.  The change in the Committee’s guidance does not indicate any 
change in the Committee’s policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January 
March  indicates that growth in economic ac tivity slowed during the winter months, 
in part reflecting adverse weather conditions is picking up as the effects of 
unusually severe winter weather and other transitory factors fade . Labor market 
indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement  with payroll 
employment expanding at a solid pace. The unemployment rate, however, remains 
elevated. Household spending appears to be rising more quickly.  and Business 
fixed investment continued continues to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained remains  slow. Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, 
although the extent of restrain t is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, but longe r-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at  a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will continue to improve gra dually, moving toward those the Committee

the pace of its asset purchases. Beginning in April May, the Committee will add to

THE CASE  FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may judge it appropriate to continue adjusting policy along its 
recent trajectory, reducing the monthly pace of  asset purchases by another $10 billion and 
issuing a postmeeting statement with very few changes, as in Alternative B.  They might 
see the information received during the inte rmeeting period as broadly confirming the 
rebound in economic growth that they anticipated when they met in March, and as again 
indicating sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing 
improvement in labor market conditions.  Policymakers, like the staff, may judge that 
part of the weakness in real activity in January and February reflected the adverse effects 
of unusually severe winter weather, and may see the available data for March as 
indicating that those e ffects have largely passed.  In pa rticular, policymakers may view 
recent readings on indicators of consumer sp ending as consistent with their expectation 
that the economic recovery woul d continue to gain strength.  And they might see a high 
likelihood that sustained employment gains, in conjunction with hi gher house and equity 
prices and diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, will support conti nued solid growth in 
consumer spending in coming quarters.   
At the same time, they may judge that considerable slack  remains in labor 
markets.  Both the share of unemployed workers who have been out of work for six months or more and the numb er of part-time workers who would prefer a full-time job 
remain elevated, and the level of labor for ce participation has stayed low.  Moreover, 
inflation continues to run below the Committee’ s 2 percent objective,  and wage increases 
remain modest.  Against this backdrop, policymakers might decide that highly 
accommodative monetary policy remains necessary in order to promote continued improvement in the labor market  and return inflation to 2 pe rcent over the medium run.  
At the same time, in light of the cumulative improvement in the labor market and their expectation that gains will co ntinue, policymakers may judge it appropriate to make a 
further gradual reduction in the pace of asset purchases while maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and the current forward guidance.  They might 
note, for example, that the paths for unempl oyment and inflation in the staff’s current 
baseline forecast (which reflect policy settings  consistent with Alternative B, including 
continued gradual reductions in the pace of  asset purchases) closely track the paths 
generated by the optimal control exerci ses summarized in the “Monetary Policy 
Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B.  Moreover, the sharp slowing of economic 
growth in the first quarter, though partly reflecting unusually  severe weather, may be 
Alternatives

seen by some participants as pointing to a le ss robust expansion of economic activity this 
year than previously anticipa ted.  Indications that the r ecovery in the housing sector 
remains slow may reinforce thei r apprehension.  Or they may be concerned that inflation 
still shows little sign of  moving back up toward 2 percent.   In either case, policymakers 
may see a sizable probability that it will beco me necessary to purchase more assets than 
envisioned in the Committee’s baseline scenario.  Even so, they may judge it premature 
to deviate from the announced baseline of fu rther measured reductions in the pace of 
asset purchases and want to wait for clearer  evidence indicating whether the economy has 
diverged from the path the Co mmittee anticipated in March.   
Alternatively, policymakers may be concer ned that continuing to buy assets and 
expand the balance sheet until the fall of this  year and maintaining near-zero rates even 
longer risks an increase in l onger-term inflation expectati ons and an undesirably large 
increase in inflation as th e economy strengthens over the medium run.  Policymakers also 
may worry that maintaining highly accommodativ e policy for such a long span could lead 
to excessive risk-taking in the financial sector.  Still, with inflation continuing to run 
below 2 percent and expected inflation showing no sign of drifting up, and with investor 
reliance on financial leverage little changed, on balance, over the past year, policymakers 
may judge that the sequence of  modest reductions in the pace of asset purchases and 
subsequent gradual rise in th e federal funds rate that mark et participants now anticipate 
will be enough to contain such risks.  And they may see the language in paragraph B.5 
that says the Committee will consider a wide range of information including readings on 
financial developments and inflation pressu res in determining how long to maintain a 
highly-accommodative stance of monetary policy as providing the Committee with sufficient flexibility to adjust policy in response to off-baseline scenarios in which their 
concerns about rising inflation or  increasing financial stability ri sks begin to be realized.   
Market participants are unlikely to be su rprised by a statement along the lines of 
Alternative B.  According to the Desk’s late st survey, all of the primary dealers expect 
the Committee to announce another $10 billion cut in the pace of asset purchases next 
week and assign an almost certain probabil ity to that outcome.  Most dealers also 
anticipate a largely unchanged statement, as ide from recognition that output growth 
weakened in the first quarter of the year mos tly because of transitory weather effects.  
Consequently, a statement like Alternative B is li kely to generate little adjustment in asset 
prices or yields.

THE CASE  FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may view the recent weakness in measures of output growth as 
largely or entirely caused by temporary factors,  and judge that there is a solid underlying 
expansion in economic activity under way that is  likely to reduce the amount of slack in 
labor markets relatively quickly.  As a result, they may worry that the risks that inflation 
will exceed the Committee’s longer-run goal ar e increasing.  Or they may be concerned 
that continuing asset purchases for as l ong as envisioned under Alternative B may pose 
some risks to financial stability.  Hence they  may see little justification for continuing 
asset purchases and perceive  the potential costs to doing so as building, tipping the 
balance of efficacy and costs in favor of a la rger cut in asset purch ases at this meeting 
and calling for ending the purchase program in  short order, as implicitly assumed under 
Alternative C.   
Weather-related disruptions aside, polic ymakers may view the strengthening in 
the pace of consumer spending, the waning of fiscal restraint, and the 180,000 average 
monthly gain in nonfarm payrolls during th e first quarter of 2014, as reasons to be 
confident that the economy a nd the labor market have sufficient momentum to continue 
making good progress towards maximum em ployment even if the Committee winds 
down asset purchases quickly.  Moreover, they  might see these developments as evidence 
that the recovery has become self-sustaini ng and that real GDP growth will soon exceed 
the growth rate of potential GDP.  In addi tion, policymakers may have concluded that the 
slower-than-anticipated recovery in output and employment over most of the past five 
years has, to a large extent, reflected a step -down in trend productiv ity growth from its 
pre-crisis value along the lines  of the “Supply Side Damage” alternative simulation in 
Tealbook, Book A.  If so, they may judge that  the level and growth  rate of potential 
output are lower than the staff estimates, and that the unemployment rate is not much above its longer-run normal level.  As a c onsequence, policymaker s may anticipate that 
inflation will move back up toward 2 percent in the near future if longer-term inflation 
expectations remain stable.  They may also be  at least somewhat concerned that inflation 
expectations could become unanchore d if the Committee continues to add 
accommodation for much longer.   
Based on the Survey of Primary Dealers,  a decision to adopt a statement like 
Alternative C would surprise market part icipants, as all dealers expect another 
$10 billion cut in the pace of asset purcha ses.  A $20 billion reduction in the pace of 
Alternatives

purchases likely would be read by investors as a signal that the Committee is moving to 
end the asset purchase program more quickly th an previously anticip ated.  Moreover, in 
combination with the solidly positive characterization of the economy in the first 
paragraph of the draft statemen t for Alternative C, a larger-than-expected cut in the pace 
of purchases would probably lead market part icipants to pull forward their forecasts of 
the date at which the Committee will first increa se its target for the federal funds rate, and 
perhaps to anticipate a steeper  path for the funds rate on ce policy firming begins.  In 
response, longer-term real intere st rates likely would rise, equity prices and inflation 
compensation fall, and the dollar appreciate.  If, however, a statement along the lines of 
Alternative C led investors to become mo re positive and more confident about the 
economic outlook, equity prices might not decline, but medium- and long-term interest 
rates could rise by more. 
THE CASE  FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Though unusually severe winter weather and very weak readings on exports likely 
accounted for much of the first-quarter wea kness in economic activity, policymakers may 
view recent data as raising doubts that the anticipated rebound in economic growth will 
return the economy to the trajectory that wa s expected prior to th e winter months.  In 
particular, taking into account the disappoi nting news on the housing market and the 
modest growth in business investment spending, they may worry that the economy will 
remain on an unacceptably slow recovery  path.  Although policymakers may be 
encouraged by the continuing rise in private payroll employment in recent months, they 
might remain skeptical that significant gain s in employment can be sustained in the 
absence of a broader pickup in economic activit y, and they may see an appreciable risk of 
an outcome such as that in the “Weaker Household Demand” alte rnative scenario in 
Tealbook, Book A.  All told, policymakers may have become somewhat less confident in 
their earlier judgment that the und erlying strength in the economy is sufficient to support 
ongoing improvement in labor market conditions a nd to return inflati on to 2 percent over 
the medium run.  If so, they may want to ma intain the current pace of asset purchases and 
await additional information regarding the economic outlook before deciding on their 
next step, as in Alternative A. 
Moreover, policymakers may see the be havior of inflation, which has run 
consistently below the Committee’s longer-run ob jective for the past two years and is not 
clearly moving back toward 2 percent, as re inforcing their view that a relatively near-

term end to the asset purchase program coul d prove premature. Participants may judge 
not only that the modal outlook for inflation is  unsatisfactory but also  that downside risks 
to the outlook remain substa ntial enough to be a concern.  Some policymakers may be 
particularly concerned about the possibility that persis tently low inflation could 
eventually produce lower longer-run infla tion expectations, resulting in mutually-
reinforcing downward dynamics for inflation and economic activity, as suggested by the 
“Low Inflation” alternative simulation in Tealbook, Book A.  If so, they may see a 
statement like that in Alterna tive A as desirable because it not only maintains the current 
pace of asset purchases but also explicitly in troduces an inflation floor that is expressed 
in terms of projected infl ation between one and two y ears ahead, signaling that the 
federal funds rate target will not be increas ed before inflation over that timeframe is 
projected to be back at its mandate-consistent  level.  They may view such a floor as 
appropriate in order to strengt hen the credibility of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation 
target and create additional downward pressure  on longer-term real interest rates, thus 
helping to ensure that the economic recovery  gains traction and that inflation moves up 
toward the Committee’s longer-run goal.  
An announcement like Alternative A would co me as a considerable surprise to 
market participants.  Investors likely would mark up their expectations for total asset 
purchases and push back the date of the first hike in the federal funds rate, perhaps by a 
considerable amount.  Therefore, longer-term real interest  rates likely would decline, 
inflation compensation and equity prices mi ght rise, and the dollar could depreciate.  
However, if investors read the statement in  Alternative A as reflecting a more downbeat 
assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation, equity prices might not rise 
or could even decline, and inflation compensation could fa ll.  In addition, introducing a 
significant change in the forward guidance la nguage so soon after th e substantial changes 
to the forward guidance in Ma rch could confuse investors an d increase the volatility of 
asset prices.

The directive for Alternative A instructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional agency mortgage-backed securities  at a pace of about $25 billion per month 
and to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $30 billion 
per month.  The draft directiv e for Alternative B instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of a bout $20 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $25 billion per month, beginning in 
May.  The draft directive fo r Alternative C instructs the Desk to purchase agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of a bout $15 billion per month, and to purchase 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of  about $20 billion per month, also beginning 
in May.  All three of the draft directives direct  the Desk to maintain the current policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-back ed securities and of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities in to new issues.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet that 
correspond to Alternatives A, B, and C.  Th e pace, ending date, and cumulative amount 
of asset purchases differ across the three alternatives.  Projections under each scenario are 
based on the staff’s assumptions about the trajectory of various components of the 
balance sheet and the balance sheet normalization strategy.1  The projections assume that 
when the time comes to begin normalizing th e balance sheet, the SOMA portfolio will 
shrink only through redemptions of  Treasury securities and ag ency debt and paydowns of 
principal from agency MBS; consistent with the strategy outlined in the press conference 
statement following the June 2013 FOMC meeting, no sales of agency MBS are included. 
For the balance sheet scen ario that corresponds to Alternative B, monthly 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS continue to be reduced by 
$5 billion each following each FOMC meeti ng until purchases wind down to zero early in 
the fourth quarter of 2014.  Under this a ssumption, which is the same as the policy 
assumption in the staff baseline forecast presented in Tealbook, Book A, purchases total a 
bit less than $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014, unchanged from Alternative B and the staff 
forecast in the March Tealbook. 
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” under 
the purchase program assumed for Alternative B, total assets would peak at about 
$4.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2015, with $2.4 trillion in Treasury securities holdings 
and $1.7 trillion in agency MBS holdings.2  We assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in the second quarter of 2015, consistent with the staff forecast and 
unchanged from Alternative B of the Marc h Tealbook.  At the time of liftoff, all 
reinvestments and rollovers of securities ar e assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio

here can be referenced in the appendix of the December 2013 Tealbook, Book B. 
2 Total assets peak after the end of the purchase  program because of delayed settlement of agency 
MBS purchases.

begins to contract.3,4  The size of the portfolio is norm alized by late 2021, as in the March 
Tealbook.5  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA holdings 
essentially matching the growth of currency in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank 
capital. Total assets are $2.5 trillion at the end of 2025, with about $645 billion in agency 
MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications of balance 
sheet developments for Federal Reserve income.  Under Alternative B, interest income 
rises while purchases are ongoing, and subsequently  declines for a number of years as the 
SOMA portfolio contracts through redempti ons and paydowns of principal.  Although 
interest expense is quite small in the near term, interest expense climbs when the federal funds rate rises while reserve balances are still quite elevated.  As a result, Federal 
Reserve remittances to the Treasury remain robust in the near term but then decline 
markedly over the period from 2016 to 2018; nevertheless, remittances are projected to remain positive over the enti re projection period.  Annual remittances peak at about 
$100 billion this year and trough at about $15 bi llion later in the decade, and no deferred 
asset is recorded.
6  The Federal Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 
2025 are about $950 billion, well above the level th at would have been observed in the 
absence of the asset pu rchase programs.   
3 Temporary reserve draining tools—reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) and term deposits— 
are not modeled in any of the scenarios presented, although the projections do assume that RRPs associated 
with foreign official and international accounts will remain around $100 billion throu ghout the forecast 
period.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a 
decline in reserve balances and a corresponding in crease in reverse repurchase agreements or term 
deposits—but would not produce an overall ch ange in the size of the balance sheet. 
4 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of April 18, 2014. 
5 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve 
capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of 
the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be 
necessary to conduct monetary policy in the long run; cu rrently, we assume that level of reserve balances to 
be $25 billion, about where these balances stood prio r to the crisis.  However, ongoing regulatory and 
structural changes could lead to a higher or lower demand for reserve balances in the new steady state.  A 
higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, imply an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet.  In addition, if the Committ ee selected a different operating regime for monetary 
policy than was used prior to the crisis, the new normal size of the balance sheet could potentially be larger 
than it was prior to the crisis.  
6 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  
In this Tealbook, none of the alternatives results in a deferred asset.

The unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA  portfolio is importantly influenced 
by the level of interest rates.  The staff estimates that the portfolio was in an unrealized 
gain position of about $15 billi on as of the end of March 2014.7  Reflecting the assumed 
rise in interest rate s over the projection period, the positi on under Alternative B shifts to 
an unrealized loss in the near term and reaches a peak unrealized loss of about 
$360 billion at year-end 2017.  The unrealized  loss position narrows through the 
remainder of the forecast period as securities mature and new securities are added at par. 
Under Alternative C, the monthly pace of purchases of longer-term Treasury 
securities and agency MBS are both reduced  by $10 billion beginning in May.  Purchases 
are assumed to wind down to zero in the third quarter of 2014.8  Under this scenario, 
purchases total about $1.4 tr illion over 2013 and 2014, and tota l assets peak at about 
$4.4 trillion by the fourth quarter of 2014.  The fe deral funds rate is assumed to lift off in 
late 2014, at which time reinvestment of prin cipal from maturing or  prepaying securities 
ends and redemptions begin.  The size of the balance sheet is normalized roughly one 
quarter earlier than under Alternative B, in  the third quarter of 2021.  Federal Reserve 
remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain positive throughout the projection 
period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 to 2025 are 
slightly lower than under Alternative B. 
Under the scenario for Alternative A, the current pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities and agency MBS is maintain ed in the near term and then is reduced 
gradually, with purchases ending in early 2015.9  Under these assumptions, purchases 
total about $1.6 trillion from 2013 to 2015.  In this scenario, total assets increase to a 
peak of about $4.7 trillion in the first quarter  of 2015.  The first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is assumed to occur in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public with a la g in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly 
Financial Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .  
8 The assumption that purchases will end by mid-2014  is consistent with a view that there is a 
concerted underlying expansion in economic activity under way that is likely to reduce the amount of slack 
in labor markets more quickly than in the staff forecast or that the level of  potential output is lower than the 
current staff estimate.  It is also consistent with a vi ew that there is little justification for continuing asset 
purchases or that the potential costs of doing so are building. 
9 Compared with the baseline, the later end to asset purchases is consistent with policymakers 
having become somewhat less confident in their earlier judgment regarding the extent of underlying 
strength in the economy being sufficient to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and to return inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.

expectation that inflation one to two years ah ead will be projected to be below 2 percent 
until this time.  All reinvestments are assumed to cease at the time of the first increase in 
the federal funds rate, and the SOMA portfolio then begins to  contract.  The size of the 
portfolio is normalized about two quarters la ter than under the scen ario corresponding to 
Alternative B, reflecting the larger amount  of asset purchases  and later end of 
reinvestment.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain 
positive over the entire projection period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are slight ly higher than under Alternative B. 
As shown in the exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the 10-Year Treasury Term 
Premium Effect,” under Alterna tive B, the effect of the Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
increase in asset holdings on th e term premium in 10-year yields in the second quarter of 
2014 is negative 122 basis points, about the sa me as under Alternative B in the March 
Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the projectio n period, the term premium effect declines 
slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated nor malization of the portfolio.  
Under Alternative C, the second quarter of 2014 term premium effect is negative 
117 basis points.  The effect is less nega tive than under Alternative B because fewer 
securities are purchased than under Alternative B and the balan ce sheet begins to contract 
sooner.  Under Alternative A, the term premiu m effect is about negative 134 basis points 
in the current quarter.  The effect is more negative than under Alternative B because more 
securities are purchased and the balance sheet begins to  contract later than under 
Alternative B. 
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases and th e timing of the liftoff of the federal funds 
rate, although the level of reserve balances is  also contingent on th e evolution of other 
balance sheet items.  Reserve balances p eak at about $3.0 trillion in late 2014 under 
Alternative B and at about $2.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2014 under Alternative C.  
Under Alternative A, reserve balances peak at around $3.1 tr illion in early 2015.  
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the Monetary Base,” 
under the scenario corresponding to Alterna tive B, the monetary base increases on 
balance through the middle of 2015 because th e purchase program is accompanied by an 
increase in reserve balances.  Once the norma lization process begins, the monetary base 
shrinks, on net, through 2021, primarily becau se redemptions of securities cause

corresponding reductions in reserve balanc es.  Starting around mid-2022, after reserve 
balances are assumed to have stabilized at  $25 billion, the monetary base begins to 
expand in line with the growth of currency in  circulation.  Because  the contours of the 
balance sheet are similar across the alternatives, the growth rates of the monetary base 
under Alternatives C and A are broadly similar to those under Alternative B.10 
10 The projections for the monetary base depend critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  If, for example, the FOMC employs reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits 
extensively during normalization, the projected level of reserve balances and the monetary base could 
decline quite markedly in the out years.

After expanding significantly faster than  nominal GDP for several years, M2 is 
projected to increase at about the same rate as nominal GDP throughout the remainder of 
this year and then to contract modestly in 2015 and 2016.  This pattern results primarily 
from the assumed increase in the target federa l funds rate over the forecast period and the 
associated rise in the opport unity cost of holding M2.  In addition, the staff assumes that 
investors will shift their portfo lios away from the safe and liquid assets in M2 toward 
riskier non-M2 assets as the economic recovery progresses.11 
11 Projections for the monetary aggregates are based on the historical relationship between the 
aggregates, interest rates, and nominal GDP.  These projections are consistent with interest rates and 
nominal GDP in the Tealbook forecast but do not account for the specifics  of the normalization process. 
The monetary aggregates could be affected by to ols that the Federal Reserve employs during the 
normalization period, although the size and direction of the effects are difficult to judge.  For example, if 
the ON RRP rate was raised close to the interest ra te on excess reserves, money funds could pay higher 
returns than those available on bank deposits.  As  a result, cash managers could reallocate from bank 
deposits to institutional money market fund shares an d thus decrease M2. In these projections, we do not 
take account of such effects. Quarterly
