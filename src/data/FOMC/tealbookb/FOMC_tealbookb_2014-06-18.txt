The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federal funds rate from six different policy rules: 
the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, the iner tial Taylor (1999) rule, the 
outcome-based rule, the first-difference rule , and the nominal income targeting rule.1 
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline proj ections for real activity and 
inflation in the near term, and they incorpor ate the staff’s new, lower, estimate of the 
long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate.2  (Medium-term prescr iptions derived from 
dynamic simulations of the rules are discus sed below.)  As shown in the left-hand 
columns, five of the six rules prescribe a federal funds rate above ¼ percent by year-end.  
Specifically, the Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome -based rule, and the first-difference rule 
prescribe increases in the federal funds rate  to values between ½ and ¾ percent in the 
third quarter and to about 1¼ percent in th e fourth quarter.  The Taylor (1993) rule, 
which places considerably less weight on the ou tput gap than the othe r rules, calls for a 
federal funds rate near 1¾ percent in the thir d quarter and slightly above 2 percent in the 
fourth quarter.  The inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule prescribes on ly a very small increase in 
the federal funds rate over the next two quarter s to a little above the current target range.  
The nominal income targeting rule prescrib es keeping the federal funds rate at its 
effective lower bound over the next two quarters. 
The right-hand columns display the rules’ near-term prescriptions in the absence 
of the lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.3  Most of the rules call for an 
immediate increase in the federal funds rate, so the lower-bound is not a binding 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the six rules. 
2 As detailed in the box “Changes to the Longer-Run Outlook” in Tealbook, Book A, the staff has 
revised its estimate of the long-run value of the r eal federal funds rate from 2 percent to 1¾ percent, 
reflecting its new assessment that the long-run growth rate of the economy is 2 percent compared to its 
previous estimate of 2¼ percent.  To facilitate comp arison, new values of the intercepts of rules, where 
applicable, have been applied to both to the “Current Tealbook” and “Previous Tealbook outlook” numbers 
displayed in the exhibit.  For example, the intercept terms of Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules are now 
1¾ rather than 2. 
3 Four of the rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the first-difference 
rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—place substantial weight on  the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed last quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table may be indirectly affected by the 
presence of the effective lower bound.

constraint.  The only exception is the nominal  income targeting rule, which calls for 
negative policy rates in the near term when the constraint is not imposed.  This more 
accommodative prescription arises because th e rule responds not only to the staff’s 
estimates of the output gap and inflation in th e current quarter but also to the cumulative 
shortfall of inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective since the end 
of 2007. 
In general, the current versions of th e simple rules prescribe somewhat higher 
policy rates in the near term  under the current staff forecast than under the previous 
Tealbook forecast, primarily reflecting the st aff’s projection of a narrower output gap 
than in the April Tealbook.  As the lower-lef t panel of the exhibit shows, the staff’s 
downward revisions to potentia l output growth in 2014 and 2015 have led to a modestly 
narrower output gap in 2015 and 2016, after wh ich real GDP rises a bout 1 percent above 
potential in 2017 compared with ¾ percent in  April.  The staff’ s projection for core 
inflation, shown in the lower-right panel of the exhibit, is largely unchanged in the near 
term; the medium-term path for inflation is s lightly below the path projected in April, 
reflecting the staff’s reassessment of where the inflation rate would settle in the absence 
of economic slack if the current level of  long-run inflation expectations were 
maintained.4 
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model after 
adjusting it to reproduce the staff’s baseline forecast.  The estimated r* corresponds to 
the real federal funds rate th at would, if maintained, retu rn output to potential in 
12 quarters.  The estimated r* , at about –0.6 percent, is modestly higher than in April 
because of the staff’s downward revisions to potential output growth and the consequent 
narrowing in the projected output gap, and it is about 0.4 percentage points higher than 
the actual real federal funds rate. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model.5  These simulations reflect the e ndogenous responses of inflation and 
4 A detailed explanation of the reassessment is  provided in the memo “Why is Inflation 
Persistently Low in the Judgmental Forecast?” by Deb Lindner, which was sent to the Committee on 
June 4, 2014.  This reasse ssment has been incorporated into the dy namic simulations of the policy rules.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation. This choice

the output gap when the federal funds rate  follows the paths implied by the different 
policy rules, under the assumption that the federal funds rate is subject to an effective 
lower bound of 12½ basis points.6  For these simulations, no attempt is made to capture 
the Committee’s forward guidance, reaffirmed in April, that “it likely will be appropriate 
to maintain the current target range for the fe deral funds rate for a considerable time after 
the asset purchase program ends.”   Alternative policy rule si mulations that take account 
of this guidance are discussed below.  Each rule is applied under the assumptions that 
financial market participants as well as pr ice- and wage-setters believe that the FOMC 
will follow that rule, and that agents fully  understand and anticipate the implications of 
the rule for future real activit y, inflation, and interest rates. 
The second exhibit also displays the imp lications of following the baseline policy 
assumptions adopted in this Tealbook.  In forming the Tealbook baseline, the staff 
assumed that the federal funds rate would remain at the effective lower bound for two 
quarters after the end of the asset purchase program and then follow the prescriptions of 
the inertial Taylor (1999) rule .  As in April, the first rate  hike under the baseline policy 
occurs in the second quarter of 2015.  Ther eafter, the federal funds rate gradually 
increases over the next few years, reaching 2 percent in the second half of 2016 and 4 percent in 2019.  Even though the projected output gap is now narrower over the near-
term, the trajectory of the federal funds rate  under the Tealbook baseline is somewhat 
lower than in April, reflecting the staff’s revi sions to the long-run real federal funds rate 
and the medium-term path for inflation. 
Four of the rules—the Taylor (1993), Taylor (1999), outcome-based, and first-
difference rules—call for policy tightening to have begun already by the third quarter of 
this year and are associated w ith real federal funds rate paths that lie significantly above 
the corresponding path in the Tealbook baseli ne over the next few years, leading to 
higher unemployment rates over that period.  Nonetheless, these four rules produce paths for inflation that are similar to the Tealbook baseline because of the low sensitivity of 
inflation to slack in the FRB/US model.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule calls for a more 
would settle in the absence of economic slack if the cu rrent level of long-run inflation expectations were 
maintained. 
6 The policy rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  For the current program, the simulations embed the 
assumption that purchases of longer-term Treasury s ecurities and agency MBS will conclude before the end 
of this year, with cumulative purchases since the start of 2013 close to $1.5 trillion.

gradual tightening commencing in the fourth quarter; its prescripti ons for the federal 
funds rate are nearly identical to th ose under the Tealbook ba seline from 2017 onward 
and result in very similar macroeconomic out comes.  Only the nominal income targeting 
rule implies a later inception of tightening than assumed in  the Tealbook baseline.  This 
rule keeps the federal funds rate within th e Committee’s current target range until the 
second quarter of 2016 and generates a real federa l funds rate that runs  persistently below 
the baseline path for the rest of the decade, thereby leadi ng to stronger real activity.  
Under this rule, inflation is closer to  the Committee’s objective than the Tealbook 
baseline through 2017 and runs almost ¼ perc entage point above this objective for 
several years thereafter. 
The results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to that rule in the future 
and that the private sector fully understands  the policy that will be pursued and its 
implications for real activity and inflation.  These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targeting rule, which generates outcomes in which unemployment runs markedly below the natu ral rate, even after inflation has moved 
above the Committee’s longer-run goal. 
As noted above, the policy rules in the si mulations do not take into account the 
Committee’s forward guidance, and most of these rules involve departures from the 
effective lower bound that occur about three quarters  earlier than the date suggested by 
recent FOMC communications.  The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations with an 
Unemployment Rate Threshold,” reports result s obtained when each policy rule is subject 
to an unemployment rate threshold of 5.8 percent.  The th reshold captures the 
Committee’s guidance—most recently expressed in its April statement—“that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target  range for the federal funds rate for a 
considerable time after the asset purchase pr ogram ends” in a data-dependent manner.  A 
value of 5.8 percent was chosen because in the Tealbook baseline, the unemployment rate 
crosses that level in the quarter before firming begins.
7  The same unemployment rate 
threshold is also adopted in most of the alternative scenarios shown in the Risk and 
Uncertainties section of Tealbook, Book A.  Fina ncial market particip ants and price- and 
7 The unemployment rate threshold used in April was 6.0 percent because that was the value of the 
unemployment rate immediately before the federal funds rate left the effective lo wer bound in the baseline 
projection.  The threshold was lowered to 5.8 percent for consistency with the current staff outlook for both 
the federal funds rate and the unemployment rate.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit keep the federal funds rate at an effective lower bound of 12½ basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is 5.8 percent or more. Thereafter, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified rule. A value of 5.8 percent was chosen because in the Tealbook baseline the unemployment rate crosses that level just before firming begins. In addition, the simulations are based on rules that respond to core inflation.

wage-setters are assumed to understand that the Committee will switch  to the specified 
rule in the quarter following the observation of  an unemployment rate of 5.8 percent, and 
to view this switch as permanent and fully credible. 
For all of the rules except the nominal income targeting rule, imposing the 
unemployment rate threshold resu lts in the federal funds rate  leaving the effective lower 
bound in the same quarter as in the T ealbook baseline—the second quarter of 2015.  
However, the delayed departure from the effective lower bound typically has small 
macroeconomic effects because the longer-te rm real rates that influence economic 
activity in the FRB/US model are not apprec iably altered by imposing the unemployment 
rate threshold.  Only for the first-differen ce rule does the thres hold imply significantly 
different outcomes.  For this rule, imposing the unemployment rate threshold lowers the 
path of interest rates over the subsequent few years and re sults in lower longer-term real 
rates, higher inflation, and a lower path fo r the unemployment ra te than otherwise. 
The fourth exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy,” compares optimal control 
simulations derived using this Tealbook’s base line forecast with those reported in April.8 
Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the unemployment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  The optimal control concept presented here corresponds to a 
commitment policy under which policymakers make decisions today that effectively 
constrain policy choices  in future periods. 
Unlike in the previous Tealbook, the e ffective lower bound no longer imposes a 
binding constraint for the federal funds rate path under optimal control.  The policy rate 
under optimal control rises above the Committee’s current target range in the fourth 
quarter of this year, two quart ers earlier than the optimal c ontrol path in April, largely 
reflecting the lower degree of product and labo r market slack in the staff projection, and 
two quarters earlier than the T ealbook baseline.  An important  reason that optimal control 
8 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 6.  The “current Tealbook” optimal control policy simulation also reflects the staff’s 
revision to the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate and the staff’s reassessment of where the 
inflation rate would settle in the absence of econom ic slack if the current level of long-run inflation 
expectations were maintained, while no adjustments for these changes are made to the “previous Tealbook” 
simulation of optimal control.  The simulated policies do not incorporate the unemployment rate threshold.

policy departs from the effective lower bound before the Tealbook baseline policy is the 
presence of a penalty on changes in the fede ral funds rate in the policymakers’ objective 
function.9  While the optimal control policy is  a little less accommodative than the 
baseline policy through 2020, the optimal contro l policy is a bit more  stimulative over the 
subsequent several years (not shown).  Thes e differences are sufficiently small, however, 
that the paths of the unemployment rate and inflation are broadly similar under both 
policies.   
The optimal control policy discussed a bove corresponds to a commitment policy 
under which policymakers make choices today th at effectively constrain policy choices in 
future periods.  The fifth exhibit, “Optimal Control Policy: Commit ment vs. Discretion,” 
displays results that use an alternativ e optimality concept—discretion—under which 
policymakers cannot credibly commit to carryin g out a plan that requires them to make 
future choices that would be suboptimal at future times.  The discretion concept limits 
policymakers’ ability to influence private-sect or expectations regard ing the federal funds 
rate and other variables.  Instead, the private sector knows that future Committees will 
always reoptimize without regard for policymakers’ past promises. 
The prescribed path for the federal funds rate under discretion is very similar to 
the Tealbook baseline path, resulting in n early identical macroeconomic outcomes.  
Under discretion, the macroeconomic outco mes are also similar to those under 
commitment, mostly because in current circ umstances the effective lower bound is not a 
significant constraint on policy.  These outco mes under discretion are achieved through 
an initially more accommodative policy than under commitment, as the federal funds rate 
leaves the lower bound a little la ter and remains lower until the second half of 2021.  For 
several years thereafter (not shown), policy is less stimula tive under discretion than under 
commitment because of the inability to commit to low interest rates very far in the future.   
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes unde r Alternative Policies” and “Outcomes 
under Alternative Policies with an Unemployment Rate Threshold,” tabulate the simulation results for key variables under each of the policy rules described above. 
9 The staff has included such a penalty in larg e part because it helps to keep the simulated 
variation and persistence of the federal funds rate close to their observed historical estimates.  An objective 
function with a substantially smaller interest-rate sm oothing term would imply a federal funds rate path 
under optimal policy that would still remain constrained by the effective lower bound for a time, but 
increase more steeply thereafter.

Appendix
POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  [math] denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead [math] the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  as well as its one-quarter-ahead  forecast  [math] , and the forecast  
of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the output  gap [math] . The value  of 
policymakers'  long-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  n*, is 2 percent.  The nominal  income  
targeting  rule responds  to the nominal  income  gap, which  is defined  as the difference  between 
nominal  income  [math] (100 times  the log of the level of nominal  GDP)  and a target  value  [math] 
(100 times  the log of target  nominal  GDP). Target  nominal  GDP in 2007:Q4  is set equal  to the 
staff's  current  estimate  of potential  real GDP in that quarter  multiplied  by the GDP deflator  in 
that quarter;  subsequently,  target  nominal  GDP  grows  2 percentage  points  per year  faster  than the 
staff's  estimate  of potential  GDP.

The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in recent  analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
outcome-based  rule uses policy  reactions  estimated  using  real-time  data over  the sample  
1988:Q1 -2006:Q4. The intercept  of the outcome-based  rule was chosen  so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent  long-run  inflation  objective  and a long-run  real interest  rate of 1 3/4 percent,  a 
value  used in the FRB/US  model. 2 The intercepts  of the Taylor  (1993,  1999)  rules and the long-
1 See Erceg  and others  (2012).
2 For the June  2014  Tealbook,  the staff revised  the long-run  value  of the real interest  rate from  2 
percent  to 1% percent.  The FRB/US  model,  as well as the intercepts  of the different  policy  rules,  have  been  
adjusted  to reflect  this change.

run intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule ar e set at 1¾ percent for the same reason.  The 1¾ 
percent real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.  
The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do no t depend on the level of the output gap or the 
long-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).  
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a 
right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same  lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s 
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.   This estimate depends on a very broad array 
of economic factors, some of which take the fo rm of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables.  The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, which 
is generated after the paths of e xogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they 
match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the outpu t gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the 
extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three policy alte rnatives—labeled A, B, and C—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  With respect to balance sheet policy, Alternative B reduces 
monthly purchases of agency MBS and Treasur y securities by anot her $5 billion each and 
signals that further reductions  of that size are likely at  future meetings.  Under 
Alternative C, the Committee would reduce purchases of agency MBS and Treasury 
securities by $10 billion each and indicate that  the pace of purchases is likely to be 
reduced further.  Under Altern ative A, the Committee would maintain the current pace of 
asset purchases “while awa iting further information concerning the economic outlook, 
labor market conditions, and inflation.” 
All of the alternatives retain the Ap ril statement’s forward guidance for the 
federal funds rate.  Alternative A adds an inflation floor, under which the Committee 
would maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate “at least as long as 
inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent, provided 
that longer-term inflation expectations re main well anchored.”  Moreover, under each 
alternative, the Committee would repeat its intention to take  a “balanced approach” when 
it begins to remove policy accommodation.  The Committee would also reiterate that it 
“currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, fo r some time, warrant keeping the target 
federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.”     
In characterizing current conditions and the economic ou tlook, Alternative B 
indicates that growth in economic activity  “has rebounded in recent months,” without 
explicit reference to the decline in output dur ing the first quarter or to adverse weather 
conditions during the winter.  Alternativ e B also observes th at household spending 
“appears to be rising moderately,” and reta ins the language on housing from April that 
“the recovery in the housing sector remained sl ow.”  Alternative C parses the recent data 
similarly to Alternative B, except that it is more positive on business fixed investment, 
saying it “accelerated.”  Alternative A offers  a less upbeat characte rization of the data, 
noting that economic activity “declined earlier in the year ,” even while acknowledging 
that it “has picked up in recent months.”  Alternative A is also less sanguine about the 
housing market, stating “the recovery in  the housing sector slowed further.”

Alternative B differs significantly from th e April statement with regard to labor 
market conditions, dropping the depiction of relevant data as “mixed” in favor of a 
statement saying that “labor market indicat ors generally showed further improvement,” 
and noting that “the unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated.”  Alternative A 
retains more of April's characterization of labor market news, saying “indicators were 
mixed but generally showed further improve ment.”  Alternative C offers a more 
expansive summary of labor market conditions, consistent with the idea, first introduced 
in the March statement, that the Committ ee “will take into account a wide range of 
information.”  The text of Alternative C in cludes: “Payroll employment has strengthened 
and the unemployment rate has declined, but these and other measur es, taken together, 
indicate that [substantial] underutiliz ation of labor resources remains.”  
The references to inflation in Alternative B are unchanged from April, stating that 
“inflation has been running below the Committ ee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term 
inflation expectations have remained stab le.”  Alternative A adds an element of 
dissatisfaction to this descri ption, arguing that inflation “co ntinues to run well below” 
target “even though” long-term inflation expect ations have been stab le.  Alternative C 
simply says that inflation “appears to be moving gradually toward” 2 percent. 
All three of the Alternatives affirm the Committee’s modal forecast that, with 
appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and 
labor market conditions will continue to im prove gradually.  Under each alternative the 
Committee would state that it recognizes the risks associ ated with inflation running 
persistently below 2 percent and is monito ring inflation developments carefully for 
evidence that inflation will move back toward 2 percent.  Alternative A notes that “The Committee anticipates that inflation will re turn to 2 percent, but only gradually.” 
Alternative C is more optimistic, indicating th at inflation “will continue to move back 
toward” the Committee’s objective. 
Subsequent pages present complete drafts of the statements and arguments for 
each alternative.

APRIL FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed 
sharply during the winter in part becaus e of adverse weathe r conditions.  Labor 
market indicators were mixed but on ba lance showed further improvement.  The 
unemployment rate, however, remains elevat ed.  Household spending appears to be 
rising more quickly.  Business fixed investment edged dow n, while the recovery in 
the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal  policy is restraining economic growth, 
although the extent of restrain t is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective, but longe r-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at  a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will continue to improve gra dually, moving toward those the Committee 
judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook 
for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes 
that inflation persistently below its 2 pe rcent objective could pose risks to economic 
performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that 
inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. The Committee currently j udges that there is sufficien t underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing improveme nt in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement 
in the outlook for labor market conditions  since the inception of  the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in May, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of $25 billion per m onth rather than $30 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressu re on longer-term interest rates, support 
mortgage markets, and help to make  broader financial conditions more 
accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s 
dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases 
Alternatives

in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a 
preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent 
on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ 
percent target range for the federal funds  rate, the Committee will assess progress— 
both realized and expected—toward its obj ectives of maximum employment and 2 
percent inflation.  This asse ssment will take into account a wide range of information, 
including measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and 
inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessmen t of these factors, that it likely will be 
appropriate to maintain the current target  range for the federal funds rate for a 
considerable time after the asset purchase  program ends, especially if projected 
inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and 
provided that longer-term inflation e xpectations remain well anchored. 
6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

fluctuations in economic growth in recen t quarters and the resulting increase in 
uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the 
current pace of its asset purchases while awaiting further information 
concerning the economic outlook, labor mark et conditions, and inflation.  Thus, 
the Committee will continue to  add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed 
securities at a pace of $20 billion per m onth rather than $25 billion per month, and 
will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasur y securities at a p ace of $25 billion per 
month rather than $30 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing 
policy of reinvesting principal payments from  its holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets,  and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic 
recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate.

below 2 percent,  provided that longer-term infl ation expectations remain well 
anchored.

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March April 
indicates that growth in ec onomic activity has picked up rebounded in  recently 
months , after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse 
weather conditions.  Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance generally 
showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, however though lower , 
remains elevated.  Household spending appears to be rising more quickly.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee may judge it appropriate to maintain its recent pattern of adjusting 
policy by reducing the monthly pace of asse t purchases another $10 billion and issuing a 
postmeeting statement with very few changes, as in Alternative B.  They might see the 
information received during the interm eeting period as confirming the rebound in 
economic growth that they anti cipated when they met in Ap ril, and as indicating that 
there continues to be sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support 
ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  Policymakers may judge that the bulk 
of the weakness in real activity  observed early in the year re flected transitory phenomena, 
including unusually severe winter weathe r and may see the more recent data as 
suggesting that those effects ha ve largely or entirely passed.  In particular, policymakers 
may view recent indicators of consumer spending and business fixed investment as consistent with their earlier  expectation that the econom ic recovery would regain 
momentum during the current quarter.  And they might see a high likelihood that 
sustained employment gains, in conjunction with higher hou se and equity prices and 
diminishing restraint from fiscal policy, will support continued solid growth in private domestic final purchases in coming quarters.   
At the same time, policymakers may judge  that considerable slack remains in 
labor markets.  The unemployment rate, while having come down in recent months, remains appreciably above the upper bound of the central tendency of participants’ 
projections for the unemployment rate in the long run.  In addition, policymakers may regard the recent large decline in the labor force participati on rate, the still-high share of 
unemployed workers who have been out of work  for six months or more, and the elevated 
number of part-time workers who would prefer a full-time job as supporting the judgment 
that there is still considerable slack in labor  markets.  Moreover, inflation continues to 
run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective and policymakers may agree with the 
staff’s assessment that inflation is likely to move toward 2 percent only slowly, 
particularly given that evidence showing inflation moving back up remains sparse. 
Policymakers might also observe that the pa ths for unemployment and inflation in the 
staff’s current baseline forecast (which reflects policy settings consistent with Alternative 
B, including continued gradual reductions in the pace of asset purchases) are quite similar 
to the paths generated by the optimal cont rol exercises summarized in the “Monetary 
Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B.  Accordingly, they might decide that a 
highly accommodative monetary  policy remains appropriate  in order to promote 
Alternatives   
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

continued improvement in the labor market and return inflation to 2 percent over the 
medium run.  Nonetheless, given the cumu lative improvement in the labor market and 
their expectation that progress toward thei r objectives will conti nue, policymakers may 
judge it appropriate to make another measur ed reduction in the pace of asset purchases, 
while maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and the current 
forward guidance.     
Some policymakers may read the econo mic news since April as providing 
insufficient assurance that a lasting bounce back from the first quarter’s weakness is 
underway and thus may be inclined to halt, for a time, reductions in the pace of asset 
purchases.  However, those same policymaker s might conclude that, given how strong a 
signal a deviation from the announced baseline for asset purchases would send, it would 
be risky to pause the taper in the absen ce of additional eviden ce indicating that the 
economy is diverging substantially from the path the Committee anticipated in April. 
Other policymakers may be concerned th at continuing to buy assets and expand 
the balance sheet until the fall of this y ear, and maintaining near-zero rates for a 
considerably longer period, risk s an increase in longer-term in flation expectations and an 
undesirably large increase in in flation as the economy strengthens over the medium run.  
Policymakers also may point to the low levels  of actual and expe cted volatility in 
financial markets and worry that maintaining highly accommodative policy for such a 
long span could lead to excessi ve risk-taking in the financia l sector.  Still, inflation 
continues to run below 2 per cent, expected inflation s hows no sign of drifting up, and 
indicators of leverage and reliance on s hort-term wholesale funding in the financial 
system remain well below pre-crisis levels, so policymakers may judge that the sequence 
of modest reductions in the pace of asset pur chases and subsequent gradual rise in the 
federal funds rate that market participants now anticipate will be enough to contain 
inflation and financial market risks.  They may also see the language in paragraph B.5 
that says the Committee will consider a wide range of information including readings on 
financial developments and inflation pressu res in determining how long to maintain a 
highly accommodative stance of monetary policy as providing the Committee with 
sufficient flexibility to adjust policy in response to off-baseline scenarios in which their 
concerns about inflation or  financial stability risks begin to be realized.   
Market participants are unlikely to be su rprised by a statement along the lines of 
Alternative B.  According to the Desk’s late st survey, all 22 of th e primary dealers, and 
Alternatives   
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Authorized for Public Release
all but one of the 27 buy-side respondents, expect the Committee to announce another 
$10 billion cut in the pace of asset purchases ne xt week and are nearly certain that will be 
the outcome.  Most dealers also anticipate a largely unchanged statement, though with a somewhat more positive characterization of current economic growth or labor market 
conditions.  Dealers expect the SEP to show declines in FOMC participants’ projections 
of both GDP growth in 2014 and the unemplo yment rate, and some dealers predict a 
modest upward revision in participants’ infl ation forecast for this year.  All told, a 
statement like Alternative B is likely to generate little adjustment in asse t prices or yields.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may be convinced that the recent weakness in measures of output 
growth was entirely caused by temporary factors and judge that there is a solid 
underlying expansion in economic activity unde r way—an expansion that is likely to 
reduce the amount of slack in labor markets relatively quickl y.  Moreover, they may think 
that the unemployment rate, while still high relativ e to its likely longe r-run equilibrium 
level, is high because of labor market fricti ons that are unlikely to diminish quickly and 
so may see little labor market slack currently.  They might also consider the recent uptick 
in inflation as more consequential than doe s the staff, increasing their confidence that 
inflation is likely to move back toward 2 percent in a reasonably timely fashion.  In 
addition, they may worry that, given the cu rrent trajectory for policy, the risks are 
increasing that inflation will eventually exc eed the Committee’s longer-run goal.  Or they 
may view high stock market valuations, low credit spreads, and very low levels of implied volatility, as suggesting that continuing asset purchases for as long as envisioned 
under Alternative B could pose ri sks to financial stability.  Hence they may see little 
justification for continuing asse t purchases and perceive the potential costs of doing so as 
building, tipping the balance of efficacy and co sts in favor of a larger cut in asset 
purchases and an early end to the purchase program, as under Alternative C.   
Policymakers may view the post-winter strengthening in the pace of consumer 
spending, the waning of fiscal restraint,  and the 230,000 average monthly gain in 
nonfarm private payrolls over the last three mo nths as reasons to be confident that the 
economy and the labor market have suffici ent momentum to maintain good progress 
towards maximum employment, even if the Committee quickly winds down asset 
purchases.  Moreover, they might see this momentum as making it likely that real GDP 
will approach potential in relatively short or der, particularly given the further downward 
Alternatives   
 
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

adjustment to potential output growth adopted  in the staff forecast.  Their confidence in 
this view might be buttressed to the extent  that they subscribe to the even more 
pessimistic outlook for potential output exemplified by the “No Room to Grow” 
alternative simulation in Tealbook, Book A.  As a consequence, policymakers may 
anticipate that inflation will move back up toward 2 percent fairly quickly and be 
concerned that inflation expectations could become unanchored if the Committee 
continues to maintain accommodation for much longer.  For all of these reasons, 
policymakers may see an early transition to  a less accommodative stance of monetary 
policy as an attractive option.  
Based on the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and buy-side firms, a 
decision to adopt a statement like Alternative C would surprise market participants, as all 
dealers and all buy-side respondents but one expe ct another $10 billion cut in the pace of 
asset purchases.  A $20 billion reduction in the pace of purchases likely would be read by 
investors as a signal that the Committee is moving to taper the asset purchase program 
more quickly, and end it sooner, than previ ously anticipated.  In combination with the 
solidly positive characterization of the ec onomy in the first paragraph of the draft 
statement for Alternative C, a larger-than-e xpected cut in the pace of purchases would 
probably lead market participants to pull forw ard their forecasts of the date on which the 
Committee will first increase its target for the federal funds rate, and perhaps also lead 
them to anticipate a steeper path for the funds rate once policy firming begins.  In 
response, longer-term real intere st rates likely would rise, equity prices and inflation 
compensation fall, and the dollar appreciate.  However, to the extent that the statement 
instead leads investors to become more pos itive and more confid ent about the economic 
outlook, equity prices and in flation compensation would likely decline less than 
otherwise while medium- and longer-term in terest rates would rise more.  Finally, 
adopting Alternative C could increase market  participants’ uncertainty regarding the 
Committee’s reaction function and thereby increase fina ncial market volatility. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Though temporary factors likely accounted for much of the decline in economic 
activity during the winter, the sequence of downward revision s to first-quarter GDP may 
raise doubts that the current rebound in ec onomic growth will persist; moreover, 
policymakers might note that average growth in the first half will likely be sub-par even with a substantial rebound in the second qua rter.  Taking into account the string of 
Alternatives   
 
 
 
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
June 12, 2014
Page 33 of 54
Authorized for Public Release
disappointing data on the pace of activity in th e housing market and readings on inflation 
that have continued to run consistently  below the Committee’s longer-run objective, 
participants may judge that ending the asset pu rchase program later th is year could prove 
premature, especially if they  fear that the Committee would consider resuming purchases 
only if the unemployment rate were trending up.  Although policymakers may be 
encouraged by the continuing rise in private payroll employment in recent months, they 
might remain skeptical that significant gain s in employment can be sustained in the 
absence of a broader pickup in economic activ ity, or they may see the low and declining 
labor force participation rate as indicative of weaker underlying labor market conditions 
than is evident from the unemployment rate and payroll employment figures.  
Policymakers might also observe that, while the prescribed path for federal funds rate in 
the staff’s current baseline forecast is quite similar to the path in the optimal control 
exercise summarized in the “Monetary Policy  Strategies” section of the Tealbook, those 
paths essentially ignore any labor market condi tions that are not cap tured by the deviation 
of the unemployment rate from the natural ra te.  For any of these reasons, participants 
may believe that it would be appropriate to  adopt a more accommodative stance of policy 
than market participants currently anticipate, as in Alternative A.     
Some policymakers may also regard th e outlook as less certain than they 
previously thought and may be less confident that there is sufficient underlying strength 
in the economy to support ongoing improvement in  labor market condit ions and to return 
inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.  For example, they may see an appreciable 
risk of an outcome such as that in the “W eaker Household Demand” alternative scenario 
in Tealbook, Book A.  Such policymaker s would presumably find Alternative A 
particularly appealing. 
In addition, participants may share the staff’s revised assessment that inflation is 
not likely to return to the Committee’s longer-run objective fo r a long time, absent easier 
monetary conditions than are shown in the Tealbook baseline, and they may judge not 
only that the modal outlook for inflation is uns atisfactory but also that downside risks to 
that outlook remain substantial enough to be a concern.  Some policymakers may be 
particularly concerned about the possibility that pe rsistently low infl ation could produce 
lower longer-run inflation e xpectations, resulting in mu tually-reinforcing downward 
dynamics for inflation and economic activity, as suggested by the “Low Inflation” 
alternative simulation in Tealbook, Book A.  If so, they may see a statement like that in 
Alternative A as desirable because it not only maintains the current pace of asset 
Alternatives   
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

purchases but also explicitly introduces an infl ation floor.  They may view such a floor as 
appropriate in order to strengt hen the credibility of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation 
target and create additional downward pressure  on longer-term real interest rates, thus 
helping to ensure that the economic recovery  gains traction and that inflation moves up 
toward the Committee’s longer-run goal.  
An announcement like Alternative A would co me as a considerable surprise to 
market participants.  Investors likely would mark up their expectations for total asset 
purchases and push back the date of the first hike in the federal funds rate, perhaps by a 
considerable amount, with a flattening of th e expected path for the federal funds rate 
thereafter also likely.  Therefore, longer-ter m real interest rates likely would decline, 
inflation compensation and equity prices mi ght rise, and the dollar could depreciate.  
However, to the extent that investors read the statement in Alternative A as reflecting a 
more downbeat assessment of the outlook fo r economic growth and inflation, equity 
prices would not rise as much or could ev en decline, and inflation compensation would 
likely fall.  As with Altern ative C, the announcement of Alternative A could engender 
greater uncertainty on the part of market pa rticipants regarding the Committee’s reaction 
function and thereby increase financial market volatility

followed by drafts for a June directive th at correspond to each of the three policy 
alternatives.  Each draft in cludes changes to make it consistent with th e corresponding 
postmeeting statement.   
The directive for Alternative A instructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $25 billion per month and to 
continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of  about $20 billion per 
month.  The draft directive for Alternative B instructs the Desk to purchase longer-term 
Treasury securities at a pace of about $20 b illion per month, beginning in July, and to 
purchase agency mortgage-back ed securities at a pace of about $15 billion per month.  
The draft directive for Alternative C instruct s the Desk to purchase longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of about $15 billion pe r month, also beginning in July, and to 
purchase agency mortgage-back ed securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month.  
All three of the draft directives direct th e Desk to maintain the current policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-back ed securities and of rolling over maturing 
Treasury securities in to new issues.

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks 
monetary and financial cond itions that will foster ma ximum employment and price 
stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks c onditions in reserve markets consistent with 
federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to 
undertake open market operations as necessary  to maintain such conditions.  Beginning 
in May, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasur y securities at a pace of 
about $25 billion per month and to purchase ag ency mortgage-backed securities at a pace 
of about $20 billion per month.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar 
roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary  to facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities  transactions.  The Committee directs the 
Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues 
and its policy of reinvesting pr incipal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-back ed securities.  The System Open Market 
Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, 
corresponding to Alternatives A, B, and C.  The pace, ending date, and cumulative 
amount of asset purchases differ across the three alternatives.  Projections under each 
scenario are based on the staff’s assumptions about the trajectory of various components 
of the balance sheet and the ba lance sheet normalization strategy.1  The projections 
assume that when the time comes to begin normalizing the size of th e balance sheet, the 
SOMA portfolio will shrink only through redemptions of Treasury securities and agency debt and through paydowns of principal from agency MBS; consistent with the discussion in the minutes of the June 2013 FOMC meeting, no sales of agency MBS are 
included. 
For the balance sheet scen ario that corresponds to Alternative B, monthly 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS continue to be reduced by 
$5 billion each following each FOMC meeti ng until purchases wind down to zero in the 
fourth quarter of 2014.  Under this assu mption, which is the same as the policy 
assumption in the staff baseline forecast pr esented in Tealbook A, purchases total a bit 
less than $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014, an am ount that is unchanged from Alternative 
B and the staff forecast in the April Tealbook. 
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” under 
the purchase program assumed for Alternative B, total assets would peak at about $4.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2015, with $2.5 trillion in Treasury securities holdings 
and $1.7 trillion in agency MBS holdings.
2  We assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in the second quarter of 2015, consistent with the staff forecast and 
unchanged from Alternative B of the Apr il Tealbook.  At the time of liftoff, all 
reinvestments and rollovers of securities ar e assumed to cease, and the SOMA portfolio 
1 Further information on the assumptions regard ing asset and liability categories not discussed 
here can be referenced in the appendix of the Decembe r 2013 Tealbook, Book B.  Of note, this round, we 
have increased the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be necessary to conduct monetary policy in 
the long run from $25 billion to $100 billion.  (See footnote 5 for a discussion.)   
2 Total assets peak after the end of the purchase  program because of delayed settlement of agency 
MBS purchases.

begins to contract.3,4  The size of the portfolio is no rmalized by the third quarter of 2021, 
one quarter earlier than a ssumed in the April Tealbook.5  The balance sheet then begins to 
expand, with increases in SOMA holdings esse ntially matching the growth of currency in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital. Total assets are $2.5 tr illion at the end of 
2025, with about $610 billion in agency MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications of balance 
sheet developments for Federal Reserve income.  Under Alternative B, interest income 
rises while purchases are ongoing;  it subsequently declines for a number of years as the 
SOMA portfolio contracts through redempti ons and paydowns of principal.  Although 
interest expense is quite small in the near term, interest expense climbs when the federal funds rate increases a nd reserve balances are still quite elevated.
6  As a result, Federal 
Reserve remittances to the Treasury remain robust in the near term but then decline 
markedly over the period from 2016 to 2018; nevertheless, remittances are projected to remain positive over the entire  projection period.  Annual rem ittances peak at about $95 
3 Temporary reserve draining tools—reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) and term deposits— 
are not modeled in any of the scenarios presented, although the projections do assume that the use of 
overnight RRPs will wind down from current levels to ze ro in the first quarter of 2015 and term deposits 
are zero for the projection period.  Use of these tools would result in a shift in the composition of Federal 
Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase 
agreements or term deposits—but would not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet.  
The projections also assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts will 
remain around $110 billion throughout the fo recast period.  For a discussion of the possible effects of the 
use of reserve draining tools on Federal Reserve income and remittances, see the staff memo to the FOMC, “Income Projections Associated with Alternativ e Normalization Scenarios,” June 4, 2014.  
4 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of June 6, 2014. 
5 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve 
capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of 
the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be 
necessary to conduct monetary policy in the long run.  In this Tealbook, we revised up our assumption of 
the steady-state level of reserve balances from $25 b illion to $100 billion, reflecting the staff’s assessment 
that required reserve balances will likely be higher at that time based on the historical relationship between 
required reserves and economic activity and because of  the effects of the payment of interest on reserve 
balances on the demand for such balances.  A $100 billion steady-state level of reserve balances could be 
consistent with different operating regimes for monetary policy, including either a floor system or a 
corridor system.  The earlier projected date of normalization in the current Tealbook relative to the previous 
Tealbook owes mostly to this revision to th e assumed longer-run level of reserve balances. 
6 For the projection period, we assume the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances equals the 
federal funds rate.

billion in 2015 and trough at about $20 bill ion in 2018, and no deferred asset is recorded.7 
The Federal Reserve’s cumulative remitta nces from 2009 through 2025 are about $950 
billion, well above the level that would have been observed in the absence of the asset 
purchase programs.   
The unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA  portfolio is influenced importantly 
by the level of interest rates.  The staff estimates that the portfolio was in an unrealized 
gain position of about $100 bill ion as of the end of May 2014.8  Reflecting the assumed 
rise in interest rates over the projection period, the position—under Alternative B—shifts 
to an unrealized loss in the near term a nd reaches a peak unrealized loss of about $300 
billion at the end of 2017.  The unrealized loss position narrows through the remainder of 
the forecast period, as securities mature and new securities ar e added to the portfolio at 
par. 
Under Alternative C, the monthly pace of purchases of longer-term Treasury 
securities and agency MBS are both redu ced by $10 billion in July; subsequently, 
purchases cease in August, bringing the program to a close.9  Under this scenario, 
purchases total about $1.4 tr illion over 2013 and 2014, and tota l assets peak at about $4.4 
trillion at the end of 2014.  The federal funds rate is assumed to lift off in late 2014, at 
which time reinvestment of principal from maturing or prepaying securities ends and 
redemptions begin.  The size of the balance sh eet is normalized in the first half of 2021, 
roughly one quarter earlier than under Alternative B.  Federal Reserve remittances to the 
Treasury are projected to remain positive throughout the projection period, and no 
deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative rem ittances from 2009 to 2025 are slightly lower 
than under the projectio n for Alternative B. 
7 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  
In this Tealbook, none of the alternatives results in a deferred asset. 
8 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public with a la g in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly 
Financial Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .  
9 The assumption that purchases will end this summer is consistent with a view that there is a solid 
underlying expansion in economic activity under way, which is likely to reduce the amount of slack in labor markets more quickly than in the staff forecast or that inflation is likely to move back toward 2 
percent more rapidly.  It is also consistent with a view that there is little benefit from continuing asset 
purchases or that the potential costs of such purchases are relatively high.

Under the scenario for Alternative A, the current pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities and agency MBS is maintain ed in the near term and then is reduced 
gradually, with purchases ending in early 2015.10  Under these assumptions, purchases 
total about $1.6 trillion from 2013 to 2015.  In this  scenario, total assets rise to a peak of 
about $4.6 trillion in the first quarter of 2015.  The first incr ease in the target federal 
funds rate is assumed to occur in the f ourth quarter of 2016, consistent with the 
expectation that inflation one to two years ah ead will be projected to be below 2 percent 
until this time.  All reinvestments are assumed to cease at the time of the first increase in 
the federal funds rate, and the SOMA portfolio then begins to  contract.  The size of the 
portfolio is normalized nearly a year late r than under the scen ario corresponding to 
Alternative B, reflecting the larger amount of asset purchases and the later end of 
reinvestment.  Federal Reserve remittances to the Treasury are projected to remain 
positive over the entire projection period, and no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are slight ly higher than under the projection for 
Alternative B. 
As shown in the exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the 10-Year Treasury Term 
Premium Effect,” under Alterna tive B, the effect of the Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
increase in asset holdings on the term prem ium embedded in the 10- year Treasury yield 
in the second quarter of 2014 is negative 121 basis points, about the same as under 
Alternative B in the April Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the projection period, the 
term premium effect converges slowly toward  zero, reflecting the ac tual and anticipated 
normalization of the portfolio.  Under Altern ative C, the term premium effect in the 
second quarter of 2014 is negative 117 basis point s.  In absolute terms, the effect is 
smaller than under Alternative B because fewer securities are purchased than under 
Alternative B, and the balance sheet begins to contract sooner.  Under Alternative A, the 
term premium effect is negative 138 basis points in the current quarter.  In absolute 
terms, the effect is larger than under Altern ative B because more s ecurities are purchased, 
and the balance sheet begins to cont ract later than under Alternative B. 
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
10 Compared with the baseline, the later end to asset purchases is consistent with a view that the 
downside risks to the economic outlook are more pro nounced than previously thought, raising questions 
about whether there is suffi cient underlying strength in the economy to support ongoing improvement in 
labor market conditions and to return inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.

magnitude of assumed asset purchases and th e timing of the liftoff of the federal funds 
rate; importantly, the level of reserve balances is also contingent on the evolution of other 
balance sheet items.  Reserve balances p eak at about $3.0 trillion early in the second 
quarter of 2015 under Alternative B and at abou t $2.9 trillion in the first quarter of 2015 
under Alternative C.  Under A lternative A, reserve balances  peak at around $3.1 trillion 
in the second quarter of 2015.  
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the Monetary Base,” 
under the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base increases, on 
balance, through the middle of 2015 because the purchase program is accompanied by an 
increase in reserve balances.  Once the norma lization process begins, the monetary base 
shrinks, on net, through 2021, primarily becau se redemptions of securities cause 
corresponding reductions in reserve balanc es.  Starting around mid-2022, after reserve 
balances are assumed to have stabilized at $100 billion, the monetary base begins to 
expand in line with the growth of currency in  circulation.  Because  the contours of the 
balance sheet are similar across the alternatives, the growth rates of the monetary base 
under Alternatives C and A are broadly similar to those under Alternative B.11 
11 The projections for the monetary base depend critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  If, for example, the FOMC employs reverse repurchase agreements or term deposits 
extensively during normalization, the projected level of reserve balances and the monetary base could 
decline quite markedly in the out years of the projection.

MONEY 
In recent years, M2 has grown consider ably faster than would be anticipated 
based on its historical relati onship with nominal GDP and the opportunity cost of holding 
money.  In part, the elevated level of M2 ma y reflect strong investor  demand for safe and 
liquid assets in the wake of the financial crisis and during the long economic recovery.  
Over the forecast period, the staff projects that M2 growth will slow markedly relative to 
its pace in recent years.12  In part, the projected decelera tion in M2 reflects an assumption 
that investors will reallocate a portion of their elevated M2 balances to riskier 
investments as the economic recovery progres ses; however, the timing and magnitude of 
this unwind is highly uncertai n.  In addition, the increase in the opportunity cost of 
holding M2 balances that occurs due to the projected tightening of monetary policy acts 
as an additional restraint on M2 growth in 2015 and 2016.13 
12 Since the last Tealbook, the staff’s money demand models have been reestimated using data 
over a more recent time period (1994:Q3 to 2007:Q2); however, the contour of the projected path for M2 
growth is broadly similar to that implied by the models prior to the reestimation. 
13 The three-month Treasury bill rate is assumed to begin rising in 2015:Q1, causing M2 
opportunity cost to rise one quarter earlier than the projected increase in the federal funds rate. Quarterly
