The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federal funds rate from six different policy rules: 
the Taylor (1993) rule, the Ta ylor (1999) rule, an  inertial version of the Taylor (1999) 
rule, an outcome-based rule, a first-differen ce rule, and a nominal income targeting rule.1  
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline proj ections for real activity and 
inflation in the near term.  (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations 
of the rules are discussed below.)  As shown in the left-hand columns, the Taylor (1993) 
rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, th e outcome-based rule, and the first-difference rule all call 
for significant increases in the federal funds ra te this quarter and ne xt.  In contrast, the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes smalle r increases in the federal funds rate, to a 
value just above ½ percent for the fourth qua rter.  The nominal income targeting rule 
continues to call for keeping the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound over the 
near term. 
The right-hand columns display the near-t erm prescriptions of the rules in the 
absence of the lower-bound constraint on the federal funds rate.2  In five of the six cases, 
the lower-bound constraint is not binding:  On ly the nominal income targeting rule calls 
for negative policy rates in th e near term.  This more accommodative prescription arises 
because the rule responds not only to the sta ff’s estimates of the output gap and inflation 
in the current quarter but also to the cumulative shortfall of inflation from the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective since the end of 2007—currently this 
cumulative shortfall is about 3¼ percent. 
The nominal income targeting rule aside, all of the simple rules call for somewhat 
higher policy rates in the near term than under the prev ious Tealbook forecast, reflecting 
the staff’s projections of somewhat higher resource utilization and slightly higher 
inflation than in the June Tealbook.  The revisi ons in the output gap projections, shown in 
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the six rules. 
2 Four of the rules—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the outcome-based rule, the first-difference 
rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—place substantial weight on  the lagged federal funds rate.  
Because the rule prescriptions are conditioned on th e actual level of the nominal federal funds rate 
observed last quarter, the unconstrained prescriptions shown in the table may be indirectly affected by the 
presence of the effective lower bound.

  the lower-left panel of the exhibit, reflect the staff’s view that the better-than-anticipated 
labor market data received over the intermeeting period are more informative about resource utilization than the surprisingly weak data for real GDP in the first half of this 
year.  The staff now anticipates that the output gap will close by mid-2015, three quarters 
earlier than projected in the June Tealbook.  The output gap is expected to peak at about 
1½ percent of potential GDP in mid-2017 and then decline to  less than ½ percent in 2020.  
Reflecting these projections of higher resource utilization, the staff’s forecast for core inflation, shown in the lower-right panel of th e exhibit, converges to 2 percent in 2018, 
several years earlier than in the June Tealbook. 
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model after 
adjusting it to reproduce the staff’s baseline fo recast.  This measure is an estimate of the 
real federal funds rate that would, if maintaine d, return output to potential in 12 quarters.  
The estimated r*, at –0.29 percent,  is about 25 basis points above the current quarter 
estimate as of the June Tealbook, reflecting the staff’s projection of higher resource 
utilization, and is about 1 pe rcentage point above the actu al real federal funds rate. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulations reflect the endogenous responses of inflation and the outpu t gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, under the assumption that the federal 
funds rate is subject to an effective lower bound of 12½ basis points.
3  The exhibit also 
displays the implications of following the baseline policy assumpti ons adopted in this 
Tealbook.  In forming the Tealbook baseline for ecast, the staff assumed that the federal 
funds rate would remain at its effective lo wer bound for two quarters after the end of the 
asset purchase program and then follow the prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule.  The two-quarter lag be tween the assumed end of a sset purchases and the first 
increase in the baseline path for the fede ral funds rate is intended to reflect the 
Committee’s view, reaffirmed in its June statement, that “it likely will be appropriate to 
maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.”  As in June , the first rate hike under the baseline policy 
                                                 
3 The policy rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  For the current program, the simulations embed the 
assumption that purchases of longer-term Treasury s ecurities and agency MBS will conclude in October, 
with cumulative purchases since the start of 2013 close to $1.5 trillion.

  occurs in the second quarter of 2015.  Ther eafter, the federal funds rate gradually 
increases over the next few years, reaching 2 percent in the fi rst half of 2016 and 
4 percent in 2018.  The baseline trajectory of the federal funds rate after mid-2015 is 
somewhat higher than in June, reflecting increas ed resource utilization and slightly higher 
inflation over the medium term.  In contra st to the Tealbook baseline, the simulations 
employing the six policy rules make no attempt to account for the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the timing of liftoff.  (Policy rule simulati ons that take account of this 
guidance are discussed further below.)   
With no constraint on the timing of liftoff,  five of the rules—the Taylor (1993), 
Taylor (1999), inertial Taylor (1999), outco me-based, and first-diffe rence rules—call for 
policy tightening to begin immediately.  Except for the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, each 
of these rules is associated w ith a real federal funds rate path that lies significantly above 
the baseline over the next few years, lead ing to higher unemployment rates over that 
period.  Reflecting the low sensitivity of infl ation to slack in the FRB/US model, the 
inflation paths produced by these four rules ar e similar to those in the Tealbook baseline.  
The inertial Taylor (1999) rule calls for ti ghtening to commence three quarters earlier 
than in the Tealbook baseline, but its prescrip tion for the federal funds rate from 2017 
onward is nearly identical to that under the Tealbook baseline  and thus results in very 
similar macroeconomic outcomes.  Only the no minal income targeting rule implies a later 
commencement of tightening than assumed in the Tealbook baseline.  This rule keeps the 
federal funds rate within the Committee’s curr ent target range until the fourth quarter of 
2015 and generates a real federal funds rate that runs persistently below the baseline path 
for the rest of the decade, thereby leading to  stronger real activ ity.  Under this rule, 
inflation is closer to th e Committee’s objective than in  the Tealbook baseline through 
2017 but runs almost ¼ percentage point above this objective for several years thereafter, 
as the rule seeks to compensate for the cumu lative shortfall of inflation from 2 percent 
since the end of 2007. 
The results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to that rule in the future and that the private sector fully understands  the policy that will be pursued and its 
implications for real activity and inflation.  These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targeting rule, which generates outcomes in which unemployment runs markedly below the natural rate even after inflation has moved above 
the Committee’s longer-run goal.

  As previously noted, the policy rules in  the simulations summarized above do not 
take into account the Committee’s forward guidance, and all but one of these rules 
involve departures from the effective lower bound that occur about three quarters earlier 
than the interpretation of recent FOMC comm unications in the staff’s projection.  The 
third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations with an Unemployment Rate Threshold,” reports results obtained when each policy rule is subj ect to an unemployment rate threshold that 
is intended to capture the Committee’s “considerable time” guidance in a data-dependent manner.  A value of 5.6 percent was chosen for the unemployment rate threshold because, in the Tealbook baseline, the unemploym ent rate crosses that level in the quarter 
before firming begins.
4  This is the same unemployment ra te threshold that is adopted in 
the alternative scenarios shown in the Ri sks and Uncertainty s ection of Tealbook, Book 
A.  Financial market participants and price-  and wage-setters are assumed to understand 
that the Committee will switch to the specified rule in the quarter following the crossing 
of the threshold, and to view this sw itch as permanent and fully credible. 
Imposing the unemployment threshold affect s all of the rules except the nominal 
income targeting rule; for the other five rules, the first increase in the federal funds rate is 
delayed by three quarters and occurs in the second quarter of 2015, the same as in the 
Tealbook baseline.  For most rules, the dela yed departure from the effective lower bound 
has small macroeconomic effects because th e longer-term real ra tes that influence 
economic activity in the FRB/US model are not  appreciably altered.  Only for the first-
difference rule does the threshold impl y significantly different outcomes for 
unemployment and inflation.  Imposing the unemployment rate threshold on the first-
difference rule induces a policy path that  is more accommodative than the Tealbook 
baseline after mid-2017, producing a trajectory for inflation that  is consistently higher 
than the baseline path and a trajectory for unemployment that eventually falls below the baseline projection. 
The fourth exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy,” compares optimal control 
simulations derived using this Tealbook’s base line forecast with those reported in June.
5  
Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE inflation 
                                                 
4 For the same reason, the unemployment rate threshold used in June was 5.8 percent. 
5 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 3.  These simulated policies do not incorporate the unemployment rate threshold (see 
the discussion below).

  close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping the unemployment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  The optimal control concept presented here corresponds to a 
commitment policy under which policymakers make decisions today that effectively 
constrain policy choices  in future periods. 
The effective lower bound no longer imposes  a binding constraint for the federal 
funds rate path under optimal control, gi ven our assumptions about policymakers’ 
preferences.  The policy rate under optimal control rises above the Committee’s current target range in the third quarter  of this year, one quarter ea rlier than the optimal control 
path in the June Tealbook, and the real fe deral funds rate thro ugh 2020 averages about 
75 basis points higher than in June, largely reflecting the higher degree of resource 
utilization in the staff proj ection.  The optimal control po licy is also less accommodative 
than the Tealbook baseline policy, as the fede ral funds rate departs from the effective 
lower bound three quarters earlier and thereafter the real federal funds rate remains between 50 and 100 basis points higher than th e Tealbook baseline for about five years.  
As a result, there is a less pronounced decline in the unemploymen t rate—with a smaller 
and briefer undershooting of the staff’s esti mate of the natural rate—under the optimal 
control policy than in the baseline policy.  The inflation path unde r the optimal control 
policy, however, is similar to the baseline pat h, reflecting the low sensitivity of inflation 
to slack in the FRB/US model. 
The fact that the optimal control polic y departs from the effective lower bound 
immediately reflects several important assump tions underlying the simulation.  First, in 
the loss function underlying the op timal control exercise, there is a substantial penalty on 
changes in the federal funds rate; optimal policy with less weight  on changes in the 
federal funds rate would imply a later departure date coupled with a steeper subsequent 
path.
6  Second, the objective function for optimal  control applies symmetric penalties to 
deviations of the unemployment rate in either  direction from the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate.  By contrast, the Committee may be prepared to attach lower marginal cost to deviations to the low side of the natural rate.  Third, the Committee may see the unemployment gap as understating the exte nt of the current miss on the “maximum 
employment” leg of its mandate.  To the ex tent that other dimensions of the labor 
                                                 
6 The staff has included such a penalty in larg e part because it helps to keep the simulated 
variation and persistence of the federal funds rate close to their observed historical estimates.

  market—such as the substantial fraction of th e labor force that is working part-time but 
would prefer full-time work, or the atypically low labor force participation rate—are seen 
as indicative of greater slack than sugg ested by the unemployment gap, the Committee 
may be prepared to tolerate lower readings on the unemployment rate itself.   
A fourth distinction between  these optimal control simulations and the conditions 
under which the Tealbook baseline is derived is that optimal control, as it is constructed 
here, does not take into account the Comm ittee’s previous comm unications indicating 
that the current target range for the federa l funds rate will likely be maintained for a 
“considerable time” after the end of the asse t purchase program, and the present-day 
effects of those communications on expectations and asset prices.  To the extent that 
economic conditions have evolved roughly as an ticipated, policymakers may prefer to let 
policy continue to follow this guidance.  The fifth exhibit, “Optimal Control Policy With 
Forward Guidance Regarding Liftoff,” explores  the effects of constraining the optimal 
control policy to be consiste nt with the Committee’s forw ard guidance by requiring that 
the federal funds rate in the optimal contro l simulation depart from the effective lower 
bound at the same time as in the Tealbook base line.  Imposing the delayed departure on 
optimal control leads to a path for the policy rate that begins  to increase above the current 
target range in the second quarter of 2015, but th en rises more rapidly than in the case of 
optimal control policy without forward guidance.   As a result, both pol icies generate very 
similar outcomes for the unemployment rate a nd inflation despite the difference in their 
departure dates from the effective lower bound.   
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes unde r Alternative Policies” and “Outcomes 
under Alternative Policies with an Unemployment Rate Threshold,” tabulate the 
simulation results for key variables under each of the policy rules described above.

  Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies.”  In the table, 	ܴ௧ denotes the effective nominal fe deral funds rate for quarter t, 
while the right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate 
for the current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast ( gap t and gap t+1|t), and the forecast 
of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of 
policymakers’ long-run inflation objective, denoted π*, is 2 percent.  The nominal income 
targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between 
nominal income ݊ݕ௧ (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ݊ݕ௧∗  
(100 times the log of target nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in 
that quarter; subsequently, target nominal GDP grow s 2 percentage points per year faster than the 
staff’s estimate of potential GDP.  
 The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prom inently in recent analysis by Board staff.
1  The 
outcome-based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 
1988:Q12006:Q4.  The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 1¾ percent, a 
value used in the FRB/US model.  The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules and the long-
run intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule ar e set at 1¾ percent for the same reason.  The 1¾ 
percent real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.

 The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do no t depend on the level of the output gap or the 
long-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).   
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a 
right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same  lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

 ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s 
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.   This estimate depends on a very broad array 
of economic factors, some of which take the fo rm of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables.  The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, which 
is generated after the paths of e xogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they 
match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the outpu t gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the 
extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three alternative FOMC statements—labeled A, B, and 
C—for the Committee’s consideration.  These al ternatives offer options for policy along 
with several possibilities for updating the Committee’s characterization of incoming 
information and the outlook.   
With respect to balance sheet policy, Alternative B redu ces monthly purchases of 
agency MBS and Treasury securities by anothe r $5 billion each and again signals that 
similar reductions are likely at future meeti ngs, consistent with the indication in the June 
minutes that purchases were expected to end in October.  Alternative C reduces purchases 
of agency MBS and Treasury securities by $10 billion each and states that purchases are 
likely to end in September.  Alternative A maintains the current pace of asset purchases 
while the Committee is “assessing incoming information that bears on the outlook for 
economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.” 
Alternative B retains the J une statement’s forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate, indicating that the current range for the federal funds rate will likely remain in place 
“for a considerable time after the asset purch ase program ends.” Alternative C replaces 
“for a considerable time” with “for some time.”  Alternative A adds to the current 
guidance an inflation floor, under which the Committee would maintain the current target 
range for the federal funds rate “at least as  long as inflation between one and two years 
ahead is projected to be below 2 percent, pr ovided that longer-term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored.”  Under each alternativ e, the Committee would repeat its intention 
to take a “balanced approach” when it be gins to remove policy accommodation.  The 
Committee would also reiterate that it “currently  anticipates that, even after employment 
and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some 
time, warrant keeping the targ et federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as 
normal in the longer run.” 
In characterizing current economic conditi ons, Alternatives B and C state that 
economic growth “rebounded in the second qua rter” and that “labor market conditions 
improved, with the unemployment rate declini ng further.”  Alternative A is less upbeat, 
noting that output growth “was modest, on average, in the first half of the year” and 
“labor market indicators generally showed fu rther improvement.”  A ll three alternatives

  reaffirm the assessment contained in the J une statement that household spending appears 
to be rising moderately, busin ess fixed investment is adva ncing, and the housing recovery 
remains slow.  The alternatives also ac knowledge the recent increase in inflation 
readings.  Alternatives B and C state that  inflation has moved “somewhat closer” and 
“closer,” respectively, to the Committee’s l onger-run objective.  A lternative A instead 
remarks that, while inflation “has moved up somewhat,” it “has continued to run below” 
2 percent.  There is some risk that the second-quarter NIPA estimates and the 
accompanying revisions to the historical da ta—both of which will be released on the 
morning of the second day of next week’s  FOMC meeting—will lead policymakers to 
conclude that the first paragraph of each of the draft statements  should be revised.  
In conveying participants’ views of the amount of slack in labor markets, the 
alternatives reduce the FOMC statement’s emphasis on the unemplo yment rate by citing 
a larger set of labor market indicators, consistent with th e notion, first introduced in the 
March statement, that the Committee takes into account “a wide range of information” in 
assessing progress toward its mandated objectiv es.  Alternative B notes that “a range of 
labor market indicators sugge sts that there remains signifi cant underutilization of labor 
resources.”  Alternative C uses the same wording as Altern ative B but replaces 
“significant underutilization”  with “some underutilization.”   Alternative A points to 
“considerable underutilization,”  citing—in addition to the unemployment rate—the 
elevated number of part-time workers and the atypically-low labor force participation rate 
in support of the characterization. 
The alternatives reaffirm the Committee’ s modal forecast that, with appropriate 
policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor 
market indicators will move toward levels “the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.”  Alternatives B and C also expre ss the Committee’s expectation that inflation 
will move back toward 2 percent; moreover, A lternatives B and C describe the risk of 
inflation lingering below 2 pe rcent as having “diminished somewhat” and “diminished,” 
respectively.  Alternative A instead retains the sentence from the June statement 
declaring that “inflation persistently belo w its 2 percent objectiv e could pose risks to 
economic performance.” 
Subsequent pages present complete drafts of the alternative statements followed 
by supporting arguments and then draft directives.

  JUNE FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April 
indicates that growth in economic activity has rebounded in recent months.  Labor 
market indicators generally showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately 
and business fixed investment resumed its advance, while the recovery in the housing 
sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is  restraining economic growth, although the 
extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the Committee’s longer-run objective, but longer-term infla tion expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at  a moderate pace and labor market 
conditions will continue to improve gra dually, moving toward those the Committee 
judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as ne arly balanced.  The Committee recognizes 
that inflation persistently below its 2 pe rcent objective could pose risks to economic 
performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that 
inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term. 
3. The Committee currently j udges that there is sufficien t underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing improve ment in labor market conditions. In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement 
in the outlook for labor market conditions  since the inception of  the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in July, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securi ties at a pace of $15 billion per month 
rather than $20 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury 
securities at a pace of $20 billion per m onth rather than $25 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressu re on longer-term interest rates, support 
mortgage markets, and help to make  broader financial conditions more 
accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s 
dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases 
in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a 
preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent

  on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federa l funds rate, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expecte d—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  The Committee continues to  anticipate, based on its assessment of 
these factors, that it likely will be appropria te to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate for a considerable ti me after the asset purchase program ends, 
especially if projected in flation continues to run be low the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run goal, and provided that longer-t erm inflation expectations remain well 
anchored. 
6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

recent months the first half of the year.  Labor market indicators generally showed 
further improvement in recent months .  The unemployment rate, though lower, 
remains elevated  above levels the Committee sees  as normal in the longer run .  
Moreover, the fraction of the labor force that is working part-time but would 
prefer full-time work remains elevated, and labor force participation is 
atypically low, indicating that there is still considerable underutilization of labor 
resources.   Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed

principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage-backed secu rities and of rolling over maturing Treasury

term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates,

  agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of 
ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases 
in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a 
preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent 
on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federa l funds rate, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expecte d—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  The Committee continues to  anticipate, based on its assessment of 
these factors, that it likely will be appropria te to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate for a considerable ti me after the asset purchase program ends, 
especially if projected inflation contin ues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent

anchored.

inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

  FOMC  STATEMENT —J ULY 2014  ALTERNATIVE C 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April June  
indicates that growth in economic ac tivity has rebounded in recent months the second 
quarter .  Labor market indicators generall y showed further improvement.  The 
unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated. conditions improved, with the 
unemployment rate declining further .  However, a range of labor market 
indicators suggests that there remains some  underutilization of labor resources.  
Household spending appears to be rising m oderately and business fixed investment 
resumed its advance is advancing , while the recovery in th e housing sector remained 
remains  slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of 
restraint is diminishing.  Infl ation has been running below moved closer to  the 
Committee’s longer-run objective. but  Longe r-term inflation expectations have 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and with  labor

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee might see the information received during the intermeeting period 
as confirming the rebound in economic growth th at it anticipated in June, and judge that 
there continues to be sufficient underlying st rength in the broader economy to warrant a 
further $10 billion reduction in the monthly pace of asset purch ases, as in Alternative B.  
Policymakers may think that much of the weakness in first-quar ter final demand and 
GDP growth reflected transitory factors and measurement issues.  Policymakers may 
view the subsequent advances in consumer  spending and business fixed investment, as 
well as the ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, as consistent with their 
earlier expectation that the economic recovery would regain  momentum in the second 
quarter.  They might also see a high likeli hood that sustained employment gains, in 
conjunction with diminishing restraint from fiscal policy and further increases in house 
and equity prices, will support sustained gain s in economic activity in coming quarters. 
Although payroll employment gains have b een solid in recent months and the 
unemployment rate slid to 6.1 percent in June, policymakers may judge that significant 
slack remains in labor markets.  Though lower, the unemployment rate is still above the central tendency of participants’ longer-run projections.  Moreover, policymakers may 
regard the labor force participation rate as atypically low, even after adjusting for 
demographic effects.  They may also see th e elevated number of part-time workers who 
would prefer a full-time job, the still-high sh are of unemployed workers who have been 
out of work for six months or more, and modest wage increases as supporting the 
judgment that there is significant scope for im provement in labor market conditions.  In 
addition, policymakers may see a modest oversh oot of the unemployment rate, relative to 
the natural rate, as appropriate to help m ove inflation back toward the Committee’s 2 
percent target in a timely fashion.   
Given the recent acceleration in pric es, policymakers might have gained 
confidence that inflation will return, as they had expected, to their longe r-run objective 
over time, while also agreeing with the staff’ s assessment that inflation is likely to run 
below 2 percent over the Teal book projection period.  Accordi ngly, they might conclude 
that a highly accommodative monetary policy is  still appropriate in order to promote 
continued improvement in the labor market and a return of inflation to 2 percent over the 
medium run.  Nonetheless, given the cumu lative improvement in the labor market and 
their expectation that progress toward thei r objectives will conti nue, policymakers may 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
July 24, 2014
Page 29 of 54
Authorized for Public Release
   
  judge it appropriate to make another measur ed reduction in the pace of asset purchases, 
while maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and the current 
forward guidance.  
Some policymakers may worry that economic  activity rose only modestly, on net, 
in the first half of the year, even after rem oving the effects of transitory factors.  They 
might be inclined to halt, for a time, reductions  in the pace of asset purchases to ascertain 
that the economy has sufficient underlying strength to support ongoing improvement in 
labor market conditions.  That said, in recent months, labor market conditions have 
broadly improved and inflation readings have  firmed.  Those same policymakers might 
thus conclude that it would be premature to pause the taper in the absence of additional 
evidence showing that the economy is underp erforming relative to the path the 
Committee anticipated in June. 
 Other policymakers may be concer ned that continuing to expand the 
balance sheet through October, and maintaini ng near-zero rates for a considerable time 
thereafter, risks pushing the unemployment ra te well below levels consistent with 
maximum employment or fueling an undesirably large rise in  inflation over the medium 
run.  Those policymakers may point to the stronger gains in payroll employment and the recent acceleration in prices as evidence that slack is disappearing rapidly.  That said, 
some policymakers might welcome a steeper de cline in the unemployment rate to a level 
below that consistent with maximum employment as a way of encouraging a more rapid 
return of inflation to the Committee’s long-r un objective.  For that reason, policymakers 
might discount the relatively prompt tighteni ng of the federal funds rate prescribed by 
most simple policy rules and the optimal c ontrol simulations in the “Monetary Policy 
Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B.  Moreover, policymakers might question a 
number of assumptions that contribute to  those simulation results—including the large 
penalty on changes in the federal funds rate, and the absence of any role for considerations such as the risk of derailing a fragile housi ng recovery or the asymmetric 
risks posed by proximity to  the effective lower bound.  More broadly, policymakers 
might judge that labor market indicators other than the unemployment rate suggest a less 
pronounced improvement in labor market c onditions (see the b ox “Has the Fall in 
Unemployment Overstated the Improvement in  Labor Market Conditions?  A View from 
the Labor Market Conditions Index” in Teal book, Book A).  They might further observe 
that 12-month PCE inflation, both overall a nd core, remains below 2 percent, and that 
wage increases and longer-term inflation e xpectations have remained stable.  Those 
Alternatives

  policymakers might be satisfied for now by the indication, under Alte rnative B, that the 
Committee sees the risks of inflation running persistently  below 2 percent as having 
“diminished somewhat.”  And with the data and the outlook not markedly different from 
the Committee’s earlier expectations, policymakers may be reluctant to deviate from the policy path suggested by past FOMC communications. 
Relatedly, some policymakers may worry that maintaining highly accommodative 
policies for a long period of time could lead to excessive risk-taking in the financial sector; they might point to the low levels of realized and im plied volatility in financial 
markets, evidence of reaching-for-yield behavi or, and stretched valuations in some asset 
markets.  However, use of short-term financ ing instruments and indicators of leverage 
remain well below pre-crisis levels.  And while  prices of real estate and broad equity 
indices have risen appreciably, valuation metrics remain generally in line with historical 
norms.  Policymakers may thus judge that the sequence of modest re ductions in the pace 
of asset purchases and the subsequent gradual rise in the federal funds rate that market 
participants currently anticipate will be sufficient to contain such risks. 
Market participants are unlikely to be su rprised by the asset purchase decision or 
forward guidance in Alternative B.  According to the Desk’s latest survey, all 22 of the 
primary dealers, and all but one of the 28 buy-side respondents, expect the Committee to 
announce another $10 billion cut in the pace of asset purchases next week and are nearly 
certain of that outcome.  In describing th eir expectations rega rding the statement’s 
description of the economic s ituation, some dealers noted that the statement would likely 
recognize the improvement in labor market c onditions and the recent pickup in inflation; 
however, dealers generally do not anticipate changes to the statem ent’s language other 
than modest updates of its summary of current conditions.  Thus, while the market reaction to Alternative B is likely to be mode st, there is greater uncertainty than usual 
around that assessment. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may be convinced that a so lid and durable expansion in economic 
activity is under way, an expans ion that is likely to reduce any remaining slack in labor 
markets fairly quickly.  In support of this  view, they might cite the broad-based 
improvement in labor market conditions so far this year, along with recent gains in 
production and spending indicators.  They mi ght also highlight the decline in the 
unemployment rate, including long-term unemplo yment, as evidence that there has been 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
July 24, 2014
Page 31 of 54
Authorized for Public Release
   
  substantial cumulative progress toward the Committee’s maximum employment goal 
since the launch of the asset purchase progr am.  Moreover, they might note that an 
aggregate index of loan demand based on res ponses to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion 
Survey reached its highest level since 2005 in July, and that banks reported further 
loosening of standards and terms across most major loan categories.  Hence, they may see little justification for continuing asset purchases and perceive the potential costs of doing 
so as building, leading them to favor of a larger cut in asset purchases and an earlier 
termination of the program , as under Alternative C. 
More generally, policymakers may be con cerned that maintaining a policy stance 
like the one articulated by the Committee in  its recent statements would be overly 
accommodative.  Policymakers may see the recent rise in inflation as likely to persist, 
rather than partially reverse as envisioned in the Tealbook projection.  They may worry that, given a trajectory for policy similar to th e median funds rate pr ojections in the June 
SEP, there is a material risk that infla tion could persistently exceed the Committee’s 
longer-run goal in coming years.  Indeed, most of the simple policy rules and the optimal control simulations in the M onetary Policy Strategies se ction of Tealbook, Book B, call 
for policy tightening to begin this quarter.  Some participants may also view high stock 
market valuations, low credit spreads, a nd very low levels of implied volatility as 
potentially posing risks to financial stability.  For all these reasons, participants may see 
the alternative scenario “S tronger Activity with Higher Inflation” in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section of Tealbook, Book A, as bett er capturing their view  that, in addition 
to terminating asset purchases early, the Co mmittee should raise th e federal funds rate 
sooner, and possibly more rapidly, th an suggested under Alternative B. 
Based on the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and buy-side firms, a 
decision to adopt a statement like Alternative C would surprise market participants, as no 
respondent to those surveys expects asset purchases to be cut by more than $10 billion.  An unexpectedly-large reduction of $20 billion, in combina tion with a so lidly positive 
characterization of the econo my, would likely be interpre ted as a signal that the 
Committee now sees labor market slack declin ing more rapidly than it did in June.  
Alternative C’s modified policy guidance, wh ich states that the current range for the 
federal funds rate would likely be maintain ed only for “some time” instead of for “a 
considerable time” after the end of asset purchases, would also be unexpected and 
encourage market participants to pull forwar d their forecasts of the date at which the 
Committee will first increase its target for the federal funds rate, and perhaps also lead

  them to anticipate a steeper pa th for the funds rate thereafte r.  In response, medium- and 
longer-term real interest rate s would rise, equity prices a nd inflation compensation likely 
fall, and the dollar appreciate.  However, to th e extent that investors read the statement in 
Alternative C as reflecting a more optimis tic assessment of the outlook for economic 
growth, equity prices would not fall as much or could even rise, and inflation 
compensation might increase.  The shift in policy expectations would likely be 
accompanied by a rise in measures of interest  rate volatility, as the timing and pace of 
normalization loomed larger as issues for investors.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
The sequence of downward revisions to  first-quarter GDP may have eroded 
policymakers’ confidence in the stre ngth of the economic recovery.  Although 
policymakers may attribute some  of the contraction in first-quarter GDP to transitory 
factors or measurement error, they may noneth eless view a 3 percent drop in real output 
during an expansion period as a highly unusua l and worrisome event, especially because 
first-quarter gross domestic income (GDI), wh ich uses different data sources than GDP, 
also contracted sharply.  While economic activity appears to have rebounded in the 
second quarter, policymakers may be concerned that the increase in output over the first 
half of the year was meager, on net, and th at the housing recovery has not regained its 
momentum in spite of highly accommodative m onetary conditions.  Given these worries 
about the strength of the economic recovery, participants may believe that it would be 
appropriate to maintain the current pace of asset purchases, as in Alternative A, while 
waiting for additional information that will allow them to more clearly assess the state of 
the economy and the outlook. 
Although policymakers may be encouraged by the continuing rise in private 
payroll employment, they may remain skeptical  that significant gain s in employment can 
be sustained in the absence of a persistent pickup in growth of economic activity and may 
be quite uncertain whether the second-quarter  rebound will prove lasting.  They also may 
see the low and declining labor force particip ation rate and the high share of part-time 
workers for economic reasons as indicative of  weaker underlying labor market conditions 
than is evident from the unemployment rate and payroll employment figures.  
Furthermore, policymakers may be reluctant to  ascribe the recent pickup in inflation to a 
diminishing margin of spare capacity, especi ally because the modest rise in worker

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
July 24, 2014
Page 33 of 54
Authorized for Public Release
   
  compensation remains significantly below increases  historically associated with inflation 
running near 2 percent. 
Participants may fear that it would be di fficult for the Committee to resume asset 
purchases after the end of the current program , even if the underlying strength in the 
economy proved insufficient to support ongoing im provement in labor market conditions 
and to return inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.  Some policymakers may also 
be concerned that persistently low inflati on could lead to lowe r longer-run inflation 
expectations, resulti ng in mutually-reinforcing downwa rd dynamics for inflation and 
economic activity.  If so, they may find a stat ement like Alternative A desirable not only 
because it maintains the current pace of asset purchases but also because it explicitly 
introduces an inflation floor. 
An announcement like Alternative A would co me as a considerable surprise to 
market participants.  Investors likely would mark up their expectations for total asset 
purchases and push back the date of the first hike in the federal funds rate, perhaps by a 
considerable amount; a flattening of the expected  path for the federal funds rate thereafter 
is also possible.  Therefore, longer-term real interest rates likely w ould decline, inflation 
compensation and equity prices might rise, a nd the dollar could depreciate.  However, to 
the extent that investors read the statem ent in Alternative A as reflecting a more 
downbeat assessment of the out look for economic growth and inflation, equity prices 
would not rise as much or could even declin e, and inflation compen sation could fall.  The 
announcement of Alternative A also could enge nder greater uncertain ty on the part of 
market participants regarding the Committee’s re action function.

  DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued after the June meeting appears on the next page, 
followed by drafts for a July directive th at correspond to each of the three policy 
alternatives.  Each draft in cludes changes to make it consistent with th e corresponding 
postmeeting statement. 
The directive for Alternative A instructs the Desk to continue purchasing 
additional longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $20 billion per month and to 
continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of  about $15 billion per 
month.  The draft directive for Alternative B in structs the Desk to purchase, beginning in 
August, longer-term Treasury securities at  a pace of about $15 billion per month and 
agency mortgage-backed securities at a p ace of about $10 billion per month.  The draft 
directive for Alternative C instructs the De sk to purchase, also beginning in August, 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month and agency 
mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $5 billion per month.  A ll three of the draft 
directives direct the Desk to maintain the cu rrent policy of reinvesting principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new 
issues.

BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared three scenarios for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, 
corresponding to Alternatives A, B, and C.  The pace, ending date, and cumulative 
amount of asset purchases differ across the three alternatives.  Projections under each 
scenario are based on the staff’s assumptions about the trajectory of various components 
of the balance sheet.  In pa rticular, the projections assume that when the time comes to 
begin normalizing the size of the balance sheet, the SOMA portfolio will shrink only 
through redemptions of maturing Treasury se curities and agency debt, and through 
paydowns of principal from agency MBS. 
For the balance sheet scen ario that corresponds to Alternative B, monthly 
purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency MBS continue to be reduced by 
$5 billion each following the July and September FOMC meetings, and by $10 and $5 
billion (to zero), respective ly, following the October meeting.  Under this assumption, 
which is the same as the policy assumption in the staff baseline forecast presented in Tealbook, Book A, purchases total a bit le ss than $1.5 trillion over 2013 and 2014, an 
amount that is unchanged from Alternative B and the staff forecast in the June Tealbook.
  
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” under 
the purchase program assumed for Alternative B, total assets woul d peak at about $4.5 
trillion in the first quarter of 2015, with $2.5 trillion in Treasury s ecurities holdings and 
$1.7 trillion in agency MBS holdings.1  We assume that the first increase in the target 
federal funds rate is in the second quarter of 2015, consistent with the staff forecast and 
unchanged from Alternative B of the June Teal book.  We also assume that the level of 
overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion—about its 
average level over recent weeks—through the end of 2018 and then falls to zero by the 
end of 2019.2  All reinvestments and rollovers of  securities are assumed to cease six 
                                                 
1 Total assets peak after the end of the purchase  program because of delayed settlement of agency 
MBS purchases. 
2 In June, we assumed that ON RRPs outstanding would fall to zero at the end of the current 
authorization for the exercise in January 2015.  Use of ON RRPs results in a shift in the composition of 
Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse 
repurchase agreements—but does not produce an over all change in the size of the balance sheet.  The

   months after liftoff, at which time th e SOMA portfolio begins to contract.3  The size of 
the portfolio is normalized by the fourth quarter of 2021, one quarter later than assumed 
in the June Tealbook.4  The balance sheet then begins to expand, with increases in SOMA 
holdings essentially matching the growth of currency in circulation and Federal Reserve 
Bank capital and surplus.  Total assets are $2.5 trillion at the end of 2025, with about 
$640 billion in agency MBS holdings remaining in the SOMA portfolio. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,”  shows the implications of balance 
sheet developments for Federal Reserve income.  Under Alternative B, interest income 
rises while reinvestment purch ases are ongoing; subsequently, it declines for a number of 
years as the SOMA portfolio contracts through redemptions and paydowns of principal.  
Although interest expense is currently quite sma ll, it climbs over the next few years as the 
federal funds rate increases while reserve bala nces are still quite elevated; annual interest 
expense peaks at $80 billion in 2017.5  Putting these pieces together, annual remittances 
reach about $100 billion this year and then slowly decline over the following four years.  
Annual remittances reach their trough at le ss than $10 billion in 2018, about $10 billion 
lower than in the June Alternative B scenario; no deferred asset is recorded.6  The Federal 
Reserve’s cumulative remittances from  2009 through 2025 are about $900 billion, 
approximately $150 billion above the staff estim ate of the level that would have been 
observed had there been no a sset purchase programs.   
                                                                                                                                                 
current projections, like the June proj ections, also assume that RRPs asso ciated with foreign official and 
international accounts w ill remain around $110  billion throughout th e forecast period.  We assume that 
term deposits are not used during normalization.    
3 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of July 22, 2014. 
4 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve 
capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be 
necessary to conduct monetary policy in the long run; cu rrently, we assume that level of reserve balances to 
be $100 billion.   
5 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains 25 basis points until liftoff.  After 
liftoff, we assume that the spread between the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 
20 basis points.  In particular, the rate paid on reserve balances is between 10 and 15 basis points above the federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate is 10 to 5 basi s points below it, with the spread sufficient to create 
conditions where trading in the funds market is at the projected federal funds rate.   
6 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  In this Tealbook, none of the alternatives result in a deferred asset.

   The unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA  portfolio is influenced importantly 
by the level of interest rates.  The staff estimates that the portfolio was in an unrealized 
gain position of about $90 billi on as of the end of June 2014.7  Reflecting the assumed 
rise in interest rates over the projection period, the position—under Alternative B—shifts 
to an unrealized loss in the near term a nd reaches a peak unrealized loss of about $375 
billion at the end of 2017.  At the peak, $200 billion of the unrealized loss can be 
attributed to the Treasury  portfolio and $175 billion to  the MBS portfolio.  The 
unrealized loss position narrows through th e remainder of the forecast period, as 
securities acquired under the large-scale asset purchase programs mature and new 
securities are added to the portfolio at par. 
Under Alternative C, the monthly pace of purchases of longer-term Treasury 
securities and agency MBS are both redu ced by $10 billion in August; purchases end 
after the September meeting.8  Under this scenario, purch ases total about $1.4 trillion 
over 2013 and 2014, and total assets peak at ab out $4.5 trillion in the first quarter of 
2015.  The federal funds rate is assumed to lift off in late 2014; six months later, 
reinvestment of principal from maturing or  prepaying securities ends and redemptions 
begin.  As a result, the size of the balance sh eet is normalized in th e third quarter of 2021, 
only slightly earlier than Alternative B.  The rise in short-term inte rest rates from early 
2015 into 2018, while reserve balances remain elevated, leads to mu ch larger interest 
expense and minimal projected remittances in 2017, though no deferred asset is recorded.  Cumulative remittances from 2009 to 2025 are s lightly lower than under the projection 
for Alternative B. 
Under the scenario for Alternative A, the current pace of purchases of longer-term 
Treasury securities and agency MBS is maintain ed in the near term but then is reduced 
gradually, with purchases ending in December 2014.
9  Under these assumptions, 
                                                 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public with a la g in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly 
Financial Report,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .   
8 The assumption that purchases will end after the September meeting is consistent with a view 
that a solid and durable expansion in economic activ ity is under way with broad-based improvement in 
labor market conditions so far this year or that inflation is likely to move back toward 2 percent more rapidly.   
9 Compared with the baseline, the later end to asset purchases is consistent with a view that the 
significant gains in employment observed recently will not be sustained in the absence of a persistent

   purchases total about $1.5 tril lion from 2013 to 2014, and total assets rise to a peak of 
about $4.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2015.  The first incr ease in the target federal 
funds rate is assumed to occur in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with inflation one 
to two years ahead rising above 2 percent at that time, given the staff’s economic outlook.  
Reinvestments are assumed to cease six months  after the first increase in the federal 
funds rate, and the SOMA portfolio then begins  to contract.  The si ze of the portfolio is 
normalized two quarters later than under th e scenario co rresponding to Alternative B, 
reflecting the larger amount of asset purchases and the later e nd of reinvestment.  As with 
the other alternatives, the ri se in shorter-dated intere st rates between 2016 and 2019, 
while reserve balances remain elevated, lead s to an increase in interest expense.  
Remittances are minimal in 2018, though no deferred asset is recorded.  Even with this pattern, cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are slight ly higher than under 
the projection for Alternative B because the larger purchase program and delayed end of 
reinvestments results in a larger balance sheet. 
As shown in the exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the 10-Year Treasury Term 
Premium Effect,” the effect of the Federa l Reserve’s cumulative increase in asset 
holdings on the term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasury yield in the third quarter of 2014 is negative 122 basis points under Alternative B, about the same as in the 
June Tealbook.  Over the remainder of the projection period, the te rm premium effect 
converges slowly toward zero, reflecting the actual and anticipated normalization of the portfolio.  Under Alternative C,  the term premium effect in  the third quarter of 2014 is 
negative 120 basis points.  In absolute terms, the effect is marginally smaller than under 
Alternative B because fewer securities are purchased than under Alternative B, and 
because the balance sheet begins to contract sooner.  Under Alternative A, the term premium effect is negative 132 ba sis points in the current quarte r.  In absolute terms, the 
effect is larger than under Alternative B because more securities are purchased, and 
because the balance sheet begins to c ontract later than under Alternative B.
  
The differences across the scenarios re garding the projected peak amount of 
reserve balances and the level of reserve balances at lifto ff are directly related to the 
magnitude of assumed asset purchases; impor tantly, the projected level of reserve 
balances is also contingent on the assumed usage of the ON RRP facility and the 
                                                                                                                                                 
pickup in growth of economic activ ity and a judgment that the recent pickup in inflation largely reflects 
transitory factors.

   evolution of other balance sheet items.10  Under all three alternatives, reserve balances 
peak at about $2.9 trillion in the first half of 2015.   
As shown in the final exhibit, “Alternative Projections for the Monetary Base,” 
under the scenario corresponding to Alternative B, the monetary base increases, on 
balance, through the middle of 2015 because the purchase program is accompanied by an 
increase in reserve balances.  Once the norma lization process begins, the monetary base 
shrinks, on net, through 2021, primarily becau se redemptions of securities cause 
corresponding reductions in reserve balanc es.  Starting around mid-2022, after reserve 
balances are assumed to have stabilized at $100 billion, the monetary base begins to 
expand in line with the growth  of currency in circulation.11  Because the contours of the 
balance sheet are similar across the alternatives, the growth rates of the monetary base 
under Alternatives C and A are broadly similar to those under Alternative B.12 
  
                                                 
10 The level of draining tools and other items assumed in the projections generally do not vary 
across the three scenarios. 
11 In these projections, an ON RRP facility is assu med and, therefore, the monetary base is lower 
until 2019 (when the facility is phased out) than it would otherwise be.  Given the relatively small size of 
the ON RRP program compared to reserve balances, the overall contours of the monetary base are not greatly affected.   
12 The projections for the monetary base depend critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  If, for example, the FOMC employs additional reverse repurcha se agreements or term 
deposits to drain reserves during normalization, the projected level of reserve balances and the monetary base could decline quite markedly in the out years of the projection.

   MONEY  
In recent years, M2 has grown considerab ly faster than would be predicted based 
on its historical relationshi p with nominal GDP and the opportunity cost of holding 
money. The staff projects that M2 growth w ill decline markedly over the forecast period 
relative to its pace in recent years, and even turn negative for a time.  This trajectory for 
M2 largely reflects an increase in the opport unity cost of holding M2 balances arising 
from the projected tighten ing of monetary policy.13  In addition, the forecast incorporates 
a judgment that investors will reallocate a portion of their elevated M2 balances to other 
investments as the economic recovery progres ses and that this process will act as an 
additional restraint on M2 growth in 2015 and 2016; however, the timing and magnitude 
of this shift are highly uncertain. 
 
 
                                                 
13 The three-month Treasury bill rate is assumed to begin rising in 2015:Q1—one quarter earlier
