The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federal funds rate from six different policy rules: 
the Taylor (1993) rule, the Ta ylor (1999) rule, an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) 
rule, an outcome-based rule, a first-differen ce rule, and a nominal income targeting rule.1 
These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline proj ections for real activity and 
inflation in the near term. (Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations 
of the rules are discussed below.) As shown in the table, the Taylor (1993) rule, the 
Taylor (1999) rule, and the outcome-based rule all call for sizable increases in the federal 
funds rate over the next two quarters. Th e inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the first-
difference rule prescribe smaller increases in the federal funds rate in the near term, to 
just below ¾ percent by the first quarter of 2015.  In c ontrast, the nominal income 
targeting rule calls for negative policy rates in the near term. This more-accommodative 
prescription arises because the rule responds not only to the staff’s estimates of the output 
gap and inflation in the current quarter but also is calibrated to respond to the cumulative 
shortfall of inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective since the end 
of 2007; currently, this cumulative shortfall is about 3 percentage points. 
All of the simple rules call for somewhat lower policy rates in the near term than 
under the previous Tealbook forecast, reflectin g the staff’s projections of somewhat 
lower resource utilization and slightly lowe r inflation than in the July Tealbook.  The 
revisions in the output gap projections, shown in the lower-left panel of the exhibit, 
reflect the staff’s view that, while the growth  of real GDP was not quite as slow in the 
first half of 2014 as estimated in July, growth in economic activity is likely to be weaker 
in the medium term than predicted in July due to a stronger dollar and modestly slower 
house price growth. The staff now anticipates that  the output gap will close by mid-2016, 
three quarters later than in the July Tealbook, and that real GDP will subsequently 
overshoot potential GDP by considerably less th an projected in July.  The output gap is 
expected to peak at about ¾ percent of potential GDP  in 2017 and then decline thereafter.  
Reflecting these projections of lower resource utilization, the staff’s forecast for core

September 11, 2014inflation, shown in the lower-right panel of th e exhibit, settles near 2 percent in 2020, two 
years later than in the July Tealbook. 
Strategies
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model after 
adjusting it to reproduce the staff’s baseline fo recast. This measure is an estimate of the 
real federal funds rate that would, if maintaine d, return output to potential in 12 quarters.  
The estimated r*, at –0.85 percent, is about 50 basis points above the actual real federal 
funds rate but 60 basis points below the current-quarter estimate as of the July Tealbook, 
reflecting the staff’s new, lower, projection of res ource utilization. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules. These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the output gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, under the assumption that the federal 
funds rate is subject to an effective lowe r bound of 12½ basis points.  The exhibit also 
displays the implications of following the baseline policy assumptions adopted in this 
Tealbook.2 In forming the Tealbook baseline for ecast, the staff has assumed that the 
federal funds rate would remain at its effective lower bound for two quarters after the end 
of the asset purchase program, and subsequen tly would follow the prescriptions of the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  The two-quarter lag between  the assumed end of asset 
purchases and the first increase in the baseline path for the fe deral funds rate is intended 
to reflect the Committee’s forward guidance, r eaffirmed in its July statement, that “it 
likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for 
a considerable time after the asset purchase pr ogram ends.”  As in the July projections, 
the first rate hike under the baseline policy occurs in the second quarter of 2015. 
Thereafter, the federal funds rate increases gradually over the next few years, reaching 
2 percent in mid-2016 and 4 percent by the end of 2019. In contrast to the Tealbook 
baseline, the simulations employing the six policy rules make no attempt to account for 
the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the start of policy firm ing. (Policy rule 
simulations that take account of th is guidance are discussed below.) 
2 The policy rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s large-scale asset purchase programs. For the current program, the simulations embed the 
assumption that purchases of longer-term Treasury s ecurities and agency MBS will conclude in October, 
with cumulative purchases since the start of 2013 close to $1.5 trillion.

September 11, 2014Ignoring the forward guidance, five of the rules—the Taylor (1993), 
Taylor (1999), inertial Taylor (1999), outco me-based, and first-diffe rence rules—call for 
tightening to begin immediately.  Except for th e inertial Taylor (1999) rule, each of these 
rules prescribes a real federal funds rate pa th that lies significantly above the baseline 
over the next few years, leading to some what higher unemployment rates over that 
period. Reflecting the low sensitivity of infl ation to slack in the FRB/US model, the 
inflation paths produced by these rules are si milar to those in the Tealbook baseline.3 
The inertial Taylor (1999) rule calls for ti ghtening to commence two quarters earlier than 
in the Tealbook baseline, but its prescriptions for the federal funds ra te converge to those 
in the staff baseline by mid-2016 and are nearly identical thereaft er. As a result, this rule 
results in very similar longer-term intere st rates and macroec onomic outcomes. 
The first-difference rule also initially implies a higher nominal funds rate than the 
baseline. However, the effect on unemplo yment of this more-rapid tightening is 
attenuated because the first-difference rule also calls for an easier stance of policy later in 
the decade, as the pace of ec onomic activity moderates, than do the other rules.  After 
2017, the more-accommodative monetary policy st ance also promotes a larger and more-
persistent undershooting of the unemployment rate with respec t to its natural rate than 
most of the other rules; this greater resour ce utilization in the future in turn boosts 
inflation in the shorter run via forward-looking expectations. 
The nominal income targeting rule implies a later departure from the effective 
lower bound than assumed in the Tealbook baseline. This rule keeps the federal funds 
rate within the Committee’s current target range until the first quarter of 2016 and 
generates a real federal funds rate that runs persistently below the baseline path for the 
rest of the decade, thereby leading to stronger real activity. Under th is rule, inflation is 
closer to the Committee’s objective than in the Tealbook baseline through 2018, but it 
runs modestly above 2 percent for several years thereafter, as the rule seeks to 
compensate for the cumulative shortfall of inflation from 2 percen t since the end of 2007. 
3 Long-term inflation expectations in all of these simulations are assumed to follow the same 
trajectory as in the staff baseline. The small differences in inflation outcomes across the rules reflect the 
different federal funds rate paths that each rule prescribes and the resulting path s for longer-term real rates 
and current and expected real activity. For alternative assumptions on long-term inflation expectations and 
their implications, see the memo, “Long-Term Inflation Expectations and Risks to the Outlook,” by 
Thomas Laubach, John M. Roberts, Jae W. Sim, and Brad E. Strum, sent to the Committee on September 5, 
2014.

StrategiesThe results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to that rule in the future 
and that the private sector fully understands the policy that will be pursued and its 
implications for real activity and inflation. These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targeting rule, which generates outcomes in which 
unemployment runs markedly below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate even after 
inflation has moved above the Committee’s longer-run goal. 
As previously noted, the policy rules in  the simulations summarized above do not 
take into account the Committee’s forward guidance, and all but one of these rules 
involve departures from the effective lower bound about two quarters earlier than in the 
staff baseline.  The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations with an Unemployment Rate 
Threshold,” reports results obtained when each policy rule is subjec t to an unemployment 
rate threshold that is intended to capture the Committee’s “considerable time” guidance 
in a data-dependent manner.  A threshold of 5.8 percent was chosen because, in the 
Tealbook baseline, the unemployment rate crosse s that level in the quarter before firming 
begins.4 (The same unemployment rate threshold is adopted in the a lternative scenarios 
shown in the Risks and Uncertainty secti on of Tealbook, Book A.)  Financial market 
participants and price- and wage-setters are assumed to understand that the Committee 
will switch to the specified rule in the quarter following the crossing of the threshold, and 
to view this switch as permanent and fully credible. 
Imposing the unemployment threshold affect s all of the rules except the nominal 
income targeting rule; for the other rules, th e first increase in the federal funds rate is 
delayed by two quarters and occurs in the second quarter of 2015, as in the Tealbook 
baseline. For most rules, the delayed depa rture from the effective lower bound has small 
macroeconomic effects because the longer-te rm real rates that influence economic 
activity in the FRB/US model are not apprecia bly altered. Only for the first-difference 
rule does the threshold imply significantly different outcomes for unemployment and 
inflation. Imposing the unemployment rate th reshold on the first-difference rule results 
in a more-accommodative policy path, delivering a lower trajectory for unemployment throughout the projection period and slightly higher inflation than in the case without the 
threshold. 
4 For the same reason, the unemployment rate threshold used in July was 5.6 percent.

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit keep the federal funds rate at an effective lower bound of 12½ basis 
points as long as the unemployment rate is 5.8 percent or more. Thereafter, the federal funds rate follows the prescriptions of the specified rule. A value of 5.8 percent was chosen because in the Tealbook baseline the unemployment rate crosses that level just before firming begins. In addition, the simulations are based on rules that respond to core inflation.

StrategiesThe fourth exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy under Commitment,” compares 
optimal control simulations derived using th is Tealbook’s baseline forecast with those 
reported in July.5 Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline 
PCE inflation close to the Committee’s 2 per cent goal, on keeping the unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate. The optimal control concept presented here 
corresponds to a commitment policy under which policymakers make decisions today 
that have the effect of constraini ng policy choices in future periods.6 
The policy rate under optimal control rise s above the Committee’s current target 
range next quarter—the first qua rter of the projection. The real federal funds rate through 
2020 averages about 1 percentage point lowe r than in July, largely reflecting the 
somewhat weaker underlying trend in aggregat e demand now seen in the staff projection.  
The federal funds rate departs from the effective lower bound two quarters earlier than in 
the Tealbook baseline. The real federal funds rate remains fairly close to the Tealbook 
baseline until early 2017, runs around 30 basis points higher than the baseline for about 
five years, but drops below the baseline in the distant future (not show n). As a result, the 
two policies imply roughly the same degree of accommodation, and the unemployment 
and inflation paths under the optimal control policy are similar to those in the baseline.7 
A feature of these optimal control simu lations under commitment is that the 
nominal federal funds rate rise s gradually to 4 percent befo re slowly converging to its 
long-run value of 3¾ percent.  The gradual incr ease reflects a number of factors, among 
them adverse economic and financial conditions that imply that a ggregate demand would 
be persistently weak if the federal funds rate were to be adjusted promptly to its steady-
state level, and the fact that the objective function assumed for these simulations 
5 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, as well as the assumptions about balance sheet policies 
described in footnote 2. These simulated policies do not incorporate the unemployment rate threshold. 
6 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in which policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan involving policy choices that would be suboptimal at the time these choices 
have to be implemented) are similar to those reported in the exhibits for commitment. 
7 These results depend on a number of factors and could vary under alternative modeling 
assumptions, including asymmetries in the specificatio n of policymakers’ prefer ences, the presence of 
asymmetric risks to the outlook, and uncertainties in gauging economic slack. For more details, see the 
memo, “Potential Implications of Alternative Appro aches to the Timing and P ace of Tightening,” by 
Christopher J. Erceg, Michael  T. Kiley, and Robert J. Tetlow, sent to the Committee on September 5, 2014.

Strategiespenalizes changes in the federal funds ra te and thereby encour ages interest-rate 
smoothing.8 
To ascertain the role played by interest-rate smoothing, the special exhibit, 
“Optimal Control Policy under Commitmen t with Lower Weight on Interest-Rate 
Smoothing,” compares these results with th e outcomes from an alternative optimal 
control simulation under commitment featuri ng a smaller penalty on the change in the 
federal funds rate.9 
With the smaller penalty, optimal contro l implies a policy in which the federal 
funds rate is raised above th e lower bound about one year later than in the standard case 
but then rises more steeply. The resulting path of longer-term intere st rates is slightly 
above the standard case, as the effect of the higher level of the funds rate in the 
intermediate term more than o ffsets the effect of the lower federal funds rate in the near 
term. Because changes in federal funds rate  policy in the FRB/US model are primarily 
transmitted to aggregate demand via longer-term interest rates, unemployment in this 
case runs a little above its tr ajectory in the standard case,  although infla tion is little 
changed. 
These results suggest that, in current circumstances, policies associated with 
various degrees of interest-rate smoothing could serve equally well in achieving the 
Committee’s dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. It deserves 
emphasis, however, that in practice the communi cation strategies associated with the two 
8 In addition, the gradual increase reflects the fact that inflation responds only weakly to economic 
conditions and depends on an exogenous measure of inflation expectations that remains below 2 percent far 
into the next decade. 
9 In the standard case, equal weights are placed on minimizing deviations of inflation and 
unemployment from the Committee’s assumed objectives and on changes in the federal funds rate. The 
inclusion of a desire for interest-rate smoothing in the assumed loss function could be motivated in several 
ways. Such smoothing implies policy prescriptions that more closely resemble the observed persistence in 
the actual federal funds rate in the past. More substantively, policymakers may put considerable weight on 
interest-rate smoothing as a hedge against model uncertainty or out of concerns for not-perfectly-rational 
expectations formation (such as learning behavior). In the case of low interest-rate smoothing, the weight 
placed on changes in the funds rate is lowered to a leve l equal to 7½ percent of the weight on the inflation 
and unemployment deviations.  Lowering the weight further would lead to convergence problems for the 
simulations of the FRB/US model.

Strategiesoptimal control policies shown in the exhibi t would likely need to be different, each 
presenting its own challenges.10 
Arguably, an increase in the federal funds rate next quarter, as prescribed by the 
standard optimal control simulation, would co me as a substantial surprise to market 
participants in light of the Committee’s “cons iderable time” guidance. Moreover, market 
participants might misinterpret such an ear ly tightening as a signal that the Committee 
intends to pursue a more-restrictive monetary policy over the medium term than is 
implied by the sequence of relatively modest  policy-rate increases featured under the 
optimal control policy. To avoid confusing market participants, the Committee might 
well need to convey that an earlier-than-expect ed start of policy-rate firming would likely 
be accompanied by a more-gradual-than-expected subsequent pattern of federal funds 
rate increases. The somewhat later commencement of policy firming associated with the 
optimal control policy under a lower weight on interest-r ate smoothing could prove less 
challenging to communicate, as the kind of  forward guidance currently used by the 
Committee might be well suited for such co mmunication.  However, if the Committee 
planned to raise rates rapidly in its tightening phase, communication of this intention 
would presumably be called for.  If market participants were surprised by the more-rapid 
increases depicted in this simulation, the adjustments in financial markets could 
potentially be disorderly.11 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes unde r Alternative Policies” and “Outcomes 
under Alternative Policies with an Unemployment Rate Threshold,” tabulate the 
simulation results for key variables under each of the policy rules described above. 
10 See also the memo, “Potential Implications of Alternative Approaches to the Timing and Pace 
of Tightening,” by Christopher J. Erceg, Michael T. K iley, and Robert J. Tetlow, sent to the Committee on 
September 5, 2014. 
11 Specifically, this policy implies increasing the federal funds rate by about 400 basis points over 
a period of two years, as opposed to four years in the case with a substantial weight on interest-rate 
smoothing. While the pace of increases under the more-gradual trajectory appears more aligned with 
current market expectations , the pace of increases under the steeper policy-rate tr ajectory is similar to the 
400 basis-point increase in the federal funds rate observed during the “meas ured pace” period from mid-
2004 to mid-2006.

Appendix
POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies. ” In the table, [math] denotes the effective nominal federal funds rate for quarter 
t, while the right-hand-side variables include the staff's projection of trailing four-quarter core 
PCE inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead [math], the output gap estimate 
for the current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast [math], and the forecast of the 
three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap [math]. The value of policymakers' 
long-run inflation objective, denoted [math], is 2 percent. The nominal income targeting 
rule responds to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference between nominal 
income [math] (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value [math] 
(100 times the log of target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the 
staff's current estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in 
that quarter; subsequently, target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the 
staff's estimate of potential GDP.
The first two of the selected  rules  were  studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
Taylor  (1999)  rule has been  featured  prominently  in recent  analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
outcome-based  rule uses policy  reactions  estimated  using  real-time  data over the sample  
1988:Q1 -2006:Q4. The intercept  of the outcome-based  rule was chosen  so that it is consistent 
with a 2 percent  long-run  inflation  objective  and a long-run  real interest  rate of 1 3/4 percent,  a 
value  used in the FRB/US  model. The intercepts  of the Taylor  (1993,  1999)  rules and the long-  
run intercept  of the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule are set at 1 3/4 percent  for the same reason. The 1 3/4 
percent  real rate estimate  also enters  the long-run  intercept  of the nominal  income  targeting  rule.Taylor  (1993)  rule \( R_t = 1.75+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+0.5gap_t\)
Taylor  (1999)  rule \( R_t = 1.75+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\)
Inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule \( R_t = 0.85R_{t-1}+0.15\left(1.75+\pi_t+0.5(\pi_t-\pi^*)+gap_t\right)\)

StrategiesThe prescriptions of the first-difference rule do no t depend on the level of the output gap or the 
long-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a 
right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (199 9) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated 
outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule—the lines denoted “Previous 
Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions 
computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set e qual to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous 
quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current  quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late 
in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for 
each of these rules, including those that use the “Previous Tealbook outlook,” is set equal to the 
average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter. For the subsequent quarter, these rules 
use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

September 11, 2014ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES 
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.” The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s 
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.   This estimate depends on a very broad array 
of economic factors, some of which take the fo rm of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables. The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r *, which 
is generated after the paths of e xogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they 
match those in the extended Tealbook forecast. Model simulations then determine the value of 
the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the 
extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index. The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook Book B publication date. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation. For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
optimal control simulations, when applied to the previous Tealbook projection.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three alternative draft FOMC statements—labeled A, B, 
and C—for the Committee’s consideration.  These alternatives offer options for asset 
purchases and forward guidance, along with different possibilities for characterizing 
incoming information and the outlook. 
With respect to balance sheet policy, Alternatives A and B reduce monthly 
purchases of agency MBS and Treasury securiti es by another $5 billion each and indicate 
that the program will “likely” be concluded at the Committee’s next meeting in October.  In contrast, Alternative C announces that asse t purchases will conclude this month, noting 
the Committee’s judgment that there has been  “a substantial improve ment in the outlook 
for the labor market” and its anticipation “that inflation will move toward the 
Committee’s longer-run objective.”  
Alternative B retains the J une statement’s forward guidance for the federal funds 
rate, indicating that the current range for the federal funds rate  will likely remain in place 
“for a considerable time after the asset purch ase program ends.”  A lternative C replaces 
the entire phrase with “for some time.”  A lternative A replaces th e current date-based 
guidance with an inflation floor; according to this state-dependent guidance, the 
Committee would anticipate maintaining the cu rrent target range fo r the federal funds 
rate “at least as long as inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be 
below 2 percent.”  Under each alternative, the Committee would repeat its intention to 
take a “balanced approach” when it begins to remove policy accommodation.  In all three 
alternatives, the Committee would also reiterat e that it “currently anticipates that, even 
after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.” 
In their descriptions of current econo mic conditions, all three alternatives 
characterize the pace of economic activity as “m oderate,” and they note that labor market 
conditions improved “somewhat further,” albeit with little change in the unemployment 
rate.  While Alternatives A and B reaffirm  that underutilization of labor resources 
remained “significant,” Altern ative C points to “diminishing” underutilization.  As in the 
July statement, all three alte rnatives observe that household spending appears to be rising

 moderately, business fixed investment is advancing, and the housing recovery remains 
slow.  Alternatives A and B maintain the reference to the restraining effects of fiscal policy; that reference is removed from the st atement language proposed by Alternative C.  
Alternatives A and B further acknowledge that inflation recently has been running “somewhat below” (Alternative B) or “som ewhat further below” (Alternative A) the 
Committee’s longer-run objective.  In contrast, Alternative C offers a judgment that 
inflation “appears to be moving gradually toward” that objective.  Data to be received 
between the publication of th is Tealbook and the second da y of the September FOMC 
meeting—in particular readings on retail sales and the CPI in August—could lead to revisions in the first paragraph of each of the draft statements. 
The alternatives all reaffirm the Committee’s modal forecast that, with 
appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges 
consistent with its dual mandate, although Alternative A notes that convergence is 
expected to be gradual.  All of the alternatives state that the Committee sees the “risks to 
the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balan ced.”  Alternatives 
B and C indicate that the risk  of inflation running persis tently below 2 percent has 
diminished “since early this year.”  In cont rast, Alternative A notes that risks to the 
outlook for inflation are “tilted somewhat to the downside.”  
Subsequent pages present the July FOMC st atement, as well as complete drafts of 
Alternatives A, B, and C followed by suppor ting arguments and then draft directives.

 JULY 2014  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates 
that growth in economic activity rebounde d in the second quarter.  Labor market 
conditions improved, with the unemployment rate declining further.  However, a 
range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.  H ousehold spending appears to be rising 
moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the 
housing sector remains slow.  Fiscal polic y is restraining eco nomic growth, although 
the extent of restraint is diminishing.  In flation has moved somewhat closer to the 
Committee’s longer-run objective.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained 
stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market 
indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity 
and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat. 
3. The Committee currently j udges that there is sufficien t underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing improveme nt in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement 
in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of  the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in August, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securi ties at a pace of $10 billion per month 
rather than $15 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $15 billion per m onth rather than $20 billion per month.  The 
Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressu re on longer-term interest rates, support 
mortgage markets, and help to make  broader financial conditions more 
accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases 
in further measured steps at future meetin gs.  However, asset purchases are not on a 
preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about their pace will remain contingent

 on the Committee’s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its 
assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percen t target range for the federa l funds rate, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expecte d—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developm ents.  The Committee continues to  anticipate, based on its assessment of 
these factors, that it likely will be appropria te to maintain the current target range for

economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has moved 
somewhat closer to further below  the Committee’s longer-run objective  even 
though longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.   
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market 
indicators and inflation moving gradually  toward levels the Committee judges 
consistent with its dual mandate.  The Co mmittee sees the risks to the outlook for 
economic activity and the labor market as  nearly balanced and judges that the 
likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat  
the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted somewhat to the downside . 
3. The Committee currently j udges that there is sufficien t underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing improveme nt in labor market conditions.  In 
light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement 
in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of  the current asset 
purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in 
the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in August  October, the Committee will 
add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $10 $5 billion 
per month rather than $15 $10 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of 
longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $15 $10 billion per month rather than $20 
$15 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its  holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee’s sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets,  and help to make broader financial 
conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic 
recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent 
with the Committee’s dual mandate. 
4. The Committee will closely monitor inco ming information on economic and financial 
developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy t ools as appropriate, 
until the outlook for the labor market has impr oved substantially in a context of price 
stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Comm ittee will likely reduce the pace of end its  current

 program of asset purchases in further measured steps at future its next  meetings.  
However, asset purchases are not on a pres et course, and the Committee’s decisions 
about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee’s outlook for the labor 
market and inflation as well as its assessmen t of the likely efficacy and costs of such 
purchases. 
5. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary 
policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federa l funds rate, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expecte d—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation exp ectations, and readings on financial 
developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate s, based on its assessment of 
these factors, that it likely will be appropria te to maintain the current target range for 
the federal funds rate for a considerable ti me after the asset purchase program ends, 
especially if projected inflation contin ues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run goal, and at least as long as inflation between one and two years ahead 
is projected to be below 2 percent,  provided that longer-term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Notwithstanding some softness in recent spending and labor market data, the 
Committee, like the staff, might see the in formation received during the intermeeting 
period as broadly consistent with an assessm ent that economic activity is expanding at a 
moderate pace.  Furthermore, policymaker s may judge that there continues to be 
sufficient underlying strength in the broade r economy to generate ongoing improvement 
in labor market conditions, with moderate growth in employment and economic activity 
supported by diminishing restraint from fiscal policy and continued monetary 
accommodation.  Nonetheless, in light of th e smaller-than-expected gains in payroll 
employment during July and August, and with most measures of labor utilization little 
changed, policymakers may continue to judge that there re mains significant 
underutilization of labor res ources.  Although the unemploym ent rate has appreciably 
declined over the year and is also somewhat lower than expected at the start of year, it is 
still well above the central te ndency of participants’ longer -run projections in the June 
SEP.  Moreover, policymakers may regard the labor force participati on rate as atypically 
low, even after taking into account demographic effects.  They may also see the elevated 
number of part-time workers who would prefer a full-time job, the still-high share of unemployed workers who have been out of wo rk for six months or more, and modest 
wage increases, as supporting the judgme nt that there is significant scope for 
improvement in labor market conditions.  In addition, policymakers might interpret the recent softness in inflation as indicating that the pickup in earlier months was in part 
transitory and that in flation may remain below their l onger-run objective for some time.  
Policymakers might conclude that a highly ac commodative stance of monetary policy is 
still appropriate in order to promote continued improvement in the labor market and a 
return of inflation to 2 percen t over the medium run.  Even so, in light of the cumulative 
improvements in the labor market in recent years and their expectation that progress toward their objectives will continue, polic ymakers may judge it appropriate to make 
another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, an d to prepare markets for the 
likely end of the purchase program in October,  while maintaining the current target range 
for the federal funds rate and forward guidance, as in Alternative B.  
Some policymakers, however, may judge that more accommodation will likely be 
appropriate before long.  They may be c oncerned not only about downside risks to 
inflation, but also that the persistent shortf all of inflation from the Committee’s longer-
run objective poses downside risks to growth.  Moreover, they may worry that recent 
Alternatives

 softness in a number of indicators—includi ng spending, payroll ga ins, and consumer 
prices—might foreshadow further weakness.  That said, the recently softer inflation 
readings have evolved along the lines of earlier Tealbook projections, and longer-term 
inflation expectations have re mained within the range observed in recent years.  While 
they may see somewhat greater risks of less favorable outcomes for employment and 
inflation than in July, those policymakers might conclude that it would be premature to alter the Committee’s forward guida nce regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate 
in the direction of providing additional accommodation.   
Taking into account the cumulative gain s in payroll employment since the 
inception of the current program of asset pur chases, some policymakers may judge that 
the second-quarter acceleration in pri ces and economic activity signals rapidly 
diminishing slack and might prefer to concl ude asset purchases at the current meeting.  
However, in light of the somewhat disappointing labor market data received during the intermeeting period, policymakers  may be reluctant to deviate from the balance sheet 
path suggested by past FOMC communicati ons, which suggested that the Committee 
would end the program at its October mee ting.  Other policymaker s may be concerned 
that maintaining near-zero rates for a cons iderable time risks pushing the unemployment 
rate well below levels consis tent with maximum employment  and fueling an undesirably 
large rise in inflation over the medium  run.  These policymakers might point to 
prescriptions derived from several simple po licy rules and the optimal control simulations 
shown in the “Monetary Policy Strategies ” section of Tealbook, Book B.  However, 
policymakers might question a number of the assumptions that underlie those simulation 
results—including the sizable penalty on changes in the federal funds rate, the assumption that policymakers have symmetric preferences, the absence of any role for 
considerations such as the risk of derailing a fragile housing recovery, and the asymmetric risks posed by proxi mity to the zero lower bound.
1,2  They might further 
observe that readings on 12-month PCE infl ation, both overall and core, are little 
                                                 
1 Under symmetric preferences, policymakers see positive and negative deviations of 
unemployment from the natural rate as equally costly, and also consider positive and negative deviations of 
inflations from 2 percent as equally costly. 
2 Further discussion of the implications of these assumptions is provided in the memo, “Potential 
Implications of Alternative Appro aches to the Timing and Pace of Tigh tening,” by Chri stopher J. Erceg, 
Michael T. Kiley, and Robert J. Tetlow, sent to the Committee on September 5, 2014, as well as the 
“Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B. 
Alternatives

 changed, while wage increases have generally  been modest, and longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable.   
Relatedly, some policymakers may worry that maintaining highly accommodative 
policies for a long period of time could lead to excessive risk-taking in the financial 
sector; they might point to the low levels of realized and im plied volatility in financial 
markets, evidence of reaching-for-yield behavi or, and stretched valuations in some asset 
markets.  However, use of short-term financ ing instruments and indicators of leverage 
remain well below levels observed ahead of the financial crisis.  And while prices of real 
estate and broad equity indexes have risen further, policymakers may still see valuation 
metrics as generally in line with historical norms.  Furthermore, policymakers may be 
concerned that a premature tightening would pose risks to fi nancial stability by impairing 
the economic recovery.  Policymakers may accordingly conclude that ending asset 
purchases at the October meeting and beginni ng to increase the federal funds rate next 
year will appropriately balance the risks to financial stability. 
Market participants would probably no t be surprised by the asset purchase 
decision or forward guidance laid out in Altern ative B.  According to the Desk’s latest 
survey, all but one dealer and one buy-side respondent expect the Committee to announce 
another $10 billion cut in the p ace of asset purchases next week and are virtually certain 
of that outcome.  Most respondents did not anticipate any major changes to the Committee’s forward guidance in September, al though a few pointed to a possibility that 
the “considerable time” language may be modified at this meeting or in the near future.  
With regard to the statement’s description of  the economic situation, most dealers did not 
anticipate changes to the stat ement’s language other than modest updates of its summary 
of current conditions; a couple of dealers, how ever, expected the Committee to remove or 
modify the language indicating that there re mains significant underutilization of labor 
resources.  Accordingly, a statement along th e lines of Alternativ e B would likely cause 
little change in asset prices.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may judge that the stated goals of the Committee’s current program 
of asset purchases—a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a 
context of price stability—have been achieved.  Furthermore, some policymakers may be 
convinced that a solid and dur able expansion in economic ac tivity is underway, and that 
this expansion likely will reduce any remaining slack in labor markets fairly quickly.  In 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 support of this view, th ey might cite the broad-based a nd swifter-than-e xpected reduction 
in unemployment, including long-term unempl oyment, so far this year.  Accordingly, 
these policymakers may judge it appropriate to  conclude asset purchases by the end of 
September. 
More generally, some policymakers may be concerned that ma intaining the policy 
stance articulated by the Committee in its recent statements would be overly 
accommodative.  Abstracting from recent ups and downs in reported inflation, and with 
longer-run expected inflation remaining near 2 percent, policymakers may see inflation as 
much more likely to run at or above 2 percent than  persistently below that rate.  They 
may worry that a trajectory for the federal funds rate similar to that in the Tealbook 
baseline forecast would create an  appreciable risk that inflat ion might persistently exceed 
the Committee’s longer-run goal in coming years,  possibly even more than shown in the 
alternative scenario “Higher Inflation with Unanchored Inflation Expectations” in the 
“Risks and Uncertainty” s ection of Tealbook, Book A.  These policymakers might 
emphasize that most simple policy rule prescr iptions and the optimal control simulations, 
as presented in the “Monetary Policy Stra tegies” section of Tealbook, Book B, call for 
policy tightening to begin immediately.  Mo reover, some participants may view the 
moderate strengthening in the growth of cr edit to households and nonfinancial businesses 
that has occurred this year as an indication that the Co mmittee’s accommodative interest-
rate and balance-sheet policies are beginning to generate a br oad-based increase in credit 
supply that will eventually prove inflationary if those policies are not shifted toward more 
neutral settings relativ ely soon.  Some participants may also view high stock market 
valuations, low credit spreads, and very low le vels of implied volatili ty as reflecting the 
highly accommodative stance of mo netary policy and potentially  posing risks to financial 
stability.  For all these reasons, participants may deem it appropriate to raise the federal 
funds rate sooner than under Alternative B,  and so find the proposed changes to the 
forward guidance in the fifth paragr aph of Alternative C desirable.  
Furthermore, policymakers may perceive some restraining effects from fiscal 
policy on economic growth—possi bly along the lines of the box “Fiscal Policy Restraint 
and Government Budget Conditions” in Tealbook, Book A.  But they may deem these effects to be sufficiently small to warrant dropping from the stat ement the previously-
used reference to restraining effects from fiscal policy, as proposed in the first paragraph 
of Alternative C.

 Based on the Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and buy-side firms, a 
decision to adopt a statement like Alternative C would surprise market participants, as 
none of the respondents to those surveys expect asset purchases to be terminated at this 
meeting.  The announcement of an immediate termination of the Committee’s current 
program of asset purchases in combinati on with Alternative C’s modified policy 
guidance likely would lead market participants to pull forward their forecasts of the date 
at which the Committee will first increase its targ et for the federal funds rate.  In addition, 
the expected federal funds rate path for th e subsequent tighteni ng phase might steepen, 
particularly if the changes announced in Alternative C were interpreted as implying a shift in the Committee’s reaction function and if  the reference to a diminishing rate of 
underutilization of labor resources was taken to signal a larger-than-expected 
improvement in the Committee’s assessment of the labor market.  In response, medium- 
and longer-term real interest rates would rise, equity prices and inflation compensation 
likely fall, and the dollar appreciate.  However, if investors read the statement in 
Alternative C as reflecting a more optimistic assessment of the outlook for economic 
growth, equity prices would not fall as much or could even rise, and inflation 
compensation might increase.  The shift in policy expectations might be accompanied by 
a rise in the volatility of fixed-income instruments and ot her securities, as  investors could 
become more uncertain about the timing and pace of normalization.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
In light of recent softness in the inflation data, some policymakers may worry that 
the pickup in inflation seen in the second quart er will prove short-lived, and that inflation 
will remain significantly below 2 percent over the medium term.  Participants might point to measures of inflation compensation deri ved from TIPS, which have declined toward 
the bottom of the range of values recorded over the last few years.  While policymakers 
may regard current levels of inflation compen sation as still consiste nt with stable longer-
term inflation expectations, they might also see the decline in inflation compensation as 
suggesting greater odds that inflation expecta tions will become unanchored.  If expected 
inflation were to drift do wn, mutually reinforcing dynamics could arise between 
declining inflation expectations, inflati on slowing further, and economic activity 
remaining weak.
3  Policymakers who attach a sizabl e probability to such outcomes may 
                                                 
3 In particular, policymakers may be concerned about possibly unstable inflation dynamics that 
might even go beyond the alternative paths for long-term inflation expectations shown in the memo, 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 see merit in a statement like Alternative A because it seeks to quell such risks by 
introducing an explicit inflation floor into the Committee’s forward guidance. 
Some policymakers may also be concerned th at, over the first ha lf of this year, 
economic activity expanded only modestly, on net,  and that the future pace of expansion 
may not be all that strong.  In addition, they might find it troubling th at the housing 
recovery is not regaining mo mentum and that improvements in mortgage finance have 
stalled in spite of highly accommodative fina ncial conditions.  Because of these worries 
about the strength of the economic recovery, participants may believe that it would be 
appropriate to provide update d, state-dependent, forward guida nce regarding the path of 
the federal funds rate in order to provide mo re explicit scope for extending the period of 
highly accommodative policy. 
Policymakers may note that recent payroll gains fell well short of expectations 
and thus may remain skeptical about whether further significant gain s in employment can 
be achieved in the absence of a persistent pickup in growth of economic activity.  They 
also may see the low labor force participation rate, the still-high share of part-time 
workers for economic reasons, and the relativ ely moderate gains in hourly compensation 
as indicative of weaker underlying labor market conditions than is evident from the 
unemployment rate and payroll employment  figures, possibly along the lines of the 
alternative scenario “Higher Trend Labor Force Participation Rate” in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, Book A. 
While participants may want to provid e additional monetary accommodation, they 
may nonetheless judge that there has been a sufficiently substantial improvement in the 
outlook for labor markets since the inception of the current asset purchase program to 
bring the program to a close relatively soon, possibly after the Oct ober meeting.  To the 
extent that the proposed infl ation floor also pushes out th e date on which reinvestments 
are expected to end or begin to be phased out, the change in forward guidance would also 
amplify the accommodation provided by the Committee’s holdings of longer-term 
securities.  Participants may thus prefer to add an inflation floor to the statement language 
in conjunction with a signal that asset purchas es will likely end in October, but with a 
reaffirmation that asset purchases are not on a preset course and that future reductions in

 the pace of purchases remain  conditional on incoming data, as proposed in the fourth 
paragraph of Alternative A. 
Market participants would be surprised by an announcement like Alternative A.  
In response to the new inflation-oriented forw ard guidance for the policy rate in the fifth 
paragraph of Alternative A, ma rket participants might push back the date of the first 
increase in the federal funds rate, perhaps appreciably; a flattening of the expected path 
for the federal funds rate after liftoff is also conceivable.  After an announcement along 
the lines of Alternative A, medium- and longer-term real interest rates would likely 
decline, inflation compensation and equity  prices might rise, and the dollar could 
depreciate.  However, insofar as investors in terpreted a statement like that in Alternative 
A as reflecting a more downbeat assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation, equity prices would not rise as much or could even decline, and inflation 
compensation could fall.  The shift in policy ex pectations might also make investors more 
uncertain about the timing and pace of normalization, leading to incr eased volatility of 
fixed-income instrument s and other securities.

 DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued after the July meeting appears on the next page, 
followed by drafts for a September directive that correspond to each of the three policy 
alternatives.  Each draft in cludes changes to make it consistent with th e corresponding 
postmeeting statement. 
The directive for Alternatives A and B instructs the Desk to purchase, beginning 
in October, longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month and 
to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a p ace of about $5 billion 
per month.  The draft directive for Alterna tive C instructs the Desk to conclude the 
current purchase program by the end of Septem ber.  All three of the draft directives 
instruct the Desk to maintain the current polic y of reinvesting principal payments from its 
holdings of agency debt and agency mortga ge-backed securities in agency mortgage-
backed securities and of rolling over matu ring Treasury securities into new issues.

September 11, 2014Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has prepared a projection of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and 
income statement that co rresponds to Alternative B.1 The projection reflects the staff’s 
assumptions about the trajecto ries of various components of the balance sheet. In 
particular, the projection embeds the assump tion that, at the time that the process of 
normalization of the size of the balance sheet begins, the SOMA portfolio will shrink 
only through paydowns of prin cipal from agency MBS and redemptions of maturing 
Treasury securities and agency debt. 
In the projection, monthly purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and 
agency MBS are each reduced by another $5 billion at the beginning of October, and by 
$10 and $5 billion (to zero), respectively, following the October meeting.  Under this 
assumption, which is the same as the policy assumption in the staff baseline forecast 
presented in Tealbook, Book A, purchases cumulate to a bit less than $1.5 trillion over 
2013 and 2014, an amount that is unchanged from Alternative B and the staff forecast in 
the July Tealbook.2 
As shown in the exhibit, “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” total 
assets peak at about $4.5 trillion in the firs t quarter of 2015, with $2.5 trillion in Treasury 
securities holdings and $1.7 trillion in agency MBS holdings.3 Reserve balances peak at 
about $2.9 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2014.  We assume that the first increase in the 
target federal funds rate is in the seco nd quarter of 2015, consis tent with the staff 
1 As there are only small differences in the purcha se programs across Alterna tives A, B, and C, the 
contours of the balance sheet projections would be similar for the other two alternatives. The size of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would normalize a bit later under Alternative A because the period over 
which the federal funds rate remains at the effective lower bound, and hence the period over which 
reinvestments continue, is stretched further into the future by the forward guidance added under that 
alternative. There would be no material difference in the projection for Alternative C relative to 
Alternative B. 
2 Including MBS purchases in the fourth quarter of 2012, under the flow-based asset purchase 
program, the FOMC purchased $790 billion of Treasury securities and $800 billion of MBS securities, or 
about $1.6 trillion in total. 
3 Total assets peak after the end of the purchase program because of delayed settlement of agency 
MBS purchases.

Projectionseconomic forecast and unchanged from Alternative B of the July Tealbook.  We also 
assume that the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at 
$100 billion through the end of 2018 and then falls to zero by the end of 2019.4 Six 
months after the federal funds rate is raised above its eff ective lower bound, all 
reinvestments and rollovers of securities are assumed to cease; at that time, the SOMA 
portfolio begins to contract.5  The size of the portfolio is normalized by the fourth quarter 
of 2021, the same as in the July Tealbook.6 The balance sheet then begins to expand, 
with increases in SOMA holdings essentia lly matching the growth of currency in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital an d surplus.  Total assets are $2.5 trillion at 
the end of 2025, with about $2.4 trillion in to tal SOMA securities holdings, of which 
$620 billion are agency MBS. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,” shows the implications of these 
balance sheet developments for Federal Reserv e income. Interest income rises over the 
period in which reinvestment purchases continue; subsequently, it declines for a number of years as the SOMA portfolio contract s through redemptions and paydowns of 
principal. Although interest expense is currently quite small, it climbs over the next few 
years as the interest rate on reserve balances increases while those balances are still quite 
elevated; annual interest expe nse peaks at $70 billion in 2017.
7 Putting these pieces 
together, annual remittances reach about $100 bi llion this year and then slowly decline 
4 Use of ON RRPs results in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a decline in 
reserve balances and a corresponding increase in reverse repurchase agreements—but does not produce an 
overall change in the size of the balance sheet. The current projections also embed the assumption that 
RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts will remain around $110 billion 
throughout the projection period. We assume that term deposits are not used during normalization; their 
use would also result in a shift in the composition of liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and a 
corresponding increase in term deposits. 
5 Projected prepayments of agency MBS reflect interest rate projections as of September 8, 2014. 
6 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
its longer-run trend level, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve 
capital and a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of 
the size of the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be 
necessary to conduct monetary policy in the long run; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to 
be $100 billion. 
7 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains 25 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound. In addition, we assume that, once firming of the 
policy rate begins, the spread between the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 25 
basis points.  In particular, the rate paid on reserve balances is between 12.5 and 17.5 basis points above the 
federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate is 12.5 to 7.5 basis points below it, with the spread sufficient to 
create conditions in which trading in the federal funds market is at the projected federal funds rate.

Projectionsover the following four years. Annual remittances reach their trough at about $15 billion 
in 2018, about $10 billion higher than in the July Alternative B scenario; no deferred 
asset is recorded.8 The Federal Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 
2025 are about $925 billion, approximately $175 b illion above the staff estimate of the 
level that would have been observed had there been no asset purchase programs.9 
The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA portfolio is influenced 
importantly by the level of interest rates. The staff estimates that the portfolio was in an 
unrealized gain position of about $120 billion as of the end of August 2014.10 Reflecting 
the assumed rise in interest rates over the ne xt several years, the position is projected to 
shift to an unrealized loss in the near te rm and projected year-end unrealized losses peak 
at $325 billion in 2016. At the peak, $175 billion of the unrealized loss can be attributed 
to the Treasury portfolio and $150 billion to the MBS portfolio. The unrealized loss 
position narrows through the remainder of the forecast period, as securities acquired 
under the large-scale asset purch ase programs mature and new s ecurities are added to the 
portfolio at par. 
As shown in the exhibit, “Projections for the 10-Year Treasury Term Premium 
Effect,” the effect of the Federal Reserve’s cumulative increase in asset holdings on the 
term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasu ry yield in the third quarter of 2014 is 
negative 122 basis points, about the same as in the July Tealbook. Over the projection 
period, the term premium effect diminishes to ward zero at a pace of about 5 basis points 
per quarter, reflecting the actual and anticipated norma lization of the portfolio. 
As shown in the final exhibit, “Projecti ons for the Monetary Base,” the monetary 
base increases through the middle of 2015 becau se the purchase program is accompanied 
by additions to reserve balances. Once the normalization process begins, the monetary 
base shrinks through 2021, primarily becau se redemptions of securities cause 
corresponding reductions in reserve balanc es.  Starting around mid-2022, after reserve 
8 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  
9 The staff estimate is obtained by linear interpolation from 2006 to 2025 based on actual 2006 
income and projected 2025 income.

Projections
11 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization. If, for example, the FOMC employs additional reverse repurchase agreements or term 
deposits to drain reserves during normalization, the projected level of reserve balances and the monetary 
base could decline quite markedly in the out-years of th e projection. In this projection, an ON RRP facility 
is assumed and, therefore, the monetary base is lo wer until 2019 (when the facility is phased out) than it 
would otherwise be.  Because the size of the ON RRP program is small in relation to reserve balances, the 
overall contours of the monetary ba se are not greatly affected.

In recent years, M2 has grown considerably faster than would have been 
anticipated based on its hist orical relationship with nominal GDP and the opportunity 
cost of holding money.  However, the staff projects that this period of unusual strength in 
M2 growth is likely to end and that the growth of M2 will decline markedly over the 
forecast horizon, even turning negative for a tim e.  This forecast trajectory for M2 growth 
reflects an expected increase in the opportunity cost of holdi ng M2 balances arising from 
the projected firming of monetary policy.12 Compared with last round, the staff forecast 
for M2 growth is somewhat higher over most of the forecast period.  After assessing 
recent regulatory developments, staff judged that depository institutions may see deposit 
liabilities as a more attractiv e funding source, compared with other liabilities, than was 
the case in the past. Consequently, sta ff lowered its projection of the amount of 
exceptional M2 balances that is likely to unwind as the economy continues to recover.13 
12 The three-month Treasury bill rate is assumed to begin rising in 2015:Q1—one quarter earlier than the 
time at which the staff projects the federal funds rate will be raised above its effective lower bound. 
Subsequently, the Treasury bill rate is assumed to con tinue rising through the end of the projection period, 
implying an increasing opportunity cost of holding M2 balances. 
13 With the introduction of the Basel III Liquidity C overage Ratio, depository institutions may prefer 
deposits to many other means of funding because the run-off rate for retail deposits used in the calculation 
of the liquidity coverage ratio is low relative to that of many other liabilities. Of course, there is 
uncertainty regarding this assessment, and other regulatory developments, such as higher capital 
requirements, might tend to constrain the growth of bank balance sheets and deposits.
