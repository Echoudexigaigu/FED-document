The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from five policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an inertial versio n of the Taylor (1999) rule, a 
first-difference rule, and a nominal income targeting rule.1  These prescriptions take as 
given the staff’s baseline projec tions for real activity and in flation in the near term.  
(Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of the rules are discussed 
below.)  As the table shows, all but one of the simple rules prescribe an immediate 
increase in the funds rate.  The Taylor (1993)  and the Taylor (1999) rules call for sizable 
increases.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule a nd the first-difference rule prescribe smaller 
increases in the near term, to  about ½ percent in the second quarter of 2015.  In contrast, 
the nominal income targeting rule calls for negative policy rates in the near term.  These negative values arise because the nominal inco me targeting rule re sponds not only to the 
remaining output gap and the current level of (PCE) inflation, but also to the cumulative 
shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level it would have reached ha d it grown at a pace 
of 2 percent per year since the fourth quarter  of 2007; on average, the growth rate of the 
GDP deflator has fallen short of 2 percent by nearly ½ percentage point per year since 2007, leading to a cumulative shortfall of about 3½ percent. 
The rules’ near-term prescriptions are a litt le higher than in October, reflecting a 
slightly narrower output gap and a small upward revision to core inflation.  As explained in Tealbook, Book A, the staff now projects the output gap to close in the middle of 2016, 
about two quarters earlier than in October.  The staff projection for core PCE inflation in 
the medium term is little change d from the previous Tealbook.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also re ports the Tealbook-consistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model with 
adjustments to reproduce the staff’s baseline fo recast.  This measure is an estimate of the 
real federal funds rate that would, if maintaine d, return output to potential in 12 quarters.  
The estimated r*, at –0.91 percent,  is about 40 basis points above the actual real federal 
funds rate.  Reflecting the staff’s reassessm ent of slack in the economy, the current 
estimate of r* is also about 40 basis points higher than it was in the October Tealbook.

 The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the outpu t gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, under the assumption that the federal 
funds rate is subject to an effective lowe r bound of 12½ basis points.  The exhibit also 
displays the implications of following the baseline monetary policy assumptions adopted 
in the current staff forecast.2  In forming its baseline forecast, the staff has assumed that 
the federal funds rate rema ins at its effective lower bound until the second quarter of 
2015—the same date as in the previous  Tealbook—and subsequently follows the 
prescriptions of the inertial Taylor (1999)  rule.  The lag between the end of the 
Committee’s asset purchase program and the firs t increase in the federal funds rate is 
intended to reflect the “considerable time” fo rward guidance in the statement issued by 
the Committee in October.  After departi ng from its effective lower bound, the federal 
funds rate increases a little more than ¼ percen tage point per quarter to reach 3 percent in 
late 2017.  The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate climbs 
to about 4 percent in 2020 before eventually  returning to its longer-run normal level of 
3¾ percent. 
With the exception of the nominal income targeting rule, all of the policy rules 
call for tightening to begin immediately.3  The Taylor (1993) and the Taylor (1999) rules 
produce paths for the real federal funds rate  that lie significan tly above the Tealbook 
baseline over the next few years, leading to somewhat higher unemployment rates but 
similar paths for inflation.  The first-difference rule calls for a somewhat higher real federal funds rate through mid-2017 than the Tealbook baseline.  However, this initially 
tighter policy is outweighed by a relatively easier stance of monetary policy later in the 
decade and beyond, resulting in lower medium- a nd longer-term real in terest rates that 
lead to a notable undershooting of the natural rate of unempl oyment later in the decade.  
Greater resource utilization in the future also  boosts inflation in th e short run under this 
rule via price- and wage-set ters’ anticipation of these stronger economic conditions.  
Under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the real federal funds ra te initially rises 
above its baseline path because the federal f unds rate departs from its effective lower 
                                                 
2 The policy rule simulations discussed here and below incorporate the macroeconomic effects of 
the FOMC’s asset holdings from the large-scale asset purchase programs. 
3 Unlike the Tealbook baseline, the simulations employing the five policy rules make no attempt to 
account for the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the start of policy firming.  Policy rule 
simulations that take account of this guidance are discussed below.

 bound one quarter earlier than in the Tealbook ba seline.  However, the difference is too 
small and dissipates too rapidly to have a materi al effect on the real longer-term rates that 
influence economic activity in the model, so  macroeconomic outcomes are virtually the 
same as those under the Tealbook baseline. 
In contrast to the other simple rules, th e nominal income targeting rule prescribes 
a later departure from the effective lower bound than the Tealbook baseline.  This rule 
keeps the federal funds rate within the current target rang e through the second quarter of 
2016 and generates a real federal funds rate that runs persistently below the baseline path 
for the rest of the decade, thereby leading to  stronger real activ ity.  Under this rule, 
inflation runs slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective for several years 
starting in 2017, as the rule seek s to compensate for the cumula tive shortfall of growth in 
the GDP deflator from a 2 percent annual ra te since the end of 2007.  Nevertheless, the 
inflation path generated by the rule is clos er to the 2 percent objective until 2019 than is 
the path under the Tealbook baseline. 
The results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to that rule in the future, 
and that the private sector fully understands  the policy that will be pursued and its 
implications for real activity and inflation.  These assumptions play a particularly critical 
role in the case of the nominal income targ eting rule and the firs t-difference rule, which 
generate outcomes in which unemployment runs  markedly below the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate, even after inflation has moved above the Committee’s longer-run goal. 
The third exhibit, “Policy Rule Simu lations with an Unemployment Rate 
Threshold,” reports results obtained when each policy rule is subjec t to an unemployment 
rate threshold intended to capture the Co mmittee’s “considerable time” guidance in a 
data-dependent manner.4  Under current conditions, imposing the unemployment rate 
threshold delays the departure from the eff ective lower bound by at most one quarter and 
has negligible effects on unemployment and inflation.5 
                                                 
4 An unemployment rate threshold of 5.6 percent was chosen because, in the Tealbook baseline, 
the unemployment rate crosses that level in the quarter before firming begins.  The same unemployment 
rate threshold is adopted in the alternative scenario s shown in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of 
Tealbook, Book A.   
5 When the Tealbook is published late in a quarter—as is the case for this Tealbook—all policy 
rule simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all

Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit keep the federal funds rate at an effective lower bound of 12½ basis
points as long as the unemployment rate is 5.6 percent or more. Thereafter, the federal funds rate follows the
prescriptions of the specified rule. A value of 5.6 percent was chosen because, in the Tealbook baseline, the
unemployment rate crosses that level just before firming begins. In addition, the simulations are based on rules

 The fourth exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy under Commitment,” compares 
optimal control simulations for this Tealbook’s baseline forecast with those reported in 
October.6  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percen t goal, on keeping the unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.7  The concept of optimal control that is employed here 
corresponds to a commitment policy under whic h the decisions that policymakers make 
today are assumed to constrain future policy choices.8 
Compared with the October Tealbook, the optimal control policy now calls for a 
higher path of the federal f unds rate, reflecting the greate r strength in aggregate demand 
in the current forecast.  Despite the tighter policy, the unemployment rate undershoots the natural rate by about the same amount as in October; this pattern reflects the staff’s 
assessment that there is now less slack in the labor market than previously projected.  The 
path for headline inflation in the optimal control exercise over the next year differs somewhat from what it was in October largel y because of modifications in the staff’s 
baseline projection due to recent declines in energy prices. 
The federal funds rate departs from the zero lower bound under optimal control 
policy one quarter earlier than  in the Tealbook baseline and th en increases at about the 
same pace as in the baseline over the next few years, so the federal funds rate from optimal control policy is about ¼ percenta ge point higher than the baseline path on 
average through 2020.
9  Compared to the Tealbook base line, the tighter stance of the 
                                                 
policy rule simulations begin in that quarter.  In this Tealbook, imposing the unemployment rate threshold 
delays departure of the federal funds rate from its e ffective lower bound until the second quarter of 2015—
one quarter after the simulations begin—for every policy rule except the nominal income targeting rule, which is unaffected by the threshold.  In the previous Tealbook, imposing the unemployment rate threshold 
similarly delayed departure from the effective lower bound until the second quarter of 2015, two quarters 
after the simulations began. 
6 The optimal control policy simulations incorporate the assumptions about underlying economic 
conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast.  These simulated policies do not incorporate the 
unemployment rate threshold. 
7 The optimal control simulation rests on the assumption that policymakers minimize a discounted 
sum of squared deviations of inflation from 2 percent, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, and of  squared changes in the federal funds rate. 
8 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in which policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan involving policy choices  that would be suboptimal  at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar. 
9 By contrast, in the October Tealbook, the optimal control paths for the federal funds rate and the 
real 10-year Treasury yield were generally below the baseline paths (not shown).

IMPLICATIONS OF A MISPERCEIVED LONG -RUN REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE  
The policy rule simulations regularly shown in Tealbook embed the assumption 
that if all gaps were closed a nd inflation were running at its target level, the real federal 
funds rate eventually would be equal to  its model-consistent long-run value ( ݎ௅ோ).  
However, by assuming that policymakers know the true value of ݎ௅ோ, the simulations 
neglect the considerable uncer tainty about the value of th e long-run real federal funds 
rate.  Faced with imperfect knowledge, po licymakers may misperceive the value of ݎ௅ோ; 
as a consequence, they may set the policy rate to a level that will eventually be 
discovered to be too high or too low. 
The fifth exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulati ons with a Misperceived Long-Run Real 
Federal Funds Rate,” explores the cost of temporarily over- or underestimating the long-
run value of the real  federal funds rate, ݎ௅ோ, in the inertial Tayl or (1999) rule using 
simulations of the FRB/US model, and comp ares the results with  the Tealbook baseline, 
which follows the prescription of an inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule after the federal funds rate 
departs from its effective lower bound.10  The same unemployment rate threshold used in 
the “Risks and Uncertainty ” section of Tealbook, Book A is also used in these 
simulations.   
The differences in macroeconomic outcomes generated by the misperceptions of 
ݎ௅ோ are roughly symmetric around the outcomes implied by the Tealbook baseline, 
shown by the solid black lines.  The experiment with an overestimated ݎ௅ோ, shown by the 
dashed green line, prescribes a higher federa l funds rate than in the Tealbook baseline 
and, as a result, generates higher unemployment and slightly lower inflation.  In the case 
of an underestimated ݎ௅ோ, shown by the blue dotted line, the rule prescribes a lower 
federal funds rate, generating lower unemploymen t and a slightly higher inflation path.   
While the differences in macroeconomic outcomes are roughly symmetric around 
the Tealbook baseline, the welfare imp lications of the misperceptions of ݎ௅ோ—as 
                                                 
10 In the first period of the simulation, the value of ݎ௅ோ is raised or lowere d, as applicable, by 
1¼ percentage points relative to its value of 1¾ percent in the standard version of the inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule.  The initial deviation is thereafter assumed to gradually decay at a rate of 5 percent per quarter.

 measured by the per-period loss function used in the optimal control exercise discussed 
earlier—are not the same.  The upper-right panel of the exhibit shows the difference 
between the per-period loss fr om over- or underestimating ݎ௅ோ relative to the Tealbook 
baseline.  The policymaker who erroneously hypothesizes that ݎ௅ோ is low experiences 
smaller losses than those incu rred in either the Tealbook baseline or the case in which 
ݎ௅ோ is overestimated.  Eventually, however, higher losses are incurred, beginning in late 
2016.   
The relatively good economic performance for the early years of the simulation in 
which ݎ௅ோ is underestimated is a consequence of  the initial state of the economy.  In 
particular, because unemployment is curren tly above its estimated natural rate and 
inflation is currently belo w target, underestimating ݎ௅ோ – which leads to more 
accommodative policy in the near term – cause s unemployment to reach  its natural rate 
and inflation to return to its 2 percent target  value more quickly than it otherwise would, 
incurring lower losses over the first two y ears.  An overestimation error – which is 
associated with tighter policy in the near term  – leads to a slower return of unemployment 
and inflation to their target values than obs erved in the baseline, leading to higher per-
period losses.  After 2016, the policy prescripti ons derived from an underestimated value 
of ݎ௅ோ generate higher losses than the other cas es almost entirely because of a more 
sizable undershooting of unemploym ent in relation to its natu ral rate rather than any 
overshooting of the 2 percent inflation target.11 
The final four exhibits, “Outcomes unde r Alternative Policies”, “Outcomes under 
Alternative Policies, Quarterly,” “Outcomes under Alternative Policies with an 
Unemployment Rate Threshold,” and “Out comes under Alternativ e Policies with an 
Unemployment Rate Threshold, Quarterly,” tabulate the simulation results for key 
variables under the polic y rules described above. 
                                                 
11 In light of the fairly low sensitivity of infla tion to economic slack embedded in the FRB/US 
model, the effects of either mispercep tion on inflation are relatively small.

Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e selected policy rules used in “Monetary 
Policy Strategies.”  In the table, 	ܴ௧ denotes the effective nominal fe deral funds rate for quarter t, 
while the right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE 
inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate 
for the current period ( gap t), and the forecast of the three-qua rter-ahead annual change in the 
output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ long-run inflation objective, denoted πLR, is 
2 percent.  The nominal income targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap, which is 
defined as the difference between nominal income ݊ݕ௧ (100 times the log of the level of nominal 
GDP) and a target value ݊ݕ∗
௧ (100 times the log of target nominal GDP).  Target nominal GDP in 
2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff’s current estimat e of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied 
by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequent ly, target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points 
per year faster than the staff’s estimate of potential GDP.  These assumptions imply that the 
nominal income gap can be expressed as the sum of  the current estimate of the output gap and the 
shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level it w ould have attained had it grown at a 2 percent 
annual pace since 2007:Q4.1   
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prom inently in recent analysis by Board staff.2  The 
intercepts of these rules are chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent long-run inflation 
objective and a long-run real interest rate, denoted ݎ௅ோ, of 1¾ percent, a value used in the 
FRB/US model.  The same estimate of ݎ௅ோ also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal 
income targeting rule.  The prescriptions of the fi rst-difference rule do not depend on the level of 
the output gap or the long-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).

Near-term prescriptions from the five policy rules are calculated using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a 
right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (1999)  rule, the first-difference rule, and the nominal 
income targeting rule—the lines denoted “P revious Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions 
derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same lagged funds rate value as in the prescripti ons computed for the current Tealbook.  When 
the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, this la gged funds rate value is set equal to the actual 
value of the lagged funds rate in the previous qu arter, and prescriptions are shown for the current 
quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in  a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the 
next quarter, and the lagged policy rate, for each of these rules, including those that use the 
“Previous Tealbook outlook,” is set equal to the average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules use the lagged values from their simulated, 
unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL RATES  
An estimate of the equilibrium real rate a ppears as a memo item in the first exhibit, 
“Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The c oncept of the short-run equilibrium real rate 
underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of th e real federal funds rate  that is consistent 
with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an output projection from FRB/US, the staff’s 
large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.   This estimate depends on a very broad array 
of economic factors, some of which take the fo rm of projected values of the model’s exogenous 
variables.  The memo item in the exhibit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of r*, which 
is generated after the paths of e xogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they 
match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the outpu t gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the 
extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook, Book B, publication date. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
previous Tealbook projection.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter.  However, wh en the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all 
of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three alternative draft FOMC statements—labeled A, B, 
and C—for the Committee’s consideration.  In addition to providing different 
possibilities for characterizing incoming info rmation and the outlook, these alternatives 
offer a variety of options for forward gui dance regarding the federal funds rate. 
With regard to forward guidance, Altern ative B provides new language that notes 
the Committee’s judgment, based on its curre nt assessment of economic and financial 
information, that it “can be patient in beginning to norma lize the stance of monetary 
policy.”  The Committee would also state that  the new guidance is consistent with the 
language in the October statement that indi cated the Committee’s ex pectation that it 
likely would be appropriate to keep the curren t target range for the federal funds rate in 
place “for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program.”  In 
addition, Alternative B would append “in Oct ober” to the “considerable time” language 
to make clear that the Committee’s view a bout the likely time of liftoff has not changed 
appreciably since it met in October.  (H aving made the point in December, the 
Committee would presumably drop the “cons iderable time” language from future 
statements.) 
Both Alternatives A and C provide two op tions regarding forward guidance.  In 
one option under Alternative C,  “for a considerable time” is replaced by “for a time,” 
thereby signaling that the firs t increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is 
likely to occur sooner than the Committee antici pated in October.  The other option under 
Alternative C would more dir ectly communicate this message  by stating that “economic 
conditions will soon warrant an in crease in the target range for the federal funds rate.”  In 
Alternative A, one of the options would retain “for a considerable time” without 
anchoring it to the end of asset purchases.   The other option would replace “for a 
considerable time” with language indicating th e Committee’s judgment that “it needs to 
be [ highly ] patient in beginni ng to normalize the stance of monetary policy in order to 
ensure that inflation returns to the 2 percen t objective at an appropr iately rapid pace.”  
This option would also give policymakers the choice of adding the cl ause “and to reverse 
recent declines in longer-term infla tion expectations” after “rapid pace.” 
Under each alternative, the Committee would repeat its previously-stated 
intention to take a “balanced approach” when  it begins to remove policy accommodation.

 Under Alternatives A and B, the Committee would also reiterate that it “currently 
anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, 
economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate 
below levels the Committee views as normal in  the longer run.”  In Alternative C, this 
sentence is rephrased to indi cate that the federal funds rate may not remain below its 
longer-run normal level after the Co mmittee’s objectives are achieved.  
In its summary of current economic conditions, the Committee would, under all 
three alternatives, characteri ze the pace of economic activity as “moderate.”  All of the 
draft statements note further improvement in labor market conditions.  Under Alternative 
A, the Committee would characterize labor market conditions as having improved “somewhat” further, while under Alternative C the modifier “somewhat” would be omitted.  Alternative B offers the choice of including or excluding “somewhat.”  Under 
Alternatives B and C, the Committee would stat e that underutilization of labor resources 
“continues to diminish.”  In contrast, under Alternative A, the Committee would again 
point to “gradually diminishing”  underutilization.  In all th ree alternatives, the Committee 
would state that household spending is rising moderately, business fixed investment is 
advancing, and the housing recovery remains slow.  Under Alternatives A and B, the 
Committee would reaffirm that it expects moderate economic growth with labor market indicators moving toward levels consistent with its dual mandate and that it sees the 
“risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.”  
Under Alternative C, the Committee would st ate that it expects moderate economic 
growth and that it views the risks to economic  activity and the labor market as balanced, 
but it would note that there is “sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to 
support attainment of its  employment objective.” 
Under each of the alternatives, the Committee would continue to acknowledge 
that inflation recently has been running be low the Committee’s longer-run objective, and 
would state that this partly reflects declines  in energy prices.  The Committee would also 
note that market-based measures of infla tion compensation have declined “somewhat 
further.” Alternative A notes that “some surv ey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations also have declined,” while a lternatives B and C stat e that “most survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation e xpectations have remained stable.”  In 
describing the outlook for inflation, under A lternatives A and B the Committee would 
indicate that it expects inflation to rise gra dually back to 2 percent.  Alternative A adds 
the phrase “however, the Committee continue s to monitor inflation and inflation

 expectations closely.”  Under Alternative B the Committee would say that it “continues 
to monitor inflation developments carefull y.”  In contrast, under Alternative C the 
Committee would not include a reference to m onitoring inflation developments.  Instead, 
under Alternative C, the Committee would state th at it “anticipates infl ation will rise to 2 
percent in the medium term,” and indicate that it sees the risks to the outlook for inflation 
as “nearly balanced.” 
With respect to balance sheet policy, unde r all three alternatives, the Committee 
would state that it is maintaining its existing reinvestment policy.  Under both 
Alternatives A and B, the Committee would continue to assert that this policy should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

 OCTOBER 2014  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September 
suggests that economic activity is expandi ng at a moderate pace.  Labor market 
conditions improved somewhat further,  with solid job gains and a lower 
unemployment rate.  On balance, a range of  labor market indicators suggests that 
underutilization of labor resources is gra dually diminishing.  Household spending is 
rising moderately and business fixed investment is advanci ng, while the recovery in 
the housing sector remains slow.  Infl ation has continued to run below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective.  Market-bas ed measures of inflation compensation 
have declined somewhat; survey-based  measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward le vels the Committee judges consistent with 
its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Although inflation in the near term will likely be held down by lower energy prices  and other factors, the Committee judges 
that the likelihood of inflati on running persistently belo w 2 percent has diminished 
somewhat since early this year.  
3. The Committee judges that there has been  a substantial improvement in the outlook 
for the labor market since the inception of  its current asset purchase program.  
Moreover, the Committee continues to s ee sufficient underlying strength in the 
broader economy to support ongoing progr ess toward maximum employment in a 
context of price stability.  Accordingly, th e Committee decided to conclude its asset 
purchase program this month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of 
reinvesting principal payments from its  holdings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities in agency mort gage-backed securities and of rolling over 
maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s 
holdings of longer-term securities at si zable levels, should help maintain 
accommodative financial conditions.  
4. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that th e current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this 
target range, the Committee will asse ss progress—both realized and expected—
toward its objectives of maximum empl oyment and 2 percent inflation.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indicators of infl ation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial developments.  The Committee anticipates, based on its current assessment, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent 
target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its 
asset purchase program this month, especially  if projected inflation continues to run 
below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term 
inflation expectations remain well anchor ed.  However, if incoming information 
indicates faster progress to ward the Committee’s employme nt and inflation objectives

 than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate are likely to o ccur sooner than currently an ticipated.  Conversely, if 
progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.  
5. When the Committee decides to begin to re move policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee may view information received  during the intermeeti ng period as broadly 
consistent with an assessment that domestic economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace 
and that there have been ongoing improvements in labor market conditions.  Indeed, in light of 
the latest readings on the labor market, which sh ow stronger-than-expected job gains and a slight 
further decline in the unemployment rate over  the intermeeting period, members may consider it 
appropriate to indicate in the Committee’s po stmeeting statement that  the underutilization of 
labor resources “continues to diminish” rather than repeating the October statement’s indication 
that underutilization “is gradually diminishing.”  Nonetheless, policymakers may still judge that 
the labor market has not yet fully healed.  Although the unemployment rate has declined 
appreciably over the past year, it remains a bove the 5.2 to 5.5 percen t central tendency of 
participants’ longer-run projections in the September SEP.  Mo reover, policymakers may also 
judge that a range of other measures of labor market conditions —including the below-trend labor 
force participation rate, the elev ated number of part-time worker s who would prefer a full-time 
job, the still-high share of unemployed workers who have been out of work for six months or more, and the modest pace of wage increases—a s suggesting that there is scope for further 
improvement in labor market conditions.  Although policymakers may see the data on economic 
activity as pointing to somewhat faster growth in  the coming year than they had anticipated, they 
may regard developments abroad as pointing to somewhat slower growth  and, on balance, they 
may not view these developments as justifying a substantial change in their modal outlook or 
their assessment that the risks to economic activity and the labor market are broadly balanced.  In 
addition, although policymakers might interpret the re cent softness in consumer prices as largely 
or partly reflecting transitory f actors, they may continue to exp ect that inflation is likely to 
remain below their longer-run ob jective for quite some time.  Consequently, policymakers might 
conclude that a highly accommodative stance of m onetary policy is still a ppropriate in order to 
promote continued improvement in the labor market  and a return of inflation to 2 percent over 
the medium run.  They may therefore choose to ma intain the current target  range for the federal 
funds rate and provide new forward guidance th at is consistent w ith the October FOMC 
statement, as in Alternative B. 
The new forward guidance states that “the Committee judges that it can be patient in 
beginning to normalize the stance of monetary po licy.”  Furthermore, the new language indicates 
that the Committee considers this new forward guida nce to be consistent with the “considerable 
time” language used in the October FOMC statement, which tied the beginning of “a 
considerable time” to the end of the asset pur chase program.  Because market participants

 generally seem to think that “a considerable time” means about six months, the sentence 
indicating consistency with the previous statement might well be taken to mean that the 
Committee continues to anticipate that economic c onditions will make it appropriate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate at the Ap ril meeting or—perhaps more  likely in light of the 
schedule for postmeeting press conferences—at th e June meeting.  Market participants might 
reach a similar conclusion if they look back to early 2004, the prior occasion on which the Committee used “patient” in its forward guidance.
1  Even though the new forward guidance is 
not intended to signify a shift in the Committee’ s policy views, policymakers may regard this 
new guidance as desirable because of its flexibility.  Although the Committee may want to change this language in March or April if th e economy progresses about as expected, the new 
guidance offers the Committee the option to drop “can be patient” sooner if the economy were to show faster-than-expected progr ess toward the Committee’s objectives, or to repeat “can be 
patient” longer if the incoming information indicates slower-than- expected progress. 
Some participants may be concerned that dec lines in market-based measures of inflation 
compensation, coupled with the recent decline in median longer-term inflation expectations from 
the Michigan Survey of Consumers, might i ndicate that the public  has begun to doubt the 
Committee’s commitment to its 2 percent in flation objective; in these circumstances, 
policymakers may regard it as appropriate to introduce forward guidance that implies a lower 
path for the federal funds rate than embodied in  Alternative B.  However, most survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation have remain ed stable, and policymakers may see it as likely 
that the declines in inflation compensation owe prim arily to transitory factors such as the fall in 
energy prices and to movements in risk or liquidi ty premiums, rather than to a fundamental shift 
in inflation expectations.
2  Moreover, they may be worried  that providing more accommodation 
than implied by Alternative B could cause the unem ployment rate to fall t oo far below its natural 
rate and ultimately lead to a scenario in which inflation persistent ly exceeds its mandate-
consistent rate and proves costly to move back  to that rate.  Alternatively, some policymakers 
                                                            
1 In January and March 2004, the statement indicated the Committee’s expectation that it could be “patient 
in removing policy accommodation.”  In  its May 2004 statement,  the Committee changed its forward guidance in a 
manner that signaled that it was poised to raise the policy rate, dropping the use of the word “patient” and indicating 
that policy accommodation could be removed at “a pace that is  likely to be measured.”  Beginning in June 2004, the 
Committee raised the federal funds rate at  a pace of 25 basis points per meeti ng until the rate reached 5.25 percent in 
June 2006.  With this prior episode in mind, market participants might well infer that the “patient” language, if 
adopted at the December 2014 FO MC meeting, suggests that the first increase in the fede ral funds rate target will 
take place in June, especially in light  of the fact that there is no press conference scheduled to follow the April 
FOMC meeting.  
2The inflation expectations measure from the Michigan Survey of Consumers also is somewhat sensitive to 
large movements in energy prices.

 may be concerned that weakness in economic  activity abroad might have significant 
repercussions for the U.S. economy—especially if that weakness intensif ied, along the lines of 
the “Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar”  scenario in the “Risks and Uncertainty” 
section of Tealbook, Book A.  However, like the staff, policymakers may weigh these concerns 
against the assessment that there has so far been  only a modest spillover of weakness abroad to 
U.S. growth.  Balancing these considerations, policymakers might  conclude that it would be 
premature to alter the Committee’s forward guidance in a way that signals a lower expected path 
for the federal funds rate th an implied by Alternative B. 
In contrast, some policymakers might be inclined to signal that the federal funds rate is 
likely to be raised above the effective lower bound sooner than the Committee had previously 
considered likely to be appropr iate.  These policymakers may judge that, in light of the further 
improvement in labor market conditions in Novemb er, resource slack is di minishing rapidly.  As 
a consequence, they may expect a quicker upturn in  price inflation as the transitory effects of 
lower energy prices dissipate.  These policym akers may be concerned that prolonging near-zero 
policy rates until mid-2015 and maintaining belo w-normal policy rates for some time after the 
economy returns to full employment would risk  pushing the unemployment rate well below 
levels consistent with maximum employment and fuel an undesirably large rise in inflation over 
the medium run.  Even so, policymakers might j udge that inflation expectations remain well 
anchored and that there are as yet few signs of inflationary pr essures building, and so conclude 
that the costs of waiting somewhat  longer before signaling that rate s will increase are likely to be 
small.  Participants also might see the experi ence abroad—most notably in Sweden or Japan, 
where the departure from the effective lowe r bound proved premature and subsequently was 
reversed—as suggesting that it may be better to err on the side of a late r rather than earlier 
commencement of policy firming. 
Some policymakers may worry that stretching out the period of near -zero interest rates 
could further increase incentives for risk-taking in  the financial sector.  However, use of short-
term financing instruments and indicators of leve rage remain at moderate levels. Furthermore, 
policymakers may be concerned that a premature tightening of policy also  could pose risks to 
financial stability by undermining the economic recovery, increasing loan losses, and thereby 
impairing the balance sheets of financial inst itutions.  Policymakers may accordingly conclude 
that the forward guidance in Alternative B, by sign aling a likely increase in the federal funds rate 
around the middle of next year, a ppropriately balances the risks to financial stability while 
supporting the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives.

 Based on the Desk’s Survey of Primary Deal ers, the median expectation for the most 
likely timing of the first increase in the fede ral funds rate is June , though many dealers view 
dates later than June as most likely.  In addition, dealers, on av erage, assign roughly even odds to 
a change in the forward guidance being made at this meeting but al so attach significant 
probability to a change at the March 2015 meeting.  In particular, many dealers expect that the 
“considerable time” language will be replaced with more data-dependent language or less 
calendar-specific language such as “patient.”  Accordingly, the new language in Alternative B may not surprise many market participants.  It may cause, however, market participants’ 
expectations for the timing of the first increas e in the federal funds rate to become more 
concentrated in the second quarter of 2015.  In par ticular, in light of the sentence in Alternative 
B referring to the consistency of the two approach es to forward guidance, market participants 
who currently anticipate a liftoff date late next year may realize that the “considerable time” 
language was anchored to the end of asset purchases in October.  As a result, these participants 
may shift their expectation for the first rate increa se closer to the middle of  next year.  However, 
the market reaction is difficult to predict with confidence and will depend importantly on the postmeeting press conference and the release of the information from the December Summary of 
Economic Projections. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
In light of the incoming data over the in termeeting period, policymakers may be more 
confident that a solid an d durable expansion in economic activ ity is in progress, an expansion 
that is likely to reduce any remaining economic slack fairly quickly.  In  support of this view, 
they might highlight the large upward revision to GDP growth in the third quarter, the expansion in payroll employment observed in recent months, and the swifter-than-expected decline in the 
unemployment rate this year.  In  addition, they may cite the str onger-than-expected retail sales in 
November as well as continued gains in househol d wealth and income and falling energy prices 
as pointing to a solid pace of consumer spending going forward.  Accordingly, these policymakers may regard it as appropriate to indicat e that the federal funds rate target range is 
likely to be raised soon as in Alternative C. 
More generally, some policymakers may be c oncerned that the anticipated path for the 
federal funds rate implied by the Committ ee’s recent statements would be overly 
accommodative.  Abstracting from recent ups and downs in inflation and focusing on diminishing economic slack, policym akers may judge that, under th e currently antic ipated policy 
rate path, inflation is likely to rise above 2 pe rcent after the transitory  effects of lower energy

 prices subside.  While acknowledging recent declines in market-based measures of longer-term 
inflation compensation, policymakers may be inclined  to regard these declines as transitory and 
view the balance of the evidence, including info rmation from survey measures, as suggesting 
that longer-run expected inflati on has remained stable.  Moreover, they may see a significant 
danger that higher actual inflation could boost ex pected inflation above 2 percent as the labor 
market tightens, and that it will prove costly to  bring inflation back down to mandate-consistent 
levels.  These Committee members might emphasize that the majority of the simple policy rule 
prescriptions and the optimal control simulations, as presen ted in the “Monetary Policy 
Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B, call for an immediate policy tightening.  In addition, 
policymakers may argue that moving the federal funds rate away from the lower bound is the 
most effective step that policymakers can ta ke to reduce risks to financial stability. 
Because of these concerns, some participants may judge it desirable to raise rates soon 
and therefore prefer the option in paragraph C.3 ʹ, which states that “economic conditions will 
soon warrant” an increase in the federal funds rate.  Other participants might also view it as appropriate to signal an earlie r increase in the federal funds rate than that suggested in 
Alternative B, but they may pr efer to wait a little longer th an indicated by paragraph C.3 ʹ, so as 
to avoid a situation in which the federal funds rate  is raised prematurely and subsequently has to 
be lowered.  These participants might prefer th e option in paragraph C.3, in which the “for a 
considerable time” language of the October statement is dropped in favor of “for a time.” 
A statement like that in Alternative C would surprise most market participants.  The 
change in forward guidance, particularly  if the Committee adopted paragraph C.3 ʹ, would be 
unexpected, as the implication that the target range for the federal f unds rate will likely be raised 
in the near future conflicts with the predominant view of market particip ants.  In response to a 
statement like that in Alternativ e C, medium- and longer-term r eal interest rates would likely 
rise, inflation compensation woul d likely fall, equity prices would probably decline, and the 
dollar appreciate.  However, it is also possible that investors would interpret the statement as 
reflecting a more positive outlook fo r economic activity and inflation.  In that case, equity prices 
and inflation compensation would not fall as much or could even rise.     
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some policymakers may view developments since the October meeting as calling for a 
postmeeting statement like either of the two options in Alternative A, which each provide more policy accommodation than Altern ative B.  Paragraph A.3 reta ins “considerable time” without

 anchoring it to the end of the asset purchase program, while paragraph A.3 ʹ indicates that the 
Committee judges that it needs to be patient in beginning to normalize the policy stance in order 
to ensure that inflation returns to 2 pe rcent at an appropria tely rapid pace.   
Policymakers may be concerned that infl ation will remain significantly below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term, undermining the Committee’s 
credibility.  They may point to continuing softness in the infla tion data, further declines in 
market-based measures of inflation compensation, and the drop in median longer-term inflation 
expectations from the Michigan  Survey of Consumers to its lowest level since March 2009.  
They may read the drop in these measures as sugg esting that inflation exp ectations have begun to 
drift down.  Alternatively, they might interpret th e drop in measures of inflation compensation as 
a decrease in inflation risk pr emiums, reasoning that investors see greater odds of scenarios in 
which inflation outcomes below 2 percent are part icularly costly because they occur alongside 
weaker economic activity.  In eith er case, policymakers may perceive  an increased risk that, in 
the absence of greater policy accommodation, longer-run expected inflation could become 
unanchored and move significantly below 2 percent.  They may worry that declining inflation 
expectations would prompt a further slowing of  inflation and a weakening of economic activity, 
perhaps along the lines of the “Lower Long-Term Inflation Expectations” s cenario in the “Risks 
and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, Book A.  C ontaining such risks might be a particular 
concern for policymakers because the effec tive lower bound on policy rates and the Federal 
Reserve’s already-large balance sheet could limit the Committee’s flexibility in responding to 
downside outcomes.  Moreover, with inflation expectations drifting down, policymakers may see little risk that inflation will rise appreciably above 2 percent in coming years, implying that 
highly accommodative policy could be pursued for longer than markets currently expect. 
Some policymakers may judge that, notwithstanding further improvements in payroll 
employment, the economic expansion is disappointi ng in some key respects.  In particular, they 
may point to weak incoming data on business inve stment and residential construction as signs 
that the underlying trend in private domestic de mand is unsatisfactory.  Th ey also may highlight 
the fact that the recovery in  the housing sector remains slow  in spite of highly accommodative 
financial conditions.  Although the recent retail sale s data suggest a pickup in consumer spending 
growth this quarter, they may s ee an appreciable risk of an ou tcome in which this pickup proves 
transitory and output growth next year rises onl y modestly as in the “Weaker Domestic Demand” 
scenario in the “Risks and Uncertainty” s ection of Tealbook, Book A.  In addition, these 
policymakers may see the low labor force participa tion rate, the still-high share of workers with 
part-time jobs for economic reasons, and the mode st gains in hourly compensation, as pointing to

 less improvement in labor market conditions than suggested by the unemployment rate and 
payroll employment figures alone. 
Some participants also may be concerned th at the prospects for domestic output growth 
exceeding that of potential output over coming qua rters have been damaged by weakness in key 
European economies and by the appreciation of the dollar.  Although some of these 
policymakers may have lowered their modal projections for U.S. real activity only a modest 
amount, they may regard the risks to the outlook as having shifted to the downside.  Some other 
policymakers may regard recent developments not only as having increased downside risks but 
also as justifying a meaningful markdow n of the modal projection for growth. 
Some policymakers may prefer paragraph A.3ʹ , because it ties the “patient” language to 
inflation returning back to 2 percent, and additi onally, if policymakers desired, to reversing the 
recent declines in longer-term inflation expectati ons.  Such an option may be seen as desirable 
because it provides assurance to the public and financial markets that the Committee is 
committed to bringing inflation back up to its 2 percent goal.  Other policymakers may prefer 
paragraph A.3, which removes the anchoring of the beginning of “a considerable time” to the 
end of the asset program, because it is a simple way to communicate that the appropriate time for 
increasing the target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be more distant than the 
Committee expected in October.   
An announcement like that in Alternative A would surprise market participants.  
Investors likely would push further into the futu re their expectation of the date of the first 
increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  A flattening of the path that the federal 
funds rate is expected to take  during normalization is also conc eivable.  Accordingly, medium- 
and longer-term real interest ra tes would likely decline, inflati on compensation and equity prices 
might rise, and the dollar could depreciate.  Ho wever, insofar as investors interpreted the 
statement as reflecting a more downbeat asse ssment of the outlook for economic growth and 
inflation, equity prices would not rise as much or could even d ecline, and inflation compensation 
could fall.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has developed proj ections of the Federal Re serve’s balance sheet and 
income statement that correspond to Alternative B.1  The projections reflect the staff’s 
assumptions about the trajecto ries of various components of  the balance sheet.  In 
particular, the projections embed the assump tion that, at the time that normalization of 
the size of the balance sheet begins, th e SOMA portfolio will shrink only through 
paydowns of principal from agency MB S and redemptions of maturing Treasury 
securities and agency debt. 
Monthly additions to the System’s holdi ngs of longer-term Tr easury securities 
and agency MBS ceased at the end of October.2  The box “The SOMA Portfolio after the 
Completion of Asset Purchases” provides some descriptive characteristics of the current 
SOMA portfolio.   
As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” total 
assets peak at about $4.5 trillion this quart er, with nearly $2.5 trillion in Treasury 
securities holdings and $1.8 trillion in agency MBS holdings.3  Reserve balances peak at 
$2.9 trillion.  We assume that the first increase in the target range for the federal funds 
rate will occur in the second quarter of 2015.  In addition, we assume that rollovers of 
maturing Treasury securities, and reinvestment of principal received from agency securities, will cease in the f ourth quarter of 2015.  These assumptions are the same as 
those embedded in the staff economic forecast.   We also assume that the level of 
overnight reverse repurchase agreements ( ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end 
                                                 
1 The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would normalize somewhat later under 
Alternative A than under Alternative B because the peri od over which the federal funds rate remains at the 
effective lower bound, and hence the period over which reinvestments continue, is stretched further into the 
future by the forward guidance adde d under that alternative.  There would be no material difference 
between the projection for Alternative C and that for Alternative B.  
2 Including MBS purchases in the fourth quarter of 2012, the FOMC purchased $790 billion of 
Treasury securities and $800 billion of MBS securities, or  about $1.6 trillion in total, under the flow-based 
asset purchase program. 
3 Total assets peak two months after the end of the purchase program because of delayed 
settlement of agency MBS purchases.

 The SOMA Portfolio  after the Completion  of Asset Purchases   
Over the course of the various large‐scale asset purchase programs  undertaken  by the 
Federal Reserve  since 2008,  as shown in  Figure 1, the domestic SOMA  portfolio has  
grown from $770 billion held in October 2006,  about equal to the amount of currency  
in circulation  at the time,  to about $4.2 trillion as of October 31, 2014, roughly  $3 trillion 
more than currency  in circulation.   While the 2006 portfolio  included  only Treasury  
securities,  the portfolio now  contains  nearly $2.5 trillion  in Treasury  securities,  almost 
$1.8 trillion in agency mortgage ‐backed securities  (MBS), and $40 billion  in agency 
debt securities.1   
In 2006, about a third  of the SOMA  portfolio consisted  of Treasury  bills.  Currently,  
SOMA Treasury security  holdings  consist exclusively  of coupon securities,  reflecting  
the fact that all remaining  securities  with time  to maturity  under three years  were sold 
or allowed to mature during the 2011‐ 2012 maturity  extension  program,  and that 
recent purchases  have had a maturity  of greater than four years.  This shift raised  the 
weighted  average maturity  of Treasury  securities  in the SOMA  from 3.3 years  in 2006 
to 9.7 years now.  In addition,  as shown  in Figure 2, this shift implies  that only about 
$3.5 billion  in Treasury  securities  will mature  before the end of 2015.  The amount  
maturing  picks up notably thereafter,  with roughly $215 billion in SOMA Treasury  
securities  maturing  in 2016, and  another $195 billion  and $370 billion maturing  in 2017 
and 2018, respectively.            
As shown in  Figure 3, agency MBS holdings  consist mostly  of Fanni e Mae and Freddie 
Mac securities,  with the rest accounted  for by Ginnie Mae securities;  the average 
coupon rate is about 3.6 percent.   Nearly half of these securities  were issued in 2013 or 
2014.  While  the timing of principal  repayments  from the Treasury  portfolio is  known, 
the path of principal  payme nts from MBS holdings  is uncertain,  reflecting  uncertainty  
regarding  prepayments  of the underlying  mortgages.   According  to the prepayment  
model used  in the projections,  and taking the staff’s baseline interest rate path  as 
given, the weighted  average maturity  of SOMA MBS holdings  is about 8.3  years.  As 
shown in  Figure 4, about $260 billion of holdings will mature  or prepay in 2015 (the 
assumed period of reinvestment),  after which about $165 billion, $130 billion, and $110 
billion will pay down in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively.   Of course,  if rates rise more 
or less than  in the baseline projection,  prepayments  would be different.  That said,  
regardless  of the uncertain  prepayment  speeds, a sizable  quantity of agency MBS 
holdings will remain  on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet even  at the end of the 
forecast period in 2025.2      
                                                 
1 Although  outright purchases  of Treasury securities  and MBS ended in October  2014, SOMA will 
continue to expand for the next few  months because  of delayed settlement  of MBS purchases.  
2 In its Normalization  Principles  and Plans, published  in September,  the Committee  indicated  
that “limited sales [of agency MBS] might be warranted  in the longer run to reduce  or eliminate  
residual holdings.”

of 2018 and then falls to  zero by the end of 2019.4  With these assumptions, the size of 
the portfolio is normalized in the second quarter of 2021, at wh ich point total assets stand 
at $2.2 trillion, with about $2 trillion in total SOMA securities holdings.5  Total assets 
and securities holdings increas e thereafter, keeping pace with growth in currency in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
The second exhibit, “Income Projections,” shows the implications of the balance 
sheet projections for Federal Reserve income.  Interest income rises over the period in 
which reinvestment purchases continue; subseq uently, it declines for a number of years 
as the SOMA portfolio cont racts through redemptions of maturing Treasury and agency 
debt and paydowns of principal from MBS.  Although interest expens e is currently quite 
small, it climbs over the next few years as the interest rate on reserve balances increases 
while the level of those balances remains quite  elevated; annual interest expense peaks at 
about $60 billion in 2017.6  Putting these pieces together, remittances to the Treasury will 
be about $100 billion this year  but are projected to decline over the next four years.  
Annual remittances reach their trough at about  $20 billion in 2018, modestly lower than 
in the October Alternative B scenario, reflecting the higher fede ral funds rate path in the 
Tealbook baseline; no deferred asset is recorded.7  The Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1 trillion, approximately $200 billion 
                                                 
4 The current projections also embed the assumption that term RRPs will total $300 billion at end-
December 2014 and then fall to  zero thereafter for the remainder of the forecast period.  RRPs associated 
with foreign official and international accounts are assumed to remain around $110 billion throughout the 
projection period.  Use of RRPs results in a shif t in the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities—a 
decline in reserve balances and an equal increase in  reverse repurchase agreements—but does not produce 
an overall change in the size of the balance sheet.  We  assume that term deposits are not used during 
normalization; their use would result in a decline in reserve balances and an increase in term deposits. 
5 The size of the balance sheet is normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to its longer-run 
trend, which is determined largely by currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and a projected 
steady-state level of reserve balances.  Currently, we assu me that the steady-state level will be $100 billion.   
6 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains 25 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound.  In addition, we assume that, once firming of the policy rate begins, the spread between the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 25 
basis points.  Moreover, we assume that the effective federal funds rate will average about 15 basis points 
below the rate paid on reserve balances and ab out 10 basis points above the ON RRP rate.   
7 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.

above the staff estimate of the level that w ould have been observed had there been no 
asset purchase programs.8   
The unrealized gain or loss position of  the SOMA portfolio is influenced 
importantly by the level of interest rates.  Th e staff estimates that the portfolio was in an 
unrealized gain position of about $170 b illion as of the end of November 2014.9  
Reflecting the assumed rise in long-term interest rates over the next  several years, the 
position is projected to shift to an unreali zed loss next year, w ith projected year-end 
unrealized losses peaking at $300 billion in 2017.  At the peak, r oughly $160 billion of 
the unrealized loss can be attributed to the Treasury portfolio and $140 billion to the 
MBS portfolio.  The unrealized loss position narrows through the remainder of the 
forecast period, as securities acquired under the large-scale asset purchase programs 
mature or pay down and new securities are adde d to the portfolio at then-current market 
rates.

term premium embedded in the 10-year Treasu ry yield in the four th quarter of 2014 is 
negative 116 basis points under Alternative B, the same as  in the October Tealbook.  
Over the projection period, the term premium ef fect diminishes at a pace of about 5 basis 
points per quarter, reflecting the proj ected normalization of the portfolio.   
As shown in the final exhibit, “Projecti ons for the Monetary Base,” the monetary 
base increases through the beginning of 2015 because the delayed settlement of prior 
purchases of agency MBS securities results in  additions to reserv e balances.  Once the 
normalization process begins, the monetary base shrinks through 2021, primarily because redemptions of securities cause corresponding reductions in reserve balances.  Starting 
                                                 
8 The staff estimate is obtained by linear interpolation from 2006 to 2025 based on actual 2006 
income and projected 2025 income. 
9 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Report,” available on the Board’s website at

around early 2022, after reserve ba lances are assumed to ha ve stabilized at $100 billion, 
the monetary base begins to expand in line with the increase in currency in circulation. 10  
  
                                                 
10 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  If, for example, the FOMC employs additional reverse repurcha se agreements or term 
deposits to drain reserves during normalization, the projected level of reserve balances and the monetary 
base could decline quite markedly in the out-years of th e projection.  In this projection, an ON RRP facility 
is assumed and, therefore, the monetary base is lo wer until 2019 (when the facility is phased out) than it 
would otherwise be.  Because the size of the ON RRP program is small in relation to reserve balances, the overall contours of the monetary ba se are not greatly affected.

After slowing in the second half of 2014, M2 is expect ed to contract slightly 
through mid-2016, and then to grow slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon.  
This trajectory for M2 reflect s an increase in the opportunity cost of holding M2 balances 
arising from the projected firming of monetary policy.11  The forecast also incorporates a 
judgment that businesses and hous eholds will reallocate a po rtion of their elevated M2 
balances to other investments as the economic  expansion progresses, which will put some 
additional restraint on M2 growth beginning in 2015.12 
 
         
                                                 
11 The three-month Treasury bill rate is assumed to begin rising in 2015:Q1—one quarter earlier than the  
time at which the staff projects the federal funds rate will be raised above its effective lower bound.  
Subsequently, the Treasury bill rate is assumed to continue rising thr ough the end of the forecast period, 
implying an increasing opportunity cost of holding M2 balances. 
12 The staff projects that only a portion of the elevated  M2 balances will be reallocated.  This judgment is 
based on the staff view that as a result of their e xperience during the financial crisis, depositors may 
continue to be quite risk averse in their investment decisions for some time.  In addition, in light of various regulatory developments, depository institutions may see deposit liabilities as a more attractive funding source than other types of funding th an was the case in the past.  Of co urse, there is uncertainty regarding 
this view, and other regulatory developments, such as higher capital requirements, might tend to constrain the growth of banks’ balance sheets and deposits.
