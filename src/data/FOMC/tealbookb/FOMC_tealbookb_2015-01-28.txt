Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from four policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an inertial vers ion of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity and inflation in the near term.  (Medium-term prescriptions 
derived from dynamic simulations of the rules are discussed below.)  As the table shows, 
all of the simple rules prescribe an immediat e increase in the fede ral funds rate.  The 
Taylor (1993) and the Taylor (1999) rules call  for sizable increases in the federal funds 
rate to values near 2 percent or higher.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the first-
difference rule prescribe less-sizable interest -rate increases over th e near term—to a little 
above ½ percent in the second quarter of 2015—because both rules place a considerable 
weight on keeping the federal funds rate close to its lagged value. 
The near-term prescriptions from these rule s are little changed compared with the 
December Tealbook, reflecting largely offsetting e ffects from the staff’s revisions to the 
outlook for real activity and inflation.2  As explained in Tealbook, Book A, and as shown 
in the lower panel of the exhibi t, the staff now projects that th e near-term trajectory of the 
output gap will run about 40 basis points high er than in the previous Tealbook and that 
the output gap will close in the first quarter of 2016.  The staff’s projection for core PCE 
inflation is a little lower in 2015, reflecting recent data, but mostly unchanged thereafter.  The top panel of the first exhibit also repor ts the Tealbook-consistent estimate of the 
equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model with 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules. In the past, the Tealbook 
has also regularly shown prescriptions derived from a nominal income targeting rule that embedded an 
assumption that policymakers seek to make up for the cumulative shortfall of inflation from 2 percent since 
the end of 2007 b y endeavoring to pu sh inflation above th is rate for a time in the future.  As this particular 
calibration of the nominal anchor appears quite dated,  and since an updated calibration of the rule would 
yield prescriptions that, at least over the near term, are roughly similar to those obtained from the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule, t he nominal income targeting rule has been removed from the menu of 
rules whose prescriptions are considered here.  As was the case in the December Tealbook, Book B, the 
nominal income targeting rule (with the nominal anchor dating back to the end of 2007) would prescribe a 
considerably later liftoff from the effective lower bound  than any of the rules shown here or in the staff 
baseline.  
2 Reflecting the lower near-term path for infla tion in the Tealbook forecast and the smaller 
sensitivity of the Taylor (1993) rule to the output gap compared with that of the other rules, near-term 
prescriptions from the former have fallen by almost 25 basis points, while prescriptions from the other rules 
have changed by no more than 15 basis points.

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook outlook" report rule prescriptions based
 on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the realized value for the policy rate last quarter. 
2. Estimates of  r* may change at the beginning of a quarter even when the staff outlook is unchanged because the twelve-quarter horizon covered by 
the calculation has rolled forward one quarter.  Therefore, whenever the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, the memo includes an extra column 
labeled "Current Quarter Estimate as of Previous Tealbook" to facilitate comparison with the current Tealbook estimate. 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 PCE Prices Excluding Food and Energy

adjustments to reproduce the staff’s baseline fo recast.  This measure is an estimate of the 
real federal funds rate that would, if maintaine d, return output to potential in 12 quarters.  
Reflecting the staff’s updated assessment of sl ack in the economy, the current estimate of 
r*, at –0.56 percent, is 40 basis points higher than th e corresponding value derived from 
the staff’s outlook in December.  As has been  true for about a year now, the estimated 
value for r* also exceeds the actual real federa l funds rate, current ly by about 75 basis 
points. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the outpu t gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, under the assumption that the federal 
funds rate is subject to an effective lower bound of 12½ basis points.  The results for each 
rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend importantly on the 
assumptions that policymakers will adhere to th e rule in the future, and that the private 
sector fully understands the pol icy that will be pursued and its implications for real 
activity and inflation. 
The exhibit also displays the implicati ons of following the baseline monetary 
policy assumptions adopted in the current staff forecast.3  In forming its baseline forecast, 
the staff has assumed that the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound until 
the second quarter of 2015—the same quarter as  in the previous Tealbook.  However, the 
staff moved the specific timing of the first in crease to the June meeting from the April 
meeting.4  After departing from its effectiv e lower bound, the federal funds rate is 
assumed to rise at a pace prescribed by an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy 
rule.  The prescribed path for the federal funds  rate initially increas es a little more than 
¼ percentage point per quarter and reach es 3½ percent in ea rly 2018; the pace of 
tightening subsequently slows, and the federa l funds rate climbs to about 4 percent in 
2020 before eventually returning to its longer-run normal level of 3¾ percent. 
3 The dynamic simulations discussed here and below incorporate the assumptions about 
underlying economic conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, including the macroeconomic effects 
of the Committee’s asset holdings from the large-scale asset purchase programs. 
4 As explained in Tealbook, Book A, the slight delay of the first rate rise leaves the projected 
funds rate in the near term a little lower than in th e previous forecast; by the fourth quarter of 2017, 
however, the funds rate is almost 20 basis points higher than in the December Tealbook, primarily 
reflecting the positive revision to the output gap in the medium-term projection.

All of the policy rules in these dynamic simulations cal l for tightening to begin 
immediately.5  The Taylor (1993) and the Taylor (1999) rules produce pa ths for the real 
federal funds rate that lie significantly above the Tealbook baseline over the next few 
years, leading to somewhat higher unempl oyment rates but similar trajectories for 
inflation.  Under the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the real fede ral funds rate initially rises 
above its baseline path because the federal f unds rate departs from its effective lower 
bound one quarter earlier than in the Tealbook ba seline.  However, the difference is too 
small and dissipates too rapidly to have a mate rial effect on the real longer-term interest 
rates that influence econom ic activity in FRB/US, so macroeconomic outcomes are 
essentially the same in this case as those under the Tealbook baseline. 
The first-difference rule initially calls for a somewhat higher real federal funds 
rate through 2017 than in the Tealbook baseline .  However, because the first-difference 
rule responds to the expected ch ange in rather than the level of the output gap, declines in 
the output gap later in the decade—expected to occur after the in itial overshooting of 
output relative to its potential level—generate expectations of federal funds rates that are 
below baseline during this period.  On net, re al longer-term interest rates generated by the 
first-difference rule are lower than those unde r the baseline path for the entire projection 
period, prompting greater resource utilization a nd boosting inflation even in the near term 
via forward-looking expectations.  Overall, this rule generates outcomes late in the 
decade that are farther from the Committee’s objectives for inflation and unemployment 
than the other rules. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy under Commitment,” compares 
optimal control simulations for this Tealbook’s baseline forecast with those reported in 
December.  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percen t goal, on keeping the unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.6  The concept of optimal control that is employed here 
5 Unlike the Tealbook baseline, the simulations employing the four policy rules make no attempt 
to account for the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the start of policy firming.  However, as shown 
in the December Tealbook, policy rule simulations that take account of this guidance by imposing an 
unemployment rate threshold only delay the departure from the effective lower bound by at most one 
quarter with negligible effects on unemployment and inflation. 
6 In previous Tealbooks, it had been the case that lowering the penalty on changes in the federal 
funds rate led to outcomes under optimal control with a later departure of the federal funds rate from the 
effective lower bound compared to  the standard case of optimal c ontrol.  However, under current 
conditions—in particular since the baseline path for the unemployment rate gap closes in about a year—

corresponds to a commitment policy under whic h the decisions that policymakers make 
today are assumed to constrain future policy choices.7 
Compared with the December Tealbook, op timal control policy calls for a higher 
path of the federal funds rate, reflecting the greater strength in aggregate demand 
embedded in the current forecast.  Despite the tighter policy, the unemployment rate 
undershoots the staff’s estimate of the natura l rate over the first few years of the 
simulation by a little more than in December, reflecting the staff’s assessment that there 
is now less slack in the labor market than pr eviously projected.  Ne vertheless, the tighter 
policy causes unemployment to return to its natural rate sooner than in the previous 
Tealbook.  The optimal control path for headline inflation in 2015 displays a more sizable 
drop than in the December Tealbook reflect ing a downward revision to the staff’s 
baseline projection caused by the further dec lines in energy prices observed during the 
intermeeting period.8  The simulated trajectory for head line inflation after 2015 is a little 
higher than in the previous Tealbook, consistent with th e lower level of slack now 
anticipated, and it gradually rises from about 1¾ percent to the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective.   
Under the optimal control policy, the federal funds rate departs from the effective 
lower bound one quarter earlier than in the T ealbook baseline and then  increases at about 
the same pace as in the baseline through 2020;  on average, the federal funds rate path 
prescribed by optimal control is about ½ perc entage point higher th an the baseline path 
over the next few years.  Compared with the Tealbook baseline, the tighter stance of the optimal control policy—evident from the so mewhat higher path of real longer-term 
rates—generates less undershooting of unempl oyment below the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, while inflation converges to the Committee’s objective at about the same 
pace.   
optimal control calls for an immediate increase in the federal funds rate, even if the weight on policy rate 
changes is lowered.  Consistent with the results s hown in previous Tealbooks, a lower penalty on policy 
rate changes has at most little effect on the outcomes for inflation and the unemployment rate under optimal 
control. 
7 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in which policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan involving policy choices  that would be suboptimal  at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar. 
8 Due to the substantial inertia of macroeconomic variables embedded in the dynamics of 
FRB/US, this temporary drop in headline inflation does not elicit a strong policy response under optimal 
control.

OPTIMAL CONTROL WITH A LOW WEIGHT ON DEVIATIONS OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT FROM ITS NATURAL RATE 
The optimal control simulations described above embed the assumption that 
policymakers place equal weights on minimizi ng squared deviations of PCE inflation 
from 2 percent, the unemployment rate from the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, and 
on changes in the federal funds rate.  The sp ecial exhibit “Optimal Control with a Low 
Weight on Deviations of Unemployment from  its Natural Rate” shows simulations that 
employ a loss function with a lower weight on unemployment deviations relative to the 
other two terms.  Specificall y, instead of placing unit weight s on all three terms of the 
loss function, for the alternative simulati on, the weight on deviations between the 
unemployment rate and its natural rate is lowered to one-tenth while keeping the unit 
weights on the inflation term and on changes in  the policy rate, thus raising the relative 
importance of the latter two terms.9  While the assumption of an equally weighted loss 
function has some appeal as a benchmark, po licymakers may want to put a lower weight 
on unemployment deviations in these simu lations, perhaps because of uncertainty 
surrounding estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.10 
Overall, when compared with the benchm ark case, the alternative optimal control 
simulation prescribes a substantially more- accommodative policy path.  In particular, the 
increase in the real federal funds rate ove r the next few years is considerably more 
gradual than under either th e Tealbook baseline or the benchmark case with equal 
weights.  As a result, the optimal control simulation with a low weight on unemployment 
generates a significantly more pronounced undershooting of unemployment from the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate—by up to ¾ percentage point a nd thus almost four 
times as much as in the benchmark case.  This more accommodative policy stance is optimal because inflation reaches 2 percent by late 2017, a few years earlier than in the 
other two cases, while the undershooting of the unemployment rate incurs only a 
9 Optimal control simulations that place a low weight on penalizi ng deviations between 
unemployment and its natural rate are also consistent with the preferences of a policymaker who is more 
concerned with stabilizing inflation.  Viewed from th is perspective, the special exhibit also provides 
information on the relevance of the unemployment term in the loss function for optimal control.  Similar 
results have also been obtained from a calibration that increases the weight on the inflation term to one-
and-nine-tenths, while lowering the weight on unemployment deviations to one-tenth and keeping the unit 
weight on policy rate changes. 
10 The alternative weights have however been chosen for illustrative purposes only, without 
reference, to a particular calibration of underlying uncertainty in estimates of the natural rate of 
unemployment.

relatively small penalty.11  However, to achieve this more  rapid progress, the alternative 
optimal control policy lets inflation run sli ghtly above 2 percent fo r several years after 
late 2018 as the unemployment rate stays below th e staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment for considerably longer th an under both the Tealbook baseline and the 
optimal control policy based on equal weights.   
The final exhibit, “Outcomes under Altern ative Policies,” tabulates the simulation 
results for key variables under th e above-described policies.  
11 This alternative specification of the loss function in optimal control generates policy rate 
prescriptions and macroeconomic outcomes that, under current conditions, are qualitatively similar to those 
obtained from the nominal income targetin g rule used in the December Tealbook.

Appendix
POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  [math] denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead and [math] , the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  [math] , and the forecast  of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the 
output  gap [math] . The value  of policymakers'  long-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  [math] is 
2 percent.
Taylor  (1993)  rule [math]
Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
Inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
First-difference  rule [math]
The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in recent  analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
intercepts  of these  rules are chosen  so that they  are consistent  with a 2 percent  long-run  inflation  
objective  and a long-run  real interest  rate, denoted  [math], of 1 3/4 percent,  a value  used in the 
FRB/US  model. The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the level of the 
output  gap or the long-run  real interest  rate; see Orphanides  (2003).
1 See Erceg  and others  (2012).Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule, and the first-difference  rule—the lines  
denoted  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same  lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy 
rate, for each of these  rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal  
to the average  value  for the policy  rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent  quarter,  these  
rules use the lagged  values  from  their simulated,  unconstrained  prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATES 
An estimate of the equilibrium real federal f unds rate appears as a memo item in the first 
exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The concept of the short-run equilibrium real 
rate underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that is 
consistent with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an  output projection from FRB/US, 
the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very broad array of economic factors, some of which ta ke the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhi bit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine 
the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook, Book B, publication date. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the 
previous Tealbook projection.  When the Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter.  However, wh en the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all 
of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three alternative draft FOMC statements—labeled A, B, 
and C—for the Committee’s consideration.  In addition to providing different 
possibilities for characterizing incoming info rmation and the outlook, these alternatives 
offer a variety of options for forward gui dance regarding the federal funds rate. 
In Alternative B, the Committee would re tain its assessment that it “can be 
patient” in beginning to normali ze the stance of monetary policy.  The draft statement for 
Alternative A includes an option to modify this  language, stating “it is  appropriate to be 
patient” because “persistently low wage and pr ice inflation indicate that [ appreciable ] 
slack remains in the labor market.”  It also  includes a second option that replaces the 
language quoted above, including the notion of being patient, with an inflation floor and 
an indication that the Committee would take additional actions if projected inflation 
remained below 2 percent once energy prices stabilized.  In contrast, the statement under 
Alternative C indicates that the Committee j udges that economic conditions either “may” 
or “could potentially” warrant an increase in th e target range for the federal funds rate “in 
a couple of meetings.”  Under Alternativ e C the Committee also would retain the 
qualification that “slower” progress toward the Committee’s dual objectives would likely lead to an initial increase in the target range that occurs later than currently expected, but because the initial tightening is seen as possibly very s oon, it drops the indication that 
faster progress would result in earlier tightening.  In all thr ee alternatives, the sentence 
asserting that the Committee sees this forw ard guidance as being consistent with its 
previous statement would be dropped.

The Committee would, under Alternatives A and B, retain the language that, in 
determining how long to maintain the current  target range, it will assess “progress” 
toward its dual objectives.  In contrast, given the greater focus of Alternative C on the conduct of monetary policy fo llowing the initial increase in the target range, the 
Committee would replace the idea that there is  still progress to be achieved.  Instead, it 
would state that “future adjustme nts” of the target range for the federal funds rate will be

statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds 
rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if 
projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that 
longer-term inflation expectati ons remain well anchored.”

made on the basis of the Committee’s assessm ents of “deviations of employment and 
inflation” from their mandate-c onsistent levels.       
As to the Committee’s characterization of its approach to removing policy 
accommodation once it decides to begin doing so, Alternatives A and B repeat the 
Committee’s previously-stated intention to take a “balanced approa ch.”  In contrast, 
Alternative C drops this sentence and inst ead emphasizes the data dependence of the 
Committee’s policy decisions, st ating that “in response to unanticipated economic and 
financial developments, the Committee will adjust  the target federal funds rate to best 
promote the attainment of its objectives  of maximum employment and 2 percent 
inflation.”  The text of all three alternatives would reit erate that economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.   
With respect to balance sheet policy, unde r all three alternatives, the Committee 
would state that it is maintaining its existing reinvestment policy.   
In characterizing recent economic conditi ons, under Alternative A the Committee 
would retain the language from December th at economic activity is expanding at a 
“moderate pace,” whereas the pace would be upgraded to “solid” in Alternative B; 
Alternative C indicates instead  that the expansion has “gai ned momentum.”  All of the 
draft statements note further improvement in labor market conditions, and each stipulates 
that underutilization of labor resources “continues to dimi nish,” although Alternative A 
also adds that wage increases remain subdue d.  In all three alternatives, the Committee 
would state that household spending is rising moderately, that recent declines in energy prices have “boosted household purchasing pow er,” that business fi xed investment is 
advancing—albeit only “modestly” in the cas e of Alternative A—and that the housing 
recovery remains slow.  Regarding the ec onomic outlook, the draft statements for the 
three alternatives indicate that the Committee expects a moderate pace of economic 
activity, with labor market indicators “continuing  to move” toward levels consistent with 
its dual mandate, and that the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for “economic 
activity and the labor market as nearly balanced,” although Alternatives A and B note 
that “the foreign economic outlook has beco me somewhat more uncertain in recent 
months.”

Under each of the three a lternatives, the Committee makes note of low inflation, 
but under Alternatives A and B it would say th at inflation has “declined further below” 
the Committee’s longer-run objective, while the text of Alternative C adheres more 
closely to the language in December by noting th at inflation has “continued to run below” 
the Committee’s longer-run objective.  Alternativ e A indicates that low inflation “partly” 
reflects declines in energy prices, while Altern atives B and C say that it “largely” reflects 
those declines.  In Alternatives A and B, the Committee would also note that market-
based measures of inflation compensation have declined “substantially in recent months,” while Alternative C would say that they d eclined “somewhat furt her.” All three draft 
statements indicate that survey-based measures  of longer-term inflati on expectations have 
remained stable.  In describing the outl ook for inflation, the draft statement for 
Alternative B acknowledges that inflation is expected “to decline further in the near 
term,” but that the Committee expects it to rise “gradually toward 2 percent over the 
medium term.”  Alternative A articulates the concern that inflation could run 
“substantially” below 2 percent “f or a protracted period,” and i ndicates that it is expected 
to rise toward 2 percent “very gradually.”   Under Alternative C, the Committee would 
state that it expects inflation to rise gradually  “to” 2 percent “over th e medium term.”  In 
all three alternatives the Committee would note that it continues to monitor inflation 
developments closely.

DECEMBER 2014 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October 
suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market 
conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  On 
balance, a range of labor market indicato rs suggests that underutilization of labor 
resources continues to diminish.  Hous ehold spending is rising moderately and 
business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run 
objective, partly reflecting declines in en ergy prices.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectati ons have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate , the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to  the outlook for economic activity and the 
labor market as nearly balanced.  The Co mmittee expects inflation to rise gradually 
toward 2 percent as the labor market impr oves further and the tr ansitory effects of 
lower energy prices and other factors dissi pate.  The Committee continues to monitor 
inflation developments closely.  
3. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that th e current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this 
target range, the Committee will asse ss progress—both realized and expected— 
toward its objectives of maximum empl oyment and 2 percent inflation.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indicators of infl ation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial developments.  Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of 
monetary policy.  The Committee sees this gu idance as consistent with its previous 
statement that it likely will be appropriate to  maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range 
for the federal funds rate for a consider able time following the end of its asset 
purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation c ontinues to run below 
the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation 
expectations remain well anchored.  Howe ver, if incoming information indicates 
faster progress toward the Committee’s empl oyment and inflation objectives than the 
Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner th an currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves 
slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than 
currently anticipated. 
4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help mainta in accommodative financial conditions.

5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant k eeping the target federal f unds rate below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations 
remain well anchored.  However, if incoming information indicates faster slower 
progress toward the Committee’s employme nt and inflation objectives than the 
Committee now expects, then  the initia l increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate are is likely to occur sooner later than currently antici pated.  Conversely, if

progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to 
occur later than currently anticipated.  
4. When the Committee decides to begin to re move policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  Based on its economic outlook, the Committee currently 
anticipates that even after em ployment and inflation are near mandate-consistent 
levels, economic conditions may, for some ti me, warrant keeping the target federal 
funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. In 
response to unanticipated economic and financial developments, the Committee 
will adjust the target federal funds rate to best promote the attainment of its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. 
5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help mainta in accommodative financial conditions.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee may view information rece ived during the intermeeting period as 
broadly consistent with economic activity e xpanding at a solid pace.  Labor market 
conditions have improved further, with st rong job gains and continued declines in 
unemployment.  Policymakers might also judge that resour ce slack remains and that 
inflation is persisting below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Based in part on these 
observations, the Committee might conclude  that the current, highly accommodative 
stance of monetary policy remains appropriate  in order to suppor t continued progress 
toward maximum employment and to return inflation gradually to 2 percent over the 
medium term.  It may therefore choose to main tain the current target range for the federal 
funds rate and reiterate the forward guidan ce that was included in the December FOMC 
statement, as in Alternative B.   
With regard to the level of labor market slack, policymakers might note that, 
although the unemployment rate ha s declined appreciably over the past year, it remains 
above the central tendency of participants ’ longer-run projections in the December SEP 
of 5.2 to 5.5 percent.  Moreover,  policymakers may also judge that a range of other labor-
market indicators, including th e below-trend labor force participation rate, the elevated 
share of those who are working part time but  would prefer a full-time job, and the still-
high share of unemployed workers who have been out of work for six months or more, 
point to lower levels of resource utilizati on than the unemployment rate would suggest on 
its own.     
Policymakers may have become more concerned over the intermeeting period 
about possible downside risks to real activity  in the United States associated with 
developments abroad.  However, they may judge that while the risks to the foreign 
outlook have increased, their implications for the U.S. economy are likely to be small and 
are roughly offset by upside risks that impr ovements in U.S. labor markets, and real 
activity more generally, could provide greater momentum to the expansion than currently 
anticipated.  Nonetheless, they  may want to state that “the foreign economic outlook has 
become somewhat more uncertain in recent months.”  In addition, although policymakers might anticipate further declines in consumer price inflation in the near term, they might 
attribute this decline largely to the trans itory effects of lower energy prices, and so 
continue to expect “inflation to rise gradually toward 2 pe rcent over the medium term.”

As in December, the forward guidance in Alternative B states that “the 
Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary 
policy,” thereby signaling that, in the Comm ittee’s current assessment, the process of 
policy normalization is not likely to begin in  the next two meetings.  However, some 
participants may be concerne d that ongoing declines in market-based measures of 
inflation compensation might indicate that the public has begun to doubt the Committee’s 
commitment to its 2 percent inflation objective.  Even so, these policymakers may note 
that survey-based measures of longer-term in flation expectations have remained stable, 
and judge that the declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation likely 
stem from movements in risk or liquidity pr emiums rather than from a fundamental shift 
in inflation expectations.2  Moreover, they may be worried that providing more 
accommodation than that implied by Alternativ e B could cause the unemployment rate to 
fall too far below its natural rate and ultimat ely lead to a scenario in which inflation 
persistently exceeds 2 percent a nd proves costly to return to  that rate.  Alternatively, 
some policymakers may be concerned that weakness in economic activity abroad might 
have significant repercussions for the U.S. economy—especially if that weakness 
intensified, along the lines of th e “Recession in the Euro Area” scenario in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, Book A.  However, policymakers may weigh these 
concerns against the assessment that there has so far been only a modest spillover of 
weakness abroad to U.S. growth.  Balanci ng these considerations, policymakers might 
conclude that it would be premature to alter the Committee’s forward guidance in a way 
that signals an expected path for the federal funds rate that is lower than that implied by 
Alternative B.  Instead, they may prefer to wait for further information to give greater 
clarity about whether inflation expectations  have declined and on the status of the 
economic situation abroad and its implications for the U.S. outlook. 
In contrast, some policymakers might be inclined to signal that the federal funds 
rate target range is likely to be raised sooner than what would be suggested by the 
language of Alternative B.  These policymakers may judge that, in light of the further improvement in labor market conditions in December, levels of resource slack are 
2 As of the closing of the December 2014 Te albook, the Michigan survey for November was 
available and it showed median inflation expectati ons over the next 5-to-10 years of 2 .6 percent—the 
lowest level this year, and down notably from October.  Since then, however, the December and 
preliminary January readings of this measure have come in at 2.8 percent, close to the October level.  For 
more on the interpretation of long-term inflation exp ectations from financial market data, see the box in 
Tealbook, Book A, titled “An Update on Measures of Longer-Term Inflation Compensation and Inflation 
Expectations.”

currently low.  Moreover, the upward revision to real GDP gr owth in the second half of 
last year may be seen as suggesting that th e economy has gained considerable momentum 
so that any remaining slack in resource utiliz ation is likely to dimi nish quickly.  These 
policymakers may be concerned that prol onging near-zero policy rates until mid-year, 
and maintaining below-normal policy rates for some time after the economy returns to 
full employment, would risk pushing the unemployment rate well below levels consistent with maximum employment and fuel an undesi rably large rise in inflation over the 
medium run.  Even so, policymakers might not e that inflation has d eclined further below 
the Committee’s objective, and judge that infl ation expectations re main well anchored 
and that there are as yet no signs of incipi ent wage and price pressures.  They may 
therefore conclude that the co sts of waiting somewhat longer before signaling that rates 
will increase are likely to be small.  They might also note that the higher foreign exchange value of the dollar implies less accommodative financial conditions, all else 
equal.  Moreover, participants might see the experience of other c ountries exiting from 
periods of long-standing high levels of policy accommodation—most notably Sweden and Japan, countries for which the depart ure from the effective lower bound proved 
premature and subsequently was reversed—as suggesting that it may be better to err on 
the side of a later, rather than earlier, commencement of policy firming.
3 
Some policymakers may worry that the exte nded period of near-z ero interest rates 
is increasing incentives for risk-taking in the financial sector, with potential for 
undermining financial stability in the future.  However, signs of exce ssive risk-taking are 
not widespread, and use of short-term financ ing instruments and indicators of leverage 
remain at moderate levels to date.  Furthe rmore, policymakers could be concerned that a 
premature tightening of polic y poses risks to financial stability by undermining the 
economic recovery, increasing loan losses, a nd thereby impairing th e balance sheets of 
financial institutions.  Policymakers may accordingly conclude that the forward guidance in Alternative B, by signa ling that the first increase in the federal funds rate is unlikely to 
take place in the next two meetings, does not measurably increase the risks to financial 
stability while supporting the Committee’s em ployment and inflation objectives.   
Based on the Desk’s Survey of Primary D ealers, the median expectation for the 
most likely timing of the first increase in th e federal funds rate is  June; however, the

views expressed are disperse, and many dealers view dates later than June as the most 
likely.  In addition, few dealers expect signi ficant changes in forward guidance at this 
meeting.  Accordingly, overall, the new language in  Alternative B is not likely to surprise 
many market participants.  That said, the Co mmittee’s allusion to uncertainty regarding 
the foreign economic outlook could garner some  attention from mark et participants, as 
only a few primary dealers mentioned in the latest survey the possibility that the 
Committee might refer to risks or uncertainty surrounding the global outlook.    
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Other policymakers may be more confid ent that the expansion has gained 
sufficient momentum that it is likely to absorb any remaining economic slack fairly 
quickly.  In support of this view, policymak ers might highlight th e large upward revision 
to real GDP growth estimated for the second half of last year, th e strong expansion in 
payroll employment observed in recent months , and the swifter-than-expected decline in 
the unemployment rate over the past year.  These policymakers might also point to the 
effects of falling energy prices on househol d purchasing power and burgeoning consumer 
confidence as pointing to greater momentum in U.S. economic activity going forward.  Accordingly, these policymakers may regard it as appropriate to indicate that the target 
range for the federal funds rate is likely to be raised sooner than a repeat of the December forward guidance would suggest, as in Alternative C.
4 
More generally, some policymakers may be concerned that the path for the 
federal funds rate currently expected by market participants could be overly 
accommodative.  Such policymakers might note the historical record of the last thirty 
years that shows that energy price fluctuations  have not had lasting effects on inflation; 
they might therefore conclude that the focus should instead be on the implications of 
diminishing economic slack for inflation and, accordingly, they might judge that under 
the currently-anticipated policy rate path, inflation is likely to rise above 2 percent once 
the transitory effects of lower energy prices  subside.  While acknowledging recent further 
declines in market-based measures of in flation compensation, policymakers may regard 
these declines as reflecting changes in risk or liquidity premiums, and they may view the 
4 Alternatively, the Committee might view the lang uage in the draft statem ent for Alternative C as 
premature at the moment, but see it as potentially appropriate when the time for departure of the target 
range for the federal funds rate from its effective lower bound draws near.  For more on this topic, see the 
memo, “Options for Evolving the Statement Language in Preparation for Liftoff” by William English, 
Thomas Laubach, and Trevor Reeve, sent to the Committee on January 16, 2015.

balance of the evidence, including informati on from survey measures, as suggesting that 
longer-run expected inflation has not dec lined.  Moreover, they may already see a 
significant risk that the unempl oyment rate could undershoot its  natural rate substantially, 
a development that might generate higher actual  inflation in the future, and in turn boost 
expected inflation above 2 pe rcent as the labor market tightens.  These policymakers 
might cite the scenario “Faster Recovery with Higher Inflation”  in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, Book A, as en capsulating some of th e risks they have 
in mind.  They also might emphasize that nearly all of the simple monetary policy rule 
prescriptions and the optimal control simulations, as presen ted in the “Monetary Policy 
Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B, ca ll for an immediate policy tightening. 
Based on these judgments, some participants may want to signal that an initial 
increase in rates at one of the next two meetings is no longer unlikely, and therefore 
prefer the forward guidance in Alternative C.  This guidance drops the word “patient” 
and states that “based on its current assessment” economic conditions “may warrant,” or alternatively “could potentially warrant,” an in crease in the target range for the federal 
funds rate “in a couple of meetings.” 
Alternative C would surprise most market  participants.  For example, only one 
respondent to the latest Survey of Primary D ealers saw April as the most likely date for 
the first increase in the federal funds rate, and the aver age probability the dealers 
assigned to that outcome was only about 5 perc ent.  Thus, a change in forward guidance 
indicating that the firs t increase in the funds rate could come as soon as the April meeting 
would be unexpected.  In respons e to a statement like that in  Alternative C, medium- and 
longer-term real interest rates would likely rise, inflation compensation would likely fall, 
equity prices would probably decline, and th e dollar appreciate.  Ho wever, to the extent 
that investors interpreted th e statement as reflecting a more positive outlook for economic 
activity and inflation, and accepted that outlook as correct, equity pr ices and inflation 
compensation would not fall as much or could even rise.     
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
In light of the information received over the intermeeting period on inflation and 
economic developments abroad, some policymakers may be concerned that the durability of the current expansion is at risk, or that a pernicious cycl e of lower inflation leading to 
lower inflation expectations and vice versa,  might be getting under way.  Accordingly, 
these policymakers may regard it as appropria te that the Committee more clearly specify 
Alternatives

Page 30 of 48

these concerns as a reason to be patient in beginning to normalize th e stance of monetary 
policy, as in the statement under Alternativ e A.  While acknowledging that job gains 
were “solid” in December, and that the unemployment rate fell further, these 
policymakers might note that some other indica tors of labor market utilization, such as 
the employment-population ratio, showed no improvement.  Moreover, policymakers 
may point to the unexpected decline in aver age hourly earnings posted in December and 
more generally to “persistently low wage a nd price inflation” as suggesting that there 
may still be an appreciable amount of slack in the labor market.    
Some policymakers may judge that the unprecedented magnitude and swiftness of 
recent declines in energy prices have increased  the risk that low levels of inflation will 
persist, heightening the con cern that “inflation could r un substantially below the 2 
percent objective for a protracted period.”   These policymakers may point to the 
substantial declines in market-based meas ures of inflation compensation in recent 
months, and interpret these measures as sugge sting that inflation e xpectations have begun 
to drift down or that the potential costs of  low inflation outcomes have increased.  In 
addition, they might be concerned about the pos sible implications for prices and personal 
incomes of low growth in labor compensa tion, much like the scenario “Weaker Wage 
Growth” that appears in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, Book A.  
Containing such risks might be a particular concern for policymakers because the effective lower bound on policy rates and the Federal Reserve’s already-large balance 
sheet could limit the Committee’s flexibility  in responding to downside outcomes.   
Some policymakers may read the incoming data since the December meeting as 
suggesting that the rate of r eal GDP growth is likely to be no better than moderate in 
coming quarters despite upward revisions to econ omic activity for the second half of last 
year.  Similarly, while policymakers might judge  that the recent decl ine in energy prices 
will raise household purchasing power, they might see this effect as likely to be transitory.  They might note th e disappointing retail sales data  for December.  They could 
also point to weakness in bus iness investment and residential construction despite a 
highly accommodative stance of monetary policy as signs th at the underlying trend in 
private domestic demand remains unsatisfactory.  These participants may also be concerned that the prospects for continued moderate growth over coming quarters have 
been damaged by weakness in key European economies and by the appreciation of the 
dollar.  They may regard the sharp fall in ener gy prices as an indica tor that global growth 
is on a lower path than before, with adve rse implications for U.S. net exports.

An announcement like that in Alterna tive A would likely surprise market 
participants.  Paragraph 3 indicates that in creases in wage and price inflation will be 
needed before it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy; 
it could also describe the level of labor ma rket slack as “appreciable.”  Paragraph 3 ′ states 
that inflation projected one to two years ahead would need to return to 2 percent before it 
would likely be appropriate to raise the target  range for the federal funds rate.  It also 
indicates that the Committee would take additio nal actions if necessary  to foster a more 
rapid return of inflation to 2 percent.  In either case, investors would likely push further 
into the future their expectation of the date of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  Medium- and longer-term real interest rates would likely decline, 
inflation compensation and equity prices mi ght rise, and the dollar could depreciate.  
However, insofar as investors interpreted the statement as reflecting a more downbeat 
assessment of the outlook for economic growth a nd inflation, equity prices would not rise 
as much or could even decline, a nd inflation compensation could fall.

BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has developed a pr ojection of the Federal Re serve’s balance sheet and 
income statement that is broadly consiste nt with the monetary policy assumptions 
incorporated in the staff’s forecast presen ted in Tealbook, Book A.  In particular, the 
projection is based on the assump tions that the first increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate will occur in the second quarter of 2015 a nd that rollovers of maturing 
Treasury securities, and the reinvestment of principal received on ag ency securities, will 
cease in the fourth quarter of 2015.  From that  point forward, the SOMA portfolio shrinks 
through redemptions of maturing Treasury securiti es and agency debt securities as well as 
paydowns of principal from agency MBS.  Regarding the Federal Reserve’s use of its 
policy normalization tools, we assume that  the level of overni ght reverse repurchase 
agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end of 2018 a nd then falls to zero 
by the end of 2019, and that term deposits and term RRPs are not used during the 
normalization period.1  Below some key features of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 
and income statement and results of the projections under these assumptions are 
highlighted. 
 Balance sheet. As shown in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet 
Items” and in the table that follows, tota l assets peaked at about $4.5 trillion near 
the end of 2014, with about $2.5 trillion in  Treasury securities holdings and $1.8 
trillion in agency MBS holdings.  Under the assumptions discussed above, reserve 
balances peak at $2.8 trillion in the first quarter of 2015.  The size of the portfolio 
is normalized in the second quarter of 2021, at which point total assets stand at 
$2.2 trillion, with about $2 trillion in  total SOMA securities holdings.2  Total 
1 RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts are assumed to remain around 
$110 billion throughout the projection period.  Use of RRPs results in a shift in the composition of Federal 
Reserve liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and an equal increase in reverse repurchase agreements— 
but does not produce an over all change in the size of the balance sheet.  If term deposits and term RRPs are 
used during normalization, their use will result in a decline in reserve balances and an increase in these 
liabilities. 
2 The size of the balance sheet is considered normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to its 
longer-run trend, which is determined largely by cu rrency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capital and a

implications of the balan ce sheet projection and interest rate assumptions for 
Federal Reserve income.3  Over 2014, the Federal Reserve remitted nearly $100 
billion to the Treasury.  Going forward, remittances to the Treasury are projected 
to be about $90 billion this year and then  to decline further over the next three 
years.  Annual remittances reach their trough at about $18 billion in 2018, modestly lower than in the balance sheet  projection presented in the December 
Tealbook; no deferred asset is recorded.
4  The Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1 trillion, approximately $200 billion above the staff estimate of the amount that would have been observed had there been no asset purchase programs.
5 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio is influenced importantly by th e level of interest rates.  The staff 
estimates that the portfo lio was in an unrealized gain position of about $175 
billion as of the end of December 2014.6  Reflecting the assumed rise in long-term 
interest rates over the next several years, the position is projected to shift to an 
unrealized loss next year, with projected year-end unrealized losses peaking at $315 billion in 2017.  At this date, roughl y $150 billion of th e unrealized losses 
can be attributed to the Tr easury portfolio and $165 bill ion to the MBS portfolio.  
The unrealized loss position narrows through the remainder of the forecast period, 
projected steady-state level of reserv e balances.  Currently, we assume that that steady-state level will be 
$100 billion. 
3 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains 25 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound.  In addition, we assume that, once firming of the 
policy rate begins, the spread between the interest rate paid on reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 25 
basis points.  Moreover, we assume that the effective federal funds rate will average about 15 basis points 
below the rate paid on reserv e balances and ab out 10 basis points above the ON RRP rate. 
4 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capital paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  
5 The staff estimate is obtained by linear interpolation from 2006 to 2025 of actual 2006 income 
and projected 2 025 income. 
6 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .

as securities acquired under the large-s cale asset purchase programs mature or pay 
down and new securities are added to the por tfolio at then-curre nt market rates. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the exhibit, “Projections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” the eff ect of the Federal Reserve’s elevated 
stock of longer-term securities on the term premium embedded in the 10-year 
Treasury yield in the first quarter of 2015 is estimated to be negative 112 basis 
points, nearly unchanged from the December Tealbook.  Over the projection 
period, the term premium effect diminishes  at a pace of about 5 basis points per 
quarter, reflecting the projected normalization of the portfolio. 
 Monetary base.  As shown in the final exhibit, “Projections for the Monetary 
Base,” once the normalization process be gins in the second quarter of 2015, the 
monetary base shrinks through the second quarter of 2021, primarily because 
redemptions of securities generate corre sponding reductions in reserve balances.  
Starting around mid-2021, after re serve balances are assumed to have stabilized at 
$100 billion, the monetary base begins to expand in line with the increase in 
currency in circulation.7 
7 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  If, for example, the FOMC employs additional RRPs or term deposits to drain reserves 
during normalization, the projected level of reserve balances and the monetary base could decline quite 
markedly.  In this projection, an ON RRP facility is assumed and, therefore, the monetary base is lower 
than it would otherwise be until 2019 (when the facility is phased out).  Because the assumed size of the 
ON RRP program is small in relation to reserve balances, the overall contours of the monetary base are not 
greatly affected.

After expanding moderately, on average,  over the next two quarters, M2 is 
expected to contract for seve ral quarters and then grow slow ly over the remainder of the 
forecast period.  This trajectory for M2 reflect s an increase in the opportunity cost of 
holding M2 balances arising from  the projected firming of mone tary policy.  The forecast 
also incorporates a judgment that businesse s and households will r eallocate a portion of 
the excess M2 balances they accumulated during  and after the financial crisis back into 
other investments as the economic expansi on progresses, resulting in some additional 
restraint on M2 growth  beginning this year.8 
8 The staff projects that only a po rtion of the recent buildup of M2 ba lances will be reallocated over the 
forecast horizon because depositors will continue to be mo re risk averse in their investment decisions than 
they were prior to the financial crisis.  In addition, in light of various regulatory developments, depository 
institutions may see retail deposit liabilities as a more attractive source of funds than was the case in the 
past, and take relatively stronger measures to retain them.  Of course, other regulatory developments, such 
as higher capital requirements, may constrain the growth of banks’ balance sheets and deposits.
