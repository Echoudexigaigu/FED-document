The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from four policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an inertial vers ion of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity and inflation in th e near term, and they incorporate the staff’s 
lower estimate of the longer-run equilibrium real federal funds rate.2  (Medium-term 
prescriptions derived from dynamic simulations of the rules are discussed below.)  As in 
January, all of the simple rules prescribe an increase in the federal funds rate by the third 
quarter.  The Taylor (1993) a nd the Taylor (1999) rules call for sizable increases in the 
federal funds rate to values of 1½ percent or higher over the near  term.  The inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule and the first-difference rule prescribe less-sizable interest-rate 
increases—to near ½ percent and just ove r ¼ percent in the third quarter of 2015, 
respectively—because both rules place a c onsiderable weight on keeping the federal 
funds rate close to its lagged value. 
In general, the current prescriptions from the simple rules using the current staff 
forecast imply slightly lower policy rate s than those using the previous Tealbook 
forecast.  This difference reflects the downward revisions in the staff’s projection for the 
output gap and core PCE inflation.  As expl ained in Tealbook, Book A, and as shown in 
the lower panel of the exhibit, the staff now projects that the trajec tory of the output gap 
will run, on average, about ½ percentage poi nt lower than in the previous Tealbook 
through 2017, with the output gap closing in the third quarter of 2016, two quarters later 
than in the January Tealbook.  The staff’s proj ection for core PCE infl ation is a bit lower 
in 2015 but mostly unchanged thereafter.  The to p panel of the first exhibit also reports 
the Tealbook-consistent estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated 
using the FRB/US model.  This measure is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that 
would, if maintained, return output to potenti al in 12 quarters.  Reflecting the staff’s 
updated assessment of slack in the economy, the current estimate of r*, at 0.82 percent, 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules.  
2 As detailed in the box, “Changes to Interest Rates in the Longer Run,” in Tealbook, Book A, the 
staff has revised its estimate of the longer-run value of the real federal funds rate down from 1¾ to 
1½ percent.  To facilitate comparisons, new values of the intercepts of rules, where applicable, have been 
used to construct both the “Current Tealbook” and “Previous Tealbook outlook” numbers tabulated in the 
exhibit.

is 26 basis points lower than the correspondi ng value derived from the staff’s outlook in 
January.  The actual real fede ral funds rate, at about -1¼ percent, is almost 50 basis 
points below the current estimate of r*.  
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the outpu t gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, under the assumption that the federal 
funds rate is subject to an effective lower bound of 12½ basis points.  The results for each 
rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to th e rule in the future, and that the private 
sector fully understands the policy that will be pursued as well as its implications for real 
activity and inflation. 
The exhibit also displays the implicati ons of following the baseline monetary 
policy assumptions adopted in the current staff forecast.
3  As in January, the staff has 
assumed in its current forecast that the first in crease in the federal funds rate will occur at 
the June FOMC meeting.  After departi ng from its effective lower bound, the federal 
funds rate is assumed to rise at a pace pres cribed by the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.  The 
prescribed path for the federal funds rate  initially increases a little more than 
¼ percentage point per quarter and reaches 3 pe rcent in the first half  of 2018; the pace of 
tightening subsequently slows, and the federa l funds rate begins to level off near its 
longer-run value of 3½ percent. 
All of the policy rules in these dynamic simulations cal l for tightening to begin 
immediately.4  The Taylor (1993) and the Taylor (1999) rules produce pa ths for the real 
federal funds rate that lie significantly above the Tealbook baseline over the next few 
years, leading to somewhat higher unempl oyment rates but similar trajectories for 
inflation.  Under the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the real fede ral funds rate initially rises 
3 The dynamic simulations discussed here and below incorporate the assumptions about 
underlying economic conditions used in the staff’s baseline forecast, including the macroeconomic effects 
of the Committee’s asset holdings from the large-scal e asset purchase programs, and the staff’s downward 
revision to the longer-run real federal funds rate. 
4 Unlike the Tealbook baseline, the simulations employing the four policy rules make no attempt 
to account for the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the start of policy firming.  However, as shown 
in the December Tealbook, policy rule simulations that take account of this guidance by imposing an 
unemployment rate threshold only delay the departure from the effective lower bound by at most one 
quarter, with negligible implications for unemployment and inflation.

above its baseline path because the federal f unds rate departs from its effective lower 
bound immediately, almost one quarter earlier than in the Tealbook baseline.  However, 
the difference is too small to have a material  effect on the real l onger-term interest rates 
that influence economic activity  in the FRB/US model, so  macroeconomic outcomes are 
essentially the same in this case as those under the Tealbook baseline. 
The first-difference rule calls for a slightly  higher real federal funds rate over the 
coming year than in the Tealbook baseline.  However, because the first-difference rule 
responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than its level, declines in the 
output gap later in the decade—expected to oc cur after the initial overshooting of output 
relative to its potential level —generate a federal funds rate path that is below baseline 
after the middle of 2017.  This lower path, co mbined with expectations of higher price 
and wage inflation in the future, leads to hi gher levels of resource utilization and more 
inflation in the short run.  Overall, this rule  generates outcomes late in the decade that are 
farther than the other policy ru les from both the staff’s estimate of the natural rate of 
unemployment and the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal Contro l Policy under Commitment,” compares 
optimal control simulations for this Tealbook’s baseline forecast with those reported in 
January.  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committee’s 2 percen t goal, on keeping the unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.  The concep t of optimal control that is employed here 
corresponds to a commitment policy under whic h the decisions that policymakers make 
today are assumed to constrain future policy choices.5 
Compared with the January Tealbook, optim al control policy entails a lower path 
of the federal funds rate, reflecting the weaker aggregate de mand embedded in the current 
forecast.6  Despite the more accommodative policy, the unemployment rate undershoots 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate by less than in January, consis tent with the staff’s 
assessment of a slightly higher trajectory for the unemployment rate.  The optimal control 
5 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in which policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan involving policy choices  that would be suboptimal  at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar. 
6 As noted above, the current Tealbook baseline reflects the staff’s reduction in its estimate of the 
longer-run real federal funds rate, and this change also  contributes to the lower optimal control path for the 
federal funds rate.

path for headline inflation is nearly identical to the baseline path, with differences relative 
to the trajectory shown in the January Teal book mostly reflecting revisions to the staff’s 
baseline projection associated with upward revisions to energy prices in the near term.  
Under the optimal control policy, the federal funds rate departs from the effective 
lower bound almost one quarter earlier than in the Tealbook baseline and then increases 
at about the same pace as in the baseline th rough 2017; on average, the federal funds rate 
path prescribed by optimal control is about ½ percentage point higher than the baseline 
path over the next few years.  Compared with  the Tealbook baseline, th e tighter stance of 
the optimal control policy—evident from the somewhat higher path of real longer-term 
rates—generates less undershooting of unempl oyment below the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate, while inflation converges to the Committee’s objective at about the same 
pace.     
OPTIMAL CONTROL WITH A NONLINEAR WAGE PHILLIPS CURVE 
The optimal control simulations discusse d above assume that the response of 
inflation to labor market slack or tightness is modest in magnitude and linear in the 
degree of resource utilizati on.  An Alternative View box in the January Tealbook, Book 
A, considered implications of a nonlinear wa ge Phillips curve for the staff’s inflation 
projection.  The special exhibit, “Optimal  Control with a Non linear Wage Phillips 
Curve,” examines the policy implications of  a related specification in which wage 
inflation is more sensitive to  the unemployment rate gap when the labor market is tight 
than when there is economic slack.  As in the January box, a nonlinear wage Phillips 
curve could be motivated, for instance, by the presence of downward nominal wage 
rigidities, which could make wages and prices  relatively unresponsiv e to slack during and 
after economic downturns.  Once the labor  market reaches full employment, the 
sensitivity of wages and prices  to slack could surge back.  Consistent with such an 
asymmetric response, FRB/US estimates of th e immediate response of wage inflation to 
the unemployment rate gap are about twice as  large using a 1985-2007 sample rather than 
the 1985-2012 sample currently in use. 
To capture such a nonlinearity, we replace th e standard, linear wage Phillips curve 
in the FRB/US model with one in which the se nsitivity of wage inflation to labor market 
slack is the same as in the FRB/US mode l when the unemployment rate is above the 
staff’s estimate of its natural rate but is f our times as responsive when the unemployment 
rate is below the natural rate.  While the calibra tion is meant to be illustrative, it is within

the range of conventional estimates.7  In the simulation, it is assumed that both the private 
sector and policymakers know that the wa ge Phillips curve is nonlinear and fully 
understand its implications for inflation and real activity.8  In addition, as in the previous 
exhibit, policymakers are assumed to co mmit to the prescribed policy and this 
prescription is regarded as  credible by the public.  
Because inflation is initially below th e Committee’s 2 percent target, the higher 
sensitivity of wage inflation to labor market  slack in the simulation with a nonlinear wage 
Phillips curve makes the tradeoff between pushing inflation up toward target and 
reducing the unemployment rate below the natu ral rate more meani ngful.  Accordingly, 
policy is more accommodative than in the st andard optimal control simulation:  Real 
long-term rates rise a bit more gradually  and the unemployment rate undershoots the 
natural rate more in the simulation with th e nonlinear wage Phillip s curve.  Given the 
tighter labor market and wage inflation’s grea ter sensitivity to real activity in this 
specification, inflation rises faster and then slightly overshoots the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Overall, the trajector y for inflation is about 0.1 per centage point hi gher than in 
the standard optimal control simulation.  
The result that monetary policy is mo re accommodative and leads to a more 
pronounced undershooting of unemployment reflects the fact that inflation starts from 
well below the Committee’s objective.  If inflation were closer to the longer-run target, 
policy would instead be tighter under optimal control with the non linear wage Phillips 
curve than under standard optimal control,  as concerns about unemployment falling 
below its natural rate would weigh more h eavily in policymakers’  objective function. 
Two assumptions noted above point to caveats worth emphasizing.  First, these 
simulations assume that policymakers fully  understand the wage and price dynamics of 
the economy.  However, our understanding of these dynamics is imperfect, limiting the 
7 The calibration implies that, all else equal, a one percentage point positive unemployment gap, 
leads to an immediate reduction in annualized nominal wage inflation of 0.015 percentage point, while a 
one percentage point negative unemployment gap leads to an immediate increase in annualized nominal 
wage inflation of 0.060 percentage point.  The latter response is within two standard deviations of the 
FRB/US model estimate informed by the 1985-2007 subsample.  Using a different specification, Kumar 
and Orrenius (2014) also report a significantly larg er response of wage inflation to a fall in the 
unemployment rate when the unemployment rate is low.  Finally, the qualitative results of the simulation hold under even larger asymmetries. 
8 In particular, if the unemployment rate fluctuates over time around the natural rate, monetary 
policy would need to keep the unemployment rate above the natural rate on average over time to prevent an 
upward acceleration of inflation.

ability of policymakers to achieve inflation outcomes near their long er-run objective in 
the presence of this nonlinearity.  Second, as with the earlier optimal control simulations, 
this simulation embeds the critical assumption that policy is perfectly credible and that 
inflation expectations remain well anchored.  If the privat e sector doubted policymakers’ 
commitment to their goals and plans, the incr ease in inflation could be larger and more 
persistent than shown in the simulations.

POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  Rt denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead  (nt and ^t+3|t), the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  (gapt), and the forecast  of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the 
output  gap (A4gap),-3 ,). The value  of policymakers'  longer-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  nLR, is 
2 percent.

Taylor  (1993)  rule Rt = rLR +nt + 0.5 (nt —nLR) + 0.5gap t
Taylor  (1999)  rule Rt = rRR +nt + 0.5 (nt —nLR) + gapt

The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in recent  analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
intercepts  of these  rules are chosen  so that they are consistent  with a 2 percent  longer-run 
inflation  objective  and a longer-run  real interest  rate, denoted  rLR, of 1/ percent,  a value  used in 
the FRB/US  model. 2 The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the level of 
the output  gap or the longer-run  real interest  rate; see Orphanides  (2003).
1 See Erceg  and others  (2012).
2 For the March  2015  Tealbook,  the staff  revised  the longer-run  value  of the real interest  rate from  
1% percent  to 1/ percent.
Page  13 of 48Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule, and the first-difference  rule—the lines  
denoted  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same  lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy 
rate, for each of these  rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal

to the average value for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these 
rules use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

ESTIMATES OF THE EQUILIBRIUM AND ACTUAL REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATES 
An estimate of the equilibrium real federal f unds rate appears as a memo item in the first 
exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection.”  The concept of the short-run equilibrium real 
rate underlying the estimate corresponds to the level of the real federal funds rate that is 
consistent with output reaching potential in 12 quarters using an  output projection from FRB/US, 
the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This estimate depends on a very broad array of economic factors, some of which ta ke the form of projected values of the model’s 
exogenous variables.  The memo item in the exhi bit reports the “Tealbook-consistent” estimate of 
r*, which is generated after the paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted 
so that they match those in the extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine 
the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous 
variables in the extended baseline forecast. 
The estimated actual real federal funds rate reported in the exhibit is constructed as the 
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change in the core PCE 
price index.  The federal funds rate is specified as the midpoint of the target range for the federal 
funds rate on the Tealbook, Book B, publication date. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation.  For the 
optimal control simulations, the dotted line la beled “Previous Tealbook” is derived from the

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents three alternative draft FOMC statements—labeled A, B, 
and C—for the Committee’s consideration.  In addition to providing different 
possibilities for characterizing incoming info rmation and the outlook, these alternatives 
offer a variety of options for forward gui dance regarding the federal funds rate. 
The Committee’s March meeting is taki ng place against a backdrop in which 
continued improvement in the labor market is  juxtaposed with a significant shortfall in 
inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent obj ective.  While many participants may be 
confident that conditions consistent with maximum employment may be reached fairly soon, they may be less confident about  the trajectory for inflation.   
The key judgment to be made at this meeting is whether the Committee can 
replace the “patient” language that is now associated with  a two-meeting delay before 
liftoff with more flexible, data-depe ndent forward guidance that would put 
decisionmaking about the first incr ease in the target federal funds  rate in play at the June 
meeting or later.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would modify its forward 
guidance in a manner that signals that an increa se in the target range is possible as early 
as June provided that the Committee has seen  further improvement in the labor market 
and is reasonably confident that inflation wi ll move back to 2 percent over the medium 
term.  Under Alternative A, the statement w ould indicate that polic ymakers want to see 
clear evidence that inflation is  turning up before they would increase the federal funds 
rate.  In contrast, under Alte rnative C, policymakers would communicate that an increase 
in the target range for the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate  at the June meeting. 
With regard to forward guidance, Alternative B replaces the Committee’s 
previous assessment that “it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of 
monetary policy.”  The new guidance states  that, consistent with the Committee’s 
previous postmeeting statement, an increase in the federal funds rate “remains unlikely at 
the April FOMC meeting” and notes the Comm ittee’s anticipation that the first increase 
in the federal funds rate will be appropria te when the Committee “has seen further 
improvement in the labor market ” and is “reasonably confident” that inflation will move 
back to 2 percent “over the medium term.”  Alternative B further adds that this “change 
in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing 
of the initial increase in the target rang e.”  The Committee would presumably drop the

reference to the April decision from future statements, but may want to retain some 
indication that the timing of the init ial increase has not been decided. 
The draft statement for Alternative A ex tends the notion of being patient by 
adding the condition that the fe deral funds rate will remain at its current level “until 
inflation is clearly moving up toward 2 pe rcent.”  In addition, the Committee would 
assert the intention to “use its tools as necessa ry to return inflation to 2 percent in two to 
three years.”  In contrast, the statement unde r Alternative C indicates that the Committee 
judges that economic conditions “will likely wa rrant an increase in the target range for 
the federal funds rate in a c ouple of meetings.”  Under th is alternative, the Committee 
would also retain the qualification that “slower” progress toward the Committee’s dual 
objectives would likely cause the initial increas e in the target range to occur later than 
currently expected; the converse stipulation that faster pr ogress would result in an earlier 
tightening would be dropped in light of the indication that a tight ening will soon occur 
under that alternative. 
Under Alternatives A and B, the Comm ittee would retain th e language stating 
that, in determining “how long to mainta in” the current target  range, it will assess 
progress toward its dual objectives.  Under A lternative C, however, the Committee would 
state that it will assess progress toward its obje ctives to determine “future adjustments of 
the target range,” meaning both the in itial and subsequent adjustments.  
With respect to the Committee’s characterization of its approach to removing 
policy accommodation, under Alternatives A and B the Committee would reaffirm its 
intention to take a “balanced approach.”  Under Alternative C, th e “balanced approach” 
phrase would be dropped in favor of language  emphasizing the data dependence of the 
Committee’s policy decisions.  The new langua ge would state that “in response to 
unanticipated economic and financial developm ents, the Committee will adjust the target 
federal funds rate to best promote the attainment of its obj ectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.”  The text  of all three alternat ives would reiterate 
that economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds 
rate below levels the Committee view s as normal in the longer run.   
With regard to balance sheet policy, unde r all three alternatives, the Committee 
would maintain its existing reinvestment policy.

Concerning the characterization of current economic conditions, Alternative B 
would incorporate three key ch anges relative to the January  statement:  It would use 
“moderate” instead of “solid” to describe th e expansion in economic activity; note that 
export growth had weakened; and acknowledge that measures of inflation compensation 
have reversed part of their pr evious decline but remain low.  Relative to Alternative B, 
the corresponding language unde r Alternatives C and A reflect brighter and more 
downbeat tones, respectively, than that for A lternative B in their characterizations of 
economic activity, labor market conditions, household spending, business fixed 
investment, export growth, and market-based measures of inflation compensation.  Data 
to be received between the pub lication of this Tealbook and the second day of the March 
FOMC meeting could lead to revisions in the first paragraph of each of the draft 
statements. 
Regarding the Committee’s outlook for infla tion, with energy price declines now 
expected to stay in the rear-v iew mirror, all of the alterna tive statements would describe 
near-term inflation as anticipated to “remain n ear its recent low level” (instead of decline 
further).  In contrast with Alternative B,  under Alternative C the Committee would say it 
expects inflation to rise gr adually “to” (not toward) 2 percent over the medium term, 
while Alternative A would say the rise toward 2 percent is expected to be “very” gradual.  
Finally, Alternative A would add that the Comm ittee is concerned that inflation could run 
substantially below 2 percent for a protracted period.

March under Alternatives A, B, and C; supporting arguments for the three alternatives;

JANUARY 2015 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December 
suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace.  Labor market 
conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  
On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor 
resources continues to diminish.  Household spending is rising moderately; recent 
declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.  Business fixed 
investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Inflation has declined further below the Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting 
declines in energy prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have 
declined substantially in recent months; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market 
indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its 
dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to decline 
further in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 
percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other fact ors dissipate.  The Committee continues to 
monitor inflation developments closely. 
3. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the 
federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target 
range, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take 
into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on financial and 
international developments.  Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy. However, if 
incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  
Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range 
are likely to occur later than currently anticipated. 
4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from 
its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, 
by keeping the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should 
help maintain accommodative financial conditions. 
5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment 
and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some 
time, warrant keeping the target federal funds  rate below levels the Committee views as 
normal in the longer run.

reflecting earlier  declines in energy prices.  Mark et-based measures of inflation 
compensation have declined substantially in recent m onths increased ; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation ex pectations have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward leve ls the Committee judges consistent with its 
dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
activity and the labor market as nearly bala nced.  Inflation is anticipated to declin e 
further remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects 
inflation to rise gradually toward to 2 percent over the medium term as the labor 
market improves further and the transitory effects of lower earlier energy prices 
price declines and other factors dissipate.  Th e Committee continues to monitor 
inflation developments closely. 
3. To support continued progress toward maxi mum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its view that th e current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate.  In determining how long to m aintain this 
future adjustments of the target range for the federal funds rate , the Committee 
will ass ess progress—both realized and expected —toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including measures of  labor market conditions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  Based on its  current assessment, the Committee judges 
that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy 
economic conditions will likely warrant an increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate in a couple of meetings.  However, if incoming information 
indicates fas ter slower progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation 
objectives than the Committee now expects, th en incre ases in the target range for the 
federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than curren tly anticipated.  Conversely, if 
progress proves slower than expected, th en increases in the target range are the init ial 
increase is  likely to occur later than currently anticipated.   
4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolli ng over maturing Treasury securities at

auction.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help mainta in accommodative financial conditions. 
5. When the Committee decides to begin to re move policy accommodation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent with its l onger-run goals of maximum employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  Based on its economic outlook, the Committee currently 
anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent 
levels, economic conditions may, for some ti me, warrant keeping the target federal 
funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. In 
response to unanticipated economic and financial developments, the Committee 
will adjust the target federal funds rate to best promote the attainment of its 
objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee may view the informati on received during the intermeeting period 
as consistent with an assessment that the cu rrent target range of the federal funds rate 
remains appropriate for at least another m eeting.  However, policymakers may want to 
drop “patient” from the postmeeting statement b ecause they may judge that an increase in 
the target range may be warra nted at the June meeting.  The Committee may therefore 
choose to maintain the current  target range for the federa l funds rate while updating its 
forward guidance, as in Alternative B. 
In light of the latest readings on the labor market, showing strong job gains and a 
further decline in the unemployment rate  over the intermeeti ng period, members may 
consider it appropriate to again indicate in  the Committee’s postmeeting statement that 
the underutilization of labor re sources “continues to diminish.”  Policymakers might also 
continue to judge that resource slack remains.   They may point to the persistent absence 
of price and wage pressures despite large declines in th e unemployment rate.  More 
broadly, policymakers may judge  that a range of other labo r-market indicators continues 
to indicate that resource util ization is lower than suggest ed by the unemployment rate 
alone; they might for example point to the be low-trend labor force participation rate, the 
still-elevated share of those who are working part time but would prefer a full-time job, 
and the still-high share of unemployed workers who have been out of work for six 
months or more. 
Some policymakers might be inclined to signal that the target range for the federal 
funds rate is likely to be ra ised sooner than what would be  suggested by the language of 
Alternative B.  In light of th e further improvement in labor market conditions in January 
and February, they may judge that levels of  resource slack are low and are poised to be 
eliminated altogether in the near future.  They may be concerned that prolonging a policy of near-zero short-term interest rates, and maintaining below-normal policy rates for 
some time once the economy returns to full employment, would risk pushing the unemployment rate well below levels consis tent with maximum sustainable employment 
and fuel an undesirably large ri se in inflation over the medi um run.  Nonetheless, they 
may remain cautious in their judgment about the momentum in economic activity in light 
of the recent downward revision to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter as well as weaker incoming data on spending and intern ational trade in the current quarter.  
Furthermore, they might note that infl ation remains well below the Committee’s 
objective, and judge that infla tion expectations remain well anchored and that there are as

yet no signs of increasing wage and price pressures.  They might also note that the higher 
foreign exchange value of the dollar implie s less accommodative fina ncial conditions, all 
else equal.  Moreover, participants might s ee the experience of other countries exiting 
from periods of long-standing high levels of policy accommodation—most notably Sweden and Japan, countries for which th e departure from the effective lower bound 
proved premature and subsequently was revers ed—as suggesting that it may be better to 
err on the side of commencing policy firming later, rather than earlier.
1  They may 
therefore conclude that the co sts of waiting another couple of  meetings before increasing 
the target range for the fede ral funds rate are likely outwe ighed by the risks of removing 
accommodation too early. 
Some policymakers may be concerned th at the extended period of near-zero 
interest rates is increasing incentives for risk-t aking in the financial sector, with potential 
for undermining financial stability in the futu re.  However, they may note that signs of 
excessive risk-taking are not wi despread, and use of short-te rm financing instruments and 
indicators of leverage have remained at moderate levels to date.  Moreover, a premature tightening of policy might itself pose risks to financial stability—namely by undermining 
the economic recovery, increasing loan losses,  and thereby impairing the balance sheets 
of financial institutions.  Policymakers ma y accordingly conclude that the statement 
language provided under Alternative B—by signaling that the first incr ease in the federal 
funds rate may, but need not, take place as early as June—gives the Committee ample flexibility to take financ ial stability concerns into account while supporting its 
employment and inflation objectives.   
Conversely, some participants may be concerned that the updated forward 
guidance in Alternative B—in particular the signal that the process of policy 
normalization may begin as early as June—might be premature.  They may be concerned that persistently low market-based measures of inflation compensation might be an 
indication that the credibility of the Committee’s commitment to its 2 percent inflation 
objective is in question.  However, as surv ey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations have so far remained stable and as market-based measures of inflation compensation have, over the intermeeting period, reversed some of their earlier declines, 
these participants may now be less concerned that changes in market-based measures of

Liftoff from the Effective Lower Bound,” by Andrea De Michelis, Michiel De Pooter, and Paul Wood, sent

inflation compensation in rece nt quarters reflect a funda mental shift in inflation 
expectations rather than movement s in risk or liquidity premiums.2  Alternatively, they 
may see risks that weakness in economic activity abroad might have significant 
repercussions for the U.S. economy—especia lly if that weakness intensified, along the 
lines of the “Greek Exit with Severe Spillove rs” scenario in the “Risks and Uncertainty” 
section of Tealbook, Book A.  However, weighi ng these risks against the assessment that 
there has so far been only a modest spillover of weakness abroad to U.S. growth, these 
policymakers may recognize that under Altern ative B, the Committee would retain the 
latitude to adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary in response to softer-than-
expected data.  Consequently, before signa ling the potential provi sion of greater policy 
accommodation, policymakers may prefer to wait for further information about inflation expectations and the economic situation abroad  and its implications  for the U.S. outlook, 
and thus choose statement language  as proposed in Alternative B. 
On average, respondents to both the Desk’s  Survey of Primary Dealers and to the 
Desk’s Survey of Market Participants place odds of about 30 percent on the first increase 
in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring in June, but c onsider an increase in 
September almost as likely.  In addition, the majority of respondents to both surveys 
expects a modification in forward guidance at  this meeting that removes the “patient” 
language.  Accordingly, overall, the new langua ge in Alternative B is not likely to 
surprise many market participants.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some policymakers may be more confid ent that the expansion has gained 
sufficient momentum such th at economic slack—if any shoul d still remain—will likely 
be absorbed fairly quickly, and they may see inflation as likely to move back toward 2 
percent in short order.  In support of this view, policymaker s might highlight the strong 
expansion in payroll employment as well as the decline in the unemployment rate over 
the past year.  In particular, these policymak ers might note that the unemployment rate, at 
5.5 percent in February, has reached the upper en d of the central tendency of participants’ 
longer-run projections for the unemployment ra te given in the December SEP, raising the 
2 Five-to-ten-year-ahead inflation forecasts from the Michigan survey in February, as well as 
forecasts from the first-quarter SPF for CPI inflation five and ten years ahead, and PCE inflation five years 
ahead ticked down by just about one tenth—well with their historical ranges—and the ten-year-ahead SPF 
forecast for PCE prices remained unchanged.  Short-term  forecasts from those surveys varied mostly in line 
with observed changes in gasoline prices.

possibility that the unemployment gap may already have closed.  Policymakers might 
also point to the fact that oil prices recently appear to have le veled off, and that oil futures 
prices suggest that energy pr ices will no longer be reducing headline inflation relative to 
core inflation. 
These policymakers might also see in creased momentum in U.S. economic 
activity in the period ahead, and point for exam ple to the elevated consumer confidence 
and the solid growth in real consumption expenditures shown in the revised data for the 
fourth quarter.  Accordingly, th ese policymakers may regard it as appropriate to indicate 
that a first increase in the target range for the federal f unds rate at the June meeting is 
more likely than suggested by Alternative B; consequently, they ma y prefer Alternative 
C. 
Policymakers may also be concerned that the path for the federal funds rate 
currently expected by market participants could imply an overly accommodative policy.  
They may judge that the current low levels of inflation largely reflect transitory effects of 
earlier declines in energy prices and thus may expect headlin e inflation to rise toward 2 
percent before long.  Participants may point to increases in market-based measures of 
inflation compensation that came in the wake  of the recent upturn in energy prices, and 
they may regard earlier declines in these measures observed since summer as 
predominantly reflecting changes in risk or liquidity premiums rather than a decline in 
longer-run inflation expectations.  Thus, th ey may view the balance of the evidence, 
including information from survey measures , as suggesting that longer-run expected 
inflation has not declined.  In contrast, they  may already see a significant risk that the 
unemployment rate could substantially undersho ot its natural rate, a development that 
might generate higher actual wage and pri ce inflation in the future, and in turn boost 
expected inflation above 2 pe rcent as the labor market tightens.  These policymakers 
might cite the scenario “Faster Growth with Higher Inflation” in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, Book A, as en capsulating some of th e risks they have 
in mind.  They also might emphasize that all of the simple mo netary policy rule 
prescriptions and the optimal control simu lations presented in the “Monetary Policy 
Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B, call for an immediate policy tightening.  Based 
on these judgments, some participants may want  to signal that an initial increase in rates 
by June is quite likely. 
A decision to issue a statement along th e lines of Alterna tive C would likely 
surprise market participants to some exte nt.  Although respondents to the Survey of 
Alternatives   
  
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)
March 12, 2015

Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants place, on average, the highest 
odds on the first target-range increase to occu r in June, at 30 percen t, these odds are not 
very high, and respondents consider it, on average, twice as like ly that the first increase 
will occur only after the June meeting.  In addition, the views expressed in the surveys 
are disperse, and quite a few re spondents view dates later than  June as the most likely.  
Many market participants might thus be surprised by the high likelihood placed by 
Alternative C on an increase in th e target range for the federal ra te at the June meeting.  If 
so, in response to a statement like that in Alternative C, medium- and longer-term real 
interest rates would likely ri se, inflation compensation woul d likely fall, equity prices 
would probably decline, and the dollar appreciate.   However, to the extent that investors 
interpreted the statement as reflecting a mo re positive outlook for economic activity and 
inflation, and accepted that outlook as correct, equity prices and inflation compensation 
would not fall as much or could even rise. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
In light of the information received over the intermeeting period on inflation, 
economic developments abroad, and the restraining effects of the appreciation of the 
dollar, some policymakers may be concerned th at the durability of the current expansion 
is at risk, or that inflation is likely to remain well below 2 percent for the foreseeable 
future.  Accordingly, these policymakers may re gard it as appropriate that the Committee 
more clearly specify these concerns as a r eason to be patient in beginning to normalize 
the stance of monetary policy, as in th e statement under Alternative A.  While 
acknowledging that job gains in January and February were “solid,” and that the 
unemployment rate fell further, these polic ymakers might judge that subdued nominal 
wage growth and other indicators of labor ma rket utilization sugge st that appreciable 
slack remains in the labor market. 
Some policymakers may note that, over the last few years, inflation has 
persistently fallen short of  the Committee’s 2 percent objective without much sign of 
moving back up again; they may be concerne d that “inflation could run substantially 
below the 2 percent objective for a protracted period.”  They may take little comfort from the stability of survey-based measures of l onger-term inflation expect ations, pointing, for 
example, to the behavior of survey expecta tions in Japan that fa iled to reflect a decade-
long experience of very low, even negative, in flation rates.  These participants may judge 
that market-based measures of inflation co mpensation provide a more useful gauge of 
longer-term inflation expecta tions.  While these market-based measures have increased, 
Alternatives   
  
 
Class I FOMC – Restricted Controlled (FR)

on balance, over the intermeeting period, polic ymakers might point to their still-low 
levels and interpret these as suggesting that  inflation expectations may have begun to 
drift down—possibly along the lines of the scenario “Lower Long-Term Inflation 
Expectations” that is considered in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook, 
Book A—or that the potential costs of low inflation outcomes have increased.  In 
addition, they might be concerned about the pos sible implications for prices and personal 
incomes of low growth in labor compensa tion.  Containing such risks might be a 
particular concern for policymakers becau se the effective lower bound on policy rates 
and the Federal Reserve’s already-large balance sheet could limit the Committee’s flexibility in responding to downside outcomes.  In response, some participants may want 
to signal the Committee’s readiness to use its tools as necessary to move inflation back 
up again.   
Some policymakers may read the incoming data since the January meeting as 
suggesting that real GDP growth is likely to be no more than moderate in coming 
quarters.  While they might judge that the recent decline in energy prices has raised 
household purchasing power, they might see this effect as likely to be  transitory, and they 
might note the relatively weak retail sales da ta for January and Fe bruary.  They could 
also point to weakness in busin ess investment and residential construction, in the face of 
a highly accommodative stance of monetary poli cy, as signs that th e underlying trend in 
private domestic demand remains unsatisfactory.  These participants may also be 
concerned that the prospects for continued moderate growth over coming quarters have 
been damaged by weakness in key European economies and the strong appreciation of 
the dollar.  They may regard the weakness in  energy prices over recent months as an 
indicator that global growth is on a lower path  than before, with a dverse implications for 
U.S. net exports.  Based on these judgments, so me participants may want to lay out more 
stringent conditions than in Alternative B (or the current statement), for beginning to 
normalize the stance of  monetary policy.  
An announcement like that in Alterna tive A would likely surprise market 
participants.  The third paragraph of the alternative not only retains the Committee’s 
existing “patient” language, but also adds the requirement that inflation should clearly 
move up toward 2 percent before beginning to  normalize the stance of monetary policy, 
and hints at the possible pr ovision of additional policy accommodation.  In response to 
such a statement, investors would likely push further into the future their expectation of 
the date of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  Medium- and 
longer-term real interest rates would likely decline, inflation compensation and equity

prices might rise, and the dollar could depr eciate.  However, insofar as investors 
interpreted the statement as reflecting a mo re downbeat assessment of the outlook for 
economic growth and inflation, equity prices  would not rise as much or could even 
decline, and inflation compensation could fall.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has developed a projection of the Federal Reserve’s b alance sheet and 
income statement that is broadl y consistent with the monetary p olicy assumptions 
incorporated in the staff’s forecast presented in Tealbook, Boo k A.  In particular, the 
projection is based on the assumpti ons that the first increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate will occu r in the second quarter of 2015, and that rollovers of maturing 
Treasury securities and the rein vestment of principal received on agency securities will 
cease in the fourth quarter of 2015.  From that point forward, the SOMA portfolio shrinks 
through redemptions of maturing Treasury securities and agency debt securities as well as 
paydowns of principal from agency MBS.  Regarding the Federal R eserve’s use of its 
policy normalization tools, we a ssume that the level of overnig ht reverse repurchase 
agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end of 20 18 and then falls to zero 
by the end of 2019, and that term depo sits and term RRPs are no t used during the 
normalization period.1,2  The bullets below highlight som e key features of the projecti ons 
for the Federal Reserve’s bala nce sheet and income statement un der these assumptions. 
 Balance sheet. As shown in the exhibit “Total A ssets and Selected Balance Shee t 
Items” and in the table that follows, the size of the portfolio  is normalized in the 
second quarter of 2021, at which point  total assets stand at $2 .2 trillion, with 
about $2 trillion in total SO MA securities holdings.3  Total assets and securities 
holdings increase thereafter, ke eping pace with growth in curre ncy in circulation 
and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
1 Use of RRPs or term deposits results in a shift in the composi tion of Federal Reserve liabilities— 
a decline in reserve balances and  an equal increase in RRPs or term deposits—but does not produce an 
overall change in the size of the balance sheet.    
2 RRPs associated with  foreign official and international accoun ts remain around $135 billion 
throughout the projection period.   
3 The size of the balance sheet i s considered normalized when re serve balances revert to an 
assumed $100 billion steady state level.  At this time, the siz e of the securities portfolio is primarily 
determined by the level of currency in circulation plus Federal  Reserve capital and the projected steady-
state level of reserve balances.

$90 billion this year (down a b it from their $100 billion peak in 2014) and then to 
decline further over the next three years.  Annual remittances reach their trough at 
about $25 billion in 2018; no deferred asset is recorded.5  The Federal Reserve’s 
cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1 trillion, 
approximately $200 billion above the staff estimate of the amou nt that would 
have been observed had there b een no asset purchase programs.6 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio is influenced importan tly by the level of interest ra tes.  The staff 
estimates that the portfolio w as in an unrealized gain position  of about $210 
billion as of the end of February.7  Reflecting the assu med rise in long-term 
interest rates over the next several years, the position is pro jected to shift to an 
unrealized loss by the end of thi s year, with projected year-en d unrealized losses 
peaking at $260 billion in 2017.  At this date, roughly $120 bi llion of the 
unrealized losses can be attribut ed to the portfolio of U.S. Tr easury securities and 
$140 billion to the portfolio of M BS.  The unrealized loss posi tion then narrows 
through 2025, as securities acquire d under the large-scale asse t purchase 
programs mature or pay down and new securities are added to the portfolio at 
then-current market rates. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table, “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” t he effect of the Federal Reserv e’s elevated 
stock of longer-term securities on the term premium embedded in  the 10-year 
4 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains 2 5 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound.  In addition, we assume that, once firming of the 
policy rate begins, the spread be tween the interest rate paid o n reserve balances and  the ON RRP rate is 25 
basis points. Moreover, we assume that the effective federal f unds rate will average about 15 basis points 
below the rate paid on reserve b alances and about 10 basis poin ts above the ON RRP rate. 
5 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capit al paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  
6 The staff estimate is obtained by linear interpolation from 20 06 to 2025 of actual 2006 income 
and projected 2025 income. 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalreserve.gov/m onetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .

Treasury yield in the first qua rter of 2015 is estimated to be negative 113 basis 
points.  Over the next couple of  years, the term premium effect  diminishes at a 
pace of about 5 basis points per quarter, reflecting the projec ted normalization of 
the portfolio. 
 Monetary base.  As shown in the final table, “Projections for the Monetary Bas e,” 
once the normalization process begins in the second quarter of 2015, the monetary 
base first grows less rapidly and then shrinks through the second quarter of 2021, 
primarily because redemptions of s ecurities generate correspond ing reductions in 
reserve balances.  Starting a round mid-2021, after reserve bala nces are assumed 
to have stabilized at $100 billi on, the monetary base begins to  expand in line with 
the increase in curre ncy in circulation.8 
8 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  In this projection, a steady $100 billion take- up in an ON RRP facility is assumed and, 
therefore, the level of the mone tary base is lower than it woul d otherwise be until 2019 (when the facility is 
phased out).  The projected growth rate of the monetary base, h owever, is generally unaffected.  If the 
FOMC employs additional reserve-draining tools during normaliza tion, however, the projected level of 
reserve balances and the monetar y base could decline quite mark edly.

MONEY 
M2 is expected to increase mode stly faster than nominal GDP, on  average, in the 
first half of 2015.  Thereafter, M 2 is projected t o contract sl ightly through early 2016 and 
then to grow slowly over the remainder of the forecast horizon as the projected increase 
in the target range for the fed eral funds rate and the associat ed rise in the opportunity cost 
of holding money restrains money demand.9  The increase in the opportunity cost is 
expected to slow M2 growth to a pace below that of nominal GDP in 2016 and, to a 
lesser extent, in 2017.  In previous forecasts, staff had assum ed that M2 growth will be 
additionally restrained by busin esses and househol ds reallocati ng a portion of the M2 
balances accumulated during and aft er the financial crisis to o ther investments.  However, 
in light of the continued strong growth in M2, staff is no longer assuming such a 
reallocation.  
9 The three-month Treasury bill rate is assumed to begin rising in 2015:Q1—one quarter earlier than the 
time at which the staff projects the target range for the feder al funds rate to be raised above its effective 
lower bound.  Subsequently, the Treasury bill rate is assumed t o continue rising through the end of the 
forecast period, implying an inc reasing opportunity cost of hol ding M2 balances.
