The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity a nd inflation in the near term.  Medium-term prescriptions 
derived from dynamic simulations o f the rules are discussed below.  All of the Taylor-
type rules prescribe an immediat e increase in the federal funds rate.  The 
Taylor (1993, 1999) rules call for sizable increases in the federal funds rate to values of 
1¼ percent or higher over  the near term.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes a less-
sizable interest-rate increase— to just over ¼ percent in the th ird quarter of 2015 and just 
under ½ percent in the fourth quarter of 2015—because the rule places a considerable 
weight on keeping the federal funds  rate close to  its lagged value.  The first-difference 
rule, which responds to expecte d changes in the output gap, cal ls for values of the federal 
funds rate of about ¼ percent in  the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 
Compared with the previous Tealbook, all four simple rules pres cribe slightly 
lower policy rates for the thir d and fourth quarters of this year, reflecting a somewhat 
wider output gap in the staff’s  near-term projection.  As expla ined in Tealbook, Book A, 
and as shown in the lower-left pa nel of the exhibit, the staff projects that the trajectory of 
the output gap will run, on average, about 0.2 percentage point  lower than in the previous 
Tealbook until 2018.  The staff’s projection for core PCE infla tion is little changed.  The 
top panel of the first exhibit al so reports the Tealbook-consis tent estimate of the 
equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model.  This measure 
is an estimate of the real federal funds rate that would, if maintained, return output to 
potential in 12 quarters.  Refl ecting the staff’s updated asses sment of slack in the 
economy over the next few years, the current estimate of r*, at 0.30 percent,  is 21 basis 
points lower than the estimate derived from the staff forecast in the April Tealbook.2  The 
actual real federal funds rate, at about −1¼ percent, is about 90 basis points below the 
current estimate of r*. 
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules.   
2 The numbers reported here are c onsistent with the corrected va lues of r* shown in the memo, 
“Correction to April 2015 Tealbook, Book B, Page 2,” which was sent to the Committee on April 27, 2015.

  The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulat ions reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the output gap when the f ederal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, subject to an effective lower bound of 
12½ basis points for the federal  funds rate.  The results for e ach rule presented in these 
and subsequent simulations depend importantly on the assumption s that policymakers 
will adhere to the rule in the f uture, and that the private sec tor fully understands the 
policy that will be pursued as well as its implications for rea l activity and inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implicati ons of following the baseline 
monetary policy assumptions in the current staff forecast.3  As discussed in Tealbook, 
Book A, the staff assumes that the first increase in the federa l funds rate will occur at the 
September FOMC meeting.  After de parting from its effective low er bound, the federal 
funds rate is assumed to rise at  the pace prescribed by the ine rtial Taylor (1999) rule.  The 
federal funds rate increases a bout 25 basis points per quarter for three years, reaching 
3 percent at the beginning of 2019; the pace of tightening subs equently slows, and the 
federal funds rate begins to lev el off near its longer-run valu e of 3½ percent. 
Except for the first-differen ce rule, all of the policy rules i n these dynamic 
simulations call for tighteni ng to begin immediately.  The Tayl or (1993) and the 
Taylor (1999) rules produce path s for the real f ederal funds ra te that lie significantly 
above the Tealbook baseline over the next few years, leading to somewhat higher 
unemployment rates but similar trajectories for inflation.  Und er the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, the federal  funds rate departs from its eff ective lower bound in the 
third quarter of 2015 and the real federal funds rate briefly rises above the corresponding 
baseline path.  However, these di fferences are too minor to have a material effect on the 
real longer-term interest rates that influence economic activity in the FRB/US model.  Consequently, macroeconomic outco mes are essentially the same i n this case as those 
under the Tealbook baseline. 
The first-difference rule presc ribes keeping the federal funds rate within its 
current target range until th e fourth quarter of 2015.  The imp lied path for the real federal 
funds rate over the next couple  of years is similar to that in the Tealbook baseline, but 
                                                 
3 The dynamic simulations discusse d here and below incorporate t he assumptions about 
underlying economic conditions u sed in the staff’s baseline for ecast, including the macroeconomic effects 
of the Committee’s asset holdings  from the large-scale asset pu rchase programs.

  then somewhat lower beginning i n 2018.  This pattern results fr om the slower pace of 
economic growth expected to occur late in the decade—after outp ut overshoots its 
potential value—because the fir st-difference rule responds to t he expected change in the 
output gap rather than its level .  The lower path of the federal funds rate in the medium 
run, in conjunction with expecta tions of higher price and wage inflation in the future, 
leads to both higher levels of resource utilization and more in flation in the short run.  
Overall, the first-difference ru le generates outcomes late in t he decade for the 
unemployment rate and the infla tion rate that, compared with th e outcomes associated 
with other policy rules, are far ther from the staff’s estimates  of the natural rate of 
unemployment and the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation  objective. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s baseline foreca st with those reported in 
April.  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keep ing headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committ ee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping t he unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployme nt, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal cont rol that is employed here 
corresponds to a commitment po licy under which the plans that p olicymakers make today 
are assumed to constrain future policy choices.4 
The optimal control path for the  federal funds rate is lower th an it was in the April 
Tealbook, reflecting the lower projected path for output relative to potential.  However, 
the path for longer-term real r ates implied by the optimal cont rol policy is, on average, 
close to that in the previous Tealbook, leading to similar outc omes for inflation and the 
unemployment rate.  
Under the optimal control policy, t he federal funds rate depart s from the effective 
lower bound in the third quarter of 2015, less than one quarter  earlier than in the 
Tealbook baseline.  However, after  2016, it is slightly below the baseline.  Accordingly, 
the real 10-year Treasury yields under the optimal control poli cy are also about the same 
as those in the Tealbook baseline , leading to similar macroecon omic outcomes.  
                                                 
4 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that wou ld be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

IMPLICATIONS  OF ALTERNATIVE  LONG-RUN REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATES
The policy  rule simulations  regularly  shown  in the Tealbook  embed  the 
assumption  that if all gaps  were  closed  and inflation  were  running  at its target  level,  the 
real federal  funds  rate would  eventually  equal its model-consistent  long-run  value  [math] . 
However,  the true value  of [math] is uncertain,  and alternative  assumptions  about  this value  
could  affect  the simple  rules'  prescribed  dates of departure  of the federal  funds  rate from  
its effective  lower  bound,  and would  affect  its path thereafter.  The special  exhibit,  
“Implications  of Alternative  Values  of the Long-Run  Real Federal  Funds  Rates  [math] ,” 
explores  how alternative  values  of [math]could  affect  the timing  of the departure  from the 
effective  lower  bound  and the federal  funds  trajectory  thereafter.
In these simulations,  which  extend  the analysis  in an alternative  scenario  
presented  in the “Risks  and Uncertainty ” section  of Tealbook,  Book  A, [math] is assumed  to 
fall because  of highly  persistent  shocks  to aggregate  demand,  which  could  be interpreted  
as exogenous  disturbances  to private  agents'  desire  to save. The special  exhibit  considers  
levels  of [math] between  0.5 and 1.5 percent.  The upper  value  of this range  corresponds  to 
the Tealbook  baseline  value;  in this case, there are no shocks  to aggregate  demand  
beyond  what  is assumed  in the Tealbook  baseline.  The lowest  value  corresponds  to the 
value  used in the alternative  scenario  from Tealbook,  Book  A, with a lower  long-run  real 
federal  funds  rate. Although  there  is also upside  risk surrounding  the Tealbook  baseline's  
value  of [math], the focus  here is on shocks  that reduce  [math], because  upside  shocks  would  
not affect  the timing  of the first increase  in the federal  funds  rate implied  by most  of the 
simple  rules. 5 These  simulations  embed  the assumptions  that policymakers  know  that 
[math] has fallen  and that they incorporate  this knowledge  into their calculations  of policy  
rule prescriptions. 6
5 As discussed  earlier,  the three  Taylor-type  rules  all prescribe  values  for the federal  funds  rate 
above  the current  target  range,  so positive  shocks  to [math] would  only push  their  prescriptions  further  above  
the current  target  range. Changes  in [math] do not directly  affect  the first-difference  rule because  it does not 
have an intercept  term. However,  demand  shocks  associated  with  changes  in [math] will affect  the 
prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule through  the broader  effects  of those  shocks  on the economy.  The 
shocks  associated  with  an increase  in [math] to 1.8 percent  or higher  lead to a prescription  for the federal  funds  
rate from  the first-difference  rule that is above  the current  target  range  in the third  quarter  of 2015.
6 The aggregate  demand  shocks  are constructed  so that if policymakers  lowered  the federal  funds  
rate by the same amount  as the decline  in [math], the path  of the unemployment  rate would  be unchanged  from  
the Tealbook  path  over  the period  considered  in the simulation.

The top panel  of the special  exhibit  shows  the prescriptions  of the inertial
Taylor  (1999)  rule (along  the vertical  axis) as a function  of the level of [math] (along  the 
horizontal  axis) in the third and fourth  quarters  of 2015. The shaded  region  represents  the 
current  target  range  for the federal  funds  rate. As shown  by the blue line, if [math]  equals  
1.4—that is, just 0.1 percentage  point  lower  than assumed  in the Tealbook  baseline —the 
inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule prescribes  values  within  the current  target  range  in the third 
quarter  of 2015,  a prescription  that contrasts  with the immediate  departure  that was 
shown  in the “Policy  Rules  Simulations ” exhibit.  If [math]  is less than 1 percent,  
prescriptions  of the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule are within  the current  target  range  even in 
the fourth  quarter  of 2015,  as shown  by the dashed  red line. Even  over the wide range  of 
alternative  values  for [math]  considered  here, the simulations  of simple  policy  rules imply  a 
delay  in departure  from the effective  lower  bound  by no more  than two quarters.
The middle  panel  treats  values  of [math]  after  the shock  in the range  of 0.5 to
1.5 percent  as equally  likely,  and shows  the distribution  over dates  of departure  of the 
federal  funds  rate from its current  target  range,  as prescribed  by the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  
rule. More  than 90 percent  of the mass for the date of the first rate increase  is split evenly  
between  the fourth  quarter  of 2015 and the first quarter  of 2016,  and the delay  in policy  
firming  is at most  two quarters  later  than in the simulation  in which  [math]  is 1.5 percent.  
Changes  to [math]  affect  the prescribed  date of the first rate increase  implied  by the first-  
difference  rule (not shown)  in a similar  way: The date of the first rate increase  also 
occurs  in the first quarter  of 2016 if [math]  declines  to 0.5 percent.  The prescribed  date of 
initial  policy  firming  implied  by the Taylor  (1993)  and Taylor  (1999)  rules (not shown)  is 
almost  unchanged  for the range  of [math]  values  considered  in the exhibit  because,  as shown  
earlier,  the prescriptions  of those  rules are already  well above  the current  target  range,  
and so the lower  bound  constraint  does not bind even if [math]  falls to 0.5 percent.
The bottom  panel of the exhibit  shows  the simulated  path of the federal  funds  rate 
from the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule for three  different  values  of the shocks,  which  are 
associated  with declines  of [math]  to 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 percent.  While  the differences  
between  the prescribed  paths  of the policy  rate are relatively  small over the next few 
quarters  because  of the lower  bound  constraint,  later in the decade  differences  in [math]  
manifest  themselves  as similarly-sized  shifts  in the prescribed  path of the policy  rate. 
The shift in the path of the federal  funds  rate in response  to a decline  in [math]  reflects  the 
assumption  that policymakers  recognize  their  new environment  immediately  and respond  
accordingly,  leading  to minimal  implications  for unemployment  and inflation.  If
Authorized for Public Release
policymakers  did not recognize  the decline  in [math] , the federal  funds  rate would,  for a 
time, be higher,  economic  performance  would  be adversely  affected,  and inflation  would  
progress  toward  2 percent  at a slower  pace.
The final two exhibits,  “Outcomes  under  Alternative  Policies ” and “Outcomes  
under  Alternative  Policies,  Quarterly, ” tabulate  the simulation  results  for key variables

POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  [math] denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead  [math] and [math] , the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  [math] , and the forecast  of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the 
output  gap [math] . The value  of policymakers'  longer-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  [math] is 
2 percent.
Taylor  (1993)  rule [math]
Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
Inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
First-difference  rule [math]
The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
version  of the Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
intercepts  of these  rules are chosen  so that they are consistent  with a 2 percent  longer-run 
inflation  objective  and a longer-run  real interest  rate, denoted  [math], of  1 1/2 percent,  a value  used in 
the FRB/US  model. The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the level of 
the output  gap or the longer-run  real interest  rate; see Orphanides  (2003).
Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules  that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule and the first-difference  rule—the lines 
labelled  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same  lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy 
rate, for each of these  rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal  
to the average  value  for the policy  rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent  quarter,  these  
rules use the lagged  values  from  their simulated,  unconstrained  prescriptions.

ESTIMATES  OF THE  EQUILIBRIUM  AND  ACTUAL  REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATES
An estimate  of the equilibrium  real federal  funds  rate appears  as a memo  item in the first 
exhibit,  “Policy  Rules  and the Staff  Projection. ” The concept  of the short-run  equilibrium  real 
rate underlying  the estimate  corresponds  to the level  of the real federal  funds  rate that is 
consistent  with output  reaching  potential  in 12 quarters  using  an output  projection  from  FRB/US,  
the staff's  large-scale  econometric  model  of the U.S. economy.  This estimate  depends  on a very 
broad  array  of economic  factors,  some  of which  take the form  of projected  values  of the model's  
exogenous  variables.  The memo  item in the exhibit  reports  the “Tealbook-consistent ” estimate  of 
r*, which  is generated  after  the paths  of exogenous  variables  in the FRB/US  model  are adjusted 
so that they match  those  in the extended  Tealbook  forecast.  Model  simulations  then determine  
the value  of the real federal  funds  rate that closes  the output  gap conditional  on the exogenous  
variables  in the extended  baseline  forecast.
The estimated  actual  real federal  funds  rate reported  in the exhibit  is constructed  as the 
difference  between  the federal  funds  rate and the trailing  four-quarter  change  in the core PCE 
price  index. The federal  funds  rate is specified  as the midpoint  of the target  range  for the federal  
funds  rate on the Tealbook,  Book  B, publication  date.
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS
The exhibits  of “Monetary  Policy  Strategies ” that report  results  from  simulations  of 
alternative  policies  are derived  from  dynamic  simulations  of the FRB/US  model.  Each  simulated  
policy  rule is assumed  to be in force  over the whole  period  covered  by the simulation;  this period  
extends  several  decades  beyond  the time  horizon  shown  in the exhibits.  The simulations  are 
conducted  under  perfect  foresight  and are predicated  on the staff's  extended  Tealbook  projection,  
which  includes  the macroeconomic  effects  of the Committee's  large-scale  asset  purchase  
programs.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early  in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  in that 
quarter.  However,  when  the Tealbook  is published  late in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  
in the subsequent  quarter.
COMPUTATION  OF THE  OPTIMAL  CONTROL  POLICY  UNDER  COMMITMENT
The optimal  control  simulations  posit  that policymakers  minimize  a discounted  sum of 
weighted  squared  deviations  of four-quarter  headline  PCE inflation  [math]  from  the Committee's  
2 percent  objective,  of squared  deviations  of the unemployment  rate from  the staff's  estimate  of 
the natural  rate (this difference  is also known  as the unemployment  rate gap, [math]) , and of 
squared  changes  in the federal  funds  rate. The resulting  loss function,  shown  below,  embeds  the 
assumptions  that policymakers  discount  the future  using  a quarterly  discount  factor  [math]  
and place equal  weights  on squared  deviations  of inflation,  the unemployment  gap, and federal  
funds  rate changes  (that is, [math] ).
Authorized for Public Release
[math]  
The optimal  control  policy  is the path for the federal  funds  rate that minimizes  the above  
loss function  in the FRB/US  model,  subject  to the effective  lower  bound  constraint  on nominal  
interest  rates,  under  the assumption  of perfect  foresight,  and conditional  on the staff's  extended  
Tealbook  projection.  Policy  tools  other  than the federal  funds  rate are taken  as given  and 
subsumed  within  the Tealbook  baseline.  The path chosen  by policymakers  today  is assumed  to 
be credible,  meaning  that decision  makers  in the model  see this path as being  a binding  
commitment  on the future  Committees;  the optimal  control  policy  takes  as given  the lagged  value  
of the federal  funds  rate but is otherwise  unconstrained  by policy  decisions  made  prior  to the 
simulation  period.  The discounted  losses  are calculated  over  a period  that ends  sufficiently  far 
into the future  that extending  that period  farther  would  not affect  the policy  prescriptions  shown  
in the exhibits.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
This Tealbook presents four polic y alternatives—labeled A, B, C , and C′—for the 
Committee’s consideration.  Because  the draft statements associ ated with Alternatives A, 
B, and C vary in their character ization of current conditions a nd the economic outlook, 
each of them will likely imply a different response of private- sector expectations 
regarding the probable timing of the onset of policy firming.  Under Alternative C′, the 
Committee would announce a decisi on to commence firming in June . 
The June FOMC meeting is taking place after several months in which economic 
indicators have sent mixed si gnals concerning the economic outl ook.  The array of 
generally soft data releases poi nting to moderate growth in dom estic spending contrasts 
with the more-pronounced improve ment in labor market conditions , including the 
stronger pace of job gains in Apr il and May.  Moreover, while e nergy prices appear to 
have stabilized, recent readings on both core and all-items PCE  prices leave open the 
question of whether inflation will rise to 2 percent in the med ium term.  The Committee 
has emphasized that monetary po licy is data dependent and that,  beginning with this 
meeting, it is taking a meeting- by-meeting posture regarding when to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rat e.  As a result, the reaction of  financial market participants 
to the statement will likely center on its characterization of incoming data and their 
implications for the economi c outlook, and particularly on what  message the statement 
conveys about the degree to which the Committee has seen furthe r labor market 
improvement and has gained confidence that inflation will move up to 2 percent over the 
medium term. 
 In connection with the first of these criteria, the Committee may want to state its 
assessment of the degree to whic h real GDP, in the wake of its first-quarter weakness, is 
growing at a pace consistent with the expectation of further im provement in labor market 
conditions.  The Committee might also, in connection with the s econd criterion, want to 
indicate whether the recent  news regarding inflation, in conjun ction with improvement in 
the labor market, has bolstered its confidence that inflation w ill rise gradually toward  
2 percent over the medium term.  The draft statement language associated with the 
various policy alterna tives provides a range of possible assess ments that the Committee 
might make about the implications of recent data for the econom ic outlook and therefore 
about how close it is to meeting its criteria for policy firmin g.  Only under Alternative C′

  would the Committee indicate that  its criteria for beginning no rmalization have now been 
met. 
 The draft statement for Altern ative B indicates that, “on bala nce,” recent data 
suggest that underutilization of l abor resources “diminished so mewhat” and makes note 
of a moderate expansion observed in recent months after “having  changed little during 
the first quarter,” while also hi ghlighting the fact that the p icture is mixed, with 
household spending having shown “mode rate” growth and “some imp rovement” in the 
housing sector, but with business fixed investment and net expo rts having “stayed soft.”  
It observes, as in April, that in flation continued to run below  2 percent, partly reflecting 
earlier declines in energy prices , but then suggests that furth er such declines may not be 
in prospect as “energy prices a ppear to have stabilized.”  With respect to the economic 
outlook, the Committee would state that it sees the risks to th e outlook for economic 
activity and the labor market  as “nearly balanced.”  Thus, unde r Alternative B, the 
Committee would communicate its judgment that there has been some progress toward 
meeting each of the conditions for an increase in the federal f unds rate target range—
conditions that remain those la id out in prior statements—but t hat the conditions have not 
yet been met.  A statement along the lines of Alternative B mig ht well be interpreted by 
financial market participants a s allowing for the possibility t hat firming could begin at 
one of the next couple of meetings  while leaving open the possi bility that firming might 
begin later, with the timing t o be determined by data that will  be released in coming 
months. 
Under Alternative C, the Comm ittee would take a more positive p erspective on 
the strength of the economy a nd the progress achieved in meetin g the conditions for 
beginning firming.  The Committee would indicate that economic conditions are likely to 
warrant raising the target range f or the federal funds rate aft er it sees “some” further 
improvement in labor market c onditions and provi ded that it is reasonably confident that 
inflation will return to 2 percent  over the medium term; it als o would report its 
assessment that the risk of inflation running persistently belo w 2 percent “has 
diminished.”  Because the draft st atement for Alternative C off ers a more positive 
interpretation of the  data than the draft statement for Alterna tive B, a decision along the 
lines of Alternative C would likel y increase private-sector exp ectations that policy 
firming will begin in the near term. 
Under Alternative C′ the Com mittee would be still more upbeat, referring to a 
“substantial improvement in labor market conditio ns in recent m onths” and indicating 
Alternatives

  that it expects the labor marke t to continue moving toward—or t o reach—maximum 
employment.  In addition, the Com mittee would say that it sees the risks to the outlook 
for economic activity and the labor market as “balanced.”  Furt hermore, under 
Alternative C′ the Committee would indicate that it is now “rea sonably confident that 
inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.”  I n light of these 
assessments, the Committee would a nnounce an increase in the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate.   
Under Alternative A, the Committee would express less optimism and greater 
uncertainty about the strength of  the economy and would be categorical in stating that the 
inflation criterion is far from  being met.  The Committee’s dou bts about the underlying 
strength of the economy would be conveyed by its description of  the expansion observed 
since the first quarter as ha ving proceeded only “moderately,” and by stating that growth 
in household spending “has been mod erate,” the recovery in the housing sector 
“remained slow,” business fixed i nvestment “stayed soft,” and exports “were weak.”  
With regard to inflation, the Co mmittee would state that “infla tion continued to run well 
below the Committee’s longer-run objective.”  The Committee wou ld also state in 
Alternative A that it sees the  risks to the outlook for economi c activity and the labor 
market as “tilted to the downs ide,” and it would voice a concer n that inflation could run 
“substantially” below  2 percent “for a protracted period.”  Opt ional language associated 
with this alternative would also express concern about the labo r market outlook.  In 
addition to expressing these judgm ents, the suggested language in Alternative A would 
state that the Committee will not  raise its target for the fede ral funds rate until it projects 
that inflation will reach 2 percent within one to two years.  T he draft statement for 
Alternative A also i ncludes language indica ting that the Committee “is prepared to use all 
of its tools as necessary to ret urn inflation to 2 percent with in one to two years.”  The 
more downbeat assessment of the data and outlook in the draft s tatement for Alternative 
A, along with its suggestion that additional steps to provide policy accommodation might 
be forthcoming, would likely lower expectations of a rate hike this year.   
With respect to the Committee’s characterization of its approac h to removing 
policy accommodation, under Alternatives A, B  and C the Committ ee would retain the 
“balanced approach” language that it has used for quite some time.  Under Alternative C′ 
the Committee would explicitly refer to the “data driven” chara cter of the policy-firming 
sequence.  In Alternatives A and Cʹ, the Committee would offer the judgment that it 
expects that the economy will evolve in a manner that “eventual ly will warrant” or  
“warrants” a gradual increase in  the target range for the feder al funds rate.

  APRIL 2015  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee  met in March 
suggests that economic growth slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting 
transitory factors.  The pace of job gains moderated, and the u nemployment rate 
remained steady.  A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of 
labor resources was little cha nged.  Growth in household spendi ng declined; 
households’ real incomes rose strongly, partly r eflecting earli er declines in energy 
prices, and consumer sentiment remains high.  Business fixed in vestment softened, 
the recovery in the housing sector remained slow, and exports d eclined.  Inflation 
continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and d ecreasing prices of non-energy i mports.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensati on remain low; survey-based mea sures of longer-
term inflation expectations have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks t o foster maximum 
employment and price stabil ity.  Although growth in output and employment slowed 
during the first quarter, the Com mittee continues to expect tha t, with appropriate 
policy accommodation, economic ac tivity will expand at a modera te pace, with labor 
market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committe e judges consistent 
with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risk s to the outlook for 
economic activity and the labor m arket as nearly balanced.  Inf lation is anticipated to 
remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Comm ittee expects inflation 
to rise gradually toward 2 percen t over the medium term as the labor market improves 
further and the transitory eff ects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  
The Committee continues to mon itor inflation developments close ly.  
3. To support continued progress to ward maximum employment and price stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its  view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate.  In determining how  long to maintain this 
target range, the Committee wi ll assess progress—both realized and expected—
toward its objectives of maximum  employment and 2 percent infla tion.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indica tors of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and inter national developments.  The Committee anticipates 
that it will be appropriate to rai se the target range for the f ederal funds rate when it 
has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasona bly confident that 
inflation will move back to its  2 percent objective over the me dium term. 
4. The Committee is maintaini ng its existing policy of reinvest ing principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of l onger-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial  conditions. 
5. When the Committee decide s to begin to remove policy accommo dation, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent w ith its longer-run goals of maxim um employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near  mandate-consistent levels, ec onomic conditions

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee may view recent data releases as having sent mixe d signals 
regarding the economic outlook.  Po licymakers’ overall assessme nt, like the staff’s, may 
be that, on balance, the outlook f or economic activity is littl e changed since the April 
meeting.  Growth in household spending has been moderate, the r ecovery in the housing 
sector has shown some improvement, and payroll employment has p osted two solid 
monthly gains.  But lower ener gy prices and the higher dollar a re still weighing on 
business fixed investment and net exports, and the boost to con sumer spending from 
higher real household income a ppears not to have materialized t o the degree expected.  In 
the labor market, recent developments—including a stronger pace  of job gains—have 
pointed to some improvement in ove rall labor market conditions, but looking across a 
broad range of indicators, partic ipants may judge that there is still room for further 
improvement in the labor market.  Furthermore, with Greece’s fi scal and financial 
problems still unresolved, the C ommittee may see the downside r isks posed to the 
economic outlook as still notable .  On the inflation front, par ticipants—while encouraged 
that the effects of the energy price declines w itnessed in the last year are apparently 
subsiding—may judge that inflation remains subdued and that the 12-month inflation rate 
is likely to run below 2 percent fo r some time.  Consequently, although the Committee 
may be encouraged by the better tone of recent labor market data and by the prospect that the effects of energy price declines on overall inflation will dissipate, it may see merit in 
awaiting the accrual of additional information before a judgmen t can be reached that 
economic growth will proceed at a rate sufficient to deliver fu rther improvement in the 
labor market and to move inflat ion back to its 2 percent longer -run objective.  If so, 
policymakers might conclude that it is appropriate to issue a s tatement like that 
associated with Alternative B, in which the Committee would update its characterization of economic developments but w ould eschew any indication of the  time at which it 
expects the conditions that wa rrant policy tightening to be met . 
  According to the Desk’s most recent primary dealer survey, market participants 
assign roughly equal probability t o initiation of p olicy firmin g in September and to a later 
commencement of firming.  Some pa rticipants may see this probab ility distribution as 
inconsistent with the likel y date of policy firming implied by their own assessment of the 
economic outlook.  In light of the recent improvement in labor market indicators and 
signs of more vibrancy in the housing sector, thes e participants may judge that the 
economic expansion is gaining momentum; moreover, their confide nce that inflation over 
the medium term will run at or close to the Committee’s 2 perce nt goal may have been

  bolstered by the recent increas e in energy prices.  Against thi s background, they might 
consider issuing a statement w hose characterization of the data  has the effect of 
increasing the perceived probability of a policy firming this s ummer.  However, they 
might also judge that there curren tly is substantial uncertaint y about the economic 
outlook and thus prefer to wait for additional information to c onfirm the growing strength 
of the expansion before encouragin g a change in expectations ab out the policy-rate path.  
Some policymakers may worry that a protracted p eriod of near-zero interest rates 
might spur excessive leverage or  encourage investors to search for yield by taking on 
excessive risk.  However, they may judge that signs of excessiv e risk-taking are not 
widespread, and that use of shor t-term financing instruments an d indicators of leverage 
have, to date, remained at moderate levels.  In addition, they may be concerned that a 
premature tightening of policy cou ld pose risks to financial st ability by undermining the 
economic recovery and increasing loan losses, thereby impairing  the balance sheets of 
financial institutions.  Policymakers may accordingly conclude that maintaining the 
current target range at this  meeting, and continuing to indicat e that the timing of policy 
firming will be data dependent without expressing a view about the most likely timing for 
the first increase in the target range for the federal funds ra te, will not raise the risks to 
financial stability appreciably. 
Even in the wake of recent labor  market data, some policymakers  may want to see 
more improvement in the labor m arket.  Participants who anticip ate only a slow reduction 
in resource slack may also see inflation as likely to run well below 2 percent over the 
medium term.  If so, they might c onclude that further policy st imulus would be helpful in 
speeding progress toward the C ommittee’s longer-run objectives.   However, they may 
judge that, with the economy e xpanding moderately, it is approp riate to wait for 
additional information regardi ng spending and employment, as we ll as on the effects of 
the recent increase in oil and gasoline prices, before making a decision regarding 
additional policy accommodation.  Also, they may take some reassurance from the 
observation that survey measures  of longer-term i nflation expectations appear well 
anchored and market-based measures of longer-term inflation com pensation have edged 
up over the intermeeting period.  Mor eover, if members judge th at the Committee has 
only limited scope to provide furt her monetary stimulus, they m ay choose to forgo the 
provision of additional policy accommodation at this time in or der to preserve sufficient 
scope for possible action in the f uture—for example, if the eco nomy were to be hit by an 
adverse shock or if the ris k of deflation were to rise.

  A statement along the lines of t hat in Alternative B would be b roadly in line with 
the expectations of financial mar ket participants .  According t o the Desk’s latest survey, 
most of the primary dealers expe ct the Committee to update its characterization of 
economic conditions.  Furthermore, the dealers reported seeing only a slight chance of a 
change in the stance of moneta ry policy occurrin g at this meeting; they place roughly 
equal probabilities on the ini tiation of policy firming occurring in September or at a later 
FOMC meeting.  Therefore, if the Committee issued a statement l ike that in Alternative 
B, interest rates along the mat urity spectrum would likely be little changed.  Equity prices 
and the foreign exchange value  of the dollar would probably als o exhibit littl e response.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may judge that the weakness registered in measures  of output and 
spending earlier in the year was  primarily a reflection of temp orary factors, and that a 
solid underlying expansion in econo mic activity is still under way.  They may view the 
remaining slack in labor markets as small and as likely to be e liminated relatively 
quickly.  They might note that the discouraging in itial estimat e of the annualized change 
in first-quarter GDP may largel y reflect transitory factors and  incorrect seasonal 
adjustment, and they may expect s trong growth during the remain der of the year.  
Participants might also highlight  economic indicators, such as the ISM’s 
nonmanufacturing composite index, that suggest that activity ha s remained solid in the 
services sector, which accounts for the bulk of private-sector economic activity.  
Furthermore, they might cite the  broad-based improvement in lab or market conditions 
since the April meeting as eviden ce that there has been substan tial progress toward 
maximum employment.  The recent acceleration in some measures o f wages along with 
the stabilization of energy pri ces might have raised policymake rs’ confidence that 
inflation will move back toward 2 percent in a timely fashion.  Taking all these 
considerations toge ther, policymakers may judge not only that a sustained economic 
expansion is in prospect for t he period ahead but also be confi dent that inflation will 
gradually move toward 2 percent ov er the medium term as labor m arket conditions 
improve further.  In addition, policymakers may note that, for the past several meetings, 
most of the simple policy rule ex ercises and the optimal contro l simulations in the 
“Monetary Policy Strategie s” section of Tealbook, Book B, have been calling for policy 
tightening to begin.  For all of  these reasons, they might choose to issue a statement along 
the lines of that proposed in Alte rnative C, which signals that  the commencement of 
policy firming is likely to occur in the near term.

  Policymakers may view the 250,000 average monthly gain in nonfa rm private 
payrolls over the past two months as grounds to be confident that the economy and the 
labor market have sufficient mome ntum to maintain further progr ess toward maximum 
employment.  Their confidence i n this view might be buttressed by the observations that 
wages, as measured by the 12-mont h change in the Employment Cos t Index, have been 
trending higher over the past year . Policymakers may note that job gains and rising wages 
should translate into higher household income, a development th at should boost 
consumption spending. 
With labor markets tighter and wages accelerating, policymakers  may worry that, 
under a trajectory for the feder al funds rate similar to the median policy rate projection in 
the March SEP, the risk that i nflation could persistently excee d the Committee’s longer-
run goal in coming years is greate r than the risk of persistent ly too low inflation.  If they 
have this concern, they may regar d it as desirable to modify th e postmeeting statement to 
indicate that “the Committee judges that the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 
percent has diminished.”  Such a change would also suggest that the Committee is likely to begin to remove policy accommodation sooner than market part icipants currently 
anticipate. 
On the basis of the above reasoni ng, participants may see the a lternative scenario 
“Faster Growth with Higher Inflation” in the “Risks and Uncerta inty” section of 
Tealbook, Book A, as better represen ting their views about the economic outlook than 
does the staff’s baseline projec tion.  In this case, policymake rs may believe that the 
Committee should raise the target range for the federal funds r ate sooner, and possibly 
more rapidly, than sugges ted under Altern ative B.  
A decision to issue a statemen t along the lines of Alternative C would likely 
surprise market participants.  T he perceived probability of an increase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate in July or September likely would ri se, while the perceived 
probability that policy firming will begin late this year or ne xt year likely would go 
down.  In response to a statement like that in Alternative C, m edium- and longer-term 
real interest rates would likel y rise, inflation compensation and equity prices would 
probably decline, while the dolla r would likely appreciate.  In vestors might further react 
by revising up the expected pace of policy tightening in the fi rming phase—a reaction 
that could magnify the increase in real longer-term interest ra tes in the wake of the 
announcement.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C′ 
Some policymakers may see progr ess—both realized and expected—t oward the 
Committee’s statutory goals as sufficient to justify initiation  of policy firming at the June 
meeting.  These policymakers ma y judge that recent data, partic ularly the substantial 
improvement in labor market cond itions in the p ast two months and the robust pace of 
retail sales in May, make clear that the slowdown in economic g rowth observed in the 
first quarter was transitory and t hat progress toward full employment has resumed.  And 
with energy prices no longer fall ing and the labor market tightening, these policymakers 
may be reasonably confident that inflation will, over the mediu m term, return to the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  Therefore, they ma y view it as appropriate 
for the Committee to issue a sta tement along th e lines of Alter native C ′, which indicates 
that both of the Committee’s criteria for commencing policy nor malization have been 
satisfied and announces a 25 basis-po int increase in the target  range for the federal funds 
rate to ¼ to ½ percent.1 
The draft statement for this alternative also provides new forward guidance 
indicating that the C ommittee currently an ticipates a gradual p ace of policy firming but 
also emphasizing that the contour  of the federal funds rate dur ing the firming phase will 
remain data dependent.  Policymakers may see such guidance as p otentially useful in 
communicating the approach to po licy decisions that the Committee will take after the 
initial increase in the target range. 
The draft statement for Alternative C ′ also refers to a separate document that the 
staff has proposed as a way of a nnouncing the various measures that the Federal Reserve 
would be taking to implement the Committee’s policy decision.  This policy 
implementation note would contai n information about the policy normalization tools that 
will be used to move the federal  funds rate into its new target  range and maintain it in that 
range.2  For example, the document mi ght announce (1) a decision by th e Board of 
Governors to raise the interes t rate paid on reserve balances t o ½ percent—a decision that 
would become effective on the day a fter the new federal funds rate target range is 
                                                            
1 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in the dr aft statement for Alternative Cʹ as 
premature in present circumstan ces but might see this language as potentially appropriate when the time 
arrives to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate ab ove its effective lower bound. 
2 The memo, “Proposal for Communicating Details Regarding the Im plementation of Monetary 
Policy at Liftoff and After” (by Deborah Leonard of the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York and Gretchen 
Weinbach of the Board of Governors), sent to the Committee on J une 10, 2015, provides greater detail 
regarding this note on policy implementation actions.

  announced; (2) the FOMC’s domestic  policy directive to the Open  Market Desk, 
containing instructions for the  conduct of open market operatio ns, including the offering 
rate and maximum scale for ON RRPs and perhaps term RRPs, as we ll as instructions for 
balance-sheet management (such as reinvestment policies); (3) a decision by the Board of 
Governors to raise the primary credit rate  by ¼ percent to 1 pe rcent—a decision that 
would become effective on the day a fter the new target range fo r the federal funds rate is 
announced; and (4) if and when polic ymakers choose, language to  delegate to the Chair 
authority to make modest interm eeting adjustments to the ON RRP rate and the interest 
rate on reserve balances. 
There are three reasons for including such details in a separate policy 
implementation note rather than i n the main text of the Committ ee’s postmeeting 
statement.  First a separate document would make clear that the  Committee’s economic 
assessment, outlook, and chosen sta nce of monetary policy—the c rux of which is the 
target range for the federal funds rate—are distinct from the o perational tools used to 
achieve that policy stance.  T he second reason relates to the g overnance of the policy 
tools.  The policy implementa tion note would provide informatio n about administered 
rates that require a vote of the Board of Governors, and about the details for operations 
governed by the Committee.  By con solidating all of this inform ation into a single 
document, the policy implementa tion note would signal that deci sions about these 
implementation details are made in tandem by the FOMC and the B oard to keep the 
federal funds rate in the target range establis hed by the FOMC.   The third reason relates 
to policy communications.  As the Committee has discussed, it m ay prove necessary to 
adjust one or more of the policy tools after the commencement o f policy firming in order 
to keep the federal funds rate in its target range, and the Com mittee may wish to 
announce such adjustments in a docu ment separate from its postmeeting statement 
because these adjustments would have no bearing on the Committe e’s intended stance of 
policy.   
A decision to issue a statemen t along the lines of Alternative C′ at the end of the 
June FOMC meeting would greatly sur prise financial market parti cipants.  In response, 
medium- and longer-term real inter est rates would likely rise, inflation compensation and 
equity prices would probably decline, and the dollar would likely appreciate.  Investors would quite likely revise up the  expected pace of policy tighte ning in the firming phase—
magnifying the increase in real longer-term interest rates in the wake of the announcement.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Although policymakers may be encouraged by the recent rise in private payroll 
employment, they may continue to b e concerned about whether sig nificant gains in 
employment can be sustained in the absence of substantially faster growth of economic 
activity, and they may be quite un certain regarding the likelihood that the second-quarter 
rebound in economic growth will be followed by acceptable progr ess toward the 
Committee’s objectives.  These pa rticipants may judge that, whi le economic activity does 
appear to have moved up somewhat in the second quarter, the inc rease in out put over the 
first half of the year is meager, on net, and that a moderate p ace of increase in aggregate 
demand has not reemerged despite highly accommodative monetary conditions.  They 
might also point to weakness in business fixed investment as an indication that the 
underlying trend in private domestic  demand is unsatisfactory.  In view of the softness in 
much of the incoming data and the  uncertainty about how much to  attribute to temporary 
or statistical factors, some po licymakers may be concerned that there is insufficient 
underlying strength in the econom y to support further improveme nt in labor market 
conditions; indeed they may judge that the risks to the outlook  for economic activity and 
the labor market are “tilted t o the downside.”  In addition, with both core and headline 
inflation continuing to run well below 2 pe rcent and with marke t-based measures of 
inflation expectati ons only slightly above  earlier lows, these policymakers may continue 
to see a substantial risk that inflation will run persistently below the Committee’s stated 
goal.  In light of such worries a bout the strength of the econo mic recovery and the 
outlook for inflation, these policymakers may want to lay out more stringent criteria for 
the beginning of policy normaliza tion than those embodied in Al ternative B. 
These policymakers may judge tha t the Committee likely will nee d to provide 
additional policy accommodation.  Th ey may see it as likely tha t the long-run equilibrium 
real interest rate has decline d, as suggested by the “Lower Lon g-Run Equilibrium Funds 
Rate” alternative simulati on in Tealbook, Book A.  If such a de cline has occurred, a 
policy decision that encouraged a  lowering of the expected fede ral funds rate path might 
be needed simply to restore the previously-prevailing degree of  policy accommodation.  
For any of these reasons, policymakers might view it as desirab le to announce that the 
Committee would be prepared, as n ecessary, to use all of its to ols to return inflation to  
2 percent over the medium term, a nd to indicate th at the return  of the federal funds rate to 
a more normal level is likely to be gradual.  Participants may therefore favor the language 
in the last paragraph in the statement for Alternative A, which  indicates the Committee’s

  expectation that “the economy will evolve in a manner that even tually will warrant a 
gradual increase in the target federal funds rate.”  
A statement like that in Alternative A would surprise financial  market 
participants.  Investors would likely push further into the fut ure their expectations of the 
date of the first increase in the  target range for the federal funds rate.  In addition, insofar 
as market participants view the  new language in the fifth parag raph of the statement for 
Alternative A as providing furth er clarity about the Committee’ s reaction function, a 
flattening of the expected path for the federal funds rate is also possible.  Longer-term 
yields would decline, inflation c ompensation and equity prices might rise, and the dollar 
could depreciate.  However, if inve stors read the statement in Alternative A as reflecting 
a more downbeat assessment of t he outlook for economic growth a nd inflation, equity 
prices would not rise as much or  could even decline, and inflat ion compensation could 
fall.

  DIRECTIVE  
The directive that was issued after the April meeting appears o n the next page.  It 
is followed by a two versions of the June directive for Alternatives A, B, and C.  The first 
version is identical to the Ap ril directive.  The second direct ive incorporates the no 
substantive “housekeeping”  updates recommended by staff.3  If the Committee approves 
of these housekeeping changes, i t might be inclined to make the se changes now, rather 
than waiting until it raises the target range for the federal f unds rate, simply to avoid 
speculation that the housekeepi ng changes are connected to the increase in the target 
range. 
The draft directive for Altern ative C´, on the subsequent page,  also reflects the 
text that staff proposes to use when the target range for the f ederal funds rate is first 
increased. 
Regarding balance sheet  policies, all of the draft directives continue to instruct the 
Desk to maintain the current po licy of reinvesting principal pa yments from its holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-b acked securities in agency mor tgage-backed 
securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities int o new issues.  
                                                            
3 The proposed changes are explained in the memo to the Committe e referenced in footnote 2.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has developed a projection of the Federal Reserve’s b alance sheet and 
income statement that is broadl y consistent with the monetary p olicy assumptions 
incorporated in the staff’s forecast presented in Tealbook, Boo k A.  As in the April 
Tealbook scenario, we assume that policy firming will begin in the third quarter of 2015 
and that reinvestments of matur ing Treasury securities and the reinvestment of principal 
received on agency securities wi ll continue through the first q uarter of 2016.  
Reinvestments cease in the second quarter, and thereafter, the SOMA portfolio shrinks 
through redemptions of maturing T reasury and agency debt securi ties as well as 
paydowns of principal from agency MBS.  Regarding the Federal R eserve’s use of its 
policy normalization tools, we a ssume that the level of overnig ht reverse repurchase 
agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end of 20 18 and then falls to zero 
by the end of 2019, and that term depo sits and term RRPs are no t used during the 
normalization period.1,2  The bullets below highlight som e key features of the projecti ons 
for the Federal Reserve’s bala nce sheet and income statement un der these assumptions. 
 Balance sheet. As shown in the exhibit “Total A ssets and Selected Balance Shee t 
Items” and in the table that follows, the size of the portfolio  is normalized in the 
second quarter of 2021, the same quart er as in the April Tealbo ok.3,4  Once 
reserve balances reach their new steady-state level, total asse ts stand at $2.3 
1 Use of RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in the co mposition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in RRPs or term deposits—but would not 
produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
2 We also assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts remain 
around $155 billion throughout the projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s considered normalized when re serve balances reach an assumed 
$100 billion steady-state level.  A t this time, the size of the  securities portfolio is primarily determined by 
the level of currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capit al and the projected steady-state level of 
reserve balances.  
4 Reflecting recent changes in the Treasury’s cash management po licy, we now assume a Treasury 
General Account (TGA) balance of $150 billion, up from $75 bill ion.  This change immediately reduces 
reserve balances by the incremen tal increase in the TGA, and, a ll else equal, the size of the balance sheet 
would normalize roughly one quart er earlier than in the April T ealbook.  However, res erve balances drift 
back up towards the April path b ecause agency MBS prepayments a re lower over the next few years 
relative to the previous Tealbook projection.

trillion, with about $2.1 trillion in total SOMA securities holdings.  Total assets 
and securities holdings increase thereafter, keeping pace with growth in currency in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   The next exhibit, “Income Projections,” shows the 
implications of the balance shee t projection and interest rate assumptions for 
Federal Reserve income.
5  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to be about 
$90 billion this year (down a b it from their $100 billion peak in 2014) and then to 
decline further over the next f ew years.  Annual remittances re ach their trough of 
roughly $35 billion in 2019; no defe rred asset is recorded.6  The Federal 
Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are abo ut $1 trillion, 
approximately $270 billion above the staff estimate of the amou nt that would 
have been observed had there b een no asset purchase programs, a nd roughly 
$30 billion greater than in the April Tealbook projection.7 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio is influenced importan tly by the level of interest ra tes.  The staff 
estimates that the portfolio w as in an unrealized gain position  of about 
$165 billion as of the end of May.8  Reflecting the assume d rise in longer-term 
interest rates over the next several years, the position is pro jected to shift to an 
unrealized loss by the middle  of 2016 and record a peak unreali zed loss of about 
$210 billion in 2019, roughly $60 billion more than projected in the April Tealbook.  At the end of that  year, roughly $100 billion of the  unrealized losses 
can be attributed to the portfo lio of Treasury securities and $110 billion to the 
portfolio of MBS.  The unrealized l oss position then narrows th rough 2025, as 
5 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains a t 25 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound.  In addition, we assume that, once firming of the 
policy rate begins, the spread be tween the interest rate paid o n reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 
25 basis points.  Moreover, we assume that the effective federa l funds rate will aver age about 15 basis 
points below the rate paid on reserve balances and about 10 bas is points above the ON RRP rate.   
6 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capit al paid-in, a deferred asset would be recorded.  
7 The staff estimate is a linear interpolation from 2006 to 2025  of actual 2006 income and 
projected 2025 income. 
8 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at

securities acquired under the larg e-scale asset purchase progra ms mature or pay 
down and new securities are added to the portfolio at then-current market rates. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” t he effect of the Federal Reserv e’s elevated 
stock of longer-term securities on the term premium embedded in  the 10-year 
Treasury yield in the second quart er of 2015 is estimated to be  negative 112 basis 
points, slightly less than the projection in the April Tealbook .  Over the next 
couple of years, the term premium effect diminishes at a pace of about 5 basis 
points per quarter, reflecting the projected shrinking of the p ortfolio. 
 Monetary base.  As shown in the final table, “Projections for the Monetary Bas e,” 
once policy firming begins in t he third quarter of 2015, the mo netary base first 
grows less rapidly and then s hrinks through the second quarter of 2021, primarily 
because redemptions of securiti es generate corresponding reductions in reserve 
balances.  Starting around mid-2021, after reserve balances are  assumed to have 
stabilized at $100 billion, the monetary base begins to expand in line with the 
increase in currency in circulation.9 
9 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  In this projection, a steady $100 billion take- up in an ON RRP facility is assumed and, 
therefore, the level of the mone tary base is lower than it woul d otherwise be until 2019 (when the facility is 
assumed to be phased out).  The projected growth rate of the monetary base, however, is generally 
unaffected.  If the FOMC employs additional reserve-draining to ols during normalization or ON RRP take-
up is larger than assumed, the p rojected level of reserve balances and the monetary bas e could decline quite 
markedly.

M2 growth is expected to mode rate a bit in the second quarter o f 2015; thereafter, 
M2 is projected to contract  notably through mid-2016 and then to move up slowly over 
the remainder of the forecast pe riod as the projected increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate and the associ ated rise in the opportunity c ost of holding money 
restrains money demand.  The incr ease in the opportunity cost is expected to hold M2 
growth below that of nominal GDP in 2016 and, to a lesser exten t, in 2017.  There are 
significant uncertainties surr ounding the M2 forecast.  For exa mple, it is possible that 
banks may respond to increases in short-term interest rates som ewhat differently than in 
the past, in particular because of important changes to bank re gulation.  (See

Bank Regulation, Deposit Outflows, and the Demand for ON RRPs 
Changes in the regulatory framework for banks may affect the demand for overnight 
reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) during policy normalization. In particular, 
new liquidity and capital regulations encourage large banks to reduce certain deposit 
liabilities. Industry analysts have estimated that these regulations could spur deposit 
outflows of at least $450 billion, but staff analysis suggests a small er estimate, around 
$300 billion, at a broader set of banks.1 Still, outflows of this magnitude could result in 
a modest increase in the demand for ON RRPs, as money market funds (MMFs) are 
likely recipients of some of these investments, and could place a portion of such 
inflows in ON RRPs. In this box, we review the staff estimate of deposit outflows, and 
discuss the possible increased demand for ON RRPs that could result. 
Three regulatory requirements provide incentives for the largest banks to reduce 
nonoperational deposits, particularly those of financial firms.2 First, the liquidity 
coverage ratio applies substantial “runoff rates” for such deposits which, in turn, 
implies that such deposits must be matched by substantial holdings of high quality 
liquid assets (HQLA).3 Second, the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requires 
tier 1 capital to be held against all assets including HQLA. As a result, the “allin” cost 
of financing with nonoperational deposits is relatively high given that they must be 
backed by relatively lowyielding HQLA. Lastly, a couple of globally systemically 
important banking organizations (GSIBs) have suggested that reducing these deposits 
could help them attain a lower GSIB capital surcharge. 
In response to these regulatory changes, JP Morgan Chase announced earlier this year 
that it would reduce its holdings of financial nonoperational deposits by $100 billion 
over 2015, about 50 percent of their holdings of such deposits. Some market analysts 
estimate that the four largest GSIBs taken together—JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, 
Bank of America, and Citigroup—could shed as much as $450 billion of nonoperational 
deposits. However, these estimates are based on publicly available data which 
provide only a coarse measurement of such deposits. In addition, these estimates 
exclude two large GSIBs, State Street and Bank of New York Mellon, which both hold 
1 This box focuses on the incentives for banks to shed private deposits and the potential 
implications for ON RRP demand. Many foreign official institutions maintain balances at U.S. 
commercial banks and banks could have incentives to reduce these deposit balances as well. Similar 
to private deposits, a portion of these funds could flow to government only MMFs and then 
indirectly add to ON RRP demand. In addition, foreign official institutions could add funds to the 
accounts they already maintain at the Federal Reserve; in that case, the level of RRP with foreign 
official institutions—a separate program from ON RRP—would likely increase. 
2 Typically, nonoperational deposits are calculated as the amount of deposits held in any type of 
deposit account in excess of that needed for a depositor’s normal volume of operations, such as for 
payment or settlement services. Deposits of retail or small business customers are excluded. 
3 The runoff rates for the nonoperational deposits of financial and nonfinancial firms are 100 
percent and 40 percent, respectively.

notable quantities of financial nonoperational deposits, as well as the remaining two 
other GSIBs based in the United States, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. 
Confidential supervisory data indicate that nonoperational deposits equal about $1.2 
trillion of $5.4 trillion total deposits at the GSIBs, and are comprised of roughly equal 
amounts owed to financial and nonfinan cial firms. Assuming that banks reduce their 
financial nonoperational deposits by 50 percent and nonfinancial nonoperational 
deposits by 10 percent—outflow rates that are based on conversations with a few of 
the GSIBs—a simple calculation suggests a likely total outflow from GSIBs of around 
$300 billion (table 1). That said, there is considerable uncertainty around such 
estimates.

Banks noted a significant share of financial nonoperational deposits are held by hedge 
funds.4 One way that banks could reduce these deposits is by channeling deposits to 
the banks’ own affiliated government MMFs, given the strong preference of hedge 
funds for stable sources of liquidity and the additional fee income for the bank. If all 
$300 billion of these outflows were to be invested in government MMFs that are 
Federal Reserve counterparties for ON RRP operations and if the investor behavior of 
government MMFs remains the same as in the past year, then a rough estimate of the 
increased demand for ON RRPs would be $5090 billion.5 However, demand for ON 
RRPs could be lower if deposits shift to other places, such as regional banks. 
4 Deposits of foreign official entities and corporations may be affected but to a lesser extent. 
5 On average over the past year, government MMFs that are Federal Reserve counterparties 
invested 17 percent of their assets in ON RRPs, and as much as 30 percent at recent quarter ends.

In addition, the demand from government money funds could depend on the supply 
of instruments eligible for purchase, such as Treasury bills and private repos.6 
Over the past year, the overall size of bank affiliated government MMFs has not 
changed much, an indication that the shedding of nonoperational deposits is still in its 
early stages. Looking ahead, there are a number of uncertainties surrounding the 
outlook for deposit runoffs and the associated effects on ON RRP demand. For 
instance, an increase in yields on money market instruments relative to rates on 
nonoperational deposits may encourage the depositors to shift funds out of banks 
into other investments. On the other hand, the incentive for banks to shed 
nonoperational deposits could decrease after liftoff; for example, yields on high
quality liquid assets may rise faster than deposit rates, making these deposits a more 
attractive funding source. 
6 Market participants have noted a reduction of investment opportunities available in private 
repo markets. In addition, some have suggested that the supply of Treasury bills has declined; 
however, the Department of Treasury, in acknowledging high demand for Treasury bills, has 
explicitly stated its plans to increase the level of Treasury bills outstanding, at least somewhat.
