The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity a nd inflation in the near term.  Medium-term prescriptions 
derived from dynamic simulations o f the rules are discussed below.  All of the Taylor-
type rules prescribe an immediat e increase in the federal funds rate.  The Taylor (1993) 
and Taylor (1999) rules call for sizable increases in the federal funds rate to values of 
1 percent or higher over the near term.  The inertial Taylor (1 999) rule prescribes less-
sizable interest-rate increases —to just over ¼ pe rcent this quarter and just under 
½ percent in the next quarter—because this rule places a consid erable weight on keeping 
the federal funds rate close t o its lagged value.  The first-di fference rule, which responds 
to expected changes in the out put gap and does not depend on a measure of the longer-
run real interest rate, calls f or values of the federal funds rate of just under ¼ percent in 
the third and f ourth quarters. 
All four simple rules prescribe  policy rates for  the current an d next quarters that 
are similar to their prescrip tions in the June Tealbook.  As ex plained in Tealbook, Book 
A, and as shown in the lower-left panel of the exhibit, the per cent deviation of output 
from potential is essentially the same as in the previous Tealb ook through 2017.  The 
staff’s projection for core PCE inflation rises a bit more slow ly toward 2 percent, 
reflecting some limited pass-through from recent declines in en ergy prices and a more 
persistent slowdown in health -care services inflation.  
The top panel of the first exhibit also reports the Tealbook-co nsistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real  federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model.  This 
measure is an estimate of the r eal federal funds rate that woul d, if maintained, return 
output to potential in 12 quarters .  The current estimate of r*, -0.06, is essentially the 
same as the current-quarter estim ate derived from the staff’s outlook in June.  The actual 
real federal funds rate, at about −1.1 percent, is over 100 basis points belo w the current 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules.

estimate of r*.  This difference between r* and the actual real feder al funds rate is well 
within the range recorde d thus far this year.  
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulat ions reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the output gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, subject to an effective lower bound of 
12½ basis points for the federal  funds rate.  The results for e ach rule presented in these 
and subsequent simulations depend importantly on the assumption s that policymakers 
will adhere to the rule in the future and that the private sect or fully understands the policy 
that will be pursued as well as  its implications for real activ ity and inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implications, in FRB/US, o f following the 
baseline monetary policy assumpti ons in the current staff forec ast.2  As discussed in 
Tealbook, Book A, the staff assumes th at the first increase in the federal funds rate will 
occur at the September FOMC meeting.  After departing from its effective lower bound, 
the federal funds rate is assume d to rise at the pace prescribe d by the inertial  version of 
the Taylor (1999) rule.  The federal funds rate increases about  20 basis points per quarter 
for three years, reaching 3 percent in early 2019; the pace of tightening subsequently 
slows, and the federal funds rate converges to its longer-run v alue of 3½ percent. 
All of the Taylor-type policy rules in these dynamic simulation s call for policy 
firming to begin this quarter.3  The first-difference rule c alls for firming to begin in the 
fourth quarter.  The Taylor (1993 ) and Taylor (1999) rules prod uce paths for the real 
federal funds rate that lie s ignificantly above the Tealbook baseline over the next few 
years, leading to somewhat higher unemployment rates but simila r trajectories for 
inflation.  Under the inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule, the federal funds rate initially rises a bit

underlying economic conditions that are used in the staff’s bas eline forecast, includi ng the macroeconomic 
effects of the Committee’s asset holdings from the large-scale asset purchase programs. 
3 Policy firming also begins in the third quarter under the Teal book baseline policy.  However, 
because it occurs late in the qua rter, the quarter ly average va lue for the federal fund s rate remains within 
the current target range.

above baseline but subsequently tra cks the baseline path almost  exactly.  Macroeconomic 
outcomes are essentially the same as under the Tealbook baselin e.4 
The real federal funds rate path implied by the first-differenc e rule over the next 
couple of years is also similar to that in the Tealbook baselin e, but it is somewhat lower 
than the baseline beginning in 2018.  This pattern results from  the slower pace of 
economic growth expected to occur late in the decade—after outp ut overshoots its 
potential value—because the fir st-difference rule responds to t he expected change in the 
output gap rather than its level .  The lower path of the federal funds rate in the medium 
run, in conjunction with expecta tions of higher price and wage inflation in the future, 
leads to both higher levels of resource utilization and more in flation in the short run.  
Overall, the first-difference ru le generates outcomes late in t he decade for the 
unemployment rate and the infla tion rate that, compared with th e outcomes associated 
with other policy rules, are far ther from the staff’s estimates  of the natural rate of 
unemployment and the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation  objective. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s baseline foreca st with those reported in 
June.  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keepi ng headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committ ee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping t he unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployme nt, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal cont rol that is employed here 
corresponds to a commitment po licy under which the plans that p olicymakers make today 
are assumed to constrain future policy choices.5 
Under the optimal control policy, t he real federal funds rate t racks the baseline 
closely.  Accordingly, the path of  the real 10-year Treasury yi eld under the optimal 
control policy is also virtua lly the same as in the Tealbook ba seline, leading to essentially 
the same macroeconomic outcomes.  
4 The prescriptions and outcomes of the inertial Taylor (1999) r ule and the Tealbook baseline 
policy are so close that in most of the panels of the exhibit t he lines for the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are 
not visible.  
5 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that would be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

The optimal control path for the  federal funds rate is largely similar to its path in 
the June Tealbook, as the staff’ s assessments of resource slack  and inflation are little 
changed.  Accordingly, the path for longer-term real rates implied by the optimal control 
tracks closely the path of t he previous Tealbook.  Although the  path of the unemployment 
rate under the optimal control po licy is lower than in the prev ious Tealbook, the 
unemployment rate gap is about  unchanged due to an offsetting r eduction in the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICY UNDER COMMITMENT WITH ALTERNATIVE 
PREFERENCES FOR LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES 
One of the assumptions embedded in the standard optimal control  simulations 
discussed above is that welfare losses due to unemployment are symmetric around the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  However,  policymakers may regard 
the cost of the unemployment rate being below the natural rate as considerably smaller 
than the cost of being above the  natural rate by the same amoun t.  This could be so for a 
variety of reasons, including tha t high unemployment could lead  to skill deterioration and 
thus to persistently low output, w hile the tight labor market i n an economy operating 
below the natural rate may lead workers and employers to undert ake greater investment 
in human capital and thus result  in persistently higher product ivity.  Policymakers may, 
instead, choose to ignore unemployment rate deviations as a pra gmatic response to 
uncertainty about estimates of t he natural rate of unemployment on the grounds that 
policy responses to poorly estimated unemployment gaps could le ad to policy mistakes.   
To model the first, we consid er a policymaker who attaches no losses to 
unemployment falling below the na tural rate but who retains the usual aversion to 
unemployment that exceeds the na tural rate.  To model the secon d, we consider a 
policymaker who places no weight on unemployment rate deviation s, whether positive or 
negative, thus narrowing the ar guments in the loss function to inflation deviations and 
policy rate changes.6  The fourth exhibit, “Optimal Control Policy under Commitment 
With Alternative Preferences for  Labor Market Outcomes,” displays optimal control 
simulations under these a lternative preferences. 
6 Optimal control simulations tha t place a low weight on penaliz ing deviations of unemployment 
from the natural rate are also consistent with preferences that  are more concerned with stabilizing inflation.  
Calibrations that reduce the wei ght placed on policy rate chang es produce similar results.

Given that, under the baselin e outlook, inflation is running substantially below 
target for the next few years, the first alternative optimal co ntrol simulation—the one 
which ascribes no costs to unders hooting the natural rate of un employment—advocates a 
substantially more accommodative policy path compared with the standard case of 
optimal control with equal and sy mmetric weights.  The federal funds rate departs from 
the effective lower bound in the s ame quarter as in the standar d optimal control 
simulation, but its ensuing rise is  more gradual, with the federal funds rate increasing, on 
average, 10 basis points per quart er over the next three years,  compared to 20 basis points 
per quarter in the optimal contro l simulation with standard pre ferences.  The 
unemployment rate undershoots the staff’s estimate of the natur al rate significantly more 
than in the standard case, and i nflation returns to the Committ ee’s 2 percent objective 
faster and subsequently remains slightly above target for some time.  That a scenario of 
this nature would result in the unemployment rate undershooting  the natural rate is an 
outcome that might be expected; th e substantial magnitude of th e undershooting is a 
manifestation of the estimated l ow sensitivity of inflation to resource slack in the 
FRB/US model. 
Given the staff outlook, with an une mployment rate that is expe cted to undershoot 
the natural rate for some time, the second alternative optimal control simulation—the one 
that ascribes no cost to devia tions of unemployment above or below the natural rate of 
unemployment—results in a qualitatively similar but more accomm odative version of the 
asymmetric case on the horizon s hown.  The differences in these  alternatives’ policy 
paths stem from the greater wi llingness of the policymaker who places no weight on 
labor market outcomes to tolerat e overshooting of the natural r ate of unemployment in 
the period beyond the horizon show n.  This policymaker is thus more amenable to easing 
policy aggressively early on and tightening aggressively later.7 
There are some important cavea ts attached to these findings.  N otably, the results 
are sensitive to a number of maintained modelling assumptions, including that inflation 
7 The dominating feature of the s imulations is the willingness o f the policymaker who is 
indifferent to the labor market to overshoot the natural rate m ore substantially and fo r a longer duration. 
Note that the binding portion of the overshoot occurs beyond th e horizon shown. This leads the indifferent 
policymaker to choose a more accommodative path that boosts inf lation early on.  This result is robust to 
reducing the relative weight assigned to changes in the federal  funds rate. With a lower weight on changes 
in the federal funds rate, both alternative optimal control sim ulations tolerate a slightly more rapid pace of 
increase in the federal funds rat e on some portion of the horiz on but produce very similar paths for the real 
10-year Treasury yield relative to their counterpart with similar preference over the labor market but 
stronger preference for small changes in the federal funds rate .

expectations would remain well anchored as policymakers pushed the unemployment rate 
well below the natural rate for an extended period.  Even if in flation expectations were to 
remain anchored, it is uncertain w hether the estimated low sens itivity of inflation to 
resource slack in the FRB/US m odel holds for a path of the unem ployment rate far from 
the staff’s baseline projection.

the FRB/US  model. The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the level of

The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
version  of the Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
intercepts  of these  rules are chosen  so that they are consistent  with a 2 percent  longer-run 
inflation  objective  and a longer-run  real interest  rate, denoted  rLR, of 1^ percent,  a value  used in
Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules  that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule and the first-difference  rule—the lines 
labelled  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same  lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy 
rate, for each of these  rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal  
to the average  value  for the policy  rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent  quarter,  these  
rules use the lagged  values  from  their simulated,  unconstrained  prescriptions.

Class  I FOMC  - Restricted  Controlled  (FR) July 23, 2015StrategiesESTIMATES  OF THE  EQUILIBRIUM  AND  ACTUAL  REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATES
An estimate  of the equilibrium  real federal  funds  rate appears  as a memo  item in the first 
exhibit,  “Policy  Rules  and the Staff  Projection. ” The concept  of the short-run  equilibrium  real 
rate underlying  the estimate  corresponds  to the level  of the real federal  funds  rate that is 
consistent  with output  reaching  potential  in 12 quarters  using  an output  projection  from  FRB/US,  
the staff's  large-scale  econometric  model  of the U.S. economy.  This estimate  depends  on a very 
broad  array  of economic  factors,  some  of which  take the form  of projected  values  of the model's  
exogenous  variables.  The memo  item in the exhibit  reports  the “Tealbook-consistent ” estimate  of 
r*, which  is generated  after  the paths  of exogenous  variables  in the FRB/US  model  are adjusted 
so that they match  those  in the extended  Tealbook  forecast.  Model  simulations  then determine  
the value  of the real federal  funds  rate that closes  the output  gap conditional  on the exogenous  
variables  in the extended  baseline  forecast.
The estimated  actual  real federal  funds  rate reported  in the exhibit  is constructed  as the 
difference  between  the federal  funds  rate and the trailing  four-quarter  change  in the core PCE 
price  index. The federal  funds  rate is specified  as the midpoint  of the target  range  for the federal  
funds  rate on the Tealbook,  Book  B, publication  date.
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS
The exhibits  of “Monetary  Policy  Strategies ” that report  results  from  simulations  of 
alternative  policies  are derived  from  dynamic  simulations  of the FRB/US  model.  Each  simulated  
policy  rule is assumed  to be in force  over the whole  period  covered  bythe  simulation;  this period  
extends  several  decades  beyond  the time horizon  shown  in the exhibits.  The simulations  are 
conducted  under  perfect  foresight  and are predicated  on the staff's  extended  Tealbook  projection,  
which  includes  the macroeconomic  effects  of the Committee's  large-scale  asset  purchase  
programs.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early  in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  in that 
quarter.  However,  when  the Tealbook  is published  late in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  
in the subsequent  quarter.
COMPUTATION  OF THE  OPTIMAL  CONTROL  POLICY  UNDER  COMMITMENT
The optimal  control  simulations  posit  that policymakers  minimize  a discounted  sum of 
weighted  squared  deviations  of four-quarter  headline  PCE inflation  (n^ce) from  the Committee's  
2 percent  objective,  of squared  deviations  of the unemployment  rate fromthe  staff's  estimate  of 
the natural  rate (this difference  is also known  as the unemployment  rate gap, ugap t), and of 
squared  changes  in the federal  funds  rate. The resulting  loss function,  shown  below,  embeds  the 
assumptions  that policymakers  discount  the future  using  a quarterly  discount  factor  ft = 0.9963  
and place equal  weights  on squared  deviations  of inflation,  the unemployment  gap, and federal  
funds  rate changes  (that is, = Augap =AR).

= y 0T (C* - nLRy + Au3ap(.ugap t+T')2 +AR(Rt+T -Rt+T_x)2} 
<T = 0
The optimal  control  policy  is the path for the federal  funds  rate that minimizes  the above  
loss function  in the FRB/US  model,  subject  to the effective  lower  bound  constraint  on nominal  
interest  rates,  under  the assumption  of perfect  foresight,  and conditional  on the staff's  extended  
Tealbook  projection.  Policy  tools  other  than the federal  funds  rate are taken  as given  and 
subsumed  within  the Tealbook  baseline.  The path chosen  by policymakers  today  is assumed  to 
be credible,  meaning  that decision  makers  in the model  see this path as being  a binding  
commitment  on the future  Committees;  the optimal  control  policy  takes  as given  the lagged  value  
of the federal  funds  rate but is otherwise  unconstrained  by policy  decisions  made  prior  to the 
simulation  period.  The discounted  losses  are calculated  over  a period  that ends  sufficiently  far 
into the future  that extending  that period  farther  would  not affect  the policy  prescriptions  shown  
in the exhibits.

Available data show continuing imp rovement in labor market cond itions this year 
and indicate that the first-quart er weakness in economic growth  was largely t ransitory.  
However, both core and headline inflation continue to run below  the Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  As presente d in the “Financial Developmen ts” section of Tealbook, 
Book A, participants in the Desk’ s Primary Dealer Survey contin ue to place very little 
weight on policy firming commencing in July; they place about 4 0 percent average 
probability on the first rate in crease happening in September a nd about 35 percent 
average probability on an increas e happening in the fourth quar ter.  Financial-market 
measures suggest broadly similar probabilities.1  Market-implied expectations about the 
path for the federal funds rat e for late-2015 and late-2016 con tinue to lie within the 
central tendency of the “dot plot ” from the June Summary of Eco nomic Projections, 
while the expected value for late -2017 again lies well below th e central tendency. 
Against this backdrop, the draft alternative statements present ed below offer a 
range of policy choices as well as a range of assessments about  recent economic 
developments and the Committee’s progress toward its objectives .  If the Committee 
chooses not to raise the target range at this meeting, a key is sue will be how to convey the 
Committee’s sense of the likelihood of various future economic outcomes and policy 
actions.  The draft statement associated with Alternative B is intended to convey the 
message that the economy has been evolving in such a way that t he Committee might 
decide to raise the target range  in September if it sees contin ued progress toward its 
objectives.  In Alternative A, the  draft statement is intended to signal that the Committee 
believes the conditions for policy firming will not be met by S eptember, particularly 
because of the risk that infla tion could run substantially belo w 2 percent for a protracted 
period.  By contrast, under Alternative C the Committee would announce that it was 
raising the target range for the  federal funds rate at this meeting. 
The draft statement associate d with Alternative B characterizes  job gains in recent 
months as “solid” and acknowledge s cumulative improvement in th e labor market “since 
early this year,” indicating that the Committee is focusing not just on the recent pace of

improvement in the labor marke t but also on the cumulative impr ovement since it 
established the criteria for  policy firming at its March meetin g.  Alternative B also 
observes that inflation continued to run below 2 percent, partl y reflecting earlier declines 
in energy prices, but does not ref er to energy price developmen ts over the intermeeting 
period because they have not mat erially affected the 12-month inflation rate or the 
outlook for inflation over the medium term.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would 
note that the housing sector has shown “additional improvement”  and characterize 
household spending, business fixed investment, and net exports as it did in its June 
statement.  The draft statement would leave the economic outloo k unchanged and also 
announce that the Committee wants to see “some” further improve ment in the labor 
market before policy firming, signa ling that progress has been made toward the labor 
market criterion that the FOMC first stated in March.  The unch anged description of the 
inflation outlook suggests that the Committee’s degree of confi dence that inflation will 
move back to its 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term is also roughly 
unchanged.  
In the draft statement for Alte rnative A, the C ommittee would p rovide an 
assessment of inflation and the l abor market, relative to the Committee’s goals, that 
would indicate that a target ran ge increase in September was no t likely.  Though the 
Committee would acknowledge “solid” job gains, it would also state that it is concerned 
that “inflation could run substa ntially below th e 2 percent obj ective for a protracted 
period.”  Moreover, under Alternat ive A, the Committee would ju dge that “economic and 
financial developments abroad” ha ve tilted the risks to the out look for the labor market 
“to the downside.”  In light of t hese risks to the economic out look, the draft statement in 
Alternative A would provide a more stringent condition for poli cy normalization, saying 
that the Committee will not raise its target range until it pro jects that “infl ation will reach 
2 percent within one to two years,” and the Committee would ind icate that it “is prepared 
to use all of its tools as necessary to return inflation to 2 p ercent within one to two years” 
if inflation “does not begin to rise soon.” 
In the draft statement associated with Alternative C the Commit tee would 
announce that its criteria fo r policy firming—laid out in March—have been met and that 
it has decided to increase the ta rget range for the federal fun ds rate by 25 basis points.  
Under Alternative C, the Comm ittee’s statement would refer to “ appreciable 
improvement in labor market cond itions since early this year” w hile acknowledging that 
inflation continues to run below the Comm ittee’s 2 percent objective.  The Committee 
would announce its expectation that the labor market will be “r eaching” levels consistent

with the Committee’s dual mandate, and state that it is “reason ably confident that 
inflation will rise to 2 percent ov er the medium term as the la bor market improves 
further.”  Nonetheless, the Com mittee would note that “the stance of monetary policy 
remains highly accommodative,” but would delete the reference t o policy 
accommodation provided through the balance sheet. 
Under Alternatives A and B, the Committee would retain the “bal anced approach” 
language that it has provided for  quite some time to characteri ze how it plans to conduct 
policy after tightening begins.  Under Alternative C, the Commi ttee would state that, in 
determining future adjustments to the target range, it will ass ess either  “realized and 
expected deviations from its objec tives of maximum employment a nd 2 percent 
inflation,” or “realized and expected economic conditions relative to its obj ectives of 
maximum employment and 2 percent in flation.”  Alternative C als o offers the option of 
stating that the Committee “will take a balanced approach to pu rsuing those objectives.”  
Furthermore, the draft statement associated with Alternative C says that the path of the 
federal funds rate will “depend on the incoming data.”  All three alternatives retain language indicating that, even on ce employment and inflation ar e close to mandate-
consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warr ant keeping the federal 
funds rate below levels the Com mittee judges as normal in the longer run. 
The next seven pages contain th e June postmeeting statement and the draft 
statements associated with the t hree alternatives; they are fol lowed by cases for each 
alternative.  After that is a  discussion about a draft implemen tation note for Alternative C 
that would be released concurren tly with the Committee’s statem ent, followed by the 
draft directives for Alternativ es A and B as well as the proposed text of the 
implementation note.

JUNE 2015 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in April suggests 
that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little 
during the first quarter.  The  pace of job gains picked up whil e the unemployment rate 
remained steady.  On balance, a ran ge of labor market indicator s suggests that 
underutilization of labor resource s diminished somewhat.  Growt h in household 
spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown som e improvement; 
however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft.   Inflation continued 
to run below the Committee’s l onger-run objective , partly refle cting earlier declines 
in energy prices and decreasing pr ices of non-energy imports; e nergy prices appear to 
have stabilized.  Market-based m easures of inflation compensati on remain low; 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations hav e remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move t oward levels the Committee judges consistent with its 
dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
activity and the labor market as nearly balance d.  Inflation is  anticipated to remain 
near its recent low level in the  near term, but the Committee e xpects inflation to rise 
gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor ma rket improves 
further and the transitory eff ects of earlier declines in energ y and import prices 
dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation develo pments closely.  
3. To support continued progress towa rd maximum employment and pri ce stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its  view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate.  In determining how  long to maintain this 
target range, the Committee wi ll assess progress—both realized and expected— 
toward its objectives of maximum  employment and 2 percent infla tion.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indica tors of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and inter national developments.  The Committee anticipates 
that it will be appropriate to rai se the target range for the f ederal funds rate when it 
has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasona bly confident that 
inflation will move back to its  2 percent objective over the me dium term. 
4. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of l onger-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial  conditions.  
5. When the Committee decides t o begin to remove policy accommodat ion, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent w ith its longer-run goals of maxim um employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near  mandate-consistent levels, ec onomic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant keep ing the target federal funds ra te below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

reasonably confident that infla tion will move back to its 2 per cent objective over the 
medium term.  The Committee curr ently anticipates that, even af ter employment and 
inflation are near mandate-cons istent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, 
warrant keeping the target federa l funds rate below levels the Committee views as 
normal in the longer run.  How ever, the actual path of t he target for the federal 
funds rate will depend on the incoming data.

from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction.  Th is policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of l onger-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial  conditions.   
6. When the Committee decides t o begin to remove policy accommodat ion, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent w ith its longer-run goals of maxim um employment and 
inflation of 2 percent. 
For Alternative C, the “Directive” section of this Tealbook, Book B includes a document 
titled “Actions to Implement Monetary Policy. ”  That document includes the directive as 
well as a list of Federal Reserve actions to implement the Committee’s monetary policy 
decision; it would be an addendum to the Co mmittee’s postmeeting statement at the time 
of liftoff and after su bsequent meetings.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Growth in household spending continues to be moderate, and the housing sector 
has shown additional improvement.  In the labor market, recent solid job gains and the 
decline in the unemployment rate contributed to improvement in overall labor market 
conditions, but looking across a broad range of indicators, pol icymakers may believe that 
there is room for further impr ovement.  Participants may be enc ouraged by the 
cumulative improvement in the la bor market since early this yea r and by the observation 
that inflation expectations appear  to be well-anchored.  Even so, they may judge that the 
12-month inflation rate is likel y to run below 2 percent for so me time as it will continue 
to be affected by the large ener gy price declines  witnessed lat e last year, and they may 
worry that the recent decline in the price of oil may further d elay the projected return of 
inflation to 2 percent.  Policym akers may thus want to wait for incoming data to confirm 
or deny their outlook that the economic expansion will support further improvement in 
the labor market and that infla tion will return to 2 percent ov er the medium term.  If so, 
participants may deem it appropriate to issue a statement like that in Alternative B, which 
would acknowledge that “underuti lization of labor resources has diminished since early 
this year,” and also ind icate that it will be appropriate to ra ise the target range after the 
Committee has seen only “some” fu rther improvement in the labor market and is 
reasonably confident that infla tion will return to 2 percent ov er the medium term. 
With the unemployment rate havi ng declined from 5.7 percent in January to 
5.3 percent in June, some policymakers may judge that the econo my is at or close to 
maximum employment and that a solid economic expansion is under  way, making them 
feel confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  These 
policymakers may thus feel that the Committee’s criteria for policy firming have been 
met.  But with inflation continuing to run below the Committee’ s objective, these 
policymakers may see the benefits  of waiting for further inform ation—including two 
employment reports prior to t he September meeting—outweighing t he risks of needing to 
raise interest rates m ore rapidly later. 
Other participants may be concer ned that inflation is not likel y to return to 
2 percent over the medium term, perhaps because they judge that there is still appreciable 
slack in labor markets—they ma y cite still-high involuntary par t-time employment and 
surprisingly low labor force pa rticipation, for example—and ant icipate only a slow 
reduction in that slack.  They m ay think it likely that the Com mittee will need to provide 
further policy accommodation to reach its objectives in the nex t few years.  These 
Alternatives

participants may nonetheless judge that, with the economy expan ding moderately and the 
unemployment rate having declined  to levels near  the longer-run  normal values reported 
in the Committee’s Summary of E conomic Projections, they would want to await further 
information before announcing additional stimulus.  Moreover, t hey may take some 
reassurance from the observation t hat survey measures of longer -term inflation 
expectations appear well anchored.  Policymakers may thus choos e to forego additional 
accommodation for now, but be alert to possible indications tha t the economy is not 
expanding at a satisfactory rate  or that inflation expectations are moving down. 
A statement like that include d in Alternative B would probably elicit little market 
reaction, but it is difficult to be  sure.  Financial-market and  survey measures suggest 
market participants do not expect  a change in the target range in July, see a good chance 
of an increase in September, but put similar or only slightly s maller odds on an increase 
in the fourth quarter.  That said, two-thirds of respondents to  the Desk surveys reported 
that they see September as the most likely meeting for the init ial increase.  It is difficult 
to assess how market participants will interpret the insertion of the word “some” in the 
third paragraph of the draft statement associated with Alternat ive B.  Most respondents 
expect no changes to forward guidance at this meeting.  Market participants could see the 
insertion of the word “some” as i ndicating that the Committee v iews the economy 
progressing in line with its outlook, which woul d lead to littl e change in the probability of 
a rate increase in September a nd a more muted market reaction.  Alternatively, if market 
participants view the insertion of  “some” as a signal that the Committee is more likely 
than not to raise the target rang e in September, then interest rates will likely increase 
some, equity prices could fall , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely 
rise. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may view continued solid job gains, t he decline of  the 
unemployment rate to 5.3 percent , the pickup in consumer spendi ng, and improvements 
in the housing sector as confirmation that the slowdown in econ omic growth observed in 
the first quarter was mostly tra nsitory and that a solid economic expansion is under way.  
These policymakers might judge that there has been appreciable improvement in labor 
market conditions since early this year.  They might also point  to the net increase in 
consumer energy prices in recent months as reasons that they are reasonably certain that 
inflation will, over the medium term, return to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run 
objective.  That is, these policym akers might view the two crit eria for policy firming— 
Alternatives

Authorized for Public Release
first included in the Committee’s March statement—as having bee n met.  In addition, 
policymakers may note that, for the past several meetings, most of the simple policy rules 
and the optimal control simulations in the “Monetary Policy Str ategies” section of 
Tealbook, Book B, have called for po licy tightening to begin.  Therefore, they may 
support issuing a statement al ong the lines of A lternative C, w hich announces a 25 basis-
point increase in the target rang e for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent.2 
Policymakers may believe that the slower-than-anticipated recov ery in output and 
employment over the past several  years reflects, to a large ext ent, a step-down in trend 
productivity growth from its pre- crisis value.  Even with modes t output growth, 
participants may judge that the recent strength in the labor ma rket is likely to persist, 
contributing to a fairly promp t increase in inflation to 2 perc ent or even higher.  They 
might view the alternative simula tion “Weak Labor Productivity,  Strong Labor Market” 
in the “Risks and Uncertain ty” section of Tealbook, Book A as b etter reflecting their 
views about the economic outlook than does the staff’s baseline projection.  These 
policymakers may be particularl y concerned that inflation could persistently exceed 
2 percent if inflation e xpectations rise as the unemployment ra te undershoots its longer-
run normal level. 
Policymakers also may be concerne d that the path for the federal funds rate 
currently expected by market partic ipants is too shallow.  In l ight of the high level of 
excess reserves held by the banking system, and amid some signs  that banks have been 
easing their credit standards, pa rticipants may have become con cerned about an 
unexpected sharp increase in le nding that could boost aggregate  demand and cause 
inflation to rise above the Com mittee’s 2 percent objective for  a prolonged period.  
Policymakers may be concerned th at a rapid, and unexpected, tightening of monetary 
policy in response to accelerati ng inflation could result in material losses at financial 
institutions and disorderly condi tions in financial markets.  A dditionally, some 
policymakers might see delaying th e initial increase in the tar get range as also increasing 
the risk of a steep rise in the federal funds rate at a later d ate.  Although these risks may 
not feature prominently in policym akers’ baseline forecasts, th ey might judge that the 
adverse consequences are suffi ciently severe to justify policy firming at this time. 
2 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in the dr aft statement for Alternative C as 
premature in present circumstan ces but might nonetheless discus s whether this language, especially 
paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, would be appropriate when the time arri ves to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate above its effective lower bound.

According to the Desk’s Survey of  Primary Dealers and the Desk’ s Survey of 
Market Participants, respondent s see little lik elihood that the Committee will decide to 
change the target range for the  federal funds rate at this meeting.  The implied probability 
of a policy tightening in July deri ved from prices of financial derivatives is similarly low.  
If the Committee issued a statement similar to Alternative C, m edium- and longer-term 
real interest rates would most likely rise and investors may al so revise up their 
expectations about the pace of policy firming.  Equity prices and inflation compensation 
would likely decline, and the dollar would appreciate. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers may see substantial risk that inflation will run p ersistently below 
the Committee’s stated goal, as  both core and headline inflation have continued to run 
well below 2 percent.  They might also view the recent decline in crude oil prices as a 
harbinger for headline inflati on well below 2 per cent later thi s year.  Though potentially 
encouraged by recent job gains, these policymakers might point to the decline in the labor 
force participation rate in June  as evidence that , in the current environment, measures of 
the unemployment rate mask the amount of slack in the labor mar ket.  They might also 
cite relatively subdued wage gain s as an indication that signif icant labor market slack 
remains.  With inflation expect ations seemingly well-anchored, policymakers may see 
little cost to the unemployment rate falling below its longer-r un normal level.  Moreover, 
they may be worried that infla tion expectations could fall in r esponse to an already 
prolonged period of low inflation o r that soft spending data in dicate the economic 
expansion is not currently robus t enough to support further imp rovement in the labor 
market.  These policymakers may want to offer more-stringent cr iteria for policy firming 
than those in Alternative B; accordingly, they may support Alte rnative A, which states 
that it will be appropriate to rai se the target range for the f ederal funds rate when the 
Committee “projects that inflation will reach 2 percent within one or two years” and 
emphasizes that the Committee “is prepared to use all of its to ols as necessary” to achieve 
this goal if inflation “does  not begin to rise soon.” 
For some policymakers, recent events in China and Greece may ha ve tilted to the 
downside the balance of risks t o the outlook for the labor market and inflation.  They 
might be concerned that a deteri oration of financial conditions  and consumer confidence 
in China will generate an appreciable slowdown in growth of eco nomic activity in that 
country which could spill over t o other emerging markets and ca use the dollar to 
appreciate further.  Additionally, if Greece exits the euro are a, these policymakers may

fear that spillovers  could cause a rece ssion in the region.  Th ey might see the alternative 
simulations “China-Driven EME  Slump with Stronger Dollar” and “ Greek Exit with 
Strong Spillovers” in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Te albook, Book A as 
encompassing some of the risks  that they have in mind.  If either scenario plays out, 
policymakers may judge that the Federal Reserve will need to pr ovide greater policy 
accommodation in order to offset the effects on the domestic ec onomy from weak global 
demand and downward pressure on inf lation from an appreciation of the dollar.  They 
may also view the recent decline in metals prices as a signal t hat global demand has 
already weakened.  Participants might therefore favor language in the second paragraph 
of Alternative A that indicates  that “in light of economic and financial developments 
abroad, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economi c activity and the labor 
market as tilted to the downside.”  They also may favor the new  language that appears at 
the end of paragraph 4 of Alternative A—language that says the Committee is prepared to 
provide additional accommodation if inflation does not begin to  rise soon.  
No respondent to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers or the De sk’s Survey of 
Market Participants noted an expectation that the Committee wou ld announce further 
policy accommodation in July or ther eafter.  If the Committee i ssued a statement along 
the lines of the draft associated with Alternative A, investors would push out their 
expectations about the most probable date of the first increase in the target range for the 
federal funds rate; they might a lso revise down their expectati ons of how quickly the 
Committee will raise the target r ange thereafter.  Longer-term real yields would likely 
decline, and equity prices and inflation compensation could ris e.  However, if investors 
saw a statement like Alternativ e A as reflecting a downbeat ass essment for global 
economic conditions, equity prices and inflation compensation m ight fall.

DIRECTIVE AND IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
The June directive appears afte r this introductory discussion.  That same directive 
would be issued in July if the Com mittee adopts A lternative A o r B, which maintain the 
current target range for the federal funds rate.  
The directive for Alternative C , which raises the target range,  is included in an 
implementation note that would be r eleased with the FOMC’s policy statement to 
communicate actions the Federal R eserve was taking to implement  the Committee’s 
decision.3  The draft implementation note s hown for Alternative C is inte nded as a model 
that could be used at the time of  the first increase in the tar get range, whether the increase 
occurs in July or later, and aft er subsequent FOMC meetings.  ( Struck-out text indicates 
language deleted from the curren t directive; bold, red, underlined text indicates language 
added to the current directive.)   
The current draft of the impleme ntation note reflects a few revisions relative to 
the text proposed in June.  The changes are: 
1) The first sentence in the current directive (the sentence that describes the FOMC’s 
dual mandate) was struck because this information is conveyed i n the 
Committee’s policy statement.  
2) For clarity, an effective date w as added to the directive; as d iscussed below, the 
staff recommends that changes in  the target range take effect t he day after a policy 
decision is announced so that s uch decisions may be supported b y corresponding 
changes to all of the overnight administered rates.   
3) Language was added to the directive to make clear that “overnig ht” RRPs can 
have a maturity of more than one day when necessary to span a weekend or 
holiday. 
4) The description in the directiv e of the practical limit on the Desk’s RRP 
operations was revised slightly to say that the Desk can conduct ON RRPs in amounts “ limited only by  the value  of Treasury securities held outright in the 
SOMA that are available for such operations .”  The Desk’s operational statement 
3 The implementation note was des cribed in a memo sent to the Committee on June 10, 2015, 
called “Proposal for Communicating Details Regarding the Implem entation of Monetary Policy at Liftoff 
and After” by Deborah Leonard and Gretchen Weinbach.

will indicate that the value of Treasury securities in the SOMA  available for RRP 
operations is about $2 trillion a nd explain how staff derived t hat operational limit.  
During the policy normalization pr ocess, the FOMC’s decisions t o change the 
target range will be implemented primarily by making correspond ing changes to the 
Federal Reserve’s overnight admin istered rates—the interest rat es paid on required and 
excess reserves, the ON RRP rate , and the primary credit rate.  In order to provide 
maximum clarity to the markets and the public and to increase the likelihood that the 
effective federal funds rate will  fall within the new target ra nge as soon as the new range 
becomes effective, the staff reco mmends that changes to the tar get range for the federal 
funds rate and changes to the administered rates all be effecti ve on the day after the 
Committee’s decision.4  With this timing, the Desk w ould be able to support the 
Committee’s decision to change the  target range for the federal  funds rate, beginning on 
the date that decision becomes effective, by conducting ON RRP operations at the new 
rate specified by the FOMC.5 
This approach is consistent w ith the staff’s recommendation that intermeeting 
changes in the administered rates—if any prove necessary to foster federal funds trading within the FOMC’s target ran ge—be announced at 4:30 p.m., when markets are closed, 
and take effect the next day.  
Note that the sentence in the c urrent directive that begins “Th e Committee seeks 
conditions in reserve markets… ” has been struck from the direc tive, as was the case in 
the illustrative example shown in the June memo.   
As indicated by what is now the f irst sentence of the draft dir ective shown in the 
implementation note, staff recomm ends the Desk be instructed to undertake open market 
4 While changes to the Reserve Ba nks’ primary credit rates would generally be effective on the 
day after a Committee decision to change the target range for the federal funds rate, the timing could be 
affected by when Reserve Bank bo ards of directors submit discou nt rate recommendations.  The staff 
proposes that, on the day of the FOMC’s policy action, the Boar d approve Reserve Bank boards’ 
recommendations for changes in the discount rate that accord wi th the FOMC’s decision to change the 
target range, effective on the f ollowing day.  Discount rate re commendations that are submitted during the 
24 hours following the release of the FOMC’s postmeeting statem ent could be approved to take effect on 
the day following the FOMC meeti ng.  As in the past, requests f or discount rate changes from one or more 
Reserve Bank boards of directors  might sometimes be received an d approved more than a day after the 
FOMC’s policy action. 
5 The Desk plans to conduct an ON RRP operation each day, typica lly at 12:45 p.m.  That is the 
latest time that is operationally feasible, given that transact ions will settle through the  tri-party repo system.

operations as necessary to keep t he federal funds rate in its target range, specifically 
including overnight and term reverse repurchase agreements acco rding to parameters 
approved by the Committee.  The baseline expecta tion is that re verse repos as specified 
in the directive will be the  only open market operations needed  to support interest on 
excess reserves to keep the feder al funds rate in the FOMC’s ta rget range.  Nonetheless, a 
directive that authori zes the Desk to conduc t other types of open market operations if 
necessary may communicate to the  public that the Committee has given the Desk latitude 
to respond quickly to unexpected c ircumstances in order to main tain the federal funds 
rate in the FOMC’s target range.6  Any use of such authority would be limited and aimed 
at alleviating transitory factor s; in the event of more persist ent issues, it would be 
appropriate for the FOMC to consid er whether it wants to revise  the directive.  The Desk 
would consult with the Chair and inform the FOMC of any plans t o conduct open market 
operations other than the reverse  repos specified in the direct ive. 
Finally, regarding balance sheet  policies, the draft directive associated with each 
of the alternative stat ements continues to instruct the Desk to  maintain the current policy 
of reinvesting principal paymen ts from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of r olling over maturing 
Treasury securities into new issues. 
6 For example, in the event that t he federal funds rate were tra ding above the target range for 
idiosyncratic technical reasons, a repo operation might signal to the market that the Federal Reserve stands 
ready to move the rate back into the target range.  Or in respo nse to a major payment system disruption, it 
might prove useful for the Desk to conduct repo operations to address potential liquidity shortages in 
money markets.  Although the latte r scenario may be covered by paragraph 5B of the Domestic 
Authorization, broad authority in the directive may provide add itional assurance to market participants.  
Additionally, it might be valuable for the Desk to have some op erational flexibility to adjust its mode of 
executing reverse repo operations, for example retaining the ab ility to conduct a fixed-quantity RRP 
operation, in response to un expected technical issues.

 The Board of Governors of the Fed eral Reserve System voted [ un animously ] to raise 
the interest rate pa id on required and excess reserve balances to [ 0.50 ] percent, 
effective July 30, 2015.  
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committ ee voted to authorize

instructed otherwise, to execute  transactions in the System Ope n Market Account in 
accordance with the following domestic policy directive: 
“Consisten t with its statutory m andate, the Federal Open Market  Committee seeks 
monetary and financial conditions  that will foster maximum employment and price

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has developed a projection of the Federal Reserve’s b alance sheet and 
income statement that is broadl y consistent with the monetary p olicy assumptions 
incorporated in the staff’s forecast presented in Tealbook, Boo k A.  As in the June 
Tealbook scenario, we assume that policy firming will occur at the September FOMC 
meeting and that reinvestments  of maturing Treasury securities and the reinvestment of 
principal received on agency securities will continue through t he first quarter of 2016.  
Reinvestments cease in the second quarter, and thereafter the S OMA portfolio shrinks 
through redemptions of maturing T reasury and agency debt securi ties as well as 
paydowns of principal from agency MBS.  Regarding the Federal R eserve’s use of its 
policy normalization tools, we a ssume that the level of overnig ht reverse repurchase 
agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end of 20 18 and then falls to zero 
by the end of 2019, and that term depo sits and term RRPs are no t used during the 
normalization period.1,2  The bullets below highlight som e key features of the projecti ons 
for the Federal Reserve’s bala nce sheet and income statement un der these assumptions. 
 Balance sheet. As shown in the exhibit “Total A ssets and Selected Balance Shee t 
Items” and in the table that follows, the size of the portfolio  is normalized in the 
second quarter of 2021, the same quart er as in the June Tealboo k.3  Once reserve 
balances reach their new steady- state level, total assets stand  at $2.3 trillion, with 
about $2.1 trillion in total SOMA  securities holdings.  Total assets and securities 
holdings increase thereafter, ke eping pace with growth in curre ncy in circulation 
and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
1 Use of RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in the co mposition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in RRPs or term deposits—but would not 
produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet. 
2 We also assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts remain 
around $166 billion throughout the projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s considered normalized when re serve balances reach an assumed 
$100 billion steady-state level.  A t this time, the size of the  securities portfolio is primarily determined by 
the level of currency in circulation plus Federal Reserve capit al, the balances held in the Treasury general 
account, and the projected steady- state level of reserve balanc es.

 Federal Reserve remittances. The next exhibit, “Income Projections,” shows the 
implications of the balance shee t projection and interest rate assumptions for 
Federal Reserve income.4  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to be about 
$90 billion this year, down a bit from their $100 billion peak in 2014, and then to 
decline further over the next f ew years.  Annual remittances re ach their trough of 
roughly $35 billion in 2019; no defe rred asset is recorded.5  The Federal 
Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are abo ut $1 trillion, 
approximately $270 billion above the staff estimate of the amou nt that would 
have been observed had there b een no asset purchase programs, a nd roughly $5 
billion less than in the June Tealbook projection.6 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio is influenced importan tly by the level of interest ra tes.  The staff 
estimates that the portfolio w as in an unrealized gain position  of about $110 
billion as of the end of June.7  Reflecting the assumed ris e in longer-term interest 
rates over the next several year s, the position is projected to  shift to an unrealized 
loss by the middle of 2016 and reco rd a peak unrealized loss of  about $200 billion 
in 2019, nearly unchanged from th e June Tealbook.  At the end of that year, 
roughly $95 billion of the unrealized  losses can be attributed to the portfolio of 
Treasury securities and $110 bill ion to the portfolio of agency  MBS.  The 
unrealized loss position the n narrows through 2025, as securiti es acquired under 
the large-scale asset purchas e programs mature or pay down and new securities 
are added to the portfolio at par. 
4 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains a t 25 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound.  In addition, we assume that, once firming of the 
policy rate begins, the spread be tween the interest rate paid o n reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 
25 basis points.  Moreover, we assume that the effective federa l funds rate will aver age about 15 basis 
points below the rate paid on reserve balances and about 10 bas is points above the ON RRP rate.   
5 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capit al paid-in, a deferred asset for interest on 
Federal Reserve notes would be recorded. 
6 The staff estimate of remittances had there been no asset purchase programs is a linear 
interpolation from 2006 to 2025 of actual 2006 income and proje cted 2025 income. 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalreserve.gov/m onetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .

 Interest rate sensitivity.  To illustrate the sensitivity of the projections to the path 
of interest rates, we compare the July Tealbook baseline projec tions to a scenario 
in which, after policy firming begins in the third quarter of 2 015, all interest rates 
gradually rise a total of 200 basi s points above the staff fore cast and remain at that 
level over the projection period.8,9  Relative to the baselin e projection, the size of 
the balance sheet is not materially affected, and SOMA net inco me follows the 
same general contour, but with a  significant difference in magn itude.  As shown 
in the dashed blue line in the e xhibit, “Income Projections,” c umulative annual 
interest expense is larger th an under the baseline by roughly $ 130 billion during 
the normalization period, year s 2016 through 2020.  As a result , net income is less 
than in the baseline and annual remittances to the Treasury rea ch a trough of near 
zero in 2018.  In the later years  of the projection period, net  income is projected to 
rise above that of the baseline scenario as Treasury securities  are purchased at 
higher yields.  Under the higher in terest rate path, cumulative  remittances from 
2009 to 2025 are approximatel y $900 billion, about $100 billion  less than in the 
July Tealbook baseline.  Finall y, under the higher rate path, the unrealized loss 
position peaks at approximately $530 billion in 2017. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” t he effect of the Federal Reserv e’s elevated 
stock of longer-term securities on the term premium embedded in  the 10-year 
Treasury yield in the third qua rter of 2015 is estimated to be negative 108 basis 
points, nearly unchanged from the June Tealbook.  Over the next  couple of years, 
the term premium effect dimini shes at a pace of about 5 basis points per quarter, 
reflecting the projected shri nking of the portfolio.  A key inp ut into our term 
premium effect model is the dura tion of the SOMA Treasury portf olio; refer to 
the “History and Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA Tr easury Holdings” 
box for more information on this measure. 
8 Interest rates include the federal funds rate; the 5, 10, and 30 year Treasury yi elds; the 30 year 
conventional fixed-rate residential mortgage rate, and the agen cy MBS current coupon. 
9 These interest rate shocks are phased in over eight quarters.  Rates are assumed to stay at this 
higher level throughout the projection period.  While we allow for agency MBS prepaym ents to change as a 
result of this shock, no other general feedback to the macroeco nomy is incorporated.  A more 
comprehensive assessment of the interest rate risk inherent in the Federal Reserve’s current portfolio that 
includes this feedback is presented in Cashin, Ferris, Kim, and  Klee (2015), “The Federal Reserve’s 
Balance Sheet and Income: Projections using the 2015 Dodd-Frank  Adverse Stress Test Scenario,” FEDS 
Note, forthcoming.

History and Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury Holdings 
This box reviews the history and projected future behavior of two important 
characteristics of the SOMA’s holdings of Treasury securities—the weighted average 
duration of the portfolio and the portfolio’s value in terms of 10year equivalents.1 Before 
the financial crisis, the weighted average duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio 
hovered around 2.7 years. As shown by the light blue line in the top panel, following the 
onset of the crisis in August 2007, the duration of Treasury holdings jumped as shorter
dated securities were sold or allowed to mature without replaceme nt. As a result of the 
maturity extension program and the flow based asset purchase program, which 
increased holdings of longer dated Treasury securities in the portfolio, duration 
continued to increase during late 2011 and 2012.2 Duration peaked in early 2013, and as of 
June 1, 2015, SOMA Treasury duration stood around 7 years. 
Going forward, under the current balance sheet assumptions, the weighted average 
duration of SOMA Treasury holdings is expected to continue to decline a bit over the next 
two years before rising, as the end to reinvestments results in shorter dated Treasury 
securities rolling off the portfolio.3,4 However, after the balance sheet normalizes in size 
in 2021, Treasury duration is projected to decline as the Desk resumes purchasing 
securities to expand the size of the portfolio.5 If purchases are spread across the 
maturity distribution following the Federal Reserve’s historical practice in purchasing 
Treasury securities of different maturities, shown by the light blue dashed line, duration 
declines slowly.6 However, if purchases are directed instead solely to Treasury bills 
initially (the “bill replenishment strategy”) to actively bring the portfolio’s Treasury 
holdings back to its historical proportion of onethird bills, as shown by the dark blue 
dashed line, weighted average duration drops noticeably over the course of one year 
from May 2021 to June 2022.7 
1 Duration is the weighted average of the times until bonds’ fixed cash flows are received. The 10
year equivalents of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is the dollar amount of 10year Treasury securities that 
the Federal Reserve would hold in order to produce the same duration as its actual holdings. 
2 The weighted average duration of the securities purchased under the first and second asset 
purchase programs was roughly in line with the duration of the SOMA portfolio at that time, and so 
SOMA duration did not materially increase as a result of those programs. 
3 As of June 2015, 50 percent of the Treasury securities held in the SOMA will mature in less than 5 
years, 24 percent will mature in 5 and 10 years, 5 percent will mature in 10 and 20 years, and 21 percent 
will mature in more than 20 years. 
4 If SOMA coupon securities mature and the Committee wishes to reinvest these proceeds at 
Treasury auctions, in general, the Desk rolls over the maturing securities held in the SOMA into newly 
issued securities in proportion to the issue amounts of the new securities, and the Federal Reserve 
receives the interest rate determined competitively in the public auction of the newly issued securities. 
5 These purchases would be in the secondary market. 
6 Specifically, precrisis, purchases in both the secondary and primary markets were aimed at 
maintaining a liquid portfolio, while avoiding significantly distorting prices or liquidity of specific 
Treasury securities. Consequently, SOMA holdings comprised an array of Treasury securities with 
varying remaining maturities. 
7 This bill replenishment strategy is used in the staff baseline presented in Tealbook, Book B.

  Either investment  strategy will result  in SOMA Treasury  holdings  having a much higher  
weighted ‐average duration  in 2025 than  prior to the  crisis.  This increase in duration  
relative to before  the crisis reflects, in  large part, the fact that the Treasury  has and is 
expected  to continue  to extend  the weighted average  maturity of its debt over time.   
This point can be seen by the light brown  line which illustrates  how the weighted ‐average 
duration of the SOMA  Treasury  portfolio would  have evolved in  a scenario  where the 
portfolio grew  primarily  with currency  growth, and the Federal Reserve  followed  its 
normal reinvestment and  secondary  market purchase policy.    
The effect of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet decisions  on long‐term rates has often 
been analyzed  in terms of  the so‐called “10‐year equivalent”  value of the portfolio.   
Similar to the  duration  of the portfolio,  as shown in  the bottom panel, SOMA Treasury 10‐
year equivalents  increased  substantially  after the onset of the financial crisis and 
subsequent  recession.   Going forward,  after reinvestment ceases, the  10‐year equivalent 
value of SOMA Treasury  holdings  is projected  to fall reflecting  the decrease  in the size of 
the SOMA Treasury  portfolio.8  When purchases  of Treasury  coupon securities  resume 
after the balance sheet normalizes in  size, the 10‐year equivalent  value of the Treasury  
portfolio is  projected  to increase.   Under the  historical  purchase strategy,  the inflection  
point in the 10‐year equivalents  occurs sooner and is larger than under the bill‐
replenishment  strategy, because the  securities  purchased  under this strategy will have 
longer duration  than those purchased  under bill‐replenishment strategy.    
 
 
                                                 
8 Ten‐year equivalents  declines between  2017 and 2021 while  duration increases  because the rise in 
duration is more than offset by the shrinking  of the SOMA Treasury portfolio.

 Monetary base.  As shown in the final table, “Projections for the Monetary Bas e,” 
once policy firming begins in t he third quarter of 2015, the mo netary base first 
grows less rapidly and then s hrinks through the second quarter of 2021, primarily 
because redemptions of securiti es generate corresponding reductions in reserve 
balances.  Starting around mid-2021, after reserve balances are  assumed to have 
stabilized at $100 billion, the monetary base begins to expand in line with the 
increase in currency in circulation.10 
10 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  In this projection, a steady $100 billion take- up in an ON RRP facility is assumed and, 
therefore, the level of the mone tary base is lower than it woul d otherwise be until 2019 (when the facility is 
assumed to be phased out).  The projected growth rate of the monetary base, however, is generally 
unaffected.  If the FOMC employs additional reserve-draining to ols during normalization or ON RRP take-
up is larger than assumed, the p rojected level of reserve balances and the monetary bas e could decline quite 
markedly.
