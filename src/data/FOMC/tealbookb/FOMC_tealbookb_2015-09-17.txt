The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity a nd inflation in the near term, a nd they incorporate the staff’s 
¼ percentage point reduction in its estimate of the longer-run real federal funds rate, 
which is discussed in Tealbook A.2  Medium-term prescriptions derived from dynamic 
simulations of the rules are discussed below.  All of the Taylo r-type rules prescribe an 
immediate increase in the federal  funds rate.  The Taylor (1993 ) and Taylor (1999) rules 
call for sizable increases in the  policy rate to values higher than 2 percent over the near 
term.  The inertial Taylor (1999)  rule prescribes raising the f ederal funds rate only to 
about ½ percent by the fourth quarter of 2015, because this rule places a considerable 
weight on keeping the federal funds  rate close to  its lagged value.  The first-difference 
rule, which responds to the projec ted inflation gap and to expe cted changes in the output 
gap, and which does not depend on a n estimate of the longer-run  real interest rate, calls 
for the federal funds rate to remain at its effective lower bou nd through the first quarter of 
2016.   
The near-term prescriptions of t he Taylor-type rules are substa ntially higher than 
those derived from the July T ealbook—despite the downward revis ion to the longer-run 
real federal funds rate—largely due to the reassessment of econ omic slack in the current 
outlook.  As explained in Tealbook A, and as shown in the lower left panel of the exhibit, the trajectory of the output gap has been shifted up by about 6 0 basis points on average 
over the projection period.  In cont rast to the Taylor-type rul es, the prescriptions from the 
first-difference rule are low er than in the July Tealbook, beca use this rule responds to the 
expected change in the output ga p over the next year, which has been revised down a 
touch in the current outlook; in addition, the first-difference rule responds to the 
somewhat lower projection of inf lation three quarters ahead.  
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules.    
2 To facilitate comparisons, new va lues of the intercepts of eac h rule, where app licable, have been

  The top panel of the first exhibit also reports the Tealbook-co nsistent estimate of 
the equilibrium real  federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model.  This 
measure is an estimate of the r eal federal funds rate that, if maintained, is expected to 
return output to potential in 12 quarters.  The current estimate of this concept of r*, at 
about ½ percent, is considerably hi gher than the estimate in Ju ly, reflecting the upward 
revision to the output gap over the projection horizon.  As noted earlier, the staff has 
revised down its estimate of the longer-run real federal funds rate, but the effect of the 
change on this medium-run concept of r* reported here is relatively small. The actual real 
federal funds rate, at −1.16 percent, is 1.63 percentage points below the current estimate 
of r*.   
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under each of the policy rules.  These simulat ions reflect the 
endogenous responses of inflation and the output gap when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the differe nt policy rules, subject to an effective lower bound of 
12½ basis points for the federal funds rate.3  The results for each rule presented in these 
and subsequent simulations depend importantly on the assumption s that policymakers 
will adhere to the rule in the future and that the private sect or fully understands the policy 
that will be pursued as well as  its implications for real activ ity and inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implicati ons of following the baseline 
monetary policy assumptions in the current staff forecast.4  As discussed in Tealbook A, 
the staff assumes that the first increase in the federal funds rate will occur after the 
September FOMC meeting.5  After departing from its effec tive lower bound, the federal 
funds rate is assumed to rise at  the pace prescribed by the ine rtial version of the 
Taylor (1999) rule.  The federal  funds rate increases about 25 basis points per quarter for 
the first three years after liftoff, reaching around 3 percent in the fall of 2018.  The pace 
of tightening subsequently slows , and the federal funds rate cl imbs to just under 4 percent 
in 2020—consistent with the high pro jected level of resource utilization around that 
                                                 
3 Because of these endogenous res ponses, prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ 
from those shown in the top p anel of the first exhibit.  
4 The dynamic simulations discusse d here and below incorporate t he assumptions about 
underlying economic conditions that are used in the staff’s bas eline forecast, includi ng the macroeconomic 
effects of the Committee’s asset holdings from the large-scale asset purchase programs, and the staff’s 
downward revision to the longer-run real federal funds rate.  
5 Policy firming begins in the third quarter under the Tealbook baseline policy.  H owever, because 
it occurs late in the quarter, th e average value for the federa l funds rate remains within the current target 
range this quarter.

  time—before eventually returning to its longer-run normal level  of 3¼ percent later in the 
next decade. 
All of the policy rules in these dynamic simulations call for policy rates above the 
current target range in the fourth quarter of 2015, the first quarter of the simulation 
period, though the increase pres cribed by the first-difference rule is small.  As a result of 
revisions to the staff forecast since July, and because the dyn amic simulations start one 
quarter later than the ones shown in the previous Tealbook, the  unemployment rate in all 
the simulations runs near or below the natural rate for the res t of the decade.  The 
Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) r ules produce paths for the real federal funds rate that 
lie significantly above the Teal book baseline over the next few  years, leading to higher 
unemployment rates (less unders hooting of the natu ral rate) than in the baseline.  Later in 
the simulation, the Taylor (1993) r ule, which places less weigh t on the output gap than 
the Taylor (1999) rule, calls f or slightly less overshooting of  the nominal policy rate 
above its longer-run value of 3¼ percent.  As a consequence, the Taylor (1993) rule generates a lower trajectory of  the unemployment rate than the Taylor (1999) rule.  
Because price- and wage-setters anticipate this slightly more a ccommodative policy 
trajectory, inflation is a touch higher under the Taylor (1993)  rule over the medium term 
relative to the Taylor (1999) r ule and the base line projection.  Under the in ertial version 
of the Taylor (1999) rule, the f ederal funds rate tracks the ba seline path, leading to the 
same macroeconomic outcomes as in the Tealbook baseline. 
Starting in 2016, the first-difference rule prescribes a pace o f increases in the 
federal funds rate that is sim ilar to the Tealbook baseline thr ough 2018.  At that point, 
under the first-difference rule , rate increases  level off.  This divergence results from the 
slower pace of economic growth e xpected to occur late in the de cade—after output has 
moved above potential output—because  the first-difference rule responds to the expected 
change in the output gap rather t han its level.  The lower path  of the federal funds rate in 
the first-difference rule in the medium run, in conjunction wit h expectations of higher 
price and wage inflation in the future, leads to higher levels of both resourc e utilization 
and inflation in the short run.  C ompared with the other policy  rules, the first-difference 
rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate over the fore cast period that are even 
farther below the staff’s estim ate of the natural rate.  Relative to the other simple policy 
rules, inflation runs a bit closer to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation 
objective over the next few year s before overshooting the targe t by a greater margin later 
in the decade.

  The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s baseline foreca st with those reported in 
July.  Policymakers are assumed to place equal weights on keeping headline PCE 
inflation close to the Committ ee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping t he unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployme nt, and on minimizing 
changes in the federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal cont rol that is employed here 
corresponds to a commitment po licy under which the plans that p olicymakers make today 
are assumed to constrain future policy choices.6 
Under the optimal control policy, t he path for real federal fun ds rate is 
substantially higher than the Tealbook baseline path.  The trajectory for the real 10-year Treasury yield is acco rdingly also higher .  The tighter policy under optimal control is 
associated with a path for the unemployment rate that is much c loser to the estimate of 
the natural rate than the T ealbook baseline projection.  Headli ne PCE is slightly lower 
than the baseline over the sim ulation period, consistent with l ower levels of resource 
utilization under opt imal control policy. 
The optimal control path for the  nominal federal funds rate is on average 75 basis 
points higher than in the July Tealbook, despite the downward r evision to the longer-run 
real federal funds rate, as the staff now forecasts a substanti ally higher level of resource 
utilization and a lower traject ory of the unemployment rate over the entire forecast 
horizon.  Accordingly, the traject ory for the real 10-year Trea sury yield implied by the 
optimal control policy i s higher than it was in the previous Te albook and inflation 
converges a bit more slowly to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. 
POLICY INERTIA AND MACROECONOMIC OUTCOMES  
The dynamic simulations of simple rules discussed above display  outcomes 
conditional on the staff’s baseli ne outlook, abstracting from the considerable uncertainty 
attending those projections.  Howev er, in the current circumstances in which the federal 
funds rate is at the effectiv e lower bound, policymakers may wish to consider entire 
probability distributions of outcomes when comparing prescriptions of different policy rules.  In the special exhibit “Policy Inertia and Macroeconomic Outcomes,” we focus in 
                                                 
6 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that wou ld be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

  particular on the choice of the de gree of interes t rate inertia  by examining the distribution 
of economic outcomes around the baseline forecast under the Tay lor (1999) rule and its 
inertial counterpart, using stochastic simulations from the sta ff’s EDO model .7  The 
starting point for these simu lations is in 2015:Q3—one quarter earlier than the dynamic 
simulations of the simple rul es shown above—when the quarterly average of the federal 
funds rate remains extremely clo se to its effective lower bound , to more clearly highlight 
the role of uncertainty whe n policy is constrained.  
The upper-left panel shows the m ean paths of the federal funds rate under these 
two rules as well as the 68 per cent uncertaint y bands around th ese paths.  Similar to the 
results shown earlier using the  FRB/US model, the mean path of the federal funds rate 
under the Taylor (1999) rule rises  sharply initially and lies above the mean path of the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule through 2020.  Importantly, the non -inertial version of the 
Taylor rule generates a much w ider distribution of policy rate paths (shown by the gray 
shaded area) than the inertial  version of the  rule (shown by the area between the dotted 
blue lines).  As a consequence, there is a greater chance of th e federal funds rate being at 
its effective lower bound at some time over the next couple of years under the non-
inertial Taylor rule.  For exa mple, as shown by the black and b lue bars in the upper right 
panel, the probability of the federal funds rate being at its e ffective lower bound in 
2016:Q4 under the Taylor (1999) rule is more than twice as high  than under its inertial 
counterpart. 
The middle-left and lower-left  panels display the mean and disp ersion of 
outcomes across stochastic simul ations for the unemployment rat e and four-quarter 
average of core PCE inflation, respectively.  The inertial Taylor (1999) rule generates, on 
average, lower unemployment outco mes and a trajectory for core PCE inflation that is 
somewhat closer to 2 percent th an the non-inertial rule.  Under  perfect foresight, the 
difference in macroeconomic outco mes between the two rules would be smaller, because, 
in the presence of uncertainty, the non-inertial rule is constr ained by the lower bound 
more often than the inertial rule; as a consequence, the non-in ertial rule is more likely to 
be associated with high unemp loyment and low inflation.8 
                                                 
7 The EDO model is a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium mode l maintained by Board staff.  It 
is frequently used to construct so me of the alternative scenari os reported in Tealbook A.  
8 For the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the mean unemployment  rate across stochastic 
simulations is substantially highe r than for the perfect-foresi ght FRB/US simulation over the period shown.

  The middle-right and lower-right panels show the distributions for the 
unemployment rate and core PCE inflation in 2016:Q4.  Because o f the effective lower 
bound constraint, the distributions  for the unemployment rate are somewhat skewed with 
a fatter upper tail of values for the unemployment rate above the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate of 5.1 percent.  Thi s upper tail of high unemploym ent is noticeably smaller 
under the inertial Taylor (1999) r ule, reflecting that this rul e effectively commits to 
raising the federal funds rate more gradually, and thus reduces  the incidence and 
economic severity of spells at the effective lower bound.  This feature of the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule also reduces  the likelihood of very low infl ation or deflationary 
outcomes, though the effect is small, because inflation is rela tively persistent in the EDO 
model, and the Phillips curve is assumed to be f airly flat. 
Overall, in these simulations, t he inclusion of interest-rate s moothing in a policy 
rule can lead to better macroec onomic outcomes in current circumstances when there is a 
significant probability of returning to the effective lower bou nd.  However, these 
simulations depend importantly on the assumptions that policyma kers will adhere to a 
given rule in the future, and tha t the private sector fully bel ieves that commitment as well 
as understands its implications f or real activity and inflation .  Consequently, achieving 
the better performance of the more inertial rule would require communicating this feature 
of policy.  Given that persistence in policy-setting has been a  hallmark of Federal 
Reserve behavior in the past, c ommunicating an approach to poli cy with this feature in a 
credible fashion to the public w ould likely be more straightfor ward than communicating a 
policy approach like that descri bed by the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule that would 
represent a significant change from the Federal Reserve’s past practice. 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under Alternative Policies” a nd “Outcomes 
under Alternative Polic ies, Quarterly,” ta bulate the simulation  results for key variables 
under dynamic simulations of the F RB/US model for each of the p olicy rules shown in 
the exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations.” 
                                                 
In particular, this mean is above  the estimate of the natural r ate of unemployment th rough 2018 because of 
the interaction of uncertainty with the effective lower bound d escribed above, the s lightly different 
dynamics of the EDO model, and the fact that the FRB/US simulat ion starts one quarter later.

POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  [math] denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead  [math] and [math] , the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  [math] , and the forecast  of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the 
output  gap [math] . The value  of policymakers'  longer-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  [math], is 
2 percent.
Taylor  (1993)  rule [math]
Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
Inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
First-difference  rule [math]
The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
version  of the Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
intercepts  of these  rules are chosen  so that they are consistent  with a 2 percent  longer-run 
inflation  objective  and a longer-run  real interest  rate, denoted  [math], of 1 1/4 percent,  a value  used in 
the FRB/US  model. The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the level of 
the output  gap or the longer-run  real interest  rate; see Orphanides  (2003).
Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules  that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule and the first-difference  rule—the lines 
labeled  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same  lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy  
rate, for each of these  rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal  
to the average  value  for the policy  rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent  quarter,  these  
rules use the lagged  values  from  their simulated,  unconstrained  prescriptions.

StrategiesESTIMATES  OF THE  EQUILIBRIUM  AND  ACTUAL  REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATES
An estimate  of the equilibrium  real federal  funds  rate appears  as a memo  item in the first 
exhibit,  “Policy  Rules  and the Staff  Projection. ” The concept  of the short-run  equilibrium  real 
rate underlying  the estimate  corresponds  to the level  of the real federal  funds  rate that is 
consistent  with output  reaching  potential  in 12 quarters  using  an output  projection  from  FRB/US,  
the staff's  large-scale  econometric  model  of the U.S. economy.  This estimate  depends  on a very 
broad  array  of economic  factors,  some  of which  take the form  of projected  values  of the model's  
exogenous  variables.  The memo  item in the exhibit  reports  the “Tealbook-consistent ” estimate  of 
[math], which  is generated  after  the paths  of exogenous  variables  in the FRB/US  model  are adjusted 
so that they match  those  in the extended  Tealbook  forecast.  Model  simulations  then determine  
the value  of the real federal  funds  rate that closes  the output  gap conditional  on the exogenous  
variables  in the extended  baseline  forecast.
The estimated  actual  real federal  funds  rate reported  in the exhibit  is constructed  as the 
difference  between  the federal  funds  rate and the trailing  four-quarter  change  in the core PCE 
price  index. The federal  funds  rate is specified  as the midpoint  of the target  range  for the federal  
funds  rate on the Tealbook  B publication  date.
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS
The exhibits  of “Monetary  Policy  Strategies ” that report  results  from  simulations  of 
alternative  policies  are derived  from  dynamic  simulations  of the FRB/US  model.  Each  simulated  
policy  rule is assumed  to be in force  over the whole  period  covered  by the simulation;  this period  
extends  several  decades  beyond  the time  horizon  shown  in the exhibits.  The simulations  are 
conducted  under  perfect  foresight  and are predicated  on the staff's  extended  Tealbook  projection,  
which  includes  the macroeconomic  effects  of the Committee's  large-scale  asset  purchase  
programs.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early  in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  in that 
quarter.  However,  when  the Tealbook  is published  late in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  
in the subsequent  quarter.
COMPUTATION  OF THE  OPTIMAL  CONTROL  POLICY  UNDER  COMMITMENT
The optimal  control  simulations  posit  that policymakers  minimize  a discounted  sum of 
weighted  squared  deviations  of four-quarter  headline  PCE inflation  [math]  from  the Committee's  
2 percent  objective,  of squared  deviations  of the unemployment  rate from  the staff's  estimate  of 
the natural  rate (this difference  is also known  as the unemployment  rate gap, [math] , and of 
squared  changes  in the federal  funds  rate. The resulting  loss function,  shown  below,  embeds  the 
assumptions  that policymakers  discount  the future  using  a quarterly  discount  factor  [math]  
and place equal  weights  on squared  deviations  of inflation,  the unemployment  gap, and federal  
funds  rate changes  (that is, = [math].
Page  14 of 58
Authorized for Public Release
Page  15 of 58[math]
The optimal  control  policy  is the path for the federal  funds  rate that minimizes  the above  
loss function  in the FRB/US  model,  subject  to the effective  lower  bound  constraint  on nominal  
interest  rates,  under  the assumption  of perfect  foresight,  and conditional  on the staff's  extended  
Tealbook  projection.  Policy  tools  other  than the federal  funds  rate are taken  as given  and 
subsumed  within  the Tealbook  baseline.  The path chosen  by policymakers  today  is assumed  to 
be credible,  meaning  that decision  makers  in the model  see this path as being  a binding  
commitment  on the future  Committees;  the optimal  control  policy  takes  as given  the lagged  value  
of the federal  funds  rate but is otherwise  unconstrained  by policy  decisions  made  prior  to the 
simulation  period.  The discounted  losses  are calculated  over  a period  that ends  sufficiently  far 
into the future  that extending  that period  farther  would  not affect  the policy  prescriptions  shown  
in the exhibits.

In March, the FOMC replaced its prior guidance that it could “b e patient in 
beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy” with the indication that it would 
be appropriate to rais e the target range f or the federal funds rate when the Committee 
“has seen further improvement” i n the labor market and “is reas onably confident” that 
inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  Th e change in FOMC 
communications at the time was  perceived by investors as more a ccommodative than 
anticipated and, along with data suggesting weaker-than-expected economic activity in 
the first quarter, caused market  participants to push back thei r expectation of the most 
likely meeting for liftoff from June to September.  While this was still the case at the time 
of the July meeting, developments over the intermeeting period have prompted market 
participants to reduce the proba bility they attach to liftoff in September. 
 Since the March FOMC meeting, real GDP has been expanding at a moderate 
pace, on average, and labor market conditions have improved bro adly, with nonfarm 
payroll gains averaging 200,000 pe r month and the unemployment rate declining from 
5.5 percent in February (the most r ecent reading available to t he Committee in March) to 
5.1 percent in August.  However, bot h core and headline inflation have continued to run 
below 2 percent, and measures of longer-term inflation compensa tion have declined.  
Moreover, over the past several  weeks, global financial markets  have been turbulent amid 
mounting concerns about a slowdow n in China and in foreign econ omies more generally, 
adding downward pressure to inflat ion in the near term, causing  a modest tightening of 
domestic financial conditions, a nd leading the staff to conclud e that the downside risks to 
its outlook for real GDP growth have increased. 
 Although the odds of liftoff at the upcoming meeting have decli ned over the 
intermeeting period, market participants continue to see a mate rial possibility of a 
tightening of policy at the September meeting, as market- and s urvey-based measures of 
liftoff probabilities suggest si milar perceived probabilities t hat liftoff will occur in 
September, later thi s year, and next year.
1  In addition, market- and survey-implied 
expectations for the federal  funds rate at the end of 2016 and 2017 have come down a 
                                                            
1 Roughly speaking, futures contracts on the federal funds rate and the Desk’s Survey of Primary 
Dealers and Survey of Market Participants are consistent with m ean probabilities of liftoff around 
30 percent for September, between 30 and 45 percent for the fou rth quarter, and between 25 and 40 percent 
for 2016.  The “Financial Developments” section of Tealbook A p rovides more details.

  couple tenths of a percentage point over the intermeeting perio d; the expected pace of 
tightening following liftoff is little changed.  These market e xpectations are consistent 
with normalization of the stance of monetary policy proceeding more gradually than 
market participants anticipated  at the onset of, or than was re alized during, the 1994 and 
2004 tightening cycles.  (See th e accompanying box “Financial M arket Responses to 
Episodes of Tightening.”) 
 
The three draft alternative statements presented below—labeled Alternative A, 
Alternative B, and Alternative C—offer somewhat different assessments of realized and expected progress toward the C ommittee’s dual mandate objective s and its two criteria 
for liftoff, along with a range  of corresponding policy choices .  Alternative B would 
convey that the Committee is pleased with the improvement in th e labor market since 
March.  However, the Committee would defer raising the target r ange until incoming 
information clarifies that recent global economic and financial  developments will have no 
more than temporary effects on domestic economic activity and i nflation, and the 
Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will move back  to 2 percent.  Under 
Alternative C, the Committee would announce that both of its cr iteria for liftoff have 
been met, indicate that the furth er improvement in the labor ma rket supports its 
expectation for a rise in inf lation over the medium run, and in crease the target range.  
Alternative C would also shift t he emphasis of policy communication from “how long to 
maintain” the target range to “the timing and si ze of future ad justments” in the target 
range.  Alternative A would signal that the Committee believes the conditions for policy 
firming are unlikely to be met in the near future, primarily be cause inflation continues to 
run appreciably below 2 percent, may well decline further, and now seems likely to 
remain below 2 percent longer than previously expected. 
 Alternative B indicates that re cent data are consistent with ec onomic activity 
“expanding at a moderate pace,” and, in addition to noting continued moderate growth in household spending, provides more upbeat assessments of business fixed investment and the housing sector than in July.  T he statement for Alternative  B characterizes recent job 
gains as “solid” and states that l abor market indicators “show”  (rather than “suggest,” as 
in July) a diminution in underut ilization of labor resources si nce early this year.  These 
descriptions would suggest that the Committee is likely to soon  judge that it has seen the 
“further improvement” in the lab or market it was seeking in Mar ch.  Against these more 
sanguine descriptions of economic activity and the labor market , Alternative B observes 
that inflation “has continued t o run below” 2 percent, in part because of recent and earlier 
declines in energy prices and i n non-energy import prices.  The  statement also recognizes

  Financial  Market Responses  to Episodes  of Tightening  
As the FOMC contemplates  the first policy rate increase in  almost a decade, we  review the  
1994 and 2004 tightening  episodes, as  well as the 2013 “taper  tantrum,”  to shed some light 
on potential  financial market responses  to liftoff. 
 On February  4, 1994, the FOMC increased  the target federal funds rate for the 
first time since 1989, by 25 basis points.  The 10‐year nominal  Treasury  yield rose 
14 basis points on the day of the announcement  and continued  to move higher 
in subsequent  months amid stronger ‐than‐expected  economic  data.  
Uncertainty  about the path of short‐term  interest rates  also rose notably 
(figure 1), likely pushing  up term premiums (figure 2).  
 On June 30, 2004,  the FOMC raised the target federal funds  rate for the first  
time since 2000,  again by 25 basis points.  The 10‐year Treasury  yield declined  
9 basis points on the day, as investors  reportedly  focused on the unexpected  
retention  of the “measured  pace” language,  and continued  to decline  over the 
next six months  along with term  premiums.   Uncertainty  about the policy rate, 
which had risen modestly  ahead of tightening,  subsequently  declined  a bit. 
 In late spring  of 2013, following  Federal Reserve  communications  interpreted  as 
suggesting  that the odds of a reduction in  the pace of asset purchases  in 
subsequent  months were higher than market participants  had been expecting, 
investors  suddenly  reassessed  the monetary  policy outlook (the “taper 
tantrum”).   The 10‐year Treasury  yield rose 85 basis points in the three months  
following  Chairman Bernanke’s Congressional  testimo ny on May 22, 2013, largely 
reflecting  higher term premiums.  
As shown in  table 3, financial market quotes suggest that investors  currently  place notably  
lower odds on  a rate hike  at the September  2015 FOMC meeting than they did a day  before 
the 1994 and 2004 tightening  moves.  Nevertheless,  market quotes and surveys still indicate a 
probability  of liftoff in September  of roughly 25 to 30 percent,  with survey respondents’  
individual  views quite dispersed.   Therefore, whether  or not the FOMC  decides to raise the 
federal funds  target range  at the upcoming  meeting,  there is likely to be a revision in  
investors’  policy expectations  that may result in a noticeable  market reaction.   Beyond the 
extent to which  any initial monetary  policy tightening  decision was anticipated  by market 
participants,  other factors, including  the evolution  of the economy,  may importantly  shape 
subsequent  market developments.

  First, as shown in  table 3, just ahead of the initial  tightening  investors  anticipated  a much 
shallower  pace of subsequent  rate increases  in 1994 than they did in 2004.  However,  
economic  data came in stronger  than expected  during the 1994 tightening  cycle, leading 
investors  to repeatedly  mark up their policy expectations  and contributing  to the sharp rise in 
longer‐term interest rates and volatility.   By contrast,  soft data releases in the months 
following  the 2004 rate hike  likely accounted  for some  of the decline in longer‐term interest 
rates during the so‐called “conundrum”  period.  While current  financial market quotes point 
to a very gradual expected  increase in  the policy  rate target  after liftoff, the actual  path of 
interest rates will depend  importantly  on the evolution of  the U.S. economic  outlook.   For 
example,  investors  have recently expressed some  concerns  about spillovers  from a weaker 
global economic  outlook,  and additional  easing by central banks in Europe and Asia could 
potentially  trigger capital  flows into  the United States, placing  upward pressure  on the dollar 
and downward  pressure  on domestic longer ‐term yields.  Conversely, a faster‐ than‐expected  
pickup in inflation might lead  investors  to anticipate  a more rapid removal of  policy 
accommodation,  pushing up longer‐term interest rates. 
Second, longer‐term Treasury  term premiums are  currently  near historically  low levels, raising  
the concern that, after years with  the federal funds rate at its  effective  lower bound, the  first 
rate hike may trigger an abrupt  rise in term premiums  toward more typical levels,  as 
witnessed  during the taper tantrum.  To  quantify this risk, we ran quantile regressions  of the 
change in the 10‐year term  premium  on its own lagged  level and  a time‐varying trend term.  
The results suggest that a below‐ trend term premium  is expected  to rise at an above‐average  
rate over  subsequent  months, but does  not appear to raise the probability  of an outsized  
jump in its level relative  to this expected  increase.  
Finally, as witnessed  during the taper tantrum, technical  factors and market dynamics  could 
play an important role  in amplifying  movements in  interest rates.   Currently,  investors’  
positions  in derivatives  on short‐term  interest rates indicate a notable divergence  among 
different types  of institutional  investors.   As shown in  figure 4, asset managers’  combined  
positions  are currently  net short—suggesting  that they are positioned  for an interest  rate 
hike.  Conversely, leveraged funds  are currently  net long—so that  they would benefit from  a 
decline in short‐term rates.  If investors  were to unwind  positions  abruptly  in response  to a 
monetary  policy surprise, this  could amplify interest rate movements.   A similar amplification  
effect could result from possible rapid outflows  from open‐ ended fixed‐income mutual funds, 
which have witnessed  a significant  increase in assets under management  in recent years.

  that measures of inflation compensation “moved lower” while rei terating that survey-
based measures of longer-term inf lation expectations have remai ned stable.  
Alternative B further acknowledges that recent foreign developm ents “may restrain 
economic activity somewhat” and that these developments are “li kely to put further 
downward pressure on inflation” i n the near term.  Nonetheless,  the Committee’s 
characterization of expected ec onomic conditions over the mediu m run, along with their 
associated risks, is unchanged r elative to Jul y, signaling that the Committee expects the 
effects of recent foreign developments to be temporary and that  the economy is still 
anticipated to evolve in such a way that the Committee might de cide to raise  the target 
range at any subsequent meeting i f it sees satisfactory progres s. 
 
In Alternative C, the Committ ee would announce that its criteria for policy 
firming have been met and that it is increasing the target rang e for the federal funds rate 
by 25 basis points.  The Committee would indicate that economic  activity has been 
“expanding at a moderate pace, on ave rage, this year,” a formul ation that recognizes both 
the momentum in recent domestic data and upwardly revised estim ates of GDP growth 
during the first half of the year .  The Committee would also st ate that labor market 
indicators show “further improve ment” since earl y this year and  that it expects that these 
indicators will be “approaching” levels consistent with the dual mandate.  Alternative C 
would acknowledge that inflati on “has continued” to run below 2 percent, that it will 
likely remain low in the near term, and that market-based measu res of inflation 
compensation “moved lower.”  However, with the labor market con tinuing to improve 
and longer-term inflation expecta tions remaining stable, the Committee would assert that 
it is “reasonably confident” that inflation will rise back to 2  percent over the medium 
term.  The statement would further  observe that, despite the in crease in the target range, 
the stance of policy remains “highly accommodative.” 
 Alternative A provides the same characterization of recent data  on economic 
activity, unemployment, and payroll employment as Alternative B , but it signals that the 
Committee is still a long way fro m being reasonably confident that inflation will move 
back to 2 percent over the medium run.  In particular, Alternat ive A notes that “gains in 
labor compensation have remained subdued” despite the reduction  in underutilization of 
labor resources; that core inflation has been running below 2 p ercent; that transitory 
factors should keep inflation “very low” in the near term; and that measures of inflation 
compensation are “near multiyear lows.”  In response to the lac k of progress on the 
inflation front and the risk that inflation might linger below the Committee’s objective, 
Alternative A states that “if incoming information does not soon indicate that inflation is

  beginning to move back toward 2 percent, the Committee is prepa red to use all tools 
necessary to return inflation t o 2 percent withi n one to two ye ars.”  Alternative A would 
also indicate that the recent de velopments abroad have “tilted somewhat to the downside” 
the risks to the Committee’s out look for economic activity and the labor market. 
 
Under Alternative A and Alternative B, the Committee would reta in the “balanced 
approach” language that it has provided for quite some time to characterize how it plans 
to conduct policy once tightening be gins.  Under Alternative C,  the Committee would 
state that, in determining future adjustments to the target range, it will assess “realized 
and expected economic conditions” relative to its mandated obje ctives, and that the path 
of the federal funds rate will “depend on the incoming data.”  This draft statement also offers the option of highlighting that the Committee “will take  a balanced approach” to 
pursuing its objectives.  Regardi ng the Committee’s balance she et policies, Alternative C 
would indicate that the Federal Reserve will continue to roll o ver maturing Treasury 
securities and to reinvest princi pal payments from its agency d ebt and mortgage-backed 
security holdings either “until  normalization of the level of t he federal funds rate is well 
under way” or “at least during the  early stages of normalizatio n of the level of the federal 
funds rate.”  All three alternatives retain language indicating that, even once employment and inflation are close to manda te-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some 
time, warrant keeping the federal funds rate below levels the C ommittee views as normal 
in the longer run. 
The next pages contain the July postmeeting statement, the three alternative draft 
statements, and summaries of the arguments for each alternative  statement.  These

  JULY 2015  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in June indicates 
that economic activity has bee n expanding moderately in recent months.  Growth in 
household spending has been moderate  and the housing sector has  shown additional 
improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports  stayed soft.  The 
labor market continued to impr ove, with solid job gains and dec lining unemployment.  
On balance, a range of labor mar ket indicators suggests that un derutilization of labor 
resources has diminished since early this year.  Inflation cont inued to run below the 
Committee’s longer-run objective , partly reflec ting earlier declines in energy prices 
and decreasing prices of non-ener gy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation 
compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term i nflation 
expectations have remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move t oward levels the Committee judges consistent with its 
dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
activity and the labor market as nearly balance d.  Inflation is  anticipated to remain 
near its recent low level in the  near term, but the Committee e xpects inflation to rise 
gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor ma rket improves 
further and the transitory eff ects of earlier declines in energ y and import prices 
dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation develo pments closely. 
3. To support continued progress towa rd maximum employment and pri ce stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its  view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this 
target range, the Committee wi ll assess progress—both realized and expected—
toward its objectives of maximum  employment and 2 percent infla tion.  This 
assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of 
labor market conditions, indica tors of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, 
and readings on financial and inter national developments.  The Committee anticipates 
that it will be appropriate to rai se the target range for the f ederal funds rate when it 
has seen some further improveme nt in the labor market and is re asonably confident 
that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over t he medium term. 
4. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of l onger-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial  conditions.  
5. When the Committee decides t o begin to remove policy accommodat ion, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent w ith its longer-run goals of maxim um employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near  mandate-consistent levels, ec onomic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant keep ing the target federal funds ra te below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

inflation will move back to its  2 percent objective over the me dium term.  If 
incoming information does not so on indicate that inflation is b eginning to move 
back toward 2 percent, the Committee is prepared to use all too ls necessary to

  ALTERNATIVE C FOR SEPTEMBER 2015    
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in June July 
indicates that economic activity has been expanding at a moderately moderate pace, 
on average, in recent months this year .  Growth in Household spending and 
business fixed investment  has have  been increasing  moderate ly, and the housing 
sector has shown additional improvement improved further ; however, business 
fixed investment and net exports stayed have been  soft.  The labor market continued 
to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment.  On balance,  A range 
of recent  labor market indicators, including solid job gains and lower 
unemployment,  suggests shows further improvement in the labor market and 
confirms  that underutilization of labor r esources has diminished since early this year.  
Inflation has continued to run below the Comm ittee’s longer-run objective, p artly 
reflecting earlier declines i n energy prices and decreasing in prices of non-energy 
imports.  Although market-based measures of infla tion compensation remain low 
moved lower, survey-based measures of longer-t erm inflation expectations h ave 
remained stable. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate 
adjustments in the stan ce of monetary  policy accommodation, economic activity 
will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move 
toward approaching  levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  
The Committee is monitoring developments ab road but  continues to see the risks 
to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to re main near its recent low level in  the near term, reflecting 
declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imp orts,  but the transito ry 
effects on inflation of these declines will dissipate.  With the labor market 
continuing to improve, and with l onger-term inflation expectations remaining 
stable, the Committee expects  is reasonably confident that  inflation to will rise 
gradually toward  to 2 percent over the medium term as the labor m arket improves 
further and the transitory eff ects of earlier declines in energ y and import prices 
dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation develo pments closely. 
3. To support continued progress towa rd maximum employment and pri ce stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its  view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In light of the considerable further 
improvement in labor market conditions this year, and the Commi ttee’s 
expectation that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent 
objective, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds 
rate to ¼ to ½ percent.  Even with this adjustment, the stance of policy remains 
highly accommodative.  
4. In determining how long to maintain this the timing and size of future adjustments 
to the  target range, the Committee wi ll assess progress—both realized  and 
expected—toward economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation [ , and will take a balanced approach to 
pursuing those objectives ] .  This assessment will take into account a wide range of

  pressures and inflation expect ations, and readings on financial  and international 
developments.  The Committee anticipates that it will be approp riate to raise the 
target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen furthe r improvement in the 
labor market and is reasonably c onfident that inflation will mo ve back to its 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  T he Committee currently antici pates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near  mandate-consistent levels, ec onomic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant keep ing the target federal funds ra te below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run ; however, the actual path of the 
target for the federal funds rate will depend on the incoming d ata.

from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at

the federal funds rate is w ell under way | at least during the early stages of 
normaliz ation of the level  of the federal funds rate ] .  This policy, by keeping the 
Committee’s holdings of longer-ter m securities at sizable level s, should help maintain 
accommodative financial conditions.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
The Committee might see information received during the interme eting period as 
consistent with a continuation of  moderate growth in real GDP, supported by gains in 
household spending, business investment, and the housing sector , but with ongoing drag 
from the external sector.  In the  labor market, payroll employm ent registered further solid 
gains and the unemployment rate  moved into the central tendency  of FOMC participants’ 
assessment of its longer-run normal level as reported in the Ju ne Summary of Economic 
Projections.  Nonetheless, the Committee may see room for furth er improvement in the 
labor market along margins such a s labor force participation or the number of persons 
employed part time for economic reasons, and may judge that suc h further improvement 
will help speed the r eturn of inflation t o the 2 percent object ive.  Policymakers may also 
judge that headline inflation is likely to remain well below 2 percent for a longer period 
than they had been expecting becau se global financial turbulence triggered by worries 
about Chinese economic activity l ed to a modest tightening of d omestic financial 
conditions and have put downward pr essure on U.S. inflation in the near term through 
their influence on commodity pr ices and the exchange rate.  Alt hough policymakers may 
expect the effects of foreign developments on the U.S. economy to be limited, they might 
still want to wait to see whether incoming data appear consiste nt with their projections 
that the economic expansion will support further improvement in  the labor market and 
that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.  For these reasons, 
participants may deem it appropriate to issue a statement like Alternative B, which 
acknowledges both the positive GDP and labor market data as wel l as the somewhat 
negative foreign developments a nd further near-term drag on inf lation, while reaffirming 
the Committee’s medium-run outlook and characterization of asso ciated risks.  
Policymakers may judge that Altern ative B is consistent with a meeting-by-meeting 
approach and would preserve pol icy options going forward. 
With the unemployment rate hav ing fallen to 5.1 percent, some p olicymakers may 
judge that the economy is alrea dy at maximum employment.  And with steady job gains 
and real GDP growing at a moderate pace, these policymakers may  think it likely that a 
solid economic expansion is unde r way, which should lead inflation to move back to 
2 percent over the medium term .  But with both headline and cor e inflation still running 
well below the Committee’s object ive, and in light of the recen t global financial market 
turbulence, the associated downgr ade of foreign GDP growth prospects, and the risks 
these developments pose to domes tic economic activity, policyma kers may prefer to 
monitor economic data a little l onger before taking the first s tep in raising rates.  
Alternatives

  Moreover, signs of excessive ris k-taking are not widespread, an d indicators of leverage 
and of reliance on short-term financing instruments have, to da te, remained at moderate 
levels.  Policymakers might there fore judge that a statement li ke Alternative B, which 
preserves the Committee’s ability to tighten policy at upcoming meetings, would not 
elevate the risks to financial stability appreciably. 
Other participants may be concerned that inflation will not ris e back to 2 percent 
over the medium term, perhaps because they judge that there is still appreciable slack in 
labor markets and anticipate onl y a slow reduction in that slac k.  Alternatively, they may 
point out that substantial impr ovement in labor markets over th e past few years has not 
prevented inflation compensation from falling, and argue that t he seemingly low 
sensitivity of price and wage growth to slack might require a p eriod of unemployment 
well below its longer-run normal rate to ensure a return of inf lation to the Committee’s 
longer-run goal.  And with U.S. financial conditions somewhat tighter and foreign 
demand for U.S. exports likely t o be somewhat weaker than previ ously expected, some 
participants may judge that the Committee will eventually need to provide further policy 
accommodation to achieve its mandate.  These participants may n onetheless judge that, 
with GDP expanding moderately an d the labor market steadily imp roving, it would be 
premature to announce additional stimulus.  Moreover, they may take some reassurance 
from the observation that survey measures of longer-term inflat ion expectations appear 
well anchored.  These policymaker s may thus choose to forego additional 
accommodation for now, but be alert to the possibility that the economy might require 
further support at a later date. 
It is difficult to ascertain what market reaction a statement l ike Alternative B 
would elicit.  Market participan ts currently perceive a roughly  30 percent probability that 
the Committee will raise the targ et range for the federal funds  rate in September.  If a 
statement like Alternative B, i n combination with the September  Summary of Economic 
Projections (SEP) and other polic y communications, leads market  participants to increase 
the probability of a rate hike a t the next few meetings but oth erwise leaves the expected 
path of the federal funds r ate in 2016 and beyond about unchang ed, then asset price 
effects could be small.  But if the statement pushes back expec tations about 
commencement of policy firming app reciably, and especially if i t changes expectations of 
the future course of monetary po licy, then the effects could be notable, with equity prices 
likely rising, medium- and longer- term real interest rates decl ining, and the dollar 
depreciating.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may view continued solid job gains and the broad-based 
improvement in GDP growth last quarter despite earlier apprecia tion of the dollar as 
confirmation that a solid ec onomic expansion is under way.  And  with the unemployment 
rate having decline d to 5.1 percent, they ma y conclude that slack in the labor market has 
essentially been absorbed and tha t tighter resour ce utilization  will soon begin to put some 
upward pressure on inflation.  Policymakers may be reasonably c ertain that, with stable 
longer-run inflation expectations , inflation wil l move back to the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective over the medium run as the drag from pass-through of broad-based declines in 
global commodity prices and appr eciation of the dollar on domes tic consumer prices 
dissipates.  That is, these policymakers might view the two cri teria for policy firming 
introduced in the Committee’s Marc h statement as having been me t.  In addition, these 
policymakers may note that, for the past several meetings, most of the simple policy rules 
and the optimal control simulations in the “Monetary Policy Str ategies” section of 
Tealbook B have called for policy tightening to begin.  Therefore, they may support 
Alternative C, which announces a  25 basis point increase in the  target range for the 
federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent. 
Given the lags in the transmi ssion of monetary policy, some policymakers may be 
concerned that delaying the i nitial firming of policy any longe r could unduly raise the 
risks of overshooting the Committ ee’s maximum employment and 2 percent inflation 
objectives.  They may expect that,  with the economy at or near full employment, wage 
pressures will build, contributing to a fairly prompt increase in inflation t o 2 percent or 
higher.  Because trend productivity growth appears to have step ped down from its pre-
crisis value, some policymakers may argue that price and wage p ressures could arise even 
if economic activity were to cont inue to expand at what is a la ckluster pace by historical 
standards.  Some policymakers ma y be particularly concerned tha t, if the unemployment 
rate is allowed to undershoot its longer-run normal level appre ciably, inflation could rise 
persistently above 2 percent and s eemingly well-anchored longer -run inflation 
expectations could drift up.  Moreover, some policymakers might judge that delaying tightening longer will make it ne cessary to raise the federal f unds rate rapidly in the 
future to prevent too-high inflation, and that a steeper path f or the policy rate would 
increase the risks of a period of  very slow growth and rising u nemployment.  
Policymakers might also worry that further delaying the firming  of policy could

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

  exacerbate risks to financial stability.  In particular, they m ay see the path for the federal 
funds rate currently expected by m arket particip ants as too sha llow, a situation that would 
encourage leveraged financing and provide incentives for managers to focus on financial 
engineering at the cost of reduced attention to potential inves tments and operational 
improvements.  Although these ris ks may not feature prominently  in policymakers’ 
baseline forecasts, they might judge that the adverse consequen ces would be sufficiently 
severe to justify policy firming at this time. 
According to the Desk’s Survey of  Primary Dealers and the Desk’ s Survey of 
Market Participants, the average  probability of t ightening at t his meeting is about 
30 percent, leaving the bulk of the probability distribution on  meetings later this year and 
in 2016.  A decision to increase the target range at this meeting would thus be somewhat 
surprising.  However, the ultimate  reaction in financial markets may be influenced 
importantly by Federal Reserve  communication about the path of subsequent tightening.  
If market participants conclude  that the Committee is intent on pursuing a less 
accommodative stance of policy going forward than had been expe cted, then the market 
reaction could be notable; medium - and longer-term real interes t rates would most likely 
rise, equity prices and inflati on compensation would likely decline, and the dollar would 
appreciate further.  However, the market reaction is more diffi cult to gauge if aspects of 
the Committee’s communication wer e interpreted as suggestive of  a more gradual pace of 
tightening after liftoff than mar ket participants had expected— for example, if SEP 
projections for GDP growth moved lower.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some policymakers may see substa ntial risk that inflation will not rise over the 
medium term to the Committee’ s longer-run goal.  Both core and headline inflation have 
trended below 2 percent over the past few years, and continued declines in global 
commodity prices, along with dow nward pressure on import prices  due to the 
appreciation of the dollar, sugge st that headline inflation will linger at very low levels 
well into 2016.  Though potentially e ncouraged by steady job ga ins, these policymakers 
may point to the absence of broad- based wage pressures and to a  step down in the labor 
force participation rate in the  second quarter as evidence that , in the current environment, 
measures of the unemployment rate  understate the amount of slack in the labor market.  
Lackluster average GDP growth during this economic recovery and  an already prolonged 
period of low inflation might indicate that the economic expans ion is not sufficiently 
robust to support further improve ment in the labor market and raise inflation to 2 percent.

  Some policymakers may also be wor ried that a number of survey-b ased measures of 
longer-run inflation expectati ons have been clustering on the l ow end of their historical 
ranges, and that measures of inflation compensation are near mu ltiyear lows. 
Moreover, for some policymaker s, mounting concerns about a slow down in the 
global economy might have tilted to the downside their percepti on of the balance of risks 
to the outlook for the labor m arket and inflation.  These polic ymakers may worry that 
deteriorating financial conditi ons and consumer confidence in C hina could cause a 
marked slowdown in real output gr owth throughout Asia, which would then lower the 
demand for U.S. exports and cause the dollar to appreciate furt her.  In fact, these 
policymakers may point to disappo inting incoming data on foreig n activity and declines 
in commodity prices as a sign tha t global demand is already weakening.  Additionally, 
these policymakers may see Greec e’s fiscal and political crisis  as largely unresolved, and 
fear a resurgence of financi al stresses in Europe and beyond.  As such, they might see the 
alternative scenarios “China-Dri ven EME Slowdown,” “China-Drive n EME Crisis,” or 
“Increased Financial Turbulence” in the “Risks and Uncertainty”  section of Tealbook A 
as encompassing some of the ris ks that they have in mind.  If e ither scenario plays out, 
policymakers may judge that the Federal Reserve will need to pr ovide greater policy 
accommodation in order to offset the adverse effects on the dom estic economy.  
Participants might therefore favor including language as in the  second paragraph of 
Alternative A, which indicates t hat, “in light of economic and financial developments 
abroad, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economi c activity and the labor 
market as tilted somewhat to the downside.” 
For all the above reasons, some policymakers may see little cos t to the 
unemployment rate falling below its longer-run normal level for a while—indeed, they 
may see such an outcome as desirable to achieve the dual mandate—and thus may want to offer more stringent crite ria for policy firming than those in past FOMC statements and 
in Alternative B.  Accordingly, they may support a statement li ke Alternative A, which 
emphasizes that the Committee “is prepared to use all tools nec essary” to achieve its 
inflation objective within one t o two years if inflation does n ot begin to rise soon. 
No respondent to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers or the De sk’s Survey of 
Market Participants noted an ant icipation that the Committee wo uld indicate the 
possibility of greater accommodation.  If the Committee issues a statement along the lines 
of Alternative A, investors w ould most likely push out their ex pectations about the most 
probable date of the first increas e in the target range for the federal funds rate; they might

  also revise down their expecta tions of how quickly the Committe e will raise the target 
range thereafter.  Longer-term yi elds would likely decline, and equity prices and inflation 
compensation could rise.  However, i f investors see a statement  like Alternative A as 
reflecting a downbeat assessmen t for global economic conditions , equity prices and 
inflation compensation might inc rease less than otherwise or ev en fall.

Statement Regarding Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements 
During its meeting on September 16-17, 2015, the Federal Open M arket Committee 
(FOMC) authorized and directed t he Open Market Trading Desk (th e Desk) at the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, effective September 18, 2015,  to undertake open 
market operations as necessary t o maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to 
½ percent, including overnight re verse repurchase operations (O N RRPs) at an offering 
rate of 0.25 percent and in a mounts limited only by the value o f Treasury securities held

  outright in the System Open Marke t Account (SOMA) that are available for such 
operations. 
To determine the value of Treas ury securities available for suc h operations, several 
factors need to be taken into account, as not all Treasury secu rities held outright in the 
SOMA will be available for use in ON RRP operations.  First, some of the Treasury 
securities held outright in the S OMA are needed to conduct reverse repurchase 
agreements with foreign official and international accounts.3  Second, some Treasury 
securities are needed to support the securities lending operations conducted by the Desk.  
Additionally, buffers are needed t o provide for possible change s in demand for these 
activities and for possible changes in the market value of the SOMA’s holdings of 
Treasury securities. After estimating the effects of these factors, the Desk anticip ates that aroun d $2 trillion of 
Treasury securities will be avail able for ON RRP operations to fulfill the FOMC’s 
domestic policy directive.
4  In the highly unlikely event that the value of bids received in 
an ON RRP operation exceeds the amount of available collateral,  the Desk will allocate 
awards using a single-price au ction based on the “stop-out” rate at which the overall size 
limit is reached, with all bids be low this rate awarded in full  at the stop-out rate and all 
bids at this rate awarded on a pr o rata basis at the stop-out r ate. 
The operations will be open to a ll eligible RRP counterparties,  will settle same-day, and 
will have an overnight tenor unle ss a longer term is warranted to accommodate weekend, 
holiday, and similar trading c onventions.  Each day, individual counterparties are 
permitted to submit one proposition in a size not to exceed $30  billion and at a rate not to 
exceed the specified offering rate.  The operations will take p lace from 12:45 p.m. to  
1:15 p.m. (Eastern Time).  Any changes to these terms will be announced with at least 
one business day’s prior notice on the New York Fed’s website. 
The results of these operations will be posted on the New York Fed’s website.  The 
outstanding amount of RRPs are re ported on the Federal Reserve’s H.4.1 statistical 
release as a factor absorbing reserves in Table 1 and as a liab ility item in Tables 5 and 6.  
                                                            
3 The outstanding amount of RRPs with foreign official and intern ational accounts is 
reported as a factor absorbing reserves in Table 1 in the Federal Reserve’s H.4.1 statistical release 
and as a liability item in Tables 5 and 6 of that release.  
4 This amount will be reduced by an y term RRP operations outstand ing at the time of 
each ON RRP operation.

  Projections 
BALANCE SHEET , INCOME , AND MONETARY BASE 
The staff has developed a projection of the Federal Reserve’s b alance sheet and 
income statement that is broadl y consistent with the monetary p olicy assumptions 
incorporated in Alternative B .  We assume that policy firming w ill occur in the fourth 
quarter of 2015 and that reinvestments of maturing Treasury sec urities and the 
reinvestment of principal received on agency debt and agency MB S securities will 
continue through the second quarter of 2016.1  Once reinvestments cease, the SOMA 
portfolio shrinks through redemp tions of maturing Treasury and agency debt securities as 
well as paydowns of principal from agency MBS.  Regarding the F ederal Reserve’s use 
of its policy normalization tools, w e assume that the level of overnight reverse repurchase 
agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end of 20 18 and then falls to zero 
by the end of 2019, and that term depo sits and term RRPs are no t used during the 
normalization period.2,3  The bullets below highlight som e key features of the projecti ons 
for the Federal Reserve’s bala nce sheet and income statement un der these assumptions. 
 Balance sheet.   As shown in the exhibit “Total A ssets and Selected Balance Shee t 
Items” and in the table that follows, the size of the portfolio  is normalized in the 
second quarter of 2021, nearly unchanged from the July Tealbook .4  Once reserve 
balances reach their new steady- state level, total assets stand  at $2.3 trillion, with 
about $2.2 trillion in total SOMA  securities holdings.  Total a ssets and SOMA 
                                                 
1 In the exhibits “Total Assets  and Selected Balance Sheet Items ” and “Income Projections,” the 
July Tealbook projection of the b alance sheet and income (dashe d blue lines) is roughly consistent with a 
projection under Alternative C of the current Tealbook, under w hich policy firming commences after the 
September FOMC meeting and rei nvestments cease at the end of th e first quarter of 2016.  The September 
Tealbook A staff for ecast also assumes the initial increase of the federal funds rate from the effective lower 
bound occurs after this meeting.  
2 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce an overall change in the size of the balance sheet.  
3 We also assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts remain 
around (their July 31, 2015 level of) $167 billion throughout t he projection period. 
4 The size of the balance sheet i s considered normalized when re serve balances reach an assumed 
$100 billion steady-state level.  B eginning at that time, the s ize of the securities portfolio is primarily 
determined by the level of currency in circulation plus Federal  Reserve capital and surplus, the balances 
held in the Treasury general acco unt, and the projected steady- state level of reserve balances.

and Federal Reserve Ban k capital and surplus. 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   The exhibit, “Income P rojections,” shows the 
implications of the balance shee t projection and interest rate assumptions for 
Federal Reserve income .5  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to be about 
$90 billion this year, down a bit from their $100 billion peak in 2014, and then to 
decline further over the next f ew years.  Annual remittances re ach their trough of 
roughly $35 billion in 2019; no defe rred asset is recorded.6  The Federal 
Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are abo ut $1 trillion, 
approximately $270 billion above the staff estimate of the amou nt that would 
have been observed had there b een no asset purchase programs; t he projection for 
cumulative remittances is nearly unchanged from the July Tealbo ok projection.7   
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio is influenced importan tly by the level of interest ra tes.  The staff 
estimates that the portfolio w as in an unrealized gain position  of about $150 
billion as of the end of July.8  Reflecting the assumed ris e in longer-term interest 
rates over the next several year s, the position is projected to  shift to an unrealized 
loss by late 2016 and record a peak  unrealized loss of about $2 00 billion in 2019, 
little changed from the July T ealbook.  At the end of that year , roughly $90 billion 
of the unrealized losses can be a ttributed to the portfolio of Treasury securities 
and $110 billion to the portfoli o of agency MBS.  The unrealize d loss position 
then narrows through 2025, as the  value of securities acquired under the large-
scale asset purchase programs returns to par as they approach m aturity and then 
mature and new securities are added to the portfolio at par.  
                                                 
5 We assume the interest rate paid on reserve balances remains a t 25 basis points as long as the 
federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound.  In ad dition, we assume that, once firming of the 
policy rate begins, the spread be tween the interest rate paid o n reserve balances and the ON RRP rate is 
25 basis points.  Moreover, we assume that the effective federa l funds rate will aver age about 15 basis 
points below the interest rate paid on reserve balances and abo ut 10 basis points above the ON RRP rate.   
6 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs, pay dividends, and equate surplus to capit al paid-in, a deferred asset for interest on 
Federal Reserve notes would be recorded.   
7 The staff estimate of remittances had there been no asset purchase programs is a linear 
interpolation from 2006 to 2025 of actual 2006 income and proje cted 2025 income. 
8 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the qu arter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at

   Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” t he effect of the Federal Reserv e’s elevated 
stock of longer-term securities on the term premium embedded in  the 10-year 
Treasury yield in the third qua rter of 2015 is estimated to be negative 113 basis 
points, slightly more negative than in the July Tealbook.  Over  the next couple of 
years, the estimated term premium effect diminishes at a pace o f about 5 basis 
points per quarter, reflecting the projected shrinking of the p ortfolio.   
 Projection uncertainty and income risks.  To help quantify the uncertainty 
surrounding the path of the balanc e sheet and the interest rate risk embedded in 
the SOMA portfolio, the accompanying Tealbook B box, “Confidenc e Interval 
Projections of the Balance Sheet ,” reports confidence intervals  for the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and income based on paths of macroecono mic variables 
generated by stochastic simulati ons of the staff’s FRB/US model.  
 Monetary base.  As shown in the final table, “Projections for the Monetary Bas e,” 
once policy firming begins in t he fourth quarter of 2015, the m onetary base still 
grows during that quarter, but the reafter shrinks through the s econd quarter of 
2021, primarily because redemptions of securities generate corr esponding 
reductions in reserve balances .  Starting around mid-2021, afte r reserve balances 
are assumed to have stabilized at $100 billion, the monetary ba se begins to 
expand in line with the increas e in currency in circulation.9  
                                                 
9 The projection for the monetary base depends critically on the FOMC’s choice of tools during 
normalization.  In this projection, a steady $100 billion take- up in an ON RRP facility is assumed, and 
therefore, the level of the mone tary base is lower than it woul d be absent this take-up until 2019 (when the 
facility is assumed to be phased  out).  The projected growth ra te of the monetary base, however, is 
generally unaffected by this assumption.  If the FOMC employs a dditional reserve-draining tools during 
normalization or ON RRP take-up is larger than assumed, the pro jected level of reserv e balances and the 
monetary base could decline quite markedly.

  Confidence  Interval Projections  of the Balance Sheet 
The elevated  size of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio and  the duration  mismatch 
between its  assets and liabilities  have long prompted  discussions  regarding  possible 
financial losses when interest rates  rise.  To help quantify the Fed’s interest rate risk,  
this box analyzes  a range of  potential  future macroeconomic  outcomes  and their 
implications  for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet an d income.  We use the paths of 
macroeconomic  variables  generated  by stochastic  simulations  of the FRB/US model 
around the July Tealbook  baseline and a staff MBS prepayment  model to project  
confidence  intervals  for the evolution  of SOMA holdings,  reserve balances, and  
income.1  Key inputs are the paths for the  federal funds  rate and 10‐year Treasury  
yield, shown in  the top two panels of the exhibit titled  “Interest  Rates and Selected  
Assets and Liabilities  of the Balance Sheet.”2   
The size and composition  of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as  well as the 
associated  income can shift  with macroeconomic  outcomes.   In particular,  the balance 
sheet projections  assume that currency  expands at a rate equal to  that of nominal 
GDP growth.  Different  nominal GDP paths therefore  induce alternative  balance  sheet 
paths, as currency  largely determines  the longer‐run balance sheet  size.  In addition,  
because agency  MBS have an embedded prepayment  option, the stock of MBS held in 
the SOMA depends  importantly  on interest rates  and economic  conditions.   In turn, 
changes in agency MBS holdings  can bring  about different paths  for SOMA Treasury  
holdings once the size of the balance sheet  is normalized.  Notably, in  the middle left 
panel of the first exhibit, the simulated  paths of SOMA holdings  mostly lie below the 
baseline path before the normalization  of the size of the balance sheet.   Most of this 
skew reflects that interest  rates above th e baseline  level are  not projected  to greatly  
affect the path  of prepayments  of agency MBS, while rates below the baseline level 
will likely  hasten prepayments  and thus reduce the size of agency MBS holdings.   As 
shown in  the bottom right, SOMA agency MBS holdings  are projected  to range  from 
$450 billion  to $787 billion in 2025.   
                                                 
1 We assume that  the Federal Reserve does not respond with unconventional  policy tools to the 
future economic  conditions;  no further asset purchases  will be conducted  in response  to adverse 
shocks.  We also  assume that liftoff occurs in September  2015 and reinvestment  ends six months 
after liftoff.  A paper by Cashin, Ferris, Kim, and Klee  (2015, forthcoming),  “The Federal  Reserve’s  
Balance Sheet and Income:  Projections  using the 2015 Dodd‐Frank Adverse Stress Test  Scenario,”  
also  provides an assessment  of the interest  rate risk inherent in the Federal  Reserve’s  current 
portfolio using the adverse scenario provided  in the 2015 Dodd‐Frank Act Stress Tests. 
2 These  interest rate paths are the same as those used in constructing  the panels shown in July 
Tealbook  A on page 70.  The solid line is the staff’s baseline projection.   The dark and lighter grey 
areas  represent  70 and 90 percentiles,  respectively.

  Interest rate risk can be reflected  in two  measures  reported  to the  public:  
remittances  to the Treasury  and the unrealized  gain or loss on the Fed’s securities  
holdings.   Remittances  largely reflect the net interest income of the Federal Reserve.  
As shown in  the top two panels  of the exhibit labeled “Income  Projections,”  interest 
income varies substantially  less than  interest expense  under a range of 
macroeconomic  scenarios  before the normalization  of the size of the balance sheet,  
suggesting  that Federal Reserve  remittances  are sensitive  to shifts in short‐term  
interest rates.  After the size of the balance sheet is  normalized,  interest income  varies 
relatively  more, largely reflecting  the purchases  of new securities  with yields that  
reflect market interest rates at the time  of purchase.   Both of these patterns  are 
reflected  in the paths for remittances,  as as shown in  the middle right panel.  Still, 
remittances  tend to remain  positive in almost all scenarios,  and therefore no deferred  
asset is recorded  in the 70 percentile confidence interval.  However, as  exhibited  in 
the bottom left panel, there are  some situations  associated  with relatively  high 
interest rates in the next several years that would result in a deferred asset;  a 
deferred asset is realized in about 10 percent  of the simulations.    
As presented  in the bottom right panel, the portfolio is  projected  to shift to an 
unrealized  loss position by the middle of 2016 and record a peak unrealized  loss of 
about $200 billion in  2019.  However,  as shown by  the lower edge  of the 90 percent  
confidence  interval, the unrealized  loss in some particularly  adverse scenarios  could 
reach $500 billion  or more.  Although  the baseline path implies that the unrealized  loss 
position then narrows through 2025, in  adverse scenarios, the  unrealized  loss position  
could still be larger than $400 billion  in 2025.  That said, the  unrealized  position of the 
portfolio has  no implications  for the conduct of  mone tary policy, unrealized  losses on 
securities  held to maturity  ultimately  drop to zero, and the Federal  Reserve does not 
realize losses  on its portfolio unless a security  is sold.3    
 
                                                 
3 The Committee  does not anticipate  selling agency mortgage ‐backed securities  as part of the 
normalization  process.   Instead, the FOMC intends  to reduce the Federal  Reserve’s  securities  
holdings in a gradual and predictable  manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest  repayments  of 
principal on securities  held in the SOMA.  Even so, the quarter‐ end market value of the SOMA 
portfolio is published  in the Federal  Reserve Banks Combined  Quarterly  Financial Reports, available 
at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetaryp olicy/bst_fedfinanci als.htm#quarterly  and could garner 
some public attention.   Weekly remittances  are reported  in the H.4.1 statistical  release.

 MONEY  
With its brisk advance in Jul y and August, M2 is on track to on ce again expand at 
a rapid pace in the third quarter.  However, we project M2 will  grow slowly in the fourth 
quarter of 2015 and then contract  through the second quarter of  2016 as the rise in the 
opportunity cost of holding money associated with the assumed i ncrease in the target 
range for the federal funds rat e restrains money demand.  Over the remainder of the 
projection period, projected furth er increases in opportunity c ost are expected to continue 
to hold M2 growth below that of nom inal GDP, although the restraint is projected to 
diminish over 2017 and 2018.
