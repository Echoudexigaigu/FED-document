Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity a nd inflation in the near term, s hown in the middle panels.  
All of the Taylor-type rules pres cribe an immediate increase in  the federal funds rate.  
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for sizable adju stments in the policy rate 
to values near 2½ percent over th e near term.  By contrast, the  inertial Taylor (1999) rule 
prescribes a level of the federal funds rate of only ½ percent in the first quarter of 2016 
because this rule places a considerable weight on keeping the federal funds rate close to 
its previous value.  The first-di fference rule, which also plac es considerable weight on the 
lagged federal funds rate, calls  for the policy rate to edge ab ove the current target range 
next quarter.  The prescriptions of  the Taylor type rules are generally close to those 
reported in the October Tealbook w hile those of the first-diffe rence rule are somewhat 
less accommodative, reflecting a  faster closing of the output g ap in the Tealbook 
projection. 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports the Tealbook-cons istent estimate of a 
notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate,  r*, generated using the FRB/US model.  
This measure is an estimate of t he real federal funds rate that , if maintained over a 12-
quarter period, makes the output ga p equal to zero in the final  quarter of that period.  The 
current estimate of r*, at 1.24 percent, is 50 basis points higher than the correspon ding 
estimate in the October Tealbook.  The increase reflects the fa ct that the staff projects 
higher resource utilization tha n in the previous Tealbook, largely due to an upward 
revision in federal government spe nding, as discussed in Tealbook A.  The panel also 
reports the average of the real federal funds rate in the Tealbook baseline projection for 
the same 12-quarter period used to compute r*. 2  This average is 0.36 percent, 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules. 
2 While r* and the average projected real f ederal funds rate are calculat ed over the same 
12-quarter period, they need not be associated with the same ma croeconomic outcomes even when their 
values are identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant 
over the entire 12-quarter perio d whereas, in the Tealbook base line, the real federal funds rate can vary 
over time.  Distinct paths of real  short-term rates can, in tur n, generate different pa ths for inflation and 
economic activity, even if they have the same 12-quarter averag e.

1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook outlook" report rule prescriptions based
 on the previous Tealbook’s staff outlook, but jumping off from the average value for the policy rate thus far in the current quarter. 2. The "Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  " is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period in the FRB/US model, sets 
 the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The "current real federal funds rate" is the difference between the federal funds rate and  the trailing four-quarter change in core PCE. The "average projected real federal funds rate" is the 12-quarter average of the current real federal funds 
 rate and its projected values under the Tealbook baseline over the next 11 quarters. r* 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 PCE Prices Excluding Food and Energy

0.88 percentage point below the estimate of r*.  The panel further reports a measure of 
the current real federal funds rate constructed as the differen ce between the mid-point of 
the prevailing target range for the federal funds rate and the trailing four-quarter change 
in the core PCE price index.  T his measure, at –1.16 percent, i s almost unchanged from 
the October Tealbook. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under the Tayl or (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999 ) rule, and a first-
difference rule.3  These simulations reflect t he endogenous responses of inflati on and the 
output gap when the federal funds rate follows the paths implie d by the different policy 
rules, subject to an effective lower bound of 12½ basis points for the federal funds rate.4 
The results for each rule presented in these and subsequent simulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to  the rule in the future and 
that market participants as well as price and wage setters full y understand the policy rule 
that will be pursued and its implications for real activity and  inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implicati ons of following the baseline 
monetary policy assumptions in the current staff forecast.5  As Tealbook A discusses, the 
staff assumes that the first inc rease in the federal funds rate will occur at the December 
FOMC meeting.  After departing f rom its effective lower bound, the federal funds rate is 
assumed to follow the prescriptio ns of the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The 
federal funds rate increases a bout 30 basis points per quarter for the first three years after 
liftoff, reaching about 3½ percent by the end of 2018.  The pac e of tightening 
subsequently slows, and the fed eral funds rate peaks at around 4¼ percent in 2020— 
consistent with the high projec ted level of resource utilizatio n around that time—before 
eventually returning to its longer-run normal level of 3¼ perce nt later in the decade. 
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for a sharp tigh tening of policy 
starting next quarter and produce pa ths for the real federal fu nds rate that lie significantly 
3 Simulations pertaining to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule have  been dropped fro m the exhibit 
because policy prescriptions and macroeconomic outcomes are, at  present, nearly indistinguishable from 
those under the staff’s baseline.  For reference, the tables “O utcomes under Alternative Policies” and 
“Outcomes under Alternative Polic ies, Quarterly” continue to report results for the inertial Taylor (1999). 
4 Because of these endogenous res ponses, prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ 
from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.  
5 The dynamic simulations discusse d here and below incorporate t he assumptions about 
underlying economic conditions that are used in the staff’s bas eline forecast, includi ng the macroeconomic 
effects of the Committee’s asset holdings from the large-scale asset purchase programs.

above the Tealbook baseline path over the next few years.  As a result, these rules lead to 
less pronounced undershooting of the  natural rate of unemployme nt than the baseline 
policy through 2018.  The Taylor (19 99) rule prescribes somewhat higher policy rates 
than the Taylor (1993) rule over the period shown because it pl aces more weight on the 
output gap.  As a consequence, the Taylor (1999) rule also generates a higher trajectory 
of the unemployment rate and a low er trajectory of inflation th an the Taylor (1993) rule. 
In contrast to the Taylor-type r ules, the first-difference rule  prescribes a pace of 
increases in the federal funds r ate that is similar to the Teal book baseline through 2018.  
At that point, the federal funds rate levels off under the firs t-difference rule whereas it 
keeps rising for a time under the Tealbook baseline.  This dive rgence occurs because the 
first-difference rule, which r esponds to the expected change in  the output gap rather than 
to its level, reacts to the slowe r pace of economic growth proj ected late in the decade.  
The lower path of the federal funds rate in the medium run unde r the first-difference rule, 
in conjunction with expectations of  higher price and wage inflation in the future, leads to 
lower long-term real rates and t hus to higher levels of resource utilization a nd inflation in 
the short run.  The first-diffe rence rule generates outcomes fo r the unemployment rate 
over the forecast period that are markedly below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
and the unemployment rate paths  generated under the other polic y rules.  Relative to the 
other simple policy rules, infla tion runs a bit closer to the C ommittee’s 2 percent longer-
run inflation objective over the n ext few years before overshoo ting the target by a greater 
margin and for a longer time later on. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s outlook with th ose reported in October.  
Policymakers are assumed to plac e equal weights on keeping head line PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent goal, on keeping the unemplo yment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal control that is emp loyed here corresponds to a 
commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to 
constrain future policy choices.6 
6 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that would be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

In the Tealbook baseline projecti on, unemployment falls well below the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate ove r the next several years.  Under the preferences embedded 
in optimal control, policymakers judge this undershooting of th e natural rate to be costly, 
leading them to tighten policy more than in the Tealbook baseli ne.  Accordingly, the path 
for the real federal funds rate is almost 1 percentage point higher, on average, than the 
Tealbook baseline path over the period shown.  The trajectory f or the real 10-year 
Treasury yield is also higher.  T he tighter polic y under optimal control results in a path of 
the unemployment rate that runs substantially closer to the sta ff’s estimate of the natural 
rate than the Tealbook baseline projection.  Headline PCE infla tion is also slightly lower 
than in the baseline over the simulation period, consistent wit h lower levels of resource 
utilization.7 
OPTIMAL CONTROL IN THE PRESENCE OF TERM-PREMIUM SHOCKS 
Longer-term yields, which are at the center of the monetary policy transmission 
mechanism, depend not only on curre nt and expected future short -term rates but also on 
term premiums.  These premiums can vary for many reasons that are often not well 
understood.  The special exhibit , “Optimal Control in the Prese nce of Term-Premium 
Shocks,” examines the implications for policy of two scenarios in which term premiums 
deviate from their baseline path s around the time of the first increase in the federal funds 
rate.  The first scenario explores  the risk that financial mark ets could overreact, resulting 
in a greater tightening of financi al conditions than intended—a  “tightening tantrum.”  
The other scenario considers the risk that term premiums could decline for a time relative 
to their expected levels after the onset of tightening, as was the case during the 
“conundrum” episode of 2004-2005.8 
In the “tightening tantrum” scen ario, the term premiums on the FRB/US model’s 
5-year, 10-year, and 30-year Treas ury rates are assumed to jump  100 basis points in the 
first quarter of 2016 and then return to their baseline values over the course of about year, 
as shown by the blue dashed line in the middle-left panel of th e exhibit.  This calibration 
7 In the simulations shown in this section of the June and July Tealbooks, the optimal control path 
for the federal funds rate was very similar to the Tealbook bas eline path.  Since then, the optimal control 
paths have been higher than the corresponding Tealbook path, with the average difference between the two 
paths rising with each Tealbook.  
8 The box “Financial Market Responses to Episodes of Tightening”  in the September Tealbook B 
provides a discussion of term premiums during the 2004–2005 “co nundrum” and 2013 “taper tantrum” 
episodes.

of the shock is largely illustra tive; however, a shock of this magnitude and duration is 
near the upper edge of the range of  the estimated cumulative in crease in 10-year Treasury 
term premiums during the “taper ta ntrum” episode over the late spring and summer of 
2013.9 
As shown in the bottom-left panel,  the temporary increase in te rm premiums in 
the tightening-tantrum scenario r esults in a sharp spike in the real 10-year Treasury yield 
in early 2016.  Optimal control  does not offset much of the effects of the spike in term 
premiums on longer-term real rat es because the contractionary shock helps raise 
unemployment closer to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate  in the near term.10  As in 
the standard optimal control, thi s scenario calls for tightenin g policy gradually starting 
next quarter.  The federal f unds rate is, on average, about 25 basis points lower from 
2016 to 2020 than in the standard op timal control.  This lower path for the federal funds 
rate results in real 10-year Treasury yields that are slightly below those of the standard 
optimal control in mid-2016 through 2019. 
The initial spike in longer-term real interest rates implies th at the unemployment 
rate is 0.1 percentage point higher and consequently closer to the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate than in the standa rd optimal control simulations, on average, through the 
beginning of 2018.  Inflation is litt le changed from its path i n the standard optimal control 
simulation because of the low sen sitivity of inflation to slack  in the model. 
In the conundrum scenario, term premiums fall below their basel ine path for four 
quarters and revert back to baselin e over the subsequent two ye ars.11  The fall in term 
premiums, which is larger and mor e persistent than initially ex pected by policymakers, 
leads to a 10-year nominal Treasury rate that rises more slowly than in the standard 
optimal control simulation, despit e a steeper trajectory of the  federal funds rate.  Because 
policymakers do not foresee the full sequence of shocks resulti ng in persistently low 
longer-term rates, they tight en policy less than would be appro priate if they had fully 
9 The simulation starts in the fi rst quarter of 2016, at which t ime policymakers and the public 
observe the jump in term premiums and understand that these pre miums will subsequen tly revert back to 
baseline. 
10 Departure from the effective lo wer bound in the presence of a 100-basis-point spike in term 
premiums is robust to the choice of the interest rate smoothing  parameter in the loss function.  Even with a 
smoothing parameter near zero, optimal control departs from the effective lower bound immediately.   
11 In the conundrum scenario, a sequence of four unexpected shocks lowers the 5-year, 10-year, 
and 30-year term premiums by around 1 percentage point below th e baseline path by the end of 2016.  
Term premiums then gradually return to their baseline values.

anticipated the fall in term  premiums.  The trough in the unemployment rate is 
¼ percentage point lower than that under the standard optimal control.  Thereafter, 
policymakers set out a higher pat h for the federal funds rate in order to make up for their 
previous errors, pushing up real 10 -year Treasury yields and in ducing an unemployment 
rate above the standard optimal  control path beginning in late 2020. 
An important caveat associated w ith this analysis is that the t erm premium 
movements in these simulations  are exogenous events, occurring in isolation, and 
unrelated to other factors suc h as changes in expected domestic and foreign economic 
growth that might drive such flu ctuations.  If, for example, lo nger-term yields were to 
remain persistently low because of economic weakness abroad tha t leads to increased 
demand for long-term Treasuries , an appreciati on of the dollar,  lower net exports and 
economic activity, then a complete  analysis would require the i nclusion of more shocks 
to represent those factors.

POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  Rt denotes  the effective  nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, 
while  the right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE 
inflation  for the current  quarter  and three  quarters  ahead  [math] , the output  gap estimate  
for the current  period  [math] , and the forecast  of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the 
output  gap [math] . The value  of policymakers'  longer-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  [math] is 
2 percent.
Taylor  (1993)  rule [math]
Taylor  (1999)  rule [math]
Inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule[math]
First-difference  rule [math]
The first two of the selected  rules  were  studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
version  of the Taylor  (1999)  rule has been  featured  prominently  in analysis  by Board  staff. 1 The 
intercepts  of these  rules  are chosen  so that they are consistent  with a 2 percent  longer-run  
inflation  objective  and a longer-run  real interest  rate, denoted  [math] , of  1 1/4 percent,  a value  used in 
the FRB/US  model.  The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the level of 
the output  gap or the longer-run  real interest  rate; see Orphanides  (2003).
Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules  that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule and the first-difference  rule—the lines 
labeled  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early  in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy  
rate, for each of these rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal  
to the average  value  for the policy  rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent  quarter,  these  
rules use the lagged  values  from  their simulated,  unconstrained  prescriptions.

REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES 
The bottom panel of the exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff Pr ojection,” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds ra te, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-qu arter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quart er of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric mod el of the U.S. economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected val ues of the model’s exogenous vari ables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted s o that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine t he value of the real federal funds 
rate that closes the output ga p conditional on the exogenous va riables in the extended baseline 
forecast. 
The “current real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is constructed as the difference 
between the midpoint of the prevailing target range for the federal funds rate and the trailing four-
quarter change in the core PCE price index. 
The “average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is constructed as the 
12-quarter average of the current real federal funds rate descr ibed above and its projections over 
the next 11 quarters under the Tealbook baseline.  This calcula tion is comparable to the one used 
to generate r*.  However, while r* and the average projected real federal funds rate are calculat ed 
over the same 12-quarter period, they need not be associated wi th the same macroeconomic 
outcomes even when their values are identical.  The reason is t hat, in the r*  simulations, the real 
federal funds rate is held constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close the output gap at the 
end of this timeframe whereas, in the Tealbook baseline, the re al federal funds rate can vary over 
time.  Distinct paths of real short-term rates can, in turn, generate different paths for inflation and 
economic activity. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derive d from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation; this period 
extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are 
conducted under the assumption that market participants as well  as price and wage setters have 
perfect foresight, and are predicated on the staff’s extended T ealbook projection, which includes 
the macroeconomic effects of the  Committee’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter.  However, when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent 
quarter.

COMPUTATION  OF THE  OPTIMAL  CONTROL  POLICY  UNDER  COMMITMENT
The optimal  control  simulations  posit  that policymakers  minimize  a discounted  sum of 
weighted  squared  deviations  of four-quarter  headline  PCE inflation  [math]  from  the Committee's  
2 percent  objective,  of squared  deviations  of the unemployment  rate from  the staff's  estimate  of 
the natural  rate (this difference  is also known  as the unemployment  rate gap, [math] ), and of 
squared  changes  in the federal  funds  rate. The resulting  loss function,  shown  below,  embeds  the 
assumptions  that policymakers  discount  the future  using  a quarterly  discount  factor  [math]  
and place equal  weights  on squared  deviations  of inflation,  the unemployment  gap, and federal  
funds  rate changes  (that is, [math] ).
[math]
The optimal  control  policy  is the path for the federal  funds  rate that minimizes  the above  
loss function  in the FRB/US  model,  subject  to the effective  lower  bound  constraint  on nominal  
interest  rates,  under  the assumption  of perfect  foresight,  and conditional  on the staff's  extended  
Tealbook  projection.  Policy  tools other  than the federal  funds  rate are taken  as given  and 
subsumed  within  the Tealbook  baseline.  The path chosen  by policymakers  today  is assumed  to 
be credible,  meaning  that decision  makers  in the model  see this path as being  a binding  
commitment  on the future  Committees;  the optimal  control  policy  takes as given  the lagged  value  
of the federal  funds  rate but is otherwise  unconstrained  by policy  decisions  made  prior  to the 
simulation  period. The discounted  losses  are calculated  over a period  that ends sufficiently  far 
into the future  that extending  that period  farther  would  not affect  the policy  prescriptions  shown  
in the exhibits.

This month’s meeting presents the Committee with three key poli cy decisions: 
first, whether to raise the targe t range for the federal funds rate;1 second, what guidance 
to give the public regarding the m ost likely future path for th e federal funds rate; and 
third, what to say about conditions  that would result in a different path for the federal 
funds rate.  
With regard to the first decision, the Committee set out, in Ma rch, two criteria for 
increasing the target range, name ly “further improvement” in la bor market conditions 
(later amended to “some further i mprovement”) and “reasonable confidence” that 
inflation would return, over the medium term, to the Committee’ s 2 percent longer-run 
goal.  Nonfarm payroll gains  have averaged about 200,000 per mo nth over the nine 
months since February—the late st month for which data were avai lable when the 
Committee set out the criteria—a nd the two labor market reports  received since the 
October meeting show that the lu ll in employment gains in late summer has given way to 
renewed strength.  The unemployment rate declined ½ percentage point since February, 
to 5.0 percent, and long-term unemp loyment has fallen about ½ p ercentage point.2  More 
recently, while net exports have continued to be a drag on GDP growth, manufacturing 
sector output has firmed and rea l GDP has been expanding at a m oderate pace with 
notable improvement in domestic f inal sales, suggesting labor m arket conditions will 
likely continue to strengthen.  O n the inflation front, core an d headline inflation, 
measured on a 12-month basis, have remained at subdued levels, and the recent oil price 
declines will likely add, for a t ime, to the downward pressure that is temporarily holding 
down headline inflation.  Meanwhile, market-based measures of longer-term inflation 
compensation remain low and some measures of longer-term survey  expectations edged 
down. 
The draft statements presented be low—labeled Alternative A, Alt ernative B, and 
Alternative C—offer different a ssessments of realized and expected progress toward the 
Committee’s dual mandate objectives and its two criteria for li ftoff, along with 
                                                            
1 A decision to raise the target range for t he federal funds rat e would be accompanied by decisions 
to increase the interest rates p aid on excess reserves and over night reverse repos, as well as the primary 
credit rate. 
2 Both the October and November employment reports were regarded  as positive surprises by 
financial markets, with strength perceived in many labor market  indicators.

corresponding policy choices.  On inflation, Alternatives B and  C acknowledge that it has 
continued to run below the Committee’s objective, but then stat e that inflation is 
“expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term,” and that the Committee is 
“reasonably confident” that this w ill occur as “the transitory effects of declines in energy 
and import prices dissipate and t he labor market strengthens further.”  Alternative B also 
states that market-based measur es of inflation co mpensation “remain low” and that 
“some” survey-based measures have “edged down.” Alternative C is more sanguine in its 
assessment of longer-term inflation expectations , stating that market-based measures 
have “stabilized” and that surv ey-based measures have “generall y remained stable.”  
Alternative B retains the cautionary note from the October stat ement’s second paragraph 
that says the Committee “continues to monitor inflation develop ments closely,” whereas 
Alternative C drops this language.  Alternative A, by contrast, emphasizes that “inflation, 
core inflation, and gains in labor compensation all [remain] su bdued,” and highlights that 
the Committee “will closely mon itor measures of actual and expe cted inflation.” 
In contrast, the three alternativ es describe developments in th e labor market (and 
real activity) identically: Ther e has been “further improvement ” in labor market 
indicators that “confirms” that  underutilization of labor resou rces has diminished 
“appreciably” since early this year. 
Alternatives B and C state that  both of the criteria for raisin g the federal funds 
rate have been met and therefore  announce an increase in the target range.  Alternative A 
recognizes the improvement in the  labor market, but emphasizes that inflation, core 
inflation, and gains in labor c ompensation all remain subdued a nd so maintains the 
current target range. 
With regard to the second deci sion, namely what forward guidanc e the Committee 
might choose to provide about its c urrent view of the modal path for the federal funds 
rate, it is useful to review market expectations and policymake rs’ role in their evolution 
over time.  On the eve of the October FOMC meeting, market participants placed less-than-even odds on liftoff occurri ng before the end of this year .  However, the postmeeting 
statement for October, and the m inutes for that meeting, emphas ized that an increase in 
the target range for the feder al funds rate at the December mee ting was a distinct 
possibility, provided that incoming data turned out to be consi stent with the Committee’s

outlook.3  In combination, FOMC communications and the uniformly strong labor market 
reports for October and November boosted the perceived probabil ity of liftoff in 
December to around 90 percent.4  All told, surveys and market conditions suggest that 
money market rates will be about in the target range immediatel y after a liftoff decision is 
announced; see the accompanying box “Expectations For Money Mar ket Rates Following 
Liftoff”. 
Market participants have long expe cted that normalization of th e stance of 
monetary policy will proceed more gradually this time than duri ng the 1994 and 2004 
tightening cycles, and more gradua lly than was anticipated at t he onset of those episodes. 
Recent policy communications appear to have reinforced those ex pectations.  Currently, 
federal funds rate futures suggest that market participants ant icipate approximately two 
25 basis point increases in the f ederal funds rate per year in 2016 and 2017, while the 
Survey of Primary Dealers and the Survey of Market Participants  point to three or four 
such increases per year.  In contrast, the December Tealbook as sumption is for 
approximately five increases ove r each of the two years.  The a ccompanying box, “The 
Federal Funds Rate Path: Market Expectations and Risk Scenarios ” surveys the available 
information on this subject. 
Returning to the statements, Alternatives B and C both note that “the stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative” after liftoff, with Alte rnative B suggesting that 
this policy stance is intended t o support further improvement i n the labor market and a 
return of inflation to 2 percent , while Alternative C is silent  on this issue.  In addition, 
Alternatives B and C shift the emphasis of policy communication  from “how long to 
maintain” the target range, as in the October statement, to “th e timing and size of future 
adjustments” of the target range.  While this new language woul d be read, initially, as 
                                                            
3 As of the October meeting, the Committee expected economic act ivity to expand at a moderate 
pace, labor market indicators to continue to improve, and infla tion to rise gradually toward 2 percent over 
the medium term as the transito ry effects of declines in energy  and import prices dissipate.   
4  Market assessments of the probability of liftoff occurring De cember rose from about 30 percent 
just before the October FOMC, to about 55 percent after the pos tmeeting statement; subsequent 
communications from FOMC particip ants raised the probability a bit further.  The probability rose from 
about 60 percent just prior to the employment situation report for October to about 70 percent afterward; 
the employment situation report f or November had only small add itional effects.  Federal funds futures 
now suggest the probability of a December liftoff is about 80 to 95 percent.  Respondents to the Desk’s 
Survey of Primar y Dealers and Su rvey of Market Participants est imate, on average, that the probability is 
around 90 percent, up from 37 p ercent in the October survey.  T he “Financial Developments” section of 
Tealbook A provides more details.

 Expectations  For Money Market Rates Following  Liftoff 
Term money market rates have moved up notably in recent weeks, reflecting  market 
expectations  for an increase in  policy rates at the December  FOMC meeting.   As 
shown in  the figure below, the 3‐month Treasury bill yield and the 3‐month LIBOR rate 
have increased  since the end  of October and  are currently  25 basis points and 17 basis 
points, respectively, above their  monthly averages  prior to the October FOMC  
meeting.   These rates, and  other term money market rates, can be  used to calculate  
implied forward interest rates that  market prices imply will prevail following  the 
December  FOMC meeting.1  Implied forward  rates can supplement measures  of 
expectations  derived from  surveys or from interest rate derivatives,  the latter of 
which are regularly  presented  in Tealbook  A to project  the path of the federal funds  
rate. 
The implied  forward rates reported  in the table below point  to an  increase in  money 
market rates immediately  following  the December  FOMC meeting.   We calculate  
market expectations  for money  market rates for the  week immedi ately following  the 
December  FOMC meeting conditional  on liftoff, using  a liftoff probability  of 90 
percent from the Desk’s December  Survey of Primary Dealers and ignoring term 
premiums.   The implied forward rates,  presented  in the top panel, range from  25 basis 
points to 47 basis points, about 20 basis points above their  current levels.  These 
results suggest that markets seem to anticipate  that, in the event of liftoff, money  
market rates will roughly  be in the assumed  target range for the federal  funds rate of 
25 to 50 basis  points.2  
Market prices  suggest that the OIS rate,  the Treasury  GC repo rate, and Treasury  bill 
yields will remain  within or  slightly above the 25 to 50 basis point range in early 2016, 
as shown in  the bottom panel of the table.  Eurodollar,  LIBOR, as  well as AA financial  
and non‐financial commercial  paper rates  are expected  to be at similar levels  in early 
2016, ranging from 41 basis points to 59 basis  points. 
The implied  forward rates presented  are based on specific assumptions.   Alternative  
assumptions  would imply different,  and potentially  much different, expected  money 
market rates.  First,  market participants  may demand a positive  term premium  for 
holding longer‐dated money market instruments,  which would suggest that the 
implied rates reported  here are too high.  Second,  using a lower (or  higher) probability  
of liftoff in December  would lead to higher  (or lower) implied post ‐liftoff rates.  In  
addition, term pricing may reflect market participants’  views of rate distortions  that 
are associated  with reporting  dates, and  some term contracts  exte nd beyond the 
January FOMC meeting to which some market participants  may assign a positive  
                                                 
1 A forward rate is the interest  rate that is implied from two spot rates of differing  maturities  for 
the period of time between  the two  maturities.  For  example,  a 1‐week spot rate and a 2‐week spot 
rate can be used to calculate a 1‐week rate that would prevail one week from now.   
2 Treasury bill yields are subject  to year‐end pressures  and other pricing dynamics,  which might 
lead  to their levels being  a bit below the anticipated  target range for the federal funds  rate.

month Treas ury bill yield immediately  following  liftoff are 34, 40, and 25 basis points,

 The  Federal Funds Rate Path:  Market Expectations  and Risk Scenarios  
Financial market quotes  indicate that investors  currently  place high  odds on a rate increase at  the 
December  FOMC meeting,  higher than was the case immediately  before the 1994 tightening  
move and only modestly  lower than the  near‐certain  odds seen ahead  of the 2004 interest rate 
increase (table 1).  
By comparison,  the expect ed pace of tightening  after liftoff, measured  from money market 
futures rates, remains  significantly  below both the expected  and the actual pace of tightening  in 
the two previous  episodes  (table 1).1  Moreover,  the expected  pace has declined  slightly over the  
past year, in contrast  to the 1994  tightening,  when the  expected  pace remained  about unchanged  
over the preceding  12 months, as well as the 2004 tightening,  when  the expected  pace increased  
sharply over the  preceding  three months  in response  to rapid improvements  in the labor  market 
(figure 2).  Meanwhile,  uncertainty  about the expected  policy path changed  little over the  past 
year,  and  is well below  the levels seen  during the previous  tightening  episodes  (figure 3).  
Overall, money  market quotes indicate a strong conviction  that the increase in the  target rate  
after the liftoff will be grad ual. 
  
According  to data collected  by the CFTC, non‐commercial  net long positions  in interest rate 
futures declined  in recent months, suggesting  that speculative  traders now have little exposure  
to increases  in short‐term  interest rates  (figure 4).  By contrast,  before the taper tantrum in the 
summer of 2013, speculative  investors  had accumulated  a large amount of net long positions  in 
interest rate futures,  which were quickly unwound  in subsequent  months, amplifying  the initial 
interest rate increase.   
                                                 
1 The expected  pace of tightening  after the initial rate hike is measured  as the difference  between  the 
futures‐implied expected  policy rates on two dates—the  date where the expected  policy path crosses the value 
corresponding  to first hike and the date one‐year thereafter.   For the current episode, we assume that that the 
federal funds rate will trade in the middle of the new target  range of 25 to 50 basis points after liftoff.

The experience from  the taper tantrum suggests that, even when asset  prices indicate a subdued  
level of uncertainty  surrounding  the expected  policy path, futures rates and spot interest rates 
can still jump higher if incoming  information  leads investors  to substantially  revise their views 
about the future course of monetary  policy.  Below we discuss two possible  scenarios  in which 
such a sharp  increase could  occur in response  to policy  tightening.  
First, market participants  appear to have placed for some  time now very low odds on the 
possibility  of a pace of federal funds  rate increases  similar to or  above the one  prevailing  during 
2004–05.   While over the  most recent period economic  activity has expanded  at a moderate pace,  
a sharp upward revision in  the expected  policy rate path might occur if  economic  data comes in 
notably above market  expectations  in coming months.  That said, investors  did not appear to 
revise their expectations  about the pace of tightenin g significantly  in response  to data surprises  
such as those associated  with nonfarm  payroll releases.  Indeed, the expected  pace of tightening  
has been nearly  flat over the  past year and  remained  much more  stable than that seen ahead  of 
the 1994 and 2004 tightenings.  
Second, survey respondents  appear to see a somewhat faster  pace of tightening  than that 
implied by futures rates.  For example,  the median dealer in  the latest Desk survey sees the target 
rate at about  2 percent at the end of 2017.  This is roughly in line with the median projections  from 
the September  SEP that are consistent  with the target range  for the federal funds  rate being  
raised about 4 to 5 times  a year by 25 basis points each.  Although  both the SEP and primary 
dealer projections  indicate a notably  slower pace of tightening  than what actually  occurred  
during the 1994 and 2004 episodes, both  projections  currently  lie well above the futures ‐based 
policy path.  A convergence  of the futures‐based path towards  the survey ‐based one would result 
in significant  increases  in money market futures rates and the market‐based policy rate path.  
An examination  of the historical  behavior  of the gap between market‐  and survey‐based paths 
suggests that its current negative level is  somewhat  unusual:   although  the gap had at times 
turned negative,  those instances  occurred  mostly when interest rates  were declining  amid a 
darkening  economic  outlook.   The gap  was positive ahead of the 1994 and 2004 tightenings,  with 
survey‐based forecasts  somewhat  below market ‐based paths, but it  moved in opposite  directions  
following  the initial rate increases  (figure 5).

 Several explanations  have been proposed  to explain the current  negative  gap, including:   (1) The 
lower futures  rates might be  a reflection  of more pessimistic views  among traders about the 
future economic  outlook than survey respondents;   (2) Concerns  about downside  tail risks would  
have reduced mean expectation measures,  such as those derived  from future rates, but would  
leave little imprint on modal expectation measures, such as  survey forecasts;  (3)  Some investors  
are said to have repeatedly  suffered  losses in the past from positions  aimed at profiting  in rising 
rate scenarios  and are currently  wary of establishing  similar positions  despite their conviction  that 
liftoff is imminent;   (4) Investors might have  increasi ngly viewed interest rate futures  and 
Treasury securities  as good hedges against economic  downturns  and so stand willing to accept  
relatively  low expected  returns on these instruments  in light of their “insurance  value” in some 
adverse scenarios, and  (5) The perception of  a persistent  policy divergence  between the U.S.  and 
other advanced  economies, as  many foreign central banks have continued  to ease to stimulate 
their economies  while the FOMC moves closer to tightening,  might have  led to increased  investor 
demand from overseas  for long positions  in U.S. money market futures, reducing  their implied 
rates. 
The evolution  of the market‐based expected  policy path during the process of policy 
normalization  depends  critically on which combination  of these factors  are at work.  If (1) and (2) 
are the main reasons behind the negative gap  and the onset of policy tightening  is seen as a 
positive signal that leads investors  to scale back significantly  their assessment  of the downside  
risks to the  economy, the  futures‐based policy path could be revised upward  significantly.   
Revisions  in the expected  policy path could be even more significant  if policy tightening  triggers a 
large amount of positions  being established  that are predicated  upon additional  rate increases, as  
in the case of (3).  In contrast,  if risk  premium ‐based explanations,  such as (4) and (5), are the 
major drivers  of the negative gap, the  gap may not change significantly  after liftoff, as  covariance 
patterns that determine the hedging  properties  of money market futures or the degree of policy 
divergence  across countries  are unlikely to be altered significantly  by a gradual  process of policy 
tightening.

pointing to further increases in the target range, it would als o allow for future reductions 
if they become appropriate. 
By contrast, Alternative A w ould not only reaffirm that the current target range 
remains appropriate and that the  liftoff criteria remain unchan ged, it would also signal 
concerns about the future course of inflation.  In particular, Alternative A includes a 
sentence indicating that the Co mmittee “is prepared to provide additional accommodation 
if incoming information does not  soon indicate that inflation i s moving up toward 2 
percent.”  Thus, unlike the October statement, Alternative A wo uld suggest that a 
decision against lifting off fr om the effective lower bound at this meeting would be more 
than a minor adjustment in the  timing of liftoff .  Alternative A would therefore likely 
result in a substantial pushi ng out of the date of liftoff expe cted by market participants. 
 Alternatives B and C state tha t, in determining “the timing and size” of future 
“adjustments” to the target range, the Committee will assess re alized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its mandated objectives.  Alter native B provides guidance 
indicating that the C ommittee expects economic conditions to ev olve in a manner that 
will warrant “only gradual” incre ases in the federal funds rate ; Alternative C differs by 
omitting the word “only.”  Both also state that the level of th e federal funds rate will 
probably remain, “for some time,” below levels likely to prevai l in the longer run. 
Turning to the Committee’s third decision, the conditions that would result in a 
different path for the funds rate than the modal one, Alternati ves B and C state that the 
“actual path of the federal funds rate” would be informed by how the incoming data 
affect the economic outlook.  In t his context, Alternative B si gnals some concern 
regarding the inflation outl ook by including, in paragraph 4, a  sentence—one that does 
not appear in Alternative C—that s tates that “In light of the c urrent shortfall of inflation 
from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and  expected progress 
toward its inflation goal.”  All three Alterna tives drop the “b alanced approach” language 
that for quite some time has bee n used to characterize how the Committee might have 
responded to changes in the economic outlook once normalization  begins. 
Finally, regarding communicati on of the Committee’s policy for SOMA portfolio 
reinvestment, the three Alternatives span the range of qualitative guidance discussed 
during the September 2015 meeti ng.  In particular , Alternative A simply says that the 
Committee is continuing its exi sting reinvestment policy, while  Alternative B indicates 
that the Federal Reserve antic ipates continuing to reinvest until normalization of the

federal funds rate “is well unde r way,” and Alternative C has t he Federal Reserve 
continuing to reinvest “at least  during the early stages” of no rmalization.5 
The next pages contain the Oct ober postmeeting statement, the three draft 
statements, and summaries of the arguments for each alternative .  These elements are 
followed by the draft directive for Alternative A, then by a dr aft implementation note 
(which includes the directive for Alternatives B and C), and finally by a draft of a desk 
statement regarding overnight rev erse repurchase operations.  If the Committee were to 
adopt Alternative B or C, the implementation note would be rele ased with the 
Committee’s postmeeting statement , and the Desk statement would be released shortly 
thereafter. 
  
                                                            
5 The median respondent in the S urvey of Primary Dealers anticip ated that reinvestment would 
end 12 months after liftoff, for both Treasury securities and M BS, up from 9 months reported in the

OCTOBER 2015  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in September 
suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderat e pace.  Household 
spending and business fixed invest ment have been increasing at solid rates in recent 
months, and the housing sector has  improved further; however, net exports have been 
soft.  The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate h eld steady.  
Nonetheless, labor market indi cators, on balance, show that und erutilization of labor 
resources has diminished since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below 
the Committee's longer-run objectiv e, partly reflecting decline s in energy prices and 
in prices of non-energy imports.  Mar ket-based measures of inflation compensation 
moved slightly lower; survey-bas ed measures of longer-term infl ation expectations 
have remained stable.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy 
accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move t oward levels the Committee judges consistent with its 
dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic 
activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitor ing global economic 
and financial developments.  Inflation is anticipated to remain  near its recent low 
level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to r ise gradually toward 2 
percent over the medium term as the labor market improves furth er and the transitory 
effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  The  Committee continues to 
monitor inflation developments closely.  
3. To support continued progress towa rd maximum employment and pri ce stability, the 
Committee today reaffirmed its  view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate remain s appropriate.  In determining whe ther it will be 
appropriate to raise t he target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess 
progress—both realized and expect ed—toward its objectives of maximum 
employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide 
range of information, including meas ures of labor market condit ions, indicators of 
inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.  The  Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to 
raise the target range for the f ederal funds rate when it has s een some further 
improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident tha t inflation will move 
back to its 2 percent objectiv e over the medium term.  
4. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities 
at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial  conditions.  
5. When the Committee decides t o begin to remove policy accommodat ion, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent w ith its longer-run goals of maxim um employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near  mandate-consistent levels, ec onomic conditions

economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 
2 percent objective.  Given the economic outlook, and recognizi ng the time it 
takes for policy action s to affect future economic outcomes, th e Committee 
decided to raise the target rang e for the federal funds rate to  ¼ to ½ percent.  
Even after this increase, the stance of monetary policy remains  accommodative.  
4. In determining whether it w ill be appropriate to raise the timing and size of future 
adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate at its next meeting, the 
Committee will assess progress–both realized and expected economic conditions –
toward relative to  its objectives of max imum employment and 2 percent inflation.  
This asses sment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  The 
Committee anticipates expects  that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for

the federal funds rate when it ha s seen some further improvemen t in the labor market 
and is reasonably confident that  inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective 
over the medium term economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will 
warrant gradual increases in the target for the federal funds rate; the federal 
funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run .  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.   
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction , and anticipates doing so at least during the early stages of normalization 
of the federal funds rate .  This policy, by keeping the Committee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities  at sizable levels , should help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions.  
6. When the Committee decides t o begin to remove policy accommodat ion, it will take a 
balanced approach consistent w ith its longer-run goals of maxim um employment and 
inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after 
employment and inflation are near  mandate-consistent levels, ec onomic conditions 
may, for some time, warrant keep ing the target federal funds ra te below levels the 
Committee views as normal in the longer run.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may see the two labor market reports received sinc e the October 
FOMC and, in particular, the brea dth of labor market improvemen ts reported therein, as 
supporting the view that “further  improvement” has been realize d in labor market 
conditions.  Other labor market da ta, such as new claims for un employment insurance, 
may reinforce that assessment.  P olicymakers might also regard recent information about 
consumer spending and the housing sector, and developments in fiscal policy, as 
suggesting that the ongoing expa nsion in the domestic economy i s strong enough to 
sustain further labor market ga ins.  Moreover, with the unemplo yment rate at 5.0 percent, 
policymakers may anticipate that  further strengthening of the l abor market might 
generate some welcome upward pr essure on inflation.  Policymake rs may observe that 
while all-items inflation gene rally has continued to run well b elow 2 percent, core 
measures, such as CPI infla tion excluding food and energy price s, and trimmed-mean 
inflation, have come in closer to 2 percent and about as expect ed, and show signs of 
turning up.  They might also take comfort from analyses indicat ing that low levels of 
market-based measures of long-te rm inflation compensation can l argely be attributed to 
liquidity and inflation-risk prem iums, and from the observation  that these measures have 
edged up, on net, in recent weeks.  They might further note that although some survey-
based measures have declined recently, these movements might be attributable to recent low levels of energy prices and h eadline inflation, and therefo re probably do not indicate 
a deterioration in longer-term inflation expectations themselve s.  For these and other 
reasons, policymakers might be “ reasonably confident” that head line inflation will move 
back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term, once the downward 
pressure on domestic consumer prices from the pass-through of d eclines in global 
commodity prices and appreciati on of the dollar  dissipate, and as the labor market 
strengthens further.  Thus polic ymakers may regard the criteria for policy firming 
introduced in the Committee’s Marc h statement as having been sa tisfied and therefore 
support Alternative B, whic h announces a 25 basis point increase in the target range for 
the federal funds rat e to ¼ to ½ percent. 
At the same time, policymakers ma y see room for some further im provement in 
the labor market along margins s uch as labor force participation or the number of persons 
employed part time for economic  reasons, and it may judge that a further increase in 
labor utilization could help speed  the return of inflation to the 2 percent objective .  
Moreover, policymakers may expect  the economic forces that have  long been restraining 
economic growth to recede only slowly.  Accordingly, they may conclude that gradual 
Alternatives

post-liftoff adjustments of the federal funds rate would be app ropriate, at least for a time, 
to support further strengthening of  labor market conditions and  to mitigate the risks of 
returning to the effective lo wer bound.  They might also judge that the message of 
gradualism in Alternative B is  properly tempered by its emphasi s that it is the expected 
“evolution of economic conditions” that “will warrant only grad ual increases in the 
federal funds rate,” and that “the actual path” will depend on how incoming data inform 
the Committee’s economic outlook. 
The data received over the past  few months, com bined with participants’ 
communications about their interpretations of those data, have succeeded in pulling 
forward market expectations of t he time of liftoff:  in contras t to the situation in October, 
respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and its Survey of Market 
Participants now place odds of about 90 percent on a rate hike at this meeting.  Moreover, 
the expected future path for the  target range is in line with “only gradual increases in the 
federal funds rate.”  In light of  the data and market participa nts’ response to those data, 
policymakers might regard the December meeting as a propitious time for the first 
increase in the federal funds rat e in nine years.  Market react ion to a statement along the 
lines of Alternative B is likel y to be muted.  However, the ind ication in paragraph 3 that 
the Committee is seeking further improvement in labor market co nditions, the hint at 
downside risks for inflation i n paragraph 2, and the sentence in paragraph 4 indicating 
that “In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and exp ected progress toward its infla tion goal,” might be 
construed as more accommodative than expected.  Insofar as this  is the case, medium- 
and longer-term real interest rate s, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, would 
decline, and equity p rices would rise.  Whether inflation compe nsation would rise or fall 
would depend on perceptions of the efficacy of monetary policy:   the signal of downside 
risk to inflation could push inflation compensation down, all e lse equal, but noting in the 
statement an awareness of the issue, together with the positive  sentiment communicated 
by the liftoff decision itself , may push in the opposite direct ion.  Of course, the SEP and 
the Chair’s postmeeting press c onference will also affect marke t reactions. 
 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Some policymakers may concur with  proponents of Alternative B that the criteria 
for liftoff of the federal funds rate from the effective lower bound have been met, but 
might not see the same downside ri sks to inflation, and may jud ge that with the 
Alternatives

unemployment rate at  5.0 percent, slack in t he labor market has essentially been 
absorbed.   
On inflation, these policymaker s might be encouraged by the rec ent stability in 
market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation and  be unconcerned by the 
recent modest declines in certain survey measures of inflation expectations on the 
grounds that the latter can be l argely explained by recent decl ines in energy prices and 
headline inflation, and are ther efore not a harbinger of an una nchoring of inflation 
expectations.  They might judge tha t the other prominent sources of downward pressure 
on inflation—the recent apprecia tion of the dollar and the decline in nonoil import 
prices—are likely restraining core as well as he adline inflation, but only temporarily.  
They might instead worry that allowing the unemployment rate to undershoot its longer-
run normal level for an extended period as a conscious act of policy risks eliciting an 
upward drift of inflation expect ations, possibly along the line s of the alternative scenario 
“Faster Growth with Higher Infl ation.”  For these reasons, amon g others, these 
policymakers might prefer Altern ative C’s omission of the reference to “the current 
shortfall of inflati on from 2 percent” that appears in paragrap h 4 of Alternative B. 
Regarding the labor market, the  breadth of the improvement in r ecent job market 
reports might lead these policym akers to conclude that there is  little in the way of 
“hidden slack.”  Accordingly, they might argue that the Committ ee should not signal, as 
does the language of Alternative B, that the still-accommodativ e stance of monetary 
policy, after liftoff, is designe d to support “further improvem ent in labor market 
conditions and a return t o 2 percent inflation.” 
In addition, some policymakers ma y note that, for about a year now, most of the 
simple policy rules and optimal c ontrol simulations in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” 
section of Tealbook B have called f or policy tightening to begi n.  They might agree that 
there were good risk-management reasons to delay liftoff, relat ive to the prescriptions of 
these risk-neutral, perfect-foresight simulations.  But given t he recent re-emergence of 
strength in the labor market, t hese policymakers might choose, contrary to Alternative B, 
to restrict references to “g radualism” to paragraph 4 and thus for paragraph 2 prefer the 
language of Alternative C which says that the Committee expects adjustments in the future stance of monetary polic y without suggesting that these adjustments will be 
gradual.  These policymakers might emphasize that, because it i s the interest- and 
consumer-confidence-sensitive sectors of the economy, such as m otor vehicle sales, that 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

have shown the most noteworthy i mprovement of late, it may be t hat the current stance of 
policy is more accommodative than commonly believed. 
These policymakers might further  argue that the language of Alt ernative B could 
create the impression that “gradua lism” is a promise rather than a conditional 
expectation, and it might therefore foster expectations of a prolonged, unconditionally 
shallow path for the f ederal funds rate, cre ating incipient exc ess demand, and thus 
running the risk that inflation w ill persistently overshoot 2 p ercent.  Alternatively, some 
policymakers may see the emphasi s on a gradually rising path fo r the federal funds rate 
that is a central feature of Alternative B as likely to induce further “reaching for yield,” 
which could leave leveraged inve stors unduly exposed to adverse  economic or financial 
market events. 
On average, respondents to the D esk’s Survey of Primary Dealers  and its Survey 
of Market Participants expect that the federal funds rate is li kely to climb only very 
slowly—notably more slowly, for e xample, than the staff assumed  in constructing the 
Tealbook forecast.  On the whole, t he differences between Alter native C and Alternative 
B are not large.  Nevertheless, t wo features of Alternative C—less emphasis on 
gradualism and less concern for the future path of inflation, r elative to Alternative B—
might be regarded as more restric tive than financial market participants expect.  Hence, if 
the Committee were to adopt Alte rnative C, medium- and longer-t erm real interest rates 
would likely rise, equity prices  and inflation compensation wou ld likely decline, and the 
dollar would appreciate.  To the extent, however, that market p articipants were to 
conclude that the Committee’s  guidance is a reflection of a mor e optimistic outlook than 
markets perceive, equity prices  and inflation compensation coul d rise. 
 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Both core and headline inflati on have run below 2 percent for several years,  and 
renewed declines in oil and othe r commodity prices, along with downward pressure on 
non-commodity import prices ste mming from the appreciation of t he dollar, suggest that 
headline inflation will linger a t very low levels well into 201 6.  Some policymakers may 
see substantial risk that infl ation will not ris e to 2 percent over the medium term.   They 
also might note that staff and FOM C participants have systematically overpredicted 
inflation in recent years.

These policymakers might express concern about measures of long-term inflation 
expectations, noting that some s urvey-based measures have decli ned below their previous 
ranges, and that market-based measures have been at low levels for so long that 
attributing the low readings to liquidity and risk premiums str ains credulity.  They might 
point to the global disinflationa ry pressures that seem prevale nt at the moment.  These 
observations may lead some partic ipants to conclude that there is little reason to be 
“reasonably confident” that inflation will return to 2 percent,  even given the current 
stance of policy, and therefore that the criteria  for liftoff o f the federal funds rate from the 
effective lower bound have not been  met.  Moreover, these polic ymakers might argue 
that the chronic failure to  get inflation moving up has put at risk the credibility of the 
FOMC’s commitment to achieving 2 percent inflation and suggests  that the Committee’s 
meeting-by-meeting approach to po licy is not working.  They might therefore prefer 
Alternative A, which states th at the “Committee is prepared to provide additional 
accommodation if incoming infor mation does not soon indicate th at inflation is moving 
up toward 2 percent.”  
These policymakers might be heartened by hints that growth in l abor 
compensation might be picking up, b ut argue that it is, at best , far too early to lean on 
these observations as justific ation for liftoff.  They might no te that the best evidence 
available says that inflation i s not very responsive to aggrega te demand conditions, 
suggesting that it would take a  substantial period of high levels of labor utilization to 
raise inflation from its current very low level to 2 percent.  They might buttress this claim 
by arguing that the social costs of overemployment are less tha n the social costs of 
underemployment which, all else equ al, would call for “running the e conomy a little 
hot,” and thus for deferral of liftoff.   
Turning to risks and their manag ement, while a cknowledging that  the more dire 
scenarios for the global outl ook seem less likely than in September, some policymakers 
might still see sizable downside risks from foreign sources.  M ore generally, 
policymakers might see the case for deferring liftoff as streng thened by the risk of a 
potentially costly return of the  federal funds rate to the effe ctive lower bound, if liftoff 
were to turn out to have been premature.  And they might reinfo rce this argument by 
noting the possibility that the neutral rate of interest might be persistently lower than once 
imagined; to the extent that thi s is so, it would mean that the  current stance of monetary 
policy is tighter than one might have thought.

Just one respondent to the Desk’s  Survey of Primary Dealers exp ects liftoff to 
occur next year, and no respondent anticipates that the Committ ee would indicate the 
possibility of greater accommodation.  In response to a stateme nt along the lines of 
Alternative A, invest ors would likely push out their expectatio ns about the most probable 
date of the first increase in the  target range for the federal funds rate well into next year; 
they might also revise down their expectations of how quickly t he Committee would raise 
the target range thereafter .  Longer-term real yields would dec line, and equity prices and 
inflation compensation could ris e.  However if investors were t o see a statement such as 
Alternative A as reflecting a downbeat assessment of economic c onditions, equity prices 
and inflation compensation might increase less th an otherwise, or even fall.

DESK STATEMENT FOR DECEMBER 2015  ALTERNATIVES B OR C 
Release Date:  December 16, 2015 
Statement Regarding Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements 
During its meeting on December 15-16, 2015, the Federal Open Ma rket Committee 
(FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank 
of New York (New York Fed), effective December 17, 2015, to und ertake open market 
operations as necessary to mainta in the federal funds rate in a  target range of ¼ to ½ 
percent, including overnight rever se repurchase operations (ON RRPs) at an offering rate 
of 0.25 percent and in amounts limited only by the value of Tre asury securities held 
outright in the System Open Marke t Account (SOMA) that are available for such 
operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per d ay. 
To determine the value of Treas ury securities available for ON RRP operations, several 
factors need to be taken into account, as not all Treasury secu rities held outright in the 
SOMA will be available for use in such operations. First, some of the Treasury securities 
held outright in the SOMA are ne eded to conduct reverse repurch ase agreements with 
foreign official and international accounts.1 Second, some Treasury securities are needed 
to support the securities lending operations  conducted by the Desk. Additionally, buffers 
are needed to provide for possibl e changes in demand for these activities and for possible 
changes in the market value of  the SOMA’s holdings of Treasury securities. 
Taking these factors into account, the Desk anticipates that ar ound $2 trillion of Treasury 
securities will be available f or ON RRP operations to fulfill the FOMC’s domestic policy 
directive.2 In the highly unlikely event that the value of bids received i n an ON RRP 
operation exceeds the amount of available securities, the Desk will allocate awards using 
a single-price auction based on the stop-out rate at which the overall size limit is reached, 
with all bids below this rate aw arded in full at the stop-out r ate and all bids at this rate 
awarded on a pro rata basis at the stop-out rate. 
These ON RRP operations will be open to all eligible RRP counte rparties, will settle 
same-day, and will have an overnight tenor unless a longer term  is warranted to 
accommodate weekend, holiday, and other similar trading conventions. Each eligible 
counterparty is permitted to submit one proposition for each ON  RRP operation, in a size 
not to exceed $30 billion and at a rate not to exceed the specified offering rate. The 
operations will take place from  12:45 p.m. to 1:15 p.m. (Eastern Time). Any changes to 
these terms will be announced wit h at least one business day’s prior notice on the New 
York Fed’s website. 
The results of these operations will be posted on the New York Fed’s website. The 
outstanding amounts of RRPs are reported on the Federal Reserve's H.4.1 statistical 
release as a factor absorbing reserves in Table 1 and as a liab ility item in Tables 5 and 6.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has developed a projection of the Federal Reserve’s b alance sheet and 
income statement that is broadl y consistent with the monetary p olicy assumptions 
incorporated in the staff’s forecast presented in Tealbook A.  We assume that the 
Committee will decide to commen ce policy normalization at its D ecember meeting and 
that reinvestments of maturi ng Treasury securities and principa l received on agency debt 
and agency MBS will continue through the second quarter of 2016.  Once reinvestments 
cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks through redemptions of maturi ng Treasury and agency 
debt securities as well as paydow ns of principal from agency MB S.  Regarding the 
Federal Reserve’s use of its policy normalization tools, we ass ume that the level of 
overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the end 
of 2018 before falling to zero by the end of 2019, and that ter m deposits and term RRPs 
are not used during the  normalization period.1,2  The bullets below highlight some key 
features of the projections for t he Federal Reserve’s balance s heet and income statement 
under these assumptions. 
 Balance sheet. As shown in the exhibit “Total A ssets and Selected Balance Shee t 
Items” and in the table that follows, the size of the portfolio  is normalized in the 
third quarter of 2021, about a quarter  later than in the Octobe r Tealbook.3  Once 
1 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the overall size of the balance sheet. 
2 We also assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts remain 
around (their October 30, 2015 level of) $201 billion throughou t the projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend, which is determ ined largely by currency in circulation and a 
projected steady-state level of r eserve balances. The projected  timing of the normalization of the size of the 
balance sheet depends importantly  on the level of reserve balances that is assumed to be necessary to 
conduct monetary policy; currently , we assume that level of res erve balances to be $100 billion. However, 
ongoing regulatory and structural changes could lead to a higher demand for reserve balances in the new 
steady state.  In turn, a higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else e qual, imply an earlier 
normalization of the size of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a $500 billion steady-state level of 
reserve balances, the balance sh eet would likely normalize in m id-2020. Alternatively, a lower assumed 
steady-state level of reserve b alances, such as $10 billion, wo uld induce a delay in the normalization of the 
balance sheet until the final quarter of 2021.

reserve balances reac h their steady-state level, total assets s tand at $2.3 trillion, 
with about $2.2 trillion in total S OMA securities holdings.  To tal assets and 
SOMA holdings increase thereafter, keeping pace with the rise i n both currency in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
 Federal Reserve remittances. The exhibit “Income Pr ojections” shows the 
implications of the balance shee t projection and interest rate assumptions for 
Federal Reserve income.4  Remittances to the Treasury are projected to be about 
$100 billion this year and the ne xt, close to the $100 billion level recorded in 
2014.  Subsequently, annual remittances fall to their trough of  roughly $30 billion 
in 2019, with no recorded deferred asset.5  The Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1.1 trillion.  Re lative to the 
October Tealbook, projected remittances for 2016 have been revi sed up nearly 
$25 billion, and cumulative remittances over the projection per iod are roughly 
$100 billion higher, refle cting the effects of the Fixing Ameri ca’s Surface 
Transportation Act, which w as signed on December 4, 2015.  This Act 
permanently reduces the Federal Reserve’s capital surplus account from its 
current level of $29 billion to a m aximum of $10 billion and cu ts dividends of 
large depository institutions fro m 6 percent to the lesser of 6 percent and the 
prevailing rate on the Treasury 10-year rate.6 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The unrealized gain or loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio depends importantly on t he level of interest rates.  The staff estimates 
that the portfolio was in a n unrealized gain position of about $125 billion as of the 
end of November.7  Because of the assumed rise i n longer-term interest rates over 
4 As firming of the policy rate begins, the spread between the i nterest rate paid on reserve balances 
and the ON RRP rate is 25 basis points.  Moreover, we assume that the effective federal funds rate will 
average about 15 basis points bel ow the interest rate paid on r eserve balances and about 10 basis points 
above the ON RRP rate.  
5 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset for int erest on Federal Reserve notes would be 
recorded. 
6 The Federal Reserve pays dividends on member depository instit utions’ capital paid-in.  Large 
depository institutions are defin ed as those with total assets over $10 billion.  These in stitutions account for 
roughly $27 billion of the total $29 billion of total capital paid-in. 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at

the next several years, the position is projected to shift to a n unrealized loss by 
mid-2016 and then to record a pea k unrealized loss of about $235 billion at the 
end of 2018, about $10 billion larger th an in the October Tealb ook.  At that time, 
almost $110 billion of the unrealized  losses can be attributed to the portfolio of 
Treasury securities and a little less than $130 billion to the portfolio of agency 
MBS.  The unrealized loss posit ion then narrows through 2025, a s the value of 
securities acquired under the larg e-scale asset purchase progra ms returns to par 
when these securities approach maturity and then mature, and ne w securities are 
added to the portfolio at par. 
 Projected uncertainty and income risks.  To help quantify the degree of 
uncertainty surrounding the pat h of the balance sheet and the i nterest rate risk 
embedded in the SOMA portfolio, the accompanying box, “Confiden ce Interval 
Projections of the Balance Sheet ,” reports confidence intervals  for the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and inc ome projections based on paths o f macroeconomic 
variables generated by stochasti c simulations of the staff’s FR B/US model. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” t he Federal Reserve’s elevated stock of longer-
term securities is estimated t o hold down the term premium embe dded in the 
10-year Treasury yield in t he fourth quarter of 2015 by 109 bas is points.  Over the 
next couple of years, the estimat ed term premium effect diminis hes at a pace of 
about 5 basis points per quarter, r eflecting in part the projec ted shrinking of the 
portfolio; this projection is r oughly unchanged from the October Tealbook. 
 SOMA Characteristics.   The exhibit “Projections f or the Characteristics of 
SOMA Holdings” shows that under the staff baseline balance shee t assumptions, 
approximately $1.4 trillion in SOMA Treasury holdings will matu re between 
2016 and 2020, with the amounts matu ring varying considerably f rom month to 
month; this pattern differs notably from projected MBS paydowns.  During the 
first half of 2016, the maturi ng $143 billion in SOMA’s Treasur y securities 
holdings are reinvested in notes and bonds.8  As a result, the weighted-average

Confidence Interval Projections of the Balance Sheet 
The elevated size of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio and the duration mismatch 
between its assets and liabilities have long prompted discussions regarding possible 
financial losses when interest rates rise. To help quantify the Fed’s interest rate risk, 
this box analyzes a range of potential macroeconomic outcomes and their 
implications for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and income. 1 We use the paths 
of macroeconomic variables generated by stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model 
around the December Tealbook baseline and a staff MBS prepayment model to 
project confidence intervals for the evolution of SOMA holdings, reserve balances, 
and income.2 Key inputs are the paths for the federal funds rate and the 10year 
Treasury yield, shown in the upper two panels of the exhibit titled “Interest Rates and 
Selected Assets and Liabilities of the Balance Sheet.”3 
The size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet as well as the 
associated income can shift with macroeconomic outcomes. In particular, because 
agency MBS have an embedded prepayment option, the stock of MBS held in the 
SOMA depends importantly on interest rates and economic conditions. Moreover, 
changes in agency MBS holdings can, in turn, bring about different paths for SOMA 
Treasury holdings once the size of the balance sheet is normalized.4 The middle left 
panel of the first exhibit shows that the set of simulated paths for SOMA holdings 
before the normalization of the size of the balance sheet mostly lies below the 
baseline path. Most of this skew reflects the asymmetric effects of different interest 
rate paths on MBS prepayments. Specifically, interest rates rising above the baseline 
path would slow refinancing activity only slightly more, thereby producing a relatively 
muted effect on the path of prepayments for agency MBS. Alternatively, rates below 
the baseline path will likely hasten prepayments, thus reducing the amount of agency 
MBS holdings. As shown in the lower right panel, SOMA agency MBS holdings are 
projected to range from $485 billion to $820 billion in 2025. 
Variation in the path for interest rates will also influence two other measures reported 
to the public: remittances to the Treasury and the unrealized gain or loss on the Fed’s 
1 Academic research also addresses this issue; for example, one method is to use a probabilistic 
approach to study the interest rate risk of the SOMA portfolio. See Jens H.E. Christensen, Jose A. 
Lopez, and Glenn D. Rudebusch (2015), “A Probability Based Stress Test of Federal Reserve Assets 
and Income,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 73 (April), pp. 26–43. 
2 We assume that the Federal Reserve does not respond with unconventional policy tools to 
future economic conditions, i.e., no further asset purchases will be conducted in response to 
adverse shocks. We also assume that liftoff occurs in December 2015 and that reinvestment ends six 
months after liftoff. 
3 These interest rate paths are the same as those used in constructing the panels shown in 
December Tealbook A, p. 72. The solid line is the staff’s baseline projection. The dark and lighter 
grey areas represent the 70 and 90 interpercentile ranges, respectively. 
4 In addition, because currency largely determines the longer run size of the balance sheet, the 
assumption that currency expands at a rate equal to that of projected nominal GDP growth implies 
that different simulated paths for nominal GDP result in different balance sheet projections.

securities holdings. Remittances largely reflect the net interest income of the Federal 
Reserve. As shown in the upper two panels of the exhibit labeled “Income 
Projections,” in the years prior to the normalization of the size of the balance sheet, 
interest income displays substantially less dispersion than interest expense under a 
range of macroeconomic scenarios. Consequently, the confidence intervals associated 
with Federal Reserve remittances (the middle right panel) primarily reflect the 
sensitivity of interest expense to changes in short term interest rates. Conversely, 
after the size of the balance sheet is normalized, interest income exhibits more 
variability than interest expense. Specifically, the higher dispersion of interest income 
reflects the purchases of new securities with yields that track market interest rates at 
the time of purchase, whereas the assumption of relatively low reserve balances 
restrains total interest expense. As exhibited in the lower left panel, only about 
15 percent of the simulations are associated with inter est rates high enough to induce 
a deferred asset. 
As shown in the lower right panel, the portfolio is projected to shift to an unrealized 
loss position by the middle of 2016 and record a peak unrealized loss of about 
$235 billion at the end of 2018. However, as shown by the lower edge of the 
90 percent confidence interval, the unrealized loss in some scenarios could reach 
$570 billion or more. Although the baseline path implies that the unrealized loss 
position subsequently narrows through 2025, some simulations result in an unrealized 
loss position larger than $400 billion in 2025. Under the assumption that no securities 
are being sold from the portfolio in any of the scenarios, no realized losses are 
incurred and unrealized losses fall to zero as the securities mature.5 
5 The Committee does not anticipate selling agency mortgage backed securities as part of the 
normalization process. Instead, the FOMC intends to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities 
holdings in a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of 
principal on securities held in the SOMA. Nevertheless, the quarter end market value of the SOMA 
portfolio is published in the Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports, available 
at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetaryp olicy/bst_fedfinancials.htm#quarterly and could garner 
some public attention. Weekly remittances are reported in the H.4.1 statistical release.
