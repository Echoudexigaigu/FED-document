The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity a nd inflation in the near term, s hown in the middle panels.  
Reflecting the modest changes in  the outlook for the output gap  and inflation, the 
prescriptions of the four simple rules are only slightly lower than those reported in the 
December Tealbook.  The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules c all for sizable 
adjustments in the policy ra te to values of about 2¼ percent ov er the near term.  By 
contrast, both the inertial Taylor  (1999) rule and the first-di fference rule prescribe a level 
of the federal funds rate within the current target range in th e first quarter of 2016 
because these rules place considerable weight on keeping the fe deral funds rate close to 
its previous quarterly value. 
The bottom panel of the first  exhibit reports the Tealbook-cons istent estimate of a 
medium-term notion of the equilib rium real federal funds rate t hat is generated using the 
FRB/US model.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  is an estimate of the real federal 
funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would make the output gap equal 
to zero in the final  quarter of that period.2  Reflecting the slightl y weaker outlook for the 
GDP gap and inflation, the current estimate of r*, at 1.30 percent, is slightly lower than 
the current-quarter estimate of  1.48 percent derived from the staff’s outlook in December.  
The panel also reports the avera ge of the real federal funds ra te in the Tealbook baseline 
projection for the same 12-qua rter period used to compute r*.3  This average is 0.43 
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the f our rules.  Starting with this 
Tealbook, all nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal fu nds rate.  Previously, most rates were 
expressed on a compounded 365-day basis.  The change in methodo logy has only a marginal effect on the 
reported values. 
2 The Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r* differs in concept and interpretation from two other notions 
of the equilibrium real federal f unds rate reported by staff in  the Tealbook and supporting materials, namely 
the “real natural rate” based on  DSGE models, and the “longer-r un equilibrium real rate” that pins down 
the intercepts of the simple policy rules.  See the accompanyin g box “The Equilibrium Real Rate in the 
Longer Run” for a discussion of these concepts.   
3 While r* and the average projected real f ederal funds rate are calculat ed over the same 
12-quarter period, they need not  be associated with the same ma croeconomic outcomes even when their

 The Equilibrium  Real Rate in the Longer Run 
The equilibrium  level of the real federal funds  rate in the longer run is the rate that is  
consistent  with the economy  operating  at its full potential  once the cyclical  effects of 
economic  shocks have  abated.  This “longer‐run equilibrium  real rate,”  along with the 
Committee’s  inflation objective,  determines  the longer‐run level of  the nominal federal 
funds rate and other interest rates  in the staff’s suite  of economic  models.   In particular,  
the longer‐run equilibrium  real rate corresponds  to the intercept  of simple policy rules 
considered  in the Monetary  Policy Strategies  section of  Tealbook  B.1   
Since June  2014, the staff has, in several steps,  lowered its assumption  for the longer ‐run 
equilibrium  real rate from  2 percent to 1¼ percent. 2  The median and  range of  the longer‐
run level of  the real federal funds  rate implied  by FOMC participants’  projections  reported  
in the Summary  of Economic  Projections  has also declined.   These revisions  are consistent  
with a decline  in the longer‐run equilibrium  real rate identified  in econometric  studies that 
model  the co‐movements  of variables  like inflation,  interest rates, output,  and 
unemployment.3  The estimates  in these  studies are meant to isolate  low‐frequency  
variation in real interest  rates—due  to changes in  risk preferences,  longer‐term potential  
output growth, or  other factors—as  opposed  to fluctuations  due to the business  cycle and 
other shorter‐lived influences.   
As an illustration,  the figure below shows the estimated  path of the longer‐run equilibrium  
real rate from  Johannsen  and Mertens  (2015) along with uncertainty  bands.  The  figure also 
shows estimates  of the longer‐run equilibrium  real rate from  Laubach  and Williams (2015) 
as well as a measure  of the actual real federal  funds rate.  The estimated  longer‐run 
equilibrium  real rates  from the Johannsen ‐Mertens and Laubach ‐Williams models are not 
the same because the  models use different data  to infer slack in the economy  and because 
of different model restrictions  and estimation  methods.   The actual  real rate fluctuates  
                                                 
1 The longer‐run equilibrium  real rate differs in interpretation  from the “real natural rate” and the 
“Tealbook ‐consistent  FRB/US r*.”  The real natural rate is a short‐ term, model‐based rate that would 
prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities.   The Tealbook ‐consistent  FRB/US r* is the real federal funds 
rate that, if maintained,  would close the output  gap in 12 quarters in the FRB/US model.  Both measures 
fluctuate  in response  to transitory  shocks to aggregate  supply or demand.  As economic  disturbances  
dissipate,  these  measures  converge  to the level of the longer‐run equilibrium  real rates assumed in the 
models.   See the memo “r*: Concepts,  Measures,  and Uses” by Christopher  Gust and others sent to the 
FOMC on October 13, 2015 for discussion  of different  equilibrium  rates. 
2 Over  the same period,  the staff has marked down its assumptions  for the longer‐run rate of real 
GDP growth.   See the Tealbook  A boxes  “Changes  to the Longer‐Run Outlook”  from June 2014 and 
“Changes  to Interest  Rates  in the Longer Run” from March 2015.

 around the estimated  values of the longer‐ run equilibrium  real rate,  as would be expected  
due to variations  in inflation and  the stance of  monetary  policy.  The real federal funds  rate 
was well below  the two estimates  of the longer‐run equilibrium  real rate from  late 2008 
through 2014, indicating  that monetary  policy was providing  stimulus  to speed  the pace at 
which the output gap was closing over time  and inflation was moving toward 2 percent.   
The actual  real rate has  increased  somewhat  in recent years even as the estimates  of the 
longer‐run equilibrium  rate have  trended down, suggesting  that the stance of  monetary  
policy has become less accommodative.  
The studies  cited above report  substantial  uncertainty  about the longer‐run equilibrium  
real rate.   As the figure illustrates,  the uncertainty  bands around the longer‐run equilibrium  
real rate in  the Johannsen ‐Mertens model are  typically large (as they are in other model 
frameworks)  and, indeed, are  recently the widest they have been during  the period shown.  
The recent increase in uncertainty  arose because,  from the model’s perspective, economic  
conditions  during the Great Recession  and its wake have been extraordinary  and because 
the effective  lower bound limits the information  content of nominal interest rates. 
Uncertainty  about the longer‐run equilibrium  real rate implies ambiguity  about the 
appropriate cumulative rise  in policy rates during the normalization  process.  The risk that 
equilibrium  real rates  going forward could  be lower than  currently  estimated  is especially  
pertinent,  because such a  scenario would increase the  probability  that policy will be 
constrained  by the effective  lower bound  in the future, with adverse  consequen ces for 
macroeconomic  outcomes.

equilibrium  real rate are jointly estimated  using data  up to that  date.  For  the Laubach‐Williams model, the

     1. Starting with the January 2016 Tealbook, this exhibit reports nominal and real federal funds rates on the same 360−day basis as the
published federal funds rate instead of on a compounded 365−day basis.  For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable,the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook outlook" report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook‘s staff outlook, but jumping off from therealized value for the policy rate last quarter.
     2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period in the
FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The "current real federal funds rate" is the
difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four−quarter change in core PCE. The "average projected real federal funds rate"is the average of the real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12−quarter period as the
Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *.

percent, 0.87 percentage point below the estimate of r*.  The panel further reports a 
measure of the current real federal funds rate which, at –0.97 percent, is little changed 
from the December Tealbook.4 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under the Tayl or (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999 ) rule, and a first-
difference rule.  These simulati ons reflect the endogenous responses of inflation and the 
output gap when the federal funds rate follows the paths implie d by the different policy 
rules.5  The results for each rule pres ented in these and subsequent s imulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to  the rule in the future and 
that market participants as well as price and wage setters full y understand the policy rule 
that will be pursued and its implications for real activity and  inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implicati ons of following the baseline 
monetary policy assumptions in the current staff forecast.  The  federal funds rate is 
assumed to follow the prescriptio ns of the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The 
federal funds rate increases a bout 25 basis points per quarter for the next three years, 
reaching about 3¼ percent by the end of 2018.  The pace of tigh tening subsequently 
slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at around 4 percent in 2021—consistent with the 
high projected level of resource ut ilization around that time—b efore eventually returning 
to its longer-run normal level of 3¼ percent. 
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for a sharp tigh tening of policy 
starting this quarter and produce  paths for the real federal fu nds rate that lie significantly 
above the Tealbook baseline path ove r the next few years.  The sharp tightening reflects, 
in part, these rules’ constant i ntercept terms, which are consi stent with an equilibrium 
longer-run real federal funds rate of 1¼ percent.  These rules lead to less pronounced 
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment than the baseline policy in coming 
years.  The Taylor (1999) rule prescribes somewhat higher polic y rates than the 
                                                 
values are identical.  The  reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant 
over the entire 12-quarter perio d whereas, in the Tealbook base line, the real federal funds rate can vary 
over time.  Distinct paths of real  short-term rates can, in tur n, generate different pa ths for inflation and 
economic activity, even if they have the same 12-quarter averag e. 
4 The current real federal funds rate is constructed as the diff erence between the midpoint of the 
prevailing target range for the f ederal funds rate and the trai ling four-quarter change in the core PCE price 
index. 
5 Because of these endogenous res ponses, prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ 
from those shown in the top p anel of the first exhibit.

Taylor (1993) rule over the period shown because it places more  weight on the output 
gap.  As a consequence, the Taylo r (1999) rule also generates a higher trajectory of the 
unemployment rate and a lower tr ajectory of inflation than the Taylor (1993) rule. 
In contrast to the Taylor-type r ules, the first-difference rule  prescribes a pace of 
increases in the federal funds r ate that is similar to the Teal book baseline through 2018.  
At that point, the federal funds rate levels off under the firs t-difference rule whereas it 
keeps rising for a time under the Tealbook baseline.  This dive rgence occurs because the 
first-difference rule, which r esponds to the expected change in  the output gap rather than 
to its level, reacts to the slowe r pace of economic growth proj ected late in the decade.  
The lower path of the federal funds rate in the medium run unde r the first-difference rule, 
in conjunction with expectations of  higher price and wage inflation in the future, leads to 
lower long-term real rates and t hus to higher levels of resource utilization a nd inflation in 
the short run.  The first-diffe rence rule generates outcomes fo r the unemployment rate 
over the forecast period that are markedly below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
and the unemployment rate paths  generated under the other polic y rules.  Relative to the 
other simple policy rules, infla tion runs a bit closer to the C ommittee’s 2 percent longer-
run inflation objective over the n ext few years before overshoo ting the target by a greater 
margin and for a longer time later on. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s outlook with th ose reported in December.  
Policymakers are assumed to plac e equal weights on keeping head line PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent goal, on keeping the unemplo yment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal control that is emp loyed here corresponds to a 
commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to 
constrain future policy choices.6  In contrast with the simple rules discussed above, the 
optimal control policy is cognizan t that headwinds are currentl y putting downward 
pressure on equilibrium real rates. 
Reflecting the modest revision in the staff’s outlook for infla tion and resource 
utilization, the optimal control path for the real federal funds rate is only slightly below 
                                                 
6 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that wou ld be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

the path derived in December .  In the current Tealbook baseline  projection, 
unemployment falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natur al rate over the next 
several years.  Under the preferences embedded in this implemen tation of optimal 
control, policymakers judge this  undershooting of the natural rate to be costly, leading 
them to tighten policy more than in the Tealbook baseline.7  Accordingly, the path for the 
real federal funds rate is alm ost 1 percentage point higher, on  average, than the Tealbook 
baseline path over the period show n.  The trajectory for the re al 10-year Treasury yield, 
shown in the lower-left panel, i s also higher.  The tighter policy under optimal control 
results in a path of the unemploy ment rate that runs substantia lly closer to the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate of  unemployment; headline PCE inflation is also slightly 
lower than in the Tealbook baseli ne over the simulation period,  consistent with lower 
levels of resource  utilization. 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under Alternative Policies” a nd “Outcomes 
under Alternative Polic ies, Quarterly,” ta bulate the simulation  results for key variables 
under the policy rules described earlier. 
                                                 
7 In optimal control, the assumption that policymakers place les s weight on the unemployment gap 
falling below the staff’s estimat e of the natural rate than pos ited under the standard case can result in 
policymakers favoring a more accommodative policy than the Teal book baseline.  See the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of the Octob er 2015 Tealbook B for an illustration.

POLICY  RULES  USED  IN “MONETARY  POLICY  STRATEGIES ”
The table  below  gives  the expressions  for the selected  policy  rules  used  in “Monetary
Policy  Strategies. ” In the table,  Rt denotes  the nominal  federal  funds  rate for quarter  t, while  the 
right-hand-side  variables  include  the staff's  projection  of trailing  four-quarter  core PCE inflation  
for the current  quarter  and three quarters  ahead  $$ (\pi_t  $$  and  $$ \pi_{t+3 \mid t}) $$ , the output  gap estimate  for the 
current  period  (gapt), and the forecast  of the three-quarter-ahead  annual  change  in the output  gap 
($$ \Delta^{4} g a p_{t+3 \mid t} $$ ).1  The value  of policymakers'  longer-run  inflation  objective,  denoted  $$ \pi^{L R} $$, is 2 percent.
1 Starting  with this Tealbook,  all nominal  and real federal  funds  rates  reported  in the Monetary  
Policy  Strategies  section  are expressed  on the same  360-day  basis  as the published  federal  funds  rate. 
Previously,  most  rates  were  expressed  on a compounded  365-day  basis. The change  in methodology  has 
only a marginal  effect  on the reported  values.Taylor (1993) rule $$    R_{t}=r^{L R}+\pi_{t}+0.5\left(\pi_{t}-\pi^{L R}\right)+0.5 gap_{t} $$ Taylor 
(1999) rule $$  R_{t}=r^{L R}+\pi_{t}+0.5\left(\pi_{t}-\pi^{L R}\right)+gap_{t} $$ Inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule $$ R_{t}=0.85 R_{t-1}+0.15\left(r^{L R}+\pi_{t}+0.5\left(\pi_{t}-\pi^{L R}\right)+g a p_{t}\right) $$  First-difference 
rule $$  R_{t}=R_{t-1}+0.5\left(\pi_{t+3 \mid t}-\pi^{L R}\right)+0.5 \Delta^{4} g a p_{t+3 \mid t} $$
The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor  (1993,  1999),  while  the inertial  
version  of the Taylor  (1999)  rule has been featured  prominently  in analysis  by Board  staff. 2 The 
intercepts  of these rules are chosen  so that they are consistent  with a 2 percent  longer-run 
inflation  objective  and a longer-run  real federal  funds  rate, denoted  $$ \r^{L R} $$, of 1 1/4 percent,  a value  
used in the FRB/US  model. The prescriptions  of the first-difference  rule do not depend  on the 
level of the output  gap or the longer-run  real interest  rate; see Orphanides  (2003).
2 See, for example,  Erceg  and others  (2012).Near-term  prescriptions  from  the four policy  rules are calculated  using  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap. For the rules  that include  the lagged  policy  rate as a 
right-hand-side  variable —the inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule and the first-difference  rule—the lines 
labeled  “Previous  Tealbook  outlook ” report  prescriptions  derived  from  the previous  Tealbook  
projections  for inflation  and the output  gap, while  using  the same  lagged  funds  rate value  as in the 
prescriptions  computed  for the current  Tealbook.  When  the Tealbook  is published  early in a 
quarter,  this lagged  funds  rate value  is set equal  to the actual  value  of the lagged  funds  rate in the 
previous  quarter,  and prescriptions  are shown  for the current  quarter.  When  the Tealbook  is 
published  late in a quarter,  the prescriptions  are shown  for the next quarter,  and the lagged  policy  
rate, for each of these rules,  including  those  that use the “Previous  Tealbook  outlook, ” is set equal
Authorized for Public Release
to the average  value  for the policy  rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent  quarter,  these  
rules  use the lagged  values  from  their  simulated,  unconstrained  prescriptions.
REAL  FEDERAL  FUNDS  RATE  ESTIMATES
The bottom  panel  of the exhibit,  “Policy  Rules  and the Staff  Projection, ” provides  an 
estimate  of one notion  of the equilibrium  real federal  funds  rate, r*. This measure  is an estimate  
of the real federal  funds  rate that,  if maintained  over a 12-quarter  period  (beginning  in the current  
quarter),  makes  the output  gap equal  to zero in the final  quarter  of that period  using  the output  
projection  from  FRB/US,  the staff's  large-scale  econometric  model  of the U.S.  economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent  FRB/US  r*” depends  on broad  array  of economic  factors,  some  of which  
take the form  of projected  values  of the model's  exogenous  variables.  It is generated  after  the 
paths  of exogenous  variables  in the FRB/US  model  are adjusted  so that they match  those  in the 
extended  Tealbook  forecast.  Model  simulations  then determine  the value  of the real federal  funds  
rate that closes  the output  gap conditional  on the exogenous  variables  in the extended  baseline  
forecast.
The “current  real federal  funds  rate” reported  in the panel  is constructed  as the difference  
between  the midpoint  of the prevailing  target  range  for the federal  funds  rate and the trailing  four-  
quarter  change  in the core PCE  price  index.
The “average  projected  real federal  funds  rate” reported  in the panel  is the average  of the 
real federal  funds  rate under  the Tealbook  baseline  projection  calculated  over the same  
12-quarter  period  as the Tealbook-consistent  FRB/US  r*. The average  projected  real federal  
funds  rate and r* need  not be associated  with the same  macroeconomic  outcomes  even  when  their 
values  are identical.  The reason  is that, in the r* simulations,  the real federal  funds  rate is held 
constant  over  the entire  12-quarter  period  to close  the output  gap at the end of this timeframe  
whereas,  in the Tealbook  baseline,  the real federal  funds  rate can vary over  time. Distinct  paths  
of real short-term  rates  can, in turn,  generate  different  paths  for inflation  and economic  activity.
FRB/US  MODEL  SIMULATIONS
The exhibits  of “Monetary  Policy  Strategies ” that report  results  from  simulations  of 
alternative  policies  are derived  from  dynamic  simulations  of the FRB/US  model.  Each  simulated  
policy  rule is assumed  to be in force  over the whole  period  covered  by the simulation;  this period  
extends  several  decades  beyond  the time horizon  shown  in the exhibits.  The simulations  are 
conducted  under  the assumption  that market  participants  as well as price  and wage  setters  have  
perfect  foresight,  and are predicated  on the staff's  extended  Tealbook  projection,  which  includes  
the macroeconomic  effects  of the Committee's  large-scale  asset  purchase  programs.  When  the 
Tealbook  is published  early  in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  in that quarter.  However,  
when  the Tealbook  is published  late in a quarter,  all of the simulations  begin  in the subsequent  
quarter.

COMPUTATION  OF THE  OPTIMAL  CONTROL  POLICY  UNDER  COMMITMENT
The optimal  control  simulations  posit  that policymakers  minimize  a discounted  sum of 
weighted  squared  deviations  of four-quarter  headline  PCE inflation  [math] from  the Committee's  
2 percent  objective,  of squared  deviations  of the unemployment  rate from  the staff's  estimate  of 
the natural  rate (this difference  is also known  as the unemployment  rate gap, ugap t), and of 
squared  changes  in the federal  funds  rate. The resulting  loss function,  shown  below,  embeds  the 
assumptions  that policymakers  discount  the future  using  a quarterly  discount  factor  [math]  
and place equal  weights  on squared  deviations  of inflation,  the unemployment  gap, and federal  
funds  rate changes  (that is, [math] ).
[math]
The optimal  control  policy  is the path for the federal  funds  rate that minimizes  the above  
loss function  in the FRB/US  model,  subject  to the effective  lower  bound  constraint  on nominal  
interest  rates,  under  the assumption  of perfect  foresight,  and conditional  on the staff's  extended  
Tealbook  projection.  Policy  tools other  than the federal  funds  rate are taken  as given  and 
subsumed  within  the Tealbook  baseline.  The path chosen  by policymakers  today  is assumed  to 
be credible,  meaning  that decision  makers  in the model  see this path as being  a binding  
commitment  on the future  Committees;  the optimal  control  policy  takes as given  the lagged  value  
of the federal  funds  rate but is otherwise  unconstrained  by policy  decisions  made  prior  to the 
simulation  period. The discounted  losses  are calculated  over a period  that ends sufficiently  far 
into the future  that extending  that period  farther  would  not affect  the policy  prescriptions  shown  
in the exhibits.

Data released during the  intermeeting period show that the labo r market continued 
to improve, with total nonfarm pa yroll employment rising an ave rage 284,000 per month 
in the fourth quarter of 2015; by contrast, spending indicators  suggest that GDP growth 
slowed significantly last quart er.  Part of the slowdown in eco nomic growth appears to 
reflect temporary factors, inclu ding a sizable decline in inven tory investment and 
unseasonably warm weather that reduced households’ consumption of energy services.  
Both core and headline inflati on continued to run below 2 perce nt, and longer-term 
inflation compensation declined further.   
Since the start of the year, global financial market turbulence  intensified in 
reaction to economic and financial  developments in China, resul ting in a tightening of 
financial conditions and a furth er decline in oil prices that added to downward pressure 
on inflation.  Reflecting these developments, the expected path  for the federal funds rate 
flattened over the intermeeti ng period.  The Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and its 
Survey of Market Participants c urrently point to two or three 2 5 basis point increases in 
the federal funds rate this year , compared to three or four inc reases at the time of the 
December meeting.  Most respondents see a negligible probabilit y that the Committee 
will raise the target range for  the federal funds rate in Janua ry and about a 35 percent 
chance that the Committee will raise the target range for the f ederal funds rate in March. 
Against this backdrop, the issues before the Committee as it co nsiders its January 
postmeeting statement include not  only whether to make an adjus tment in the target range 
for the federal funds rate but a lso whether to change its asses sment of the medium-term 
economic outlook or the risks to t hat outlook.  A change in the  outlook or balance of risks 
would likely be read as signali ng a change in the likelihood of  an adjustment to the target 
range in March and possibly thereafter. 
The draft statements presented be low—labeled Alternative A, Alt ernative B, and 
Alternative C—offer different a ssessments of the outlook for in flation, and of the risks 
surrounding the economic outlook, a long with corresponding poli cy choices.  Regarding 
those choices, alternatives A a nd B leave the current target ra nge for the federal funds 
rate unchanged.  Alternative B is  meant to indicate that the Co mmittee will continue to 
assess the implication of incoming information for the economic  outlook and thus for 
appropriate monetary policy, and that the Committee does not ye t have a strong

predisposition regarding its de cision at the March meeting.  By  noting downside risks to 
the outlook and the Committee’s expectation for inflation to re main below 2 percent for 
longer than previously projecte d, Alternative A signals that a near-term increase in the 
target range is unlikely.  Altern ative C raises the target rang e for the federal funds rate to 
½ to ¾ percent, emphasizing the ong oing improvement in the labo r market as well as the 
lag with which policy actions affect future outcomes.1 
With regard to the labor marke t, Alternatives B and C both characterize job gains 
as strong and note that labor market conditions improved furthe r.  Alternative B refers to 
“some additional decline in unde rutilization of labor resources ,” while instead Alternative 
C refers to “some additional in crease in utilization of labor r esources.”  Both alternatives 
note that economic growth slowe d late last year, with Alternati ve C more explicitly 
pointing to temporary factors as  part of the explanation for th is slowdown.  Alternative A 
puts more emphasis on the slowdown in economic growth than on the improvement in 
labor markets and omits any referen ce to a change in the utiliz ation of labor resources.  
All three alternatives indicate the Committee’s expectation that, with gradual adjustments 
in policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and  labor market indicators 
will continue to strengthen. 
All three of the draft statements acknowledge that inflation ha s continued to run 
below the Committee’s objective, that measures of inflation compensation declined 
further, and that survey-based m easures of longer-term inflatio n expectations are little 
changed, on balance, in recent months.  With respect to the out look for inflation, all three 
alternatives state that inflation is expected to remain low in the near term in part due to 
further declines in energy pri ces.  Both Alternatives A and B s ay that inflation is expected 
to rise to 2 percent over the medium term with Alternative A ad ding that inflation is 
anticipated to remain below 2 per cent longer than the Committee  previously projected.   
Alternatives B and C reaffirm Dece mber’s statement that the ris ks to the outlook 
for economic activity and the labor market are balanced.  Alternative B offers the 
cautionary note that the Committ ee “is closely monitoring global economic and financial 
developments and assessing their i mplications for the labor mar ket and inflation.”  In lieu 
of this sentence, alternative C indicates only that the Committ ee is monitoring global 
1 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in the dr aft statement for Alternative C as 
premature in present circumstan ces but might nonetheless discus s whether this language, especially 
paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, would be appropriate when the time arri ves to next raise the target range for the 
federal funds rate again.

economic and financial developm ents.  In addition, with respect  to inflation, Alternative 
C takes a different approach by stating that “the Committee rem ains reasonably confident 
that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term,” an d by retaining the sentence 
from the December statement that says “the Committee continues to monitor inflation 
developments closely.”  Alterna tive A characterizes the risks t o the outlook for the labor 
market and inflation as “tilted t o the downside” in light of gl obal economic and financial 
developments and also offers the option to characterize them as  “tilted slightly to the 
downside.” 
The three alternatives retain the December statement’s language  that “the 
Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a man ner that will warrant 
only gradual increases in the f ederal funds rate” and that the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain below its longer-run level “ for some time.”  The three a lternatives also retain the 
December statement’s language tha t the Committee anticipates co ntinuing to reinvest 
until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate “is well under way.”

would be issued if the Committee de cides either to maintain the  current setting of the 
target range for the federal f unds rate, as in Alternative A an d Alternative B, or instead 
decides to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate, a s in Alternative C.  Regardless 
of the Committee’s choice of polic y alternative, and as in Dece mber, the implementation

DECEMBER 2015 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in October 
suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderat e pace.  Household 
spending and business fixed invest ment have been increasing at solid rates in recent 
months, and the housing sector has  improved further; however, net exports have been 
soft.  A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and 
declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that 
underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year.  
Inflation has continued to run be low the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, 
partly reflecting declines in e nergy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  
Market-based measures of infla tion compensation remain low; some survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflati on expectations  have edged down. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee currently expect s that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will continue to 
expand at a moderate pace and lab or market indicators will cont inue to strengthen.  
Overall, taking into account dom estic and international develop ments, the Committee 
sees the risks to the outlook f or both economic activity and th e labor market as 
balanced.  Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the 
transitory effects of declines i n energy and import prices diss ipate and the labor 
market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor  inflation 
developments closely. 
3. The Committee judges that there  has been considerable improvement in labor market 
conditions this year, and it is r easonably confident that infla tion will rise, over the 
medium term, to its 2 percent obj ective.  Given the economic ou tlook, and 
recognizing the time it takes fo r policy actions to affect futu re economic outcomes, 
the Committee decided to raise the  target range for the federal  funds rate to ¼ to ½ 
percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative a fter this increase, 
thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditio ns and a return to 2 
percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases

ALTERNATIVE A FOR JANUARY 2016 FOMC 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in October 
December suggests that the pace of expansion in economic activity has been 
expanding at a moderate pace slowed late last year .  Household spending and 
business fixed investment have been increasing at solid moderate  rates in recent 
months, and the housing sector has  improved further; however, net exports have been 
soft and inventory investment slowed.  A range of recent labor market indicators, 
including ongoing job gains, and declining unemployment, shows further 
improvement and confirms that unde rutilization of labor resourc es has diminished 
appreciably since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run o bjective, partly reflecting d eclines in energy 
prices and in prices of non-ener gy imports.  Market-based measu res of inflation 
compensation remain low declined further ; some survey-based measures of longer-
term inflation expecta tions have edged down are little changed, on balance, in 
recent months .

employment and price stability. T he Committee currently expects  that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will continue to 
expand at a moderate pace and lab or market indicators will cont inue to strengthen. 
Overall, taking into account dom estic and international develop ments, the Committee 
sees the risks to the outlook f or both economic activity and th e labor market as 
balanced. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of 
the further declines in energy prices, but to  rise to 2 percent over the medium term 
as the transitory effects of d eclines in energy and import pric es dissipate and the labor 
market strengthens further. In light of recent global economic and financial 
developments, the Committee sees t he risks to the outlook for t he labor market 
and inflation as tilted [ slightly ] to the downside.   The Committee continues to

Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may see the available information as suggesting th at slow growth 
will not persist, and that the m odal outlook is still that econ omic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace going forward, with t he labor market continuing to strengthen.  But the 
contrast between recent labor market reports and spending indic ators may have increased 
policymakers’ uncertainty about the outlook for the real econom y.  If so, they may want 
to assess the implications of the two labor market reports and the additional spending data 
that will be released over the coming intermeeting period befor e judging whether the 
medium-term outlook for the e conomy has changed enough to warra nt a different path 
for monetary policy than was conveyed by December’s postmeeting  statement and 
Summary of Economic Projections .  Policymakers may also view th e heightened global 
financial turmoil and associate d tightening in financial condit ions as potentially posing 
more substantial downside risk s to their modal outlook, and the y might want to see 
whether these tighter financial  conditions change further over the coming intermeeting 
period.  For these reasons, partic ipants may deem it appropriat e to adopt a stance of 
watchful waiting and to abstain from signaling a likely next po licy move.  If so, they may 
choose to issue a statement like Alternative B that maintains t he current target range for 
the federal funds rate, leaves the language about the likely fu ture path of the federal funds 
rate unchanged, and reaffirms the Committee’s medium-run outloo k while 
acknowledging concerns about global and financial developments. 
Policymakers may continue to expect that inflation will rise to  2 percent over the 
medium term, once energy and non-en ergy import prices stabilize  and resource utilization 
tightens further, provided that longer-term inflation expectati ons remain stable, even if 
they judge that the additional  declines in oil prices and the a ppreciation of the dollar will 
push inflation lower i n the near term and that headline inflati on is likely to remain below 
2 percent for longer than they previously anticipated.  Nonethe less, policymakers may see 
recent global and economic developments as potentially posing d ownside risks to their 
medium-term inflation outlook.  F or this reason, too, they may favor the new language in 
Alternative B, which indicates t hat the Committee is closely mo nitoring and assessing 
implications of these developmen ts for the labor market and inf lation. 
Some participants may judge that the recent tightening in finan cial conditions and 
heightened risks from abroad m ake it unlikely that an increase in the target range will be 
appropriate in March.  Or they ma y view the low sensitivity of inflation to resource 
utilization as requiring a period of unemployment well below it s longer-run normal rate

to ensure a return of inflation to the Committee’s longer-run g oal over the medium run.  
Nevertheless, they may think it is  premature to signal a pause in tightening, because of 
the strong ongoing job gains along w ith continued improvement i n a broad range of labor 
market indicators.  Moreover, the y may take some reassurance fr om the observation that 
longer-term inflation expectations from th e Michigan Surveys of  Consumers edged up 
recently, while the measure from the Survey of Primary Dealers remained stable.  They 
may also prefer to wait and monitor global economic and financi al developments over the 
coming intermeeting period. 
Other policymakers may place lit tle weight on the recent softness in GDP growth; 
they may deem it likely that the economic expansion will prove resilient, bolstered by 
solid consumption growth.  This expansion will help drive continued improvement in the 
utilization of labor resources t hat, together with stable longe r-run inflation expectations, 
should move inflation back to 2 per cent over the medium term.  If so, these policymakers 
may lean toward an immediate furth er increase in the target range for the federal funds 
rate.  But with both headline and core inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, with recent dollar appreciation  and declines in crude oil 
prices implying that inflation w ill remain low in the near term , and with global economic 
and financial developments poten tially posing larger downside risks to the economic 
outlook, these policymakers may pr efer to keep their options op en, and to monitor 
economic data a little longer be fore deciding when and whether to adjust the target range 
for the federal funds rate.  Mor eover, they may judge the langu age in Alternative B that 
points to “gradual” increases i n the federal funds rate as prop erly tempered by the 
statement that the funds rate path “will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.”  If so, these policymakers may see Alternative B as providing the 
flexibility for the expected funds rate path to steepen, if the data indicate stronger momentum in the economy. 
A statement along the lines of tha t in Alternative B would like ly be in line with 
the expectations of financial mar ket participants .  According t o the Desk’s latest survey, 
respondents perceive there to be almost no chance that the Comm ittee will change the 
current target range at this m eeting, and most respondents expe ct little change in the 
language concerning the likely fut ure path of the federal funds  rate or reinvestment 
policy.  Some survey participants responded that the statement may indicate that 
downside risks to the outlook have increased, and thus they may  not be too surprised by 
the new language in Alternative B  indicating that the Committee  is closely monitoring 
recent global economic and financial developments and assessing  their implications for 
Alternatives

the labor market and inflation.  Accordingly, if the Committee issued a statement like that 
in Alternative B, the  response of longer-term interest rates, e quity prices, and the foreign 
exchange value of the dollar might be muted, although the heigh tened volatility in 
financial markets observed in re cent weeks suggests one should not have great 
confidence in this assessment. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Both core and headline inflati on have run below 2 percent for several years, and 
renewed declines in oil and othe r commodity prices, along with further downward 
pressure on non-commodity import prices stemming from the addit ional appreciation of 
the dollar, suggest that headline inflation will linger at very low levels well into 2016.  
Some policymakers may see substa ntial risk that longer-term inf lation expectations will 
slide lower and that actual inflation will not rise to 2 percen t over the medium term. 
They might note that the staff and FOMC participants have consistently overpredicted 
inflation in recent years. Policymakers may judge that it is m ore likely that real GDP 
growth will fall short of potenti al growth this year in light o f the disappointing spending 
data for the fourth quarter, the  appreciation of the dollar, and a weaker foreign outlook.  
Accordingly, they may judge that the neutral rate of interest h as declined.  Moreover, 
they may view the likelihood that turmoil in China exerts a sub stantial drag on U.S. 
economic activity as having risen sharply over the intermeeting  period.   
These policymakers might also note  that the Michigan Survey measure of longer-
term inflation expectations rem ains near the lower end of its r ange in recent years, and 
that market-based measures of inflation compensation have been at low levels for so long 
that it is hard to believe that  these declines are entirely due to liquidity and risk 
premiums.  They might point to the global disinflationary press ures that seem prevalent at 
the moment as well as wage ga ins that remain subdued, and view the relationship 
between inflation and aggregate  demand as too weak to generate much upward pressure 
on inflation without a substanti al period of very high resource  utilization.  These 
observations may lead some partic ipants to conclude that there is little reason to be 
confident that inflation will return to 2 percent if the Commit tee raises interest rates in the 
near future.  Moreover, these pol icymakers might argue that the  chronic failure to get 
inflation moving up has put at risk t he credibility of the FOMC ’s commitment to 
achieving 2 percent inflation.  The y might therefore prefer Alt ernative A, which 
maintains the current target ran ge for the federal funds rate, signals that an increase in 
Alternatives

this range is unlikely at the March FOMC meeting and possibly f or some time thereafter, 
and indicates that the risks to the labor market and inflation are tilted to the downside. 
Participants might favor including language that indicates that  the risks are tilted 
to the downside in light of recent global financial market turm oil and deteriorating 
confidence among market particip ants in the ability of Chinese authorities to ensure a 
smooth transition to slower and mor e sustainable growth there.  Accordingly, they may 
see the alternative scenarios “China-Driven EME Crisis” or “Str onger Dollar and Low 
Oil Prices” in the “Risks and U ncertainty” s ection of Tealbook A as increasingly likely.  
If either scenario plays out, policymakers may judge that the F ederal Reserve will need to 
provide greater policy accommoda tion in order to offset the likely adverse effects on the 
domestic economy.  Moreover, giv en the proximity of the effective lower bound and the 
associated asymmetric risks t o U.S. activity and inflation, the y may prefer to signal a 
delay in the removal of po licy accommodation based on risk mana gement considerations. 
Although some respondents in the D esk’s latest survey expected the statement to 
reflect greater downside risks to the economic outlook, a state ment like that in 
Alternative A would likely surpr ise many financial market parti cipants.  Investors might 
push further into the future the expected date of the next rate  increase and a flattening of 
the expected path for the feder al fund rate is also possible.  Longer-term yields would 
decline, inflation compensation and equity price s would rise, a nd the dollar would 
depreciate.  However, if investor s read the statement as reflec ting a downbeat assessment 
of global economic conditions, e quity prices and  inflation comp ensation could possibly 
fall.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may judge that the economy is at or near maximum s ustainable 
employment and that the breadth of  improvement in the labor mar ket in recent months 
confirms that the economy is st rong and likely to be resilient.   Although spending 
indicators suggest that GDP gr owth slowed in the fourth quarter , policymakers may 
conclude that the slowdown largely reflects temporary factors related to inventories and 
the effects of unseasonably warm weather on the consumption of energy services.  More 
broadly, they may judge that cond itions remain favorable for so lid consumption growth, 
as household balance sheets have i mproved, gains in disposable income have been 
healthy, gasoline prices are low , consumer confidence is high, and job prospects are

good.  Moreover, these strong fundamentals should help limit any negative spillover 
effects from weaker  activity abroad. 
Although headline inflation is lo w, participants may point out that some measures 
of the underlying trend in inflati on, such as the 12-month trim med mean PCE inflation 
rate calculated by the Dallas Fed, are running not that far bel ow 2 percent.  They might 
judge that downward pressures on inflation from the appreciatio n of the dollar and the 
decline in non-oil im port prices are restraining core as well as headline inflation, and that 
this restraint is likely to fad e in the near term.  Participant s may also be less concerned by 
the recent declines in longer-term inflation compensation becau se they judge that these 
declines reflect movements in liquidity and risk premiums unrel ated to inflation 
expectations.  Moreover, they m ay attribute the softening over 2015 in the median 
Michigan Survey respondent’s e xpectation of average inflation o ver the coming five or 
ten years to the transitory eff ects of the declines in energy p rices rather than a reduction 
in expected inflation over the longer run.  Participants may also expect headline inflation 
to move back to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the me dium term as energy 
prices bottom out. 
For these reasons, policymakers may judge that it is appropriate to announce a 
25 basis point increase in the tar get range for the federal fun ds rate to ½ to ¾ percent, as 
in Alternative C.  Policymakers may note that, even with this increase, the real federal 
funds rate would still lie well  below the Tealbook-consistent e stimate of the equilibrium 
real federal funds rate reported in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook 
B.  A rate increase would also be c onsistent with  the level of the federal funds rate 
prescribed by the optimal control policy reported there. 
These policymakers might further  argue that leaving rates uncha nged in the face 
of rapid job growth and when the  unemployment rate is already a t a level consistent with 
maximum employment would likely foster expectations of a prolon ged, unconditionally 
shallow path for the f ederal funds rate, cre ating incipient exc ess demand.  Leaving the 
stance of monetary policy unchanged thus runs the risk that inf lation will pe rsistently 
overshoot 2 percent, eliciting an upward drift in inflation exp ectations, possibly along the 
lines of the alternative scenari o “Faster Growth with Higher In flation” in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Teal book A.  In addition, such an expec ted path could induce 
further “reaching for yield,” and e xcessive risk-taking behavio r in financial markets.  
Some policymakers might also be co ncerned that a statement like  Alternative B risks 
Alternatives

sending the signal that the Com mittee is reacting to financial volatility rather than to its 
medium-term outlook for the labor market and inflation. 
According to the Desk’s latest survey, the perceived probability of a tightening at 
this meeting is negligible, and a decision to increase the targ et range at this meeting 
would be very surprising.  Acco rdingly, it is difficult to pred ict how markets might react.  
If market participants infer tha t “gradualism” implies that the  Committee intends to 
tighten at each successive meeting this year and thus pursue a much less accommodative 
stance of policy going forward tha n had been expected, then med ium- and longer-term 
real interest rates would ri se, equity prices and inflation com pensation would likely 
decline, and the dollar would appreciate.  However, if investor s see a statement like 
Alternative C as reflecting an upbeat assessment for global economic conditions, then 
equity prices and inflation compe nsation might fall less than o therwise, or even rise.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
Drafts of the implementation not e that would be issued for the drafts of the 
alternative statements follows.  If the Committee decides to maintain the current target 
range for the federal funds rate,  as in Alternative A or Altern ative B, an implementation 
note that indicates no change in the  Federal Reserve’s administered rates—the interest 
rates on required and excess reserves, the ON RRP offered rate,  and the discount rate— 
would be issued.  If the Committee instead decides to raise the target range for the federal 
funds rate, as in Alternative C , an implementation note that co mmunicates the changes 
the Federal Reserve decided to m ake to these three policy tools  would be issued. 
Regardless of which policy alternative the Committee adopts, th e implementation 
note issued in January will cont ain two minor changes relative to the note that was issued 
in December.  First, the footnote stating that the new directiv e “supersedes the resolution 
on overnight reverse repurchase ag reement (ON RRP) test operations approved by the 
Committee at its December 16–7, 2014 meeting” will be dropped b ecause this 
information was relevant only at the commencement of policy fir ming in December, 
when the testing phase of ON RRP  operations ceased.  Second, th e reference in the 
directive to “the resoluti on on term RRP operations approved by  the Committee at its 
March 17–18, 2015, meeting” will be dropped because that resolu tion has expired.1  The 
Committee may discuss its plans for conducting future term RRP operations at the 
January meeting; text could be adde d to the directive in March regarding the conduct of 
future term RRP operations, such as if the Committee decides to  offer them at March 
quarter-end.2 
On the following pages, struck- out text indicates language dele ted from the

(1) overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurc hase operations 
with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommod ate weekend, 
holiday, or similar trading conve ntions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in 
amounts limited only by the value of  Treasury securities held o utright in the

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has developed a projection of the Federal Reserve’s b alance sheet and 
income statement that is consistent with the monetary policy assumptions incorporated in 
the staff’s forecast presented in Tealbook A.  We assume that r einvestments of maturing 
Treasury securities and agency de bt as well as principal receiv ed on agency MBS will 
cease at the end of 2016, about two quarters later than posited  in the December Tealbook, 
and when the federal funds rat e is projected t o reach about 1½ percent in the staff 
forecast.  Once reinvestments cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks through redemptions of 
maturing Treasury and agency debt  securities as well as paydowns of principal from 
agency MBS.  Regarding the Feder al Reserve’s use of its policy normalization tools, we 
assume that the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreement s (ON RRPs) runs at 
$100 billion through the end of 2018 and then declines, reachin g zero by the end of 2019, 
and that term deposits and term RRPs are not used during the no rmalization period.1,2 
The bullets below highlight som e key features of the projection s for the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet and income statement under these assump tions. 
 Balance sheet. As shown in the exhibit “Total A ssets and Selected Balance Shee t 
Items” and in the table that follows, the size of the portfolio  is normalized in the 
fourth quarter of 2021, about a quarter  later than projected in the December 
Tealbook, reflecting the later cessation of reinvestment assume d in this 
projection.3  Once reserve balances reach the ir steady-state level, total a ssets stand 
1 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the overall size of the balance sheet. 
2 We also assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and international accounts remain 
around their December 31, 2015 level of $238 billion throughout  the projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend, which is determ ined largely by currency in circulation and a 
projected steady-state level of r eserve balances. The projected  timing of the normalization of the size of the 
balance sheet depends importantly  on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct monetary 
policy; currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $100 billion. However, ongoing regulatory 
and structural changes  could lead to a higher demand for reserv e balances in the new steady state.  In turn, 
a higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all els e equal, imply an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a $500 billion s teady-state level of r eserve balances, the 
balance sheet would likely normalize at the end of 2020.  Alternatively, a lower assumed steady-state level

at $2.4 trillion, with about $2.2 tri llion in total SOMA securi ties holdings.  Total 
assets and SOMA holdings increas e thereafter, keeping pace with  the growth in 
both Federal Reserve notes in cir culation and Feder al Reserve B ank capital.4 
 Federal Reserve earnings remittances. The exhibit “Income Projections” shows 
the implications of the balance sheet projection and interest r ate assumptions for 
Federal Reserve income.5  After record remittances in 2015, including estimated 
payments of $98 billion in net income and $19 billion in a tran sfer of surplus, 
remittances to the Treasury are projected to be about $80 billi on this year.6 
Subsequently, annual remittances diminish to a trough of roughl y $33 billion in 
2019, with no recorded d eferred asset.7  The Federal Reserve’s cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 are about $1.1 trillion.  
 Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the portfolio was in an 
unrealized gain position of a bout $106 billion as of the end of  December.8  The 
unrealized gain or loss position of  the SOMA portfolio going fo rward will depend 
importantly on the path of interest rates.  Because of the assu med rise in longer-
term interest rates over the ne xt several years, the position is projected to shift to 
an unrealized loss w ithin the next 6 months, and then to record a peak unrealized 
loss of about $254 billion in mid-2019, about $10 billion large r than the peak in 
of reserve balances, such as $1 0 billion, would induce a delay in the projected norma lization of the balance 
sheet until the first quarter of 2022. 
4 We now assume that capital paid-in will grow at an annual rate  of 5½ percent, whereas in the 
December Tealbook our assumption was for a 12½ percent growth r ate.  Our revised assumption is more in 
line with the average pace of i ncrease in recent years. 
5 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balanc es will average about 15 basis 
points above the effective federa l funds rate and the ON RRP ra te will average about 10 basis points below 
the effective federal funds rate.  
6 The Fixing America’s Surface Tr ansportation Act signed on Dece mber 4, 2015, permanently 
reduces the Federal Reserve’s capital surplus account from its previous level of $29 billion to a maximum 
of $10 billion.  In addition, it adjusts the dividends paid by the Federal Reserve to large member depository 
institutions on their capital paid -in from a 6 percent rate to the smaller of 6 percent and the rate on the most 
recently auctioned 10-year Treas ury security.  For reference, l arge depository institutions are defined as 
those with total assets above $1 0 billion, and account for abou t $27 billion of the overall $29 billion of total 
capital paid-in. 
7 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset for int erest on Federal Reserve notes would be 
recorded. 
8 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the quarter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at

the December Tealbook.  At that time, almost $105 billion of th e unrealized 
losses will be attributable t o the portfolio of Treasury securi ties and $149 billion 
to the portfolio of agency MBS.  T he unrealized loss position then narrows 
through 2025, as the value of securities acquired under the lar ge-scale asset 
purchase programs returns to par when these securities approach  maturity and 
then mature, and new securities ar e added to the portfolio at p revailing market 
yields. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” t he Federal Reserve’s elevated stock of longer-
term securities is estimated t o hold down the term premium embe dded in the 
10-year Treasury yield by 111 basis points in the current quarter.  Over the next 
couple of years, the estimated t erm premium effect diminishes a t a pace of about 
4 basis points per quarter, refl ecting in part the projected sh rinking of the 
portfolio.  The path for the term premium effects in this proje ction is slightly 
more negative than in the December Tealbook.  The shift reflect s our assumption 
that reinvestment will end two qua rters later, which implies that SOMA securities 
holdings will remain eleva ted for a bit longer. 
 SOMA Characteristics.   The exhibit “Projections f or the Characteristics of 
SOMA Holdings” shows that under the staff baseline balance shee t assumptions, 
approximately $1.4 trillion in SOMA Treasury holdings will matu re between 
2016 and 2020, with the amounts matu ring varying considerably f rom month to 
month.  While projected MBS paydowns  are considerably smoother than Treasury 
maturities, realized MBS paydowns will reflect the evolution of interest rates and other factors over time and thus  could be significantly more vo latile than the 
projected MBS paydowns.
9  In 2016, the $216 billion of maturing Treasury 
securities in the SOMA portfolio are assumed to be reinvested i n notes and 
bonds.10  By the end of 2016, the weighted-av erage duration of SOMA Treasury 
9 The Board’s balance sheet and income projections now use a staff MBS prepayment model 
instead of the Bl ackRock prepayment model used in the December and earlier Tealbooks.  For reference, 
the staff MBS prepayment model was already used in the context of the “Confidence Inte rval Projections of 
the Balance Sheet” boxes in the  September and December Tealbook s. With this model, the stock of agency 
MBS is now projected to be higher, as prepayments towards the e nd of the forecast pe riod are expected to 
be slower than previously predicted.

holdings decreases by about four mon ths from its current level of 6½ years.11 
Thereafter, reflecting the end of  reinvestment as well as the a ging of the portfolio, 
the weighted-average duration declines through 2017, and then it rebounds until 
2021, when the size of the balance sheet is normalized.  Afterw ards, the duration 
of the SOMA portfolio of Treasur y securities is projected to re sume its decline as 
the Desk starts purchasing secu rities to keep pace with currenc y growth.  This 
projection is based on the key assu mption that the Federal Rese rve will buy only 
bills until those holdings are equal to approximately 30 percen t of the Treasury 
portfolio, similar to the pre-c risis composition of the portfol io (currently there are 
no Treasury bill holdings).  Thereafter, purchases are assumed to be spread across 
the Treasury maturity spectrum. 
placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the value of  holdings maturing on the issue date of a 
newly issued security.  Moreover,  across the various maturities , these bids are placed proportionately to the 
issue amounts of the new securities. The Desk’s bids at Treasur y auctions are placed as noncompetitive 
tenders and are treated as add-ons  to announced auction sizes. 
11 The July 2015 Tealbook B box “History and Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA 
Treasury Holdings” provides more information on the duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio.
