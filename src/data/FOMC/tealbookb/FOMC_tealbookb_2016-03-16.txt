The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for real activity a nd inflation in the near term, s hown in the middle panels.  
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for sizable adju stments in the policy rate 
to values of about 2¾ percent by the third quarter of 2016, whi le the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule, which places a cons iderable weight on keeping the federal funds rate close to 
its previous quarterly value, calls for raising the policy rate  to just under 1¼ percent over 
the same period.  The first-differe nce rule prescribes more mod erate increases in the level 
of the federal funds rate to just above the current target rang e, as it also places 
considerable weight on the lagged federal funds rate.  Reflecti ng the upward revision to 
the projected path for infla tion over 2016, the Taylor rules’ prescriptions are higher than 
those reported in the January Tealbook.  The first-difference r ule is revised up only 
slightly—calling for a policy rate by the third quarter of 2016  that is similar to the one 
computed using the January Tealbook outlook—because its forward -looking nature 
means that it is less sensitive to this revision in the near-te rm outlook for inflation. 
The bottom panel of the first e xhibit reports the estimate of a  Tealbook-consistent, 
medium-term notion of the equilib rium real federal funds rate t hat is generated using the 
FRB/US model.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  is an estimate of the real federal 
funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would close the output gap in the 
final quarter of that period.  T he current estimate of r*, at 1.33 percent, is almost 
unchanged from the estimate derived from the staff’s outlook in  January.  The panel also 
reports the average of the real federal funds rate in the Tealb ook baseline projection for 
the same 12-quarter period used to compute r*.2  This average is 0.41 percent,  
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules, and also describes the 
nominal income targeting rule that is used in the special exhib it.   
2 While r* and the average projected real f ederal funds rate are calculat ed over the same 
12-quarter period, they need not  be associated with the same ma croeconomic outcomes even when their 
values are identical.  The  reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant 
over the entire 12-quarter perio d, whereas in the Tealbook base line, the real federal funds rate can vary

report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook‘s staff outlook, but jumping off from the realized value for the
policy rate last quarter.
     2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter
period in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The "current real federal
funds rate" is the difference between the federal funds rate and the trailing four−quarter change in core PCE. The "average
projected real federal funds rate" is the average of the real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection
calculated over the same 12−quarter period as the Tealbook FRB/US r*.

   about 1 percentage point below the estimate of r*.  The panel further reports a measure of 
the current real federal funds  rate which, at –1 percent, is li ttle changed from the January 
Tealbook.3 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under the Tayl or (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999 ) rule, and a first-
difference rule.  These simulati ons reflect the endogenous responses of inflation and the 
output gap when the federal funds rate follows the paths implie d by the different policy 
rules.4  The results for each rule pres ented in these and subsequent s imulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to  the rule in the future and 
that market participants as well as price and wage setters full y understand the policy rule 
that will be pursued and its implications for real activity and  inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implicati ons of following the baseline 
monetary policy assumptions in the current staff forecast.  The  federal funds rate is 
assumed to follow the prescriptio ns of the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  The 
nominal federal funds rate in creases about 25 basis points per quarter for the next three 
years, reaching about 3¼ percent by the end of 2018.  The pace of tightening 
subsequently slows, and the fed eral funds rate peaks at around 4 percent in 2021—
consistent with the higher projec ted level of resource utilizat ion around that time—before 
eventually returning to its longer-run normal level of 3¼ perce nt. 
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate  sharp tightening 
and produce paths for the real fed eral funds rate that lie sign ificantly above the Tealbook 
baseline path over the next few y ears.  The sharp tightening mo stly reflects these rules’ 
intercept terms, which are consistent with an equilibrium longe r-run real federal funds 
rate of 1¼ percent.  These rules lead to higher trajectories of  the unemployment rate 
relative to its path under the ba seline projecti on through at l east the end of 2019.  The 
Taylor (1999) rule prescribes s omewhat higher policy rates than  the Taylor (1993) rule 
over the period shown because it places more weight on the outp ut gap.  As a 
                                                 
over time.  Distinct paths of real  short-term rates can, in tur n, generate different pa ths for inflation and 
economic activity, even if they have the same 12-quarter averag e. 
3 The current real federal funds rate is constructed as the diff erence between the midpoint of the 
prevailing target range for the f ederal funds rate and the trai ling four-quarter change in the core PCE price 
index. 
4 Because of these endogenous res ponses, prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ 
from those shown in the top p anel of the first exhibit.

Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of the tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline

   consequence, the Taylor (1999) r ule also generates a higher trajectory of the 
unemployment rate and a slightly lower tra jectory of inflation than the Taylor (1993) 
rule. 
In contrast to the Taylor-type r ules, the first-difference rule  prescribes a pace of 
increase in the federal funds rat e that is similar to the Tealb ook baseline through 2018.  
At that point, the federal funds rate levels off under the firs t-difference rule, whereas it 
keeps rising for a time under the Tealbook baseline.  This dive rgence occurs because the 
first-difference rule, which r esponds to the expected change in  the output gap rather than 
to its level, reacts to the slowe r pace of economic growth proj ected late in the decade.  
The lower path of the federal funds rate in the medium run unde r the first-difference rule, 
in conjunction with expectations of  higher price and wage inflation in the future, leads to 
lower long-term real rates and t hus to higher levels of resource utilization a nd inflation in 
the short run.  The first-diffe rence rule generates outcomes fo r the unemployment rate 
over the forecast period that are markedly below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
and the unemployment rate paths  generated under the other polic y rules.  Relative to the 
other simple policy rules, under th is rule inflation runs a bit  closer to the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run inflation objective over the next few year s before overshooting the 
target by a modest margin. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s outlook with th ose reported in January.  
Policymakers are assumed to plac e equal weights on keeping head line PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent goal, on keeping the unemplo yment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal control that is emp loyed here corresponds to a 
commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to 
constrain future policy choices.5   
The optimal control path for the  real federal f unds rate is sig nificantly higher than 
the path in the Tealbook outlook.  I n the current baseline proj ection, unemployment falls 
well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the ne xt several years.  Under the 
                                                 
5 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that wou ld be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

   preferences embedded in the sta ndard implementation of optimal control, policymakers 
judge this undershooting of the na tural rate to be costly, lead ing them to tighten policy 
more than in the Tealbook baseline.6  Accordingly, the path for the real federal funds rate 
is almost 1 percentage point high er, on average, than the Tealb ook baseline path over the 
period shown.  The trajectory for  the real 10-year Treasury yie ld is also higher.  The 
tighter policy under optimal contro l results in a path of the unemployment rate that runs 
substantially closer to the sta ff’s estimate of the natural rat e of unemployment; headline 
PCE inflation is slightly lower than in the Tealbook baseline o ver the simulation period, 
consistent with lower levels of resource utilization. 
Relative to the optimal control path shown in the January Tealbook, the path for 
the real federal funds rate is s omewhat higher over the period shown but the real 10-year 
Treasury yield is lower over the next few years, due to the rev ised outlook for term 
premiums in the current Teal book baseline projection.  On net, this leads to a lower path 
for the unemployment rate, although it is important to note tha t the staff’s downward 
revision to the estimated natural rate of unemployment, as well  as the upward revision to 
near-term inflation, dampen the l oss associated with this lower trajectory.  
NOMINAL INCOME TARGETING RULES  
With the federal funds rate ne ar its effective lower bound (ELB ) and lingering 
concerns about the outlook for global economic growth, the Comm ittee may wish to 
examine possible ways to deliver additional monetary stimulus s o as to insure against 
adverse macroeconomic outcomes.  This special exhibit uses the FRB/US model to 
explore the implications of nomina l income (NI) targeting rules—in which monetary 
policy reacts to the ga p between the level of actual nominal GD P and some 
predetermined level—under both th e staff’s baseline outlook and  a recession scenario.  
Even when the current policy ra te is constrained by the ELB, NI  targeting, which 
promises to make up for cumulative past undershooting of nomina l income growth, can 
stimulate current economic ac tivity by generating a lower expec ted path for the federal 
funds rate. 
                                                 
6 In optimal control, the assumption that policymakers place les s weight on the unemployment gap 
falling below the staff’s estimat e of the natural rate than pos ited under the standard case can result in 
policymakers favoring a more accommodative policy than the Teal book baseline.  See the Monetary Policy 
Strategies section of the Octob er 2015 Tealbook B for an illustration of such a scenario.

   The amount of stimulus that NI targeting delivers depends impor tantly on the 
target path for nominal income and, in particular, on the initi al shortfall in nominal 
income that policymakers seek to offset.  To illustrate this pr operty, we use an NI 
targeting rule that targets a  path for the level of nominal inc ome anchored in 2015:Q4, 
and thus effectively only promises  to make up for current and f uture shortfalls in nominal 
income.  We compare macroeconomic outcomes under this rule with  outcomes associated 
with an NI targeting rule that seeks to make up for the cumulat ive shortfall in nominal 
income growth since 2011:Q4, just before the Committee announce d its 2 percent 
inflation objective.  Under both r ules, target nominal income g rows at a rate consistent 
with the Committee’s  2 percent inflation t arget and the staff’s estimate of the path of real 
potential output; as a result , the 2011:Q4 NI targeting rule in herits a nominal income 
shortfall of about 2¾ percent th at is due to inflation having run below the Committee’s 
inflation objective.7 
The panels on the left column of  the fourth exhibit, “Nominal I ncome (NI) 
Targeting,” show the effects  of following the 2011:Q4 and 2015: Q4 NI targeting rules 
conditional on the staff’s baseline outlook from the January 2016 Tealbook.  The nominal 
federal funds rate prescribe d by the 2015:Q4 NI targeting rule (the green line) tracks the 
Tealbook baseline (the black line)  projection closely over the first two years of the 
simulation, but is lower in later  years.  As a consequence, the  path for the unemployment 
rate is slightly lower under this NI targeting rule than under the baseline, b ut overall the 
effects of the two policies ar e quite similar.  The 2011:Q4 NI targeting rule ( the blue line) 
is significantly more accommodativ e because it inherits a large  shortfall in nominal 
income.  Under this rule, the fe deral funds rate does not excee d 1 percent until the end of 
2017, over a year later than under th e 2015:Q4 NI ta rgeting rul e.8  As a result, the 
unemployment rate undershoots the staff’s estimate of the natur al rate by about  
½ percentage point more than it  does under the 2015:Q4 NI targe ting rule.  Moreover, 
                                                 
7 As detailed in the appendix, the nominal income gap can be exp ressed as the sum of the current 
estimate of the output gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflato r from the level it would have attained had it 
increased at an annual rate of 2 percent since the date associa ted with the rule.  Because the current output 
gap is estimated to be 0.1 per cent in 2016:Q2, the 2011:Q4 NI t argeting rule is effectively only making up 
for past misses in inflation.   
8 An NI targeting rule with an anchor date of 2007:Q4, shown in past Tealbooks, would call for an 
even more accommodative path for the policy rate.

   unlike the 2015:Q4 NI targeting rule, inflati on overshoots the Committee’s 2 percent 
objective persistently, albeit by a small amount.   
Even NI targeting rules that place less emphasis on addressing past shortfalls in 
nominal income may be effective at providing stimulus in the ev ent of negative shocks 
that push the federal funds rate back down to the ELB.  The pan els on the right column of 
the exhibit show the same two N I targeting rules under a recess ion scenario that causes a 
large shortfall in nominal  income starting in 2016:Q2.9  Both NI targeting rules are 
considerably more accommodative than the inertial Taylor (1999)  rule used in the 
construction of the baseline re cession scenario:  Under the NI rules, the federal funds rate 
remains at the ELB longer than und er the inertial Taylor rule, and rises more gradually 
after departing from the ELB.  A ccordingly, the unemployment ra te falls more rapidly 
than in the baseline recession scenario.  Inflation rises back to the Committee’s 2 percent 
target more quickly and afterwar ds is above this target for an extended period of time, 
with a somewhat greater degree  of overshooting under the 2011:Q 4 NI targeting rule.  
Overall, both NI targeting rules prove effective at mitigating the persistently high 
unemployment associated with t he recession, though these outcom es are accompanied by 
a sustained period with inflation slightly above 2 percent.  Of course, the ability of NI 
targeting rules to deliver suc h outcomes relies heavily on the assumptions that 
policymakers can credibly commit to such policies and communica te them clearly, and 
that private sector agents unders tand and anticipate their effects. 
The final two exhibits, “Outcomes under Alternative Policies” a nd “Outcomes 
under Alternative Polic ies, Quarterly,” ta bulate the simulation  results for key variables 
under the policy rules described earlier. 
 
 
                                                 
9 This recession scenario is the same one discussed in the FOMC memo titled “Unconventional 
Policy Responses to a Recession” b y Hess Chung and Edward Herbs t, sent to the Committee on March 4, 
2016, and thus allows a direct comparison of the macroeconomic effects of the NI targeting rules to the 
unconventional policies considered in that memo.

  Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expr essions for the four policy rules  regularly reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  In the table, 	ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter 
t, while the right-hand-side var iables include the staff’s proje ction of trailing four-quarter core 
PCE inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead (ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap 
estimate for the current period ( gap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in 
the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ l onger-run inflation objective, denoted 
πLR, is 2 percent. 
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (199 3, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently  in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules are chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent longer-run 
inflation objective and a longer-run real federal funds rate, d enoted ݎ௅ோ, of 1¼ percent, a value 
used in the FRB/US model.  The prescriptions of the first-diffe rence rule do not depend on the 
level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; s ee Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculat ed using Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules th at include the lagged policy rate as a 
right-hand-side variable—the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and th e first-difference rule—the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook outl ook” report prescriptions derive d from the previous Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the s ame lagged funds rate value as in the 
prescriptions computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set equal to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current q uarter.  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the  prescriptions are shown for th e next quarter, and the lagged policy 
rate, for each of these rules, inc luding those that use the “Pr evious Tealbook outlook,” is set equal 
to the average value for the po licy rate thus far in the quarte r.  For the subsequent quarter, these 
rules use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained  prescriptions.

  REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff Pr ojection,” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds ra te, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-qu arter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quart er of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric mod el of the U.S. economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected val ues of the model’s exogenous vari ables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted s o that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine t he value of the real federal funds 
rate that closes the output ga p conditional on the exogenous va riables in the extended baseline 
forecast. 
The “current real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is constructed as the difference 
between the midpoint of the prevailing target range for the federal funds rate and the trailing four-
quarter change in the core PCE price index. 
The “average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the  panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 
12−quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*.  The average projected real federal 
funds rate and r* need not be associated with the s ame macroeconomic outcomes ev en when their 
values are identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held 
constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close the output gap at the end of this timeframe 
whereas, in the Tealbook baseline , the real federal funds rate can vary over time.  Distinct paths 
of real short-term rates can, in turn, generate different paths  for inflation and economic activity. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derive d from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation; this period 
extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well  as price and wage setters have 
perfect foresight, and are predicated on the staff’s extended T ealbook projection, which includes 
the macroeconomic effects of the  Committee’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter.  However, when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent 
quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICY UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimiz e a discounted sum of 
weighted squared deviations of four-quarter headline PCE inflation ( ߨ௧௣௖௘) from the Committee’s

  2 percent objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate (this differe nce is also known as the unemployment rate gap, ݌ܽ݃ݑ௧), and of 
squared changes in the federal funds rate.  The resulting loss function, shown below, embeds the 
assumptions that policymakers discount the future using a quart erly discount factor ߚ ൌ 0.9963  
and place equal weights on square d deviations of inflation, the  unemployment gap, and federal 
funds rate changes (that is, ߣ గൌߣ௨௚௔௣ൌߣோ).

The optimal control policy is the path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the above 
loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to the effective low er bound constraint on nominal 
interest rates, under the assumption of perfect foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended 
Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds  rate are taken as given and 
subsumed within the Tealbook base line.  The path chosen by poli cymakers today is assumed to 
be credible, meaning that decision makers in the model see this  path as being a binding 
commitment on the future Committees; the optimal control policy  takes as given the lagged value 
of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by pol icy decisions made prior to the 
simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a  period that ends sufficiently far 
into the future that extending that period farther would not af fect the policy prescriptions shown 
in the exhibits. 
NOMINAL INCOME TARGETING RULE 
 The nominal income targeting rule, used in the special exhibit  for this Tealbook, responds 
to the nominal income gap, which is defined as the difference b etween nominal income ݊ݕ௧ (100 
times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value ݊ݕ௧∗ (100 times the log of target 
nominal GDP). 
ܴ௧ൌ 	0.75ܴ ௧ିଵ൅0.25ሺݎ௅ோ൅ߨ௧	൅	݊ݕ௧െ݊ݕ௧∗ሻ 
 The target value ݊ݕ ௧∗ grows at a rate equal to 2 percentage points per year faster than the 
staff’s estimate of potential GDP.2  In the special exhibit, the initial value for ݊ݕ௧∗  is computed in 
two ways.  In the first calibration of the rule, the initial ta rget value is set so that policymakers 
address only nominal income shor tfalls since 2015:Q4, while in the second calibration, the initial 
value for ݊ݕ௧∗ is constructed so that the rule seeks to offset the cumulative  nominal income gap 
since 2011:Q4.  For each of these rule specifications, the nomi nal income gap can be expressed as 
the sum of the current estimate of the output gap and the short fall of the GDP deflator from the 
                                                 
2 This implies that, as with many other simple policy rules, a revision to the estimate of potential 
GDP would change the prescription of the rule.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
The draft statements—labeled A lternative A, Alternative B, and Alternative C—
offer similar assessments of incoming data on domestic economic  activity and the labor 
market.  Where they differ is in their characterization of infl ation expectations and the 
outlook for inflation, of the ris ks attending the outlook in li ght of financial market 
turbulence and developments abroad, and of the implications for  adjustments in the 
stance of monetary po licy at this and subsequent meetings.  In particular, Alternative B 
maintains the current target range while keeping open the optio n for target range 
adjustments at upcoming meetings , Alternative A specifies conditions for raising the 
target range that, in the staff’ s view, are unlikely to be met in the near term, and 
Alternative C increases the target range. 
All three statements begin by ac knowledging that “economic acti vity has been 
expanding at a moderate pace,” w ith Alternative B and Alternati ve C emphasizing the 
economy’s resilience to date by pointing out that this expansio n has been occurring 
“despite the global economic and financial developments of rece nt months.”  The draft 
statements next note that househol d spending “has been increasi ng at a solid rate” while 
business fixed investment and net exports “have been soft.”  The three statements then 
report that recent indicators point to “strengthening of the la bor market.”  This language 
recognizes that, from November to February, total nonfarm payro ll employment 
expanded, on average, by a so lid 228,000 jobs per month, the un employment rate ticked 
down to 4.9 percent, and the labor f orce participation rate ros e 0.4 percentage point. 
The three draft statements obs erve that inflation picked up in recent months but 
also note that it has continue d to run below 2 percent.  Altern ative B and Alternative C 
both suggest that measures of inflation compensation and survey -based measures of 
longer-run inflation expectati ons are little changed, on balanc e, but Alternative B draws 
attention to the low levels of some of these measures whereas A lternative C does not.  
Alternative A conveys greater c oncern about readings from these  measures by stating that 
they point to increased risks tha t inflation “will fail to rise to 2 percent over the medium 
term.”  With respect to the Co mmittee’s modal outlook for infla tion, Alternative A and 
Alternative B both reaffirm the C ommittee’s expectation that in flation will “remain low 
in the near term,” in part because of earlier declines in energ y prices, but that inflation 
will rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory e ffects of these declines

  dissipate and as the labor market strengthens further.  Alterna tive C dispenses with any 
mention of expected softness in t he near term; it simply states the Committee’s 
anticipation that inflation will rise to 2 percent as transitor y influences dissipate. 
Financial conditions deteriorate d early in the intermeeting per iod, with equity 
prices falling and credit spreads on risky corporate bonds risi ng.  Subsequently, investor 
sentiment improved markedly, and financial conditions ended the  period generally less 
tight than at the time of the J anuary meeting.  The reasons for  this improvement in 
sentiment are unclear, as the f actors that have fuelled concern s over the global outlook in 
recent months—such as the possibility of a hard landing in Chin a, unsettling news about 
the health of European banks, and e xcessive corporate debt in emerging market 
economies—remain largely unaddressed.  Stepping back, on balance since the December 
FOMC meeting, the S&P 500 stock p rice index is down 4 percent, 10-year nominal 
Treasury yields are down about  35 basis points, and the levels of the federal funds rate 
implied by OIS quotes for year -end 2016 and year-end 2017 are d own nearly 20 basis 
points and about 40 basis poi nts, respectively. 
The draft statements suggest tha t the global ec onomic and finan cial developments 
of the past few months have not had a material effect on the Co mmittee’s medium-term 
baseline outlook; however, they o ffer differing characterizatio ns of the risks to the U.S. 
economy stemming from these developments.  Alternative B acknow ledges that these 
developments “continue to pose risks” whereas Alternative A cau tions that they “pose 
downside risks.”  Alternative C returns to December statement l anguage in affirming that 
the Committee “sees the risks t o the outlook for both economic activity and the labor 
market as balanced.” 
Turning to the policy decision, A lternative B repeats language from the January 
statement by indicating that the  decision to hold the target ra nge at this meeting will 
support “further improvement in labor market conditions and a r eturn to 2 percent 
inflation.”  But the new ope ning words of paragraph 3 suggest t hat the Committee’s 
decision is based not only on its economic outlook but also on its risk assessment, and 
thus suggest that risk managemen t considerations contributed to  the decision to maintain 
the current target range.  Alternative B preserves the option t o alter the target range at any 
future meeting and leaves unchanged the guidance regarding futu re target range 
adjustments and balance sheet management.  By contrast, Alterna tive A communicates a 
judgment that the “economic outlook and associated risks” warra nt not increasing the 
target range “until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a su stained basis and the risks to

  the economic outlook are more closely balanced;” the staff fore cast presented in 
Tealbook A suggests that the inf lation condition is unlikely to  be met in short order.  In 
any case, by the time these inflation and risk conditions are m et, the labor market could 
have strengthened substantially f urther, a situation that would  call for relatively rapid 
increases in the target range.  Accordingly, Alternative A drop s the indication that future 
adjustments to the stance of po licy will be “onl y gradual.”  Al ternative C raises the target 
range by 25 basis points and maint ains the existing guidance about future monetary 
policy actions, consistent with a view that the economy has evo lved in a way that makes 
it appropriate to follow a pat h of policy rate increases like the median path in the 
December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). 
The next pages contain the January postmeeting statement, the three draft 
statements, and summaries of the arguments for each alternative .  These elements are 
followed by drafts of the implement ation note regarding the dec isions taken by the 
Federal Reserve to implement the monetary policy stance announc ed by the Committee.  
The first draft could be issued i f the Committee decides to maintain the current setting of 
the target range for the federal funds rate, as in Alternative A and Alternative B, and the 
second draft could be issued if th e Committee decides to raise the target range for the 
federal funds rate, as in Altern ative C.  In either case, the i mplementation note, which 
contains the Committee’s domestic policy directive to the Desk,  will be released with the 
Committee’s postmeeting statement.

  JANUARY 2016  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in December 
suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth 
slowed late last year.  House hold spending and business fixed investment have been 
increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved 
further; however, net exports have  been soft and inventory inve stment slowed.  A 
range of recent labor market i ndicators, including strong job g ains, points to some 
additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.  Inf lation has continued to 
run below the Committee’s 2 percen t longer-run objective, partl y reflecting declines 
in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-b ased measures of 
inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recen t months.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee currently expect s that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market in dicators will continue to stre ngthen.  Inflation is 
expected to remain low in the  near term, in part because of the  further declines in 
energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as  the transitory effects 
of declines in energy and import  prices dissipate and the labor  market strengthens 
further.  The Committee is closely monitoring global economic a nd financial 
developments and is assessing their  implications for the labor market and inflation, 
and for the balance of  risks to the outlook. 
3. Given the economic outlook, the C ommittee decided to maintain the target range for 
the federal funds rate at ¼ t o ½ percent.  The stance of moneta ry policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run.  H owever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data.  
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency

  mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the  level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities  at sizable levels , should help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions

economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor mark et indicators will 
continue to strengthen.  However, global economic and financial developments in 
recent months pose downside risks to the outlook for economic a ctivity and the 
labor market.   Inflation is expected to remai n low in the near term, in part  because of 
the furthe r earlier  declines in energy prices, but to rise t o 2 percent over the m edium 
term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import  prices dissipate and the 
labor market strengthens further.  The Comm ittee is closely mon itoring global 
economic and financial developmen ts and is assessing their implications for the labor 
market and inflation, and for the  balance of risks to the outlo ok.  In light of 
continued low readings from mea sures of longer-term inflation c ompensation 
and expectations, the Committee j udges that the risks that infl ation will fail to 
rise to 2 percent over the medium term have increased.  
3. Given the economic outlook  and associated risks , the Committee decided to 
maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in 
labor market conditions and a r eturn to 2 percent inflation.  The Committe e 
anticipates that it will not increase this target range until i nflation moves closer 
to 2 percent on a sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more 
closely balanced.

inflation pressures and inflati on expectations, and readings on  financial and 
international developments.  In l ight of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 
percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expect ed progress toward its

manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal 
funds rate is likely to will remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  Howev er, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.  
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the  level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may see the available information as suggesting th at economic 
activity and the labor market are evolving in ways that are broadly consistent with their 
modal forecasts at the time of the December FOMC meeting.  The earlier downside 
surprise to fourth-quarter real GDP growth was partly revised away, leaving the estimate 
of GDP growth in 2015 modestly belo w the median response in the  December SEP.  
First-quarter indicators of real  activity, including personal c onsumption expenditures in 
January as well as consumer conf idence and light vehicle sales through February, appear 
consistent with moderate growth.  Labor market conditions have strengthened further, 
with nonfarm payroll employment  expanding solidly through Febru ary and the labor 
force participation rate moving up.  Although global financial conditions have generally 
improved of late, the factors tha t led to their sharp deteriora tion earlier this year remain 
largely unaddressed, suggesting th at concerns over the global outlook are likely to persist.  
Turning to inflation, policymaker s may judge that developments have been mixed and 
further complicate the task of di sentangling the persistent and  temporary components:  
Although inflation picked up recently, it remains below 2 perce nt and at least part of the 
firming seems to be due to erratic  components and transitory se asonal movements.  On 
the other hand, while measures of  inflation compensation and lo nger-run inflation 
expectations have remained sof t, and have even edged down in so me cases, policymakers 
may judge that this softness likel y reflects chan ges in risk and liquidity premiums and the 
known sensitivity of survey responses to gasoline prices.  Give n these considerations, 
Committee members may find it prudent to maintain the current target range, as in 
Alternative B, until they have grea ter confidence that the econ omy will remain on a path 
consistent with achieving their mandated objectives. 
Policymakers may judge that global economic and financial devel opments 
continue to pose risks to the ir economic outlook, and they migh t want to convey that risk 
management considerations are pl aying a role in their March policy decision.  They may 
note that, under certain conditions, it is optimal to follow a shallower policy rate path in 
response to increased uncertainty  about the economic outlook wh en there is a material 
possibility that the effectiv e lower bound (ELB) could bind for a protracted period going 
forward than when there is lit tle or no risk of being constrain ed by the ELB.  In the 
current context, they might conclude that waiting for greater c larity regarding the 
economic outlook before taking the next step in normalizing the  stance of monetary 
policy might provide some insurance against costly downside ris ks and that waiting has 
the added benefit of confirmi ng to the public that policy is no t on a preset course.  
Alternatives

  Some participants may judge it un likely that an increase in the  target range will be 
warranted in the near term.  In light of historically low readings on measures of inflation 
compensation and expectations, they may have become less confid ent that inflation will 
move up to 2 percent.  Or they may view the low sensitivity of inflation to resource 
utilization as requiring a period of unemployment well below it s longer-run normal rate 
to ensure a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.  Nevertheless, those who 
judge that the outlook is suffici ently uncertain to make near-t erm rate hikes inadvisable 
may conclude that, by not increas ing the target range in March,  the Committee would go 
far enough, for now, in signaling t hat policy is not on a prese t course, that the FOMC is 
committed to achieving its inflation goal, and that the FOMC is  mindful of its limited 
ability to offset adverse shocks in the vicinity of the ELB.  M oreover, they might judge 
that the statement should signal that the Committee is closely monitoring inflation 
developments, as in Alternative B. 
Other policymakers may see in coming data, in particular strong job gains and 
solid consumption indicators, as reinforcing the ir view that th e ongoing economic 
expansion is resilient and that worries about the recent market  volatility and foreign 
developments significantly restraining the U.S. economy are exaggerated.  Looking 
through temporary influences fro m energy and import prices, the se policymakers may 
view the recent uptick in core inflation, the moderate rebound in oil prices, and the 
further strengthening of the la bor market as suggesting that inflation will, as they had 
previously expected, rise toward 2 percent over the medium term .  If so, these 
policymakers may lean toward continuing on the path of gradual policy normalization 
envisioned in December.  That said, they may believe that postp oning the decision to 
raise the target range until a later meeting entails little, if  any, extra risks that the 
economy could overheat or that financial imbalances could emerg e, because real GDP 
growth remains moderate, infla tion continues to run below 2 per cent, wage growth is 
tepid, measures of longer-term inf lation expectations are at or  below normal levels, and 
asset valuation pressures are generally moderate.  Moreover, these policymakers may recognize that the Committee coul d readily tighten policy rapid ly were it necessary, and 
that the language in Alternati ve B emphasizing the Committee’s pursuit of a data-
dependent approach indicates that the Committee stands ready to do so. 
A decision to maintain the curr ent target range would be in lin e with the 
expectations of financial marke t participants.  According to th e Desk’s latest Survey of 
Primary Dealers and Survey of Mar ket Participants, respondents perceive there to be only 
a remote chance that the Committee will change the target range  at this meeting.  
Alternatives

  Moreover, respondents do not anticipate any changes to the Comm ittee’s forward 
guidance or reinvestment policy, w hich Alternative B both maint ains.  Whether market 
participants will perceive the statement as more or less accomm odative, on balance, than 
they had anticipated is unclear.  On the one hand, the statemen t acknowledges that 
“global economic and financial developments continue to pose ri sks,” which some 
market participants might interpr et as the Committee showing gr eater concerns than they 
had anticipated.  On the other hand, the statement contrasts these concerns with a 
relatively upbeat assessment of  the U.S. economy, which might b oost market 
participants’ confidence in ec onomic prospects.  Obviously, the  market reaction to the 
March decision could also be sensitive to the content of the ac companying SEP. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Some policymakers might argue t hat the global economic and fina ncial situation 
poses substantial downside risk s to the domestic economic outlo ok, and that recent 
financial market turbulence offers an important reminder that the ability of U.S. and foreign central banks to offset  the effects of adverse economic shocks is limited.  Despite 
the improvement in the labor market to date, these policymakers  may believe that more 
needs to be done to reach maxim um employment.  And with the ris ks to economic 
activity skewed to the downside , they might be concerned that p rogress toward that 
objective might stall or be reve rsed.  These policymakers might  also stress that both core 
and headline inflation have run be low 2 percent for several yea rs, and that headline 
inflation will linger at low levels well into 2016 because of e arlier movements in the 
exchange value of the dollar a nd in the prices  of oil and other commodities.  With FOMC 
participants, the staff, and many other forecasters having repe atedly overpredicted 
inflation in recent years, some policymakers might want to see actual inflation move 
more convincingly toward their  objective rather than to continu e to predicate their policy 
decisions on inflation forecasts  that hinge on a tenuous relati onship with slack in labor or 
product markets and on the assumption that inflation expectatio ns are, and will remain, 
well anchored.  In sum, these policymakers might prefer a state ment along the lines of 
Alternative A, whic h asserts that the Committee anticipates tha t it will not increase the 
target range “until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a su stained basis and the risks to 
the economic outlook are more closely balanced.” 
These policymakers might favor i ncluding language indicating th at recent global 
developments pose downside risks to their outlook for economic activity and the labor 
market.  More generally, these po licymakers might see alternati ve scenarios such as 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
March 10, 2016
Page 30 of 54
Authorized for Public Release
  
  “Global Recession” or “Less Effec tive Foreign Monetary Policy” in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A  as increasingl y likely.  They might observe that the 
scope to use conventional policy m easures to support the econom y in the event that such 
scenarios materialize would be quickly exhausted, given the pro ximity to the effective 
lower bound.  On a related note, t hese policymakers might expec t that the neutral rate of 
interest is likely to remain low  for an extended period, thus e xacerbating the risk that 
conventional policy could be constrained going forward.  They m ight also judge that 
unconventional monetary policies provide only a limited extra c ushion against adverse 
shocks unless the FOMC commits to maintaining extraordinary amo unts of 
accommodation for a prolonged perio d, a point illustrated in th e memo “Unconventional 
Policy Responses to a Recession” sent to the Committee on March  4, 2016.  Because the 
benefits of such forceful actions  are uncertain and the risks t hey entail are not well 
captured by economic models, these policymakers may worry that the scope for 
unconventional policy actions i s even more limited than suggest ed in the memo.  
Therefore, these policymakers ma y believe that risk management considerations call for 
signaling that any further rem oval of policy accommodation is s ome time off. 
Policymakers might also worry that the failure of inflation to rise to target over 
the past several years has beco me ingrained in longer-term infl ation expectations.  They 
might note that the Michigan Sur vey measure of longer-term infl ation expectations slid to 
the lowest level in its nearl y four-decade history in February,  and that the New York 
Fed’s measure of three-year-ah ead expected inflation displays a  similar downward drift.  
They might add that market-based measures of inflation compensa tion have been at low 
levels for so long that it is diffi cult to believe that these d eclines are entirely due to 
liquidity and risk premiums.  O n balance, they may see the weak ness in those various 
measures as suggesting that the  inflation expectations relevant  for wage and price setting 
have declined slightly, and note that staff, in effect, reached  such a conclusion this round 
when it lowered its estimate of underlying inflation over the m edium term from 
1.8 percent to 1.75 percent.  Some policymakers might further d ismiss the recent uptick 
in core inflation as a transitory anomaly, and instead point to  wage inflation falling back 
to the low levels seen over the p ast several years as evidence that there is little upward 
pressure from resource utiliza tion and that inflation is likely  to continue trending below 
2 percent.  These observations may lead these policymakers to c onclude that there is little 
reason to be confident that inflation will return to 2 percent in the medium term if the 
Committee raises interest rates in the near future.  Moreover, these policymakers might 
argue that a chronic failure to get inflation moving up risks e roding the credibility of the 
Alternatives

Page 31 of 54

  FOMC’s commitment to achieving 2 percent inflation and to treat ing deviations from this 
objective on a symmetric basis. 
Most respondents in the Desk’s la test surveys expect the Commit tee to continue 
to emphasize the gradual natu re of its normalization approach a nd to convey a bias 
toward raising rates later thi s year.  Respondents also did not  report an expectation that 
the March statement would emphasi ze downside risks to the econo mic outlook to the 
extent suggested by Alternative A .  Therefore, the issuance of a postmeeting statement 
like Alternative A would likely surprise financial market parti cipants.  Investors would 
likely push further into the future the expected date of the ne xt rate increase, the expected 
path for the federal fund rate w ould likely flatten further, an d longer-term yields would 
decline.  If the statement is primarily seen as more accommodat ive, equity prices and 
inflation compensation might rise, and the dollar would depreci ate.  But if investors 
interpret the statement as r eflecting an unexpectedly downbeat assessment of global 
economic conditions and greater-than-anticipated concerns over the downside risks to the 
outlook, equity prices and inflati on compensation could fall. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
With the unemployment rate, now a t 4.9 percent, equal to the me dian of 
participants’ estimates of its  longer-run value in the December SEP, some policymakers 
might conclude that the economy is at or close to maximum susta inable employment.  
They might also assess that inc oming indicators of real activit y and the labor market 
continue to display sufficient strength, despite the recent bou t of financial turbulence, to 
continue to foster improvement i n the labor market and promote the expected progress to 
the Committee’s inflation objectiv e over the medium term.  In p articular, they may see 
claims that the risks to the economic outlook are significantly  skewed to the downside as 
unjustified and instead view the r isks as balanced.  These poli cymakers may judge that 
conditions remain favorable for  solid consumption growth and fu rther improvement in 
the housing sector even with a m odest further increase in the t arget range because 
household balance sheets have imp roved, gains in disposable income have been healthy, 
gasoline prices are low, consumer confidence is high, and job p rospects are good. 
Regarding the Committee’s infla tion objective, policymakers may  note that 
various measures of the trend i n inflation have moved closer to  2 percent, with the  
12-month change in core PCE infl ation and the Dallas Fed’s trim med mean PCE inflation 
edging up to 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, in Janu ary.  Moreover, participants 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

  may have only limited concerns a bout low readings on longer-ter m inflation 
compensation because they judge that these indicators are depressed by movements in 
liquidity and risk premiums that are unrelated to longer-run in flation outcomes.  
Similarly, they may attribute the softening in the median Michi gan Survey respondent’s 
expectation of average inf lation over the coming 5 or 10 years to the transitory influences 
of earlier declines in gasoline pr ices rather than to a reduction in expected inflation over 
the longer run.  Therefore, polic ymakers may have confidence th at headline inflation will 
be close to the 2 percent objectiv e once the transitory effects  of earlier declines in energy 
and import prices fade, and that the projected further tightening of the labor market will 
suffice to return headline inflati on to the Committee’s longer- run objective. 
These policymakers might further  argue that leaving rates uncha nged in the face 
of rapid job growth and a closed unemployment rate gap would li kely foster expectations 
of a prolonged, unconditionally shallow path for the federal fu nds rate, creating incipient 
excess demand.  Leaving the stance of monetary policy unchanged thus runs the risk that 
inflation will persistently overshoot 2 percent, eliciting an u pward drift in inflation 
expectations, possibly along the l ines of the alte rnative scenario “Faster Growth with 
Higher Inflation” in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tea lbook A.  In addition, 
such an expected path could induce further “reach for yield” or excessive risk-taking 
behavior in financial markets.  Some policymakers might also be  concerned that the 
public might misinterpret a statement like Alternative B as an indication that the FOMC 
is placing excessive weight on the  downside economic risks that  might accompany 
market volatility and reduced asse t valuations, and too little weight on a solid central 
outlook for the economy, la bor markets, and inflation. 
For all of the above reasons, the se policymakers may judge that  it is appropriate 
to announce a 25 basis point increa se in the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to 
¾ percent, as in Alternative C .  Policymakers may note that, ev en with this increase, the 
real federal funds rate would s till lie well below the Tealbook -consistent estimate of the 
equilibrium real federal funds r ate reported in t he “Monetary P olicy Strategie s” section of 
Tealbook B.  An increase in the tar get range would also be cons istent with the level of the 
federal funds rate prescribe d by the optimal control policy rep orted there. 
According to the Desk’s latest s urveys, the average perceived p robability of a 
tightening at this meeting is a bout 5 percent, and so a decisio n to increase the target range 
would be very surprising.  If mark et participants infer that, a ll else equal, the Committee 
intends to pursue a much less accommodative stance of policy go ing forward than they

  had expected, then medium- and longer-term real interest rates would rise, equity prices 
and inflation compensation woul d likely decline, and the dollar would appreciate.  
However, if investors see a statement like Alternative C as ref lecting an upbeat 
assessment for the strength of t he U.S. expansion, then equity prices and inflation 
compensation might fall less th an otherwise, or even rise.

rate, as in Alternative A or Alte rnative B, an implementation n ote that indicates no 
change in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates—the interest rates on required and 
excess reserves, the offering rat e on overnight reverse repurch ase agreements, and the 
discount rate—would be issued.  If  the Committee instead decide s to raise the target 
range for the federal funds rate,  as in Alternative C, an imple mentation note that 
communicates the changes the Fed eral Reserve decided to make to  these three policy 
tools would be issued. 
Regardless of which policy alternative the Committee adopts, th e Committee may 
decide to authorize the Desk to c onduct term reverse repurchase  agreement operations 
(RRP) over the March quarter-end.1  If the Committee authorizes term RRPs, the

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation 
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on January 27 
March 16, 2016: 
 The Board of Governors of the Fed eral Reserve System left uncha nged the 
interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 0 .50 percent. 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open 
Market Account in accordance with  the following domestic policy  directive:  
"Effective January 28 March 17, 2016, the Federal Open Market

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and key 
elements of the associated income statement under two scenarios  for the path of monetary 
policy.  The first set of projec tions (labeled “March Tealbook baseline” in the 
accompanying exhibits) reflects the policy assumptions incorpor ated in the staff’s 
baseline forecast presented in Tealbook A.  The second set (labeled “Lower federal funds 
rate”) incorporates the lower path for the federal funds rate assumed in the DEDO box in Tealbook A “An Alternative Path f or the Federal Funds Rate” as well as a delayed 
cessation of reinvestments relative  to the staff’s baseline for ecast.
1   
The paths of interest rates a nd macroeconomic variables as well  as the date of 
cessation of reinvestments differ across the two scenarios.  In  the March Tealbook 
baseline scenario, the federal funds rate follows the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and rises 
roughly 1 percentage point per year until the end of 2018.  In the lower federal funds rate 
scenario, the policy rate r emains on hold through the end of 20 16 and thereafter follows 
the prescriptions of the inertia l Taylor rule.  The baseline sc enario also assumes that 
reinvestments of maturing Treas ury securities and agency debt a s well as principal 
received on agency MBS will cease at the end of 2016, when the federal funds rate is 
projected to be at about 1½ percen t.  Under the lower federal f unds rate scenario, 
reinvestments are also assumed to cease when the policy rate re aches 1½ percent, but this 
occurs in the third quarter of  2017, three quarters later than in the baseline projection.  
In both scenarios, we assume that , once reinvestments cease, th e SOMA portfolio 
shrinks through full redemptions  of maturing Treasury and agency debt securities as well 
as paydowns of principal from age ncy MBS.  Regarding the Federa l Reserve’s use of its 
policy normalization tools, we also assume in both scenarios th at the level of overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement s (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion th rough the end of 2018 
                                                 
1 The DEDO box assumes no change in the date of cessation of rei nvestments from the staff’s 
baseline forecast.

  before declining to zero by the end of 2019, and that term depo sits and term RRPs are not 
used.2  Below, we highlight some key f eatures of the two scenarios. 
 Balance sheet.   Under the baseline scenario, the size of the portfolio is 
normalized in the third quart er of 2021, one quarter earlier th an projected in the 
January Tealbook, reflecting a low er path of the 10-year Treasu ry yield and a 
faster pace of agency MBS prepay ments than in our previous forecast (see the 
solid black lines in the exhibit “Total Assets and Selected Bal ance Sheet Items” 
and the table that follows).3  At that time, total assets are projected to stand at 
$2.35 trillion, with about $2.2 tril lion in total SOMA securiti es holdings.  Total 
assets and SOMA Treasury holdings increase thereaf ter, keeping pace with the 
growth in both Federal Reserve notes in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank 
capital.   
Under the lower federal funds rat e scenario, the normalization of the size of the 
portfolio occurs in the firs t quarter of 2022, nearly two quart ers later than in the 
baseline scenario, primarily ref lecting the longer reinvestment  period, a 
development that results in about $340 billion of additional re investments (see the 
dotted red lines in the exhib it and the second table).   
 Federal Reserve earnings remittances.   After record remittances to the Treasury 
in 2015 that included payments  of nearly $100 bill ion in net in come, remittances 
under the baseline scenario are  projected to decline to about $ 65 billion this year 
                                                 
2 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the over all size of the balance sheet.  We also assume that RRPs associated with 
foreign official and international accounts remain near their J anuary 29, 2016, level of $235 billion 
throughout the projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend, which is determ ined largely by currency in circulation and a 
projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projecte d timing of the normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet depends importa ntly on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct 
monetary policy; currently, we a ssume that level of reserve balances to be $100 billion.  However, ongoing 
regulatory and structural change s could result in a higher underlying demand for reserve balances.  In turn, 
a higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all els e equal, imply an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a $500 billion s teady-state level of r eserve balances, the 
balance sheet would likely normalize at the end of 2020.  Alternatively, a lower assumed steady-state level 
of reserve balances, such as $1 0 billion, would induce a delay in the projected norma lization of the balance 
sheet until the first quarter of 2022.

  (see the solid black lines in the “ Income Project ions” exhibit) .4  The large step-
down in 2016 primarily reflects lower interest income from MBS holdings.  
Annual remittances continue to decline in subsequent years, rea ching a low of 
roughly $32 billion in 2019, with no deferred asset being recorded.5  Under this 
scenario, the Federal Reserve’s  cumulative remittances from 200 9 through 2025 
total about $1.1 trillion.   
Under the lower federal funds rat e scenario, cumulative remitta nces are projected 
to be about $20 billion higher tha n in the baseline projection,  primarily reflecting 
lower interest expense through 2018 (see the dotted red lines).  In particular, 
because during the earlier porti on of the projection the path f or the federal funds 
rate as well as those for the ra tes paid on reserve balances and ON RRPs lie below 
those that prevail in the baselin e scenario, interest expense r ises less in the lower-
rate scenario.     
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of about $215 billion at the end o f February.6  Going 
forward, the net unrealized gain or  loss position of the portfolio will depend 
importantly on the path of longer-term interest rates.  Under t he baseline scenario, 
because of the assumed rise in l onger-term interest rates over the next several 
years, the portfolio is projected to shift to a position of unrealized loss within the next two quarters, and to record  a peak unrealized loss of abou t $240 billion in 
mid-2019, about $10 billion lower than t he peak loss estimated in the January 
Tealbook.  At that time, of the $240 billion loss, almost $100 billion is 
attributable to losses on holdings of Treasury securities and $ 140 billion to losses 
on holdings of agency MBS.  After  peaking, the unrealized loss position then 
contracts through 2025, as the valu e of securities previously a cquired under the 
large-scale asset purchase progr ams returns to par as these sec urities approach 
                                                 
4 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balanc es will average about 15 basis 
points above the effective federa l funds rate and the ON RRP ra te will average about 10 basis points below 
the effective federal funds rate.  
5 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset for int erest on Federal Reserve notes would be 
recorded. 
6 The Federal Reserve reports the level and the change in the qu arter-end net unr ealized gain/loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial 
Reports,” available on the Board’s website at

  maturity, and new securities are added to the portfolio at prev ailing market yields.  
Under the lower federal funds rate scenario, th e projected unrealized gain or loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio doe s not materially differ from the corresponding 
baseline projection, largely reflecting similar paths for longer-term interest rates 
in the two scenarios. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” unde r the baseline scenario, the Federal 
Reserve’s elevated stock of longer-term securities is estimated  to hold down the 
term premium embedded in the 10 -year Treasury yield by 107 basi s points in the 
current quarter.  Over the next c ouple of years, the estimated term premium effect 
diminishes at a pace of about 4 basis points per quarter, refle cting in part the 
gradual projected shrinking of t he portfolio.  The projection f or the term premium 
effect is slightly less negativ e than in the January Tealbook, reflecting the lower 
path of the 10-year Treasury rate and the resulting faster MBS prepayments.   
Under the lower federal funds rat e scenario, the estimated term  premium effect is 
just a few basis points more nega tive than in the baseline proj ection, a result of 
the later end to reinvestments.7  
 SOMA Characteristics.   Regarding the size of the  portfolio, under the baseline 
scenario, approximately $220 bill ion in SOMA Treasury holdings will mature this 
year, and a total of $1.4 trilli on will mature between 2016 and  2020 (see the upper 
panel of the exhibit “Projections  for the Characteristics of SO MA Holdings”).8  
The amounts of Treasury securities maturing each month vary con siderably, while 
projected MBS paydowns are much l ess variable.  H owever, realiz ed MBS 
                                                 
7 Because the DEDO box assumes a date for the cessation of reinv estments that is consistent with 
the staff’s baseline forecast, its simulations for longer-term interest rates do not incorporate the term 
premium effects projected here u nder the lower federal funds ra te scenario that stem from the extension of 
the reinvestment period.  This small additional widening of the term premium arising from the later end of 
reinvestments would not have a material impact on the macroecon omic effects reported in the DEDO box. 
8 While following its current reinvestment policy, the Desk repl aces maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
value of holdings maturing on the issue date of a newly issued security.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are p laced as noncompetitive tenders and are treated as a dd-ons to announced 
auction sizes.

  paydowns will reflect the evolution over time of interest rates  and other factors 
and could thus be significantly more volatile than projected.9   
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6½ years (see the lower panel of the exhibit).  Under the basel ine scenario, it is 
projected to be about three months shorter at the end of this y ear.10  Duration is 
projected to decline through 2017, reflecting the end of reinve stments as well as 
the aging of the portfolio, and subsequently to rise through 20 21, when the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized.11  Under the lower federa l funds rate scenario, 
duration peaks at about the same l evel as in the baseline scenario, but nearly two 
quarters later, reflecting the  delayed normalization of the siz e of the balance sheet.  
After reaching its peak when the s ize of the balance sheet is n ormalized, duration 
is projected to resume its declin e in both scenarios as the Des k starts purchasing 
Treasury securities to keep p ace with currency growth.  In particular, the duration 
contour in this latter portion of  the projection is based on the key assumption that 
the Federal Reserve will buy only Treasury bills until those holdings are equal to 
approximately 30 percent of the Treasury portfolio, similar to the pre-crisis 
composition of the portfolio (curr ently there are no Treasury b ill holdings).  
Thereafter, purchases of Treasur y securities are assumed to be spread across the 
maturity spectrum.12   
 
                                                 
9 Since the January Tealbook, the Board’s balance sheet and income projections use a staff MBS 
prepayment model.  This model was previously employed earlier i n the context of the “ Confidence Interval 
Projections of the Balance Sheet” boxes in the September and De cember Tealbooks.   
10 The July 2015 Tealbook B box “History and Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA 
Treasury Holdings” provides more information on the duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio. 
11 The duration of the SOMA Treas ury portfolio initially declines once reinvestments cease, as 
Treasury securities in the portfolio approach maturity.  Once t he pace of roll-offs accel erates starting in 
2018 and longer tenor securities  account for a larger share in the portfolio, duration increases until the 
balance sheet is normalized.    
12 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments cea se.
