Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap a nd inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for sizable adju stments in the policy rate 
to levels of about 2¾ percent  by the third qu arter of 2016, whe reas the inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule, which places a cons iderable weight on keeping the federal funds rate close to 
the rate in the prev ious quarter, calls for raising the policy rate to about 1 percent over the 
same period.  The first-difference rule prescribes more moderat e increases in the federal 
funds rate, to about ¾ percent i n the third quarter of 2016, as it also places a considerable 
weight on the lagged federal funds  rate.  The Taylor rules’ prescriptions are a bit lower 
than those derived from the March Tealbook projections, reflect ing the slightly lower 
level of output relative to poten tial in the second and third q uarters of 2016.  The first-
difference rule calls for higher levels of the federal funds ra te than it did in March 
because the staff projection implies a somewhat faster growth r ate of output relative to 
potential in the near term. 
The bottom panel of the first e xhibit reports the estimate of a  Tealbook-consistent, 
medium-term notion of the equilib rium real federal funds rate t hat is generated using the 
FRB/US model.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  corresponds to the real federal 
funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, would close the output gap in the 
final quarter of that period in t he model.  The current-quarter estimate of r*, at 
1.66 percent, is essentially unchanged from the estimate derive d from the staff’s outlook 
in March.  The panel also reports  the average of the real feder al funds rate in the 
Tealbook baseline projection for the same 12-quarter period use d to compute r*. 2  This 
average is 0.56 percent, about 1 perc entage point below the est imate of r*.  The panel 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules. 
2 While r* and the average projected real f ederal funds rate are calculat ed over the same 
12-quarter period, they need not be associated with the same ma croeconomic outcomes even when their 
values are identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant 
over the entire 12-quarter perio d, whereas in the Tealbook base line, the real federal funds rate can vary 
over time.  Distinct paths of real  short-term rates can, in tur n, generate different pa ths for inflation and 
economic activity, even if they have the same 12-quarter averag e.

further reports a measure of the current real federal funds rat e that, at –1.23 percent, is 
about ¼ percentage point lower than in the March Tealbook. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under the Tayl or (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999 ) rule, and the first-
difference rule.  These simulati ons reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap 
and inflation when the federal f unds rate follows the paths implied by the different policy 
rules.3  The results for each rule pres ented in these and subsequent s imulations depend 
importantly on the assumptions that policymakers will adhere to  the rule in the future and 
that market participants as well as price and wage setters full y understand the policy rule 
that will be pursued and its implications for real activity and  inflation. 
The second exhibit also display s the implicati ons of following the baseline 
monetary policy assumptions in the current staff forecast, unde r which the federal funds 
rate is assumed to follow the pr escriptions of the inertial ver sion of the Taylor (1999) 
rule.  The nominal federal funds  rate increases about 1 percent age point per year for the 
next three years, reaching 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter of  2018.  The pace of 
tightening subsequently slows, and t he federal funds rate peaks at around 4 percent in 
2021, before eventually returning to its longer-run normal leve l of 3¼ percent. 
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate  sharp tightening 
and produce paths for the real fed eral funds rate that lie sign ificantly above the Tealbook 
baseline path over the next few y ears.  The sharp tightening mo stly reflects that these 
rules do not include lagged values  of the federal funds rate as  a determinant of their 
current policy prescriptions.  Giv en that the Taylor (1993) and  Taylor (1999) rules have 
as intercepts the longer-run norma l real federal funds rate of 1¼ percent, that the output 
gap is essentially closed, and that core inflation is about ½ p ercentage point below the 
Committee’s objective, these rules prescribe rates only moderat ely below their longer-run 
level of 3¼ percent.  Over the ne xt few years, these rules woul d cause the unemployment 
rate to undershoot the staff’s estim ate of the natural rate som ewhat less than in the staff’s 
baseline projection.  The Taylor ( 1999) rule prescribes somewhat higher policy rates than 
the Taylor (1993) rule over the period shown because it places more weight on the output 
gap.  As a consequence, the Taylo r (1999) rule also generates a higher trajectory of the 
3 Because of these endogenous res ponses, prescriptions from the dynamic simulations can differ 
from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit.

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of the tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline

unemployment rate and a slightly lower tra jectory of inflation than the Taylor (1993) 
rule. 
In contrast to the Taylor-type r ules, the first-difference rule  prescribes a pace of 
increase in the federal funds r ate similar to the Tealbook base line through 2018.  At that 
point, the federal funds rate le vels off under the first-differ ence rule, whereas it keeps 
rising under the Tealbook baseline .  This divergence occurs bec ause the first-difference 
rule, which responds to the expect ed change in the output gap r ather than to its level, 
reacts to the slower pace of ec onomic growth projected late in the decade.  The lower 
path of the federal funds rat e beyond 2018 under the first-difference rule, in conjunction 
with expectations of higher pri ce and wage inflation in the fut ure, leads to lower long-
term real rates and thus to higher levels of resource utilizati on and inflation in the short 
run.  The first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unem ployment rate over the 
forecast period that are markedly below the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate as well as 
the unemployment rate paths ge nerated under the other policy ru les.  The first-difference 
rule also leads to a somewhat  higher inflation path over the pe riod shown relative to the 
other simple rules. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal C ontrol Policy under Commitment,” c ompares 
optimal control simulations for  this Tealbook’s outlook with th ose reported in March.  
Policymakers are assumed to plac e equal weights on keeping head line PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent goal, on keeping the unemplo yment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  The concept of optimal control that is emp loyed here corresponds to a 
commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to 
constrain future policy choices; see the appendix for details.4 
The optimal control path for the  federal funds rate is signific antly higher than the 
path in the Tealbook outlook.  In the  current baseline projecti on, unemployment falls well 
below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years.  Under the 
preferences embedded in the sta ndard implementation of optimal control, policymakers 
judge this undershooting of the na tural rate to be costly, lead ing them to tighten policy 
appreciably more than in the T ealbook baseline.  Accordingly, the path for the real 
4 The results for optimal control policy under discretion (in wh ich policymakers cannot credibly 
commit to carrying out a plan in volving policy choices that would be suboptimal at the time that these 
choices have to be implemented) are similar.

federal funds rate is almost  1 percentage point higher, on aver age, than the Tealbook 
baseline path over the period show n.  The trajectory for the re al 10-year Treasury yield is 
also higher.  The tighter po licy under optimal control results in a path of the 
unemployment rate that runs substantially closer to the staff’s  estimate of the natural rate 
of unemployment; headline PCE inf lation is slightly lower than in the Tealbook baseline 
over the simulation period, consis tent with lower levels of res ource utilization. 
The optimal control paths for th e federal funds rate, the unemp loyment rate, and 
inflation are similar to tho se derived in the March Tealbook.  However, the path of the 
real 10-year Treasury yield is lower over t he next few years th an the optimal control path 
in the March Tealbook, reflecti ng the downward revision by the staff of its estimate of 
the term premiums in longer-term Treasury yields that is discussed in the Domestic 
Economic Developments and Outlook section of Tealbook A. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL WITH ASYMMETRIC WEIGHT ON UNEMPLOYMENT 
GAP AND STEEPER PHILLIPS CURVE 
In the standard optimal control simulations discussed above, we lfare losses arise 
from deviations—positive or nega tive—of the unemployment rate f rom the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate.  However, some policymakers may p lace little, if any, weight 
on current and projected unemployment deviations on the grounds  that the welfare costs 
of unemployment running somewhat or even substantially below th e staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate are by themselve s small.  These policymakers m ay even view the 
unemployment rate falling below its  natural rate as a useful me ans to speed up the return 
of inflation to 2 percent.  Altern atively, they may see a small  weight on the 
unemployment gap as a pragmatic  response to uncertainty about e stimates of the natural 
rate of unemployment and to the r isk that poorly estimated unem ployment gaps could 
lead to policy mistakes.  At the s ame time, some policymakers m ight be concerned that 
inflation is likely to be more responsive to declines in the un employment rate going 
forward than appears to have bee n the case in recent years when  there was ample slack in 
the labor market.   
The exhibit “Optimal Control wi th Asymmetric Weight on Unemploy ment Gap 
and Steeper Phillips Curve” compares the Tealbook baseline and our standard optimal 
control simulations with two othe r simulations.  The first simulation (the blue dashed 
lines) uses a loss function that assigns no loss to unemploymen t rate outcomes below the

natural rate but is otherwise id entical to the st andard loss fu nction.  The second 
simulation (the green dot-dashed l ines) also uses this alternat ive loss function but further 
assumes a larger response of i nflation to economic activity (that is, a steeper Phillips 
curve) than in the Tealbook baseline. 
In the scenario in which policym akers incur no losses from the unemployment 
rate falling below the natural rate, the optimal control path o f the federal funds rate is 
considerably below the corres ponding path under the standard lo ss function, and also 
below the Tealbook baseline path.  This relatively low path for  the policy rate stems from 
policymakers’ desire to raise inflation back to 2 percent; a greater undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment helps achieve that outcome.  In this simulation, inflation 
returns to 2 percent more quick ly than in the Tealbook baseline  as a result of the tighter 
labor market, and then edges above the Committee’s longer-run o bjective for a few years.   
A key assumption underlying the resu lts from the usual optimal control 
simulations is the low sensitivity of inflation to resource sla ck in the FRB/US model, a 
feature that is consistent wit h estimates of the relationship b etween inflation and slack in 
recent decades.  This low sensitivity limits the effects of mon etary policy on inflation.  
To demonstrate the role of this  feature of the model, the green dot-dashed lines in the 
exhibit show an optimal control simulation in which policymaker s incur no losses from 
the unemployment rate falling below its natural rate, but that replaces the standard wage 
Phillips curve in the FRB/US mode l with one in which wage infla tion is four times more 
responsive to the unemployment gap.  While the calibration is m eant to be illustrative, it 
is within the range of plausible empirical estimates.5 
Under the alternative specificat ion with the steeper wage Phillips curve, the path 
for the federal funds rate is higher and the inflation gap closes slightly faster than in the case in which policymakers pla ce no weight on the unemployment gap with the standard 
specification of the wage Phill ips curve.  The accompanying hig her path for the real 10-
year Treasury yield constrains economic activity and results in  both a smaller 
undershooting of unemployment relativ e to its natural rate and a slightly larger 
overshooting of inflatio n relative to 2 per cent.  In essence, t he steeper slope of the wage 
5 This calibrated response of inflation to slack is within two s tandard deviations of the FRB/US 
model estimate informed by the 1985–2007 subsample.  Using a different model specification, Kumar and 
Orrenius (2014) report a significantly larger response of wage inflation to a fall in the unemployment rate 
when the unemployment rate is below its historical average as c ompared to when the unemployment rate is 
above its historical average.

Phillips curve makes the unders hooting of unemployment relative  to its natural rate more 
powerful for returning inflation to 2 percent, resulting in les s aggressive policy stimulus. 
In the above simulations, as in the standard optimal control ex ercise, longer-term 
inflation expectati ons are assumed to remain well anchored in e very period.  If 
policymakers judge that longer-term inflation exp ectations are at risk of drifting above or 
below 2 percent, then they may accordingly prefer a higher or l ower path for the federal 
funds rate than in the simulations  shown to ensure that those e xpectations remain well 
anchored.  Additionally, if, in or der to maintain the credibili ty of their inflation objective, 
policymakers thought it necessary to return inflation to 2 perc ent fairly quickly, then they 
might prefer a lower path for the federal funds rate than other wise.

under Alternative Polic ies, Quarterly,” ta bulate the simulation  results for key variables 
under the policy rules described earlier.

Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expr essions for the four policy rules  regularly reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  In the table, 	ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter 
t, while the right-hand-side var iables include the staff’s proje ction of trailing four-quarter core 
PCE inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead (ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap 
estimate for the current period ( gap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in 
the output gap ( 4gap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ l onger-run inflation objective, denoted 
πLR, is 2 percent. 
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (199 3, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently  in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules, denoted ݎ௅ோ, are chosen so that they are consistent with a 2 percent 
longer-run inflation objective and a longer-run real federal fu nds rate of 1¼ percent, a value used 
in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first- difference rule do not depend on the level of 
the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see Orphan ides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculat ed taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When th e Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are s hown for the current and next q uarters.  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the  prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter sho wn, and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter show n.  The lines labeled “Previous 
Tealbook outlook” report prescriptions conditional on the previ ous Tealbook projections for 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012). 
2 All nominal and real f ederal funds rates reported in the Monet ary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal fu nds rate.  Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully-compounded, 365-day basis and 
then converted to a 360-day basis.

first quarter shown use the lagged policy rate in the current T ealbook projection. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES 
The bottom panel of the exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff Pr ojection,” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds ra te, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-qu arter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quart er of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric mod el of the U.S. economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected val ues of the model’s exogenous vari ables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted s o that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine t he value of the real federal funds 
rate that closes the output ga p conditional on the exogenous va riables in the extended baseline 
forecast. 
The “current real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is constructed as the difference 
between the midpoint of the prevailing target range for the federal funds rate and the trailing four-
quarter change in the core PCE price index. 
The “average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the  panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 
12−quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*.  The average projected real federal 
funds rate and r* need not be associated with the s ame macroeconomic outcomes ev en when their 
values are identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held 
constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close the output gap at the end of this timeframe 
whereas, in the Tealbook baseline , the real federal funds rate can vary over time. Distinct paths 
of real short-term rates can, in turn, generate different paths  for inflation and economic activity. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derive d from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation; this period 
extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are 
conducted under the assumption that market participants as well  as price and wage setters have 
perfect foresight, and are predicated on the staff’s extended T ealbook projection, which includes 
the macroeconomic effects of the  Committee’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter.  However, when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent 
quarter.

COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICY UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimiz e a discounted sum of 
weighted squared deviations of four-quarter headline PCE inflation ( ߨ௧ ௣௖௘) from the Committee’s 
2 percent objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate (this differe nce is also known as the unemployment rate gap, ݌ܽ݃ݑ௧), and of 
squared changes in the federal funds rate.  The resulting loss function, shown below, embeds the 
assumptions that policymakers discount the future using a quart erly discount factor ߚ ൌ 0.9963 
and place equal weights on square d deviations of inflation, the unemployment gap, and federal 
funds rate changes (that is, ߣ గ ൌߣ௨௚௔௣ ൌߣோ).

The optimal control policy is the path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the above 
loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to the effective low er bound constraint on nominal 
interest rates, under the assumption of perfect foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended 
Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds  rate are taken as given and 
subsumed within the Tealbook base line.  The path chosen by poli cymakers today is assumed to 
be credible, meaning that decision makers in the model see this  path as being a binding 
commitment on the future Committees; the optimal control policy  takes as given the initial lagged 
value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to 
the simulation period.  The discounted losses are calculated over a period that ends sufficiently 
far into the future that extendi ng that period farther would no t affect the policy prescriptions 
shown in the exhibits.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
The Tealbook presents three polic y alternatives—labeled Alternative A, 
Alternative B, and Alternative C—for the Committee’s considerat ion.  Key 
considerations for the Committee at this meeting will be whethe r conditions that warrant 
increasing the target range a re in place now, and if not, what to convey about the 
prospects that such conditions will be in place by the time of the June FOMC meeting.  
Alternative B maintains the current target range while keeping open the option for a 
target range adjustment in June.  It allows policymakers to wai t and see additional data 
without giving a firm indicati on of the likely timing of the ne xt policy move.  
Alternative A specifies conditions for raising th e target range  that would likely be 
perceived by market participants  as unlikely to be met in the n ear term.  Alternative C 
increases the target range and w ould thereby lead market partic ipants to expect that 
further gradual increases woul d likely be forthcoming this year .  
The drafts of Alternatives A, B, and C each begin by noting that labor market 
conditions have improved further , but then give differing descriptions of recent and 
expected economic activity.  While Alternative A states that economic activity “has 
slowed” recently, Alternative B and Alternative C say that econ omic activity “appears to 
have slowed,” suggesting that th e current estimates of weak GDP  growth in the first 
quarter may understate the fundame ntal strength of economic act ivity.  Alternative B 
reinforces that suggestion by indi cating that, while growth in household spending in 
particular has moderated, “househol ds’ real income has risen at  a solid rate and consumer 
sentiment remains high;” Altern ative C simply looks through the recent step-down in 
household spending growth.  Alterna tive A is less sanguine, sta ting that growth of 
household spending has declined without highlighting the positive fundamentals.  
Looking forward, Alternative B and Alternative C repeat languag e from the March 
statement noting the Committee’ s expectation that “economic act ivity will expand at a 
moderate pace.”  Alternative A e xpresses an expe ctation that ec onomic growth “will pick 
up to a moderate pace.” 
In light of incoming data indica ting that 12-month inflation mo derated in 
February and March after risi ng for a number of months, all three alternatives drop the 
language from the March statement that inflation “picked up in recent months,” though 
Alternative C still gives some attention to the earlier increas e by stating that “inflation

has stepped up since last year.”   The three alternatives convey  different degrees of 
concern about inflation continuing to run below 2 percent, with  those readings “largely” 
reflecting earlier declines in e nergy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports 
according to Alternative C, “partly” reflecting those factors a ccording to Alternative B, 
and “only partly” in Alternative  A.  Each alternative notes that the Committee will 
closely monitor inflation.  Altern ative A also expresses concer n about indicators of 
longer-term inflation expectations, noting that the Committee w ill be closely monitoring 
these measures as well.  All three statements reaffirm the Comm ittee’s expectation that 
inflation will “remain low in the  near term,” in part because o f earlier declines in energy 
prices, but that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory 
effects of these declines dissipa te and as the labor market str engthens further. 
The three alternatives contai n substantially different assessme nts of the risks to 
the outlook.  Alternativ e B drops the statement from March that global economic and 
financial developments pose risk s to economic activity and the labor market, but adds 
those developments to the set of  things that the Committee “con tinues to closely 
monitor,” along with inflation indi cators.  The change is inten ded to allow the inference 
that the Committee views downsid e risks from global development s as less pressing but 
still a matter of concern.  In c ontrast, Alternative A cautions that the Committee “sees 
downside risks” to the economi c outlook.  Alternative C returns  to statement language 
from October, stating that the C ommittee “sees the risks to the  outlook for both economic 
activity and the labor mark et as nearly balanced.” 
In the policy decision, Alternative B maintains the current tar get range and 
repeats paragraphs 3 and 4 of the March statement.  By contrast, Alternative A 
communicates a judgment that the economic outlook and associate d risks warrant 
deferring increases in the target range “until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a 
sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced.”  The 
staff forecast presented in Tealbook A suggests that the inflat ion condition is unlikely to 
be met in short order.  By the time these inflation and risk conditions are met, the labor 
market could have strengthened sub stantially fur ther, a situati on that would call for 
relatively rapid increases in t he target range.  Accordingly, A lternative A drops the 
indication that futur e adjustments to the stance of policy will  be “only gradual.”  
Alternative C raises the tar get range by 25 basis points and maintains the existing 
guidance about future monetary po licy actions, consistent with a view that the economy 
will likely evolve in a way that will warrant further gradual i ncreases in the federal funds 
rate target range.

MARCH 2016 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in January 
suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the 
global economic and financial developments of recent months.  H ousehold spending 
has been increasing at a modera te rate, and the housing sector has improved further; 
however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional st rengthening of the labor 
market.  Inflation picked up in rec ent months; however, it continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run o bjective, partly reflecting d eclines in energy 
prices and in prices of non-ener gy imports.  Market-based measu res of inflation 
compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term i nflation 
expectations are little change d, on balance, in recent months. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee currently expect s that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market in dicators will continue to stre ngthen.  However, 
global economic and financial developments continue to pose ris ks.  Inflation is 
expected to remain low in the  near term, in part because of ear lier declines in energy 
prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the tr ansitory effects of 
declines in energy and import pric es dissipate and the labor ma rket strengthens 
further.  The Committee continue s to monitor inflation developments closely. 
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ per cent.  The stance of monetary p olicy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run.  H owever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data.

1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in January 
March suggests indicates  that labor market conditions have improved further 
even as grow th in  economic activity has been expa nding at a moderate pace despit e 
the global econom ic and financi al developments of recent months appears to have 
slow ed.  Household spending has been incr easing at a moderate rate, a nd the housing 
sector has improved further;  however, business fixed investment  and net exports have 
been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to 
additional strengthening of the l abor market.  Inflation picked  up in recent months 
has stepped up since last year ; however, though it has continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run o bjective, partly reflectin g largely because of 
earlier  declines in energy prices and in falling  prices of non-energy imports.  Market-
based measures of inflation compens ation remain low; survey-based measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balan ce, in recent months. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Weighing information received ove r the intermeeting period abou t the labor 
market, spending, and foreign economi c and financial developmen ts, policymakers may 
view the data as consistent, on ba lance, with their modal forec asts at the time of the 
March FOMC meeting.  Although weaker -than-expected readings on components of final 
demand led to downward revisions i n GDP projections for the fir st quarter, labor market 
conditions have continued to imp rove, with nonfarm payroll empl oyment expanding 
solidly through March and the lab or force participation rate mo ving up for six 
consecutive months.  Moreover, f inancial conditions have contin ued to improve, on 
balance, and foreign output growt h appears to have picked up.  Thus, policymakers may 
think that sluggish domestic output  growth is likely to prove t ransitory, and expect a 
return to moderate growth in the rest of the year.  Regarding i nflation, policymakers may 
view the recent deceleration as simply reversing the impact of erratic components and 
volatile seasonal movements earl ier this year.  While measures of inflation compensation 
and longer-run inflation expecta tions have remained soft, polic ymakers may continue to 
judge that this softn ess likely reflects changes in risk and li quidity premiums and the 
well-known excess sensitivity of  survey responses to gasoline prices. 
In light of such an assessment of recent developments and the o utlook, and in 
particular, given the large downw ard revision in projected grow th for the first quarter, 
policymakers may judge it prudent to wait for evidence that dom estic demand is 
rebounding, or that job growth does not slow appreciably, befor e taking the next step in 
normalizing the stance of moneta ry policy.  Policymakers may al so prefer to avoid 
signaling the timing of the next policy move, and instead want to emphasize the 
data-dependent nature of policy de cisions and the FOMC’s commit ment to achieving its 
inflation goal.  In addition, policymakers might judge that downside risks from global 
economic and financial developments  are less acute than in Marc h but still large enough 
to warrant concern, and thus bear  close watching.  With nominal  interest rates close to the 
effective lower bound, policymakers might conclude that the optimal response to such risks is to choose a shallower  path for the federal funds rate than would otherwise be 
appropriate. 
Some participants may judge it un likely that an increase in the  target range will be 
warranted in the near term.  In light of still historically low  readings on measures of 
inflation compensation and exp ectations, they may have become less confident that 
inflation will move up to 2 percent .  Or they may view the low sensitivity of inflation to 
Alternatives

resource utilization as requiring a period of unemployment well  below its longer-run 
normal rate to ensure a retur n of inflation to 2 percent over t he medium run.  
Nevertheless, those who judge t hat the outlook and risks to the outlook make near-term 
rate hikes inadvisable may conclude that, by not increasing the  target range in April, the 
Committee would go far enough, for now , in reinforcing the mess age that policy is data 
dependent and that the FOMC is committed to achieving both of its dual mandate goals.  
In addition, they may see the new language indicating that the Committee is closely 
monitoring inflation and global economic and financial developm ents as continuing to 
provide an appropriate signal  of concern about t he risks to the  outlook.  
Other policymakers may see th e incoming data, in particular the continued strong 
job gains, as providing additional evidence that the economic e xpansion is resilient and 
that worries about the recent ma rket volatilit y and foreign dev elopments significantly 
restraining the U.S. economy are exaggerated.  They might also point to solid household 
balance sheets and measures of c onsumer confidence as suggestin g that the fundamentals 
for domestic demand are strong.  These policymakers may view the higher inflation readings this year, the modera te rebound in oil prices and lowe r level of the dollar, and 
the further strengthening of the  labor market as reinforcing th e expectation that inflation 
will rise toward 2 percent over the medium term.  That said, th ese policymakers may note 
that again postponing the decisi on to raise the target range un til the next meeting is 
unlikely to generate large costs  because real GDP growth remain s moderate, inflation 
continues to run below 2 percent , wage growth is tepid, measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations are at or below nor mal levels, and asset valuation  pressures are generally 
moderate.  Moreover, these policym akers may recognize that the Committee could 
readily tighten policy somewhat more rapidly than expected by m arkets were it 
necessary, and that the language in Alternative B emphasizing the Committee’s pursuit of a data-dependent approach indica tes that the Committee stands r eady to do so.   
A decision to maintain the curr ent target range would be largel y in line with the 
expectations of financial marke t participants.  According to th e Desk’s latest Survey of 
Primary Dealers and Survey of Mar ket Participants, respondents perceive there to be only 
a negligible probability that the Committee will alter the targ et range at this meeting.  
Many respondents expect the Comm ittee to indicate that risks fr om abroad have 
diminished; many also expect the  statement to recognize the wea kness in first-quarter 
spending.  Moreover, respondents do not anticipate any changes to the Committee’s 
forward guidance or reinvestment  policy (that is, to paragraphs 4 or 5 of the statement), 
both of which Alternative B main tains.  In terms of the Committee’s actions in the future, 
Alternatives

Alternative B may not lead marke t participants to significantly  increase the odds they 
place on a target range increase at the June meeting from its current level of roughly 20 
percent.  Rather, Alternative B may lead market participants to  increase those odds over 
time if data received between the April and June meetings prove to be largely consistent 
with the Committee’s expectation for a re bound in growth of spe nding and real GDP, and 
for continued solid job gains. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers might view the continued improvement in labor mark et data as 
having brought the econo my to maximum sustainable employment, o r close to it.  Based 
in part on repeated experience with weak first-quarter growth i n recent years, they may 
also see the slowdown in first qua rter GDP growth as transitory .  Moreover, 
policymakers may judge that condit ions remain favorable for sol id consumption growth 
and further improvement in the  housing sector even with a further increase in the target 
range.  Household balance sheets ha ve improved, gains in dispos able income have been 
healthy, consumer confidence is high, job prospects are good, a nd, as explored in a box in 
Tealbook A, low gasoline prices are providing a boost to consum er spending.  Finally, 
they may view the risks to the e conomic outlook as nearly balan ced, and see the 
downside risk from global economic and financial developments i n particular as having 
diminished compared with earlier  this year.  Policymakers might view alternative 
scenarios such as the “Stronger Foreign Growth and Weaker Dolla r” or “Weaker Labor 
Productivity, Stronger Labor Market”  scenarios in the “Risks an d Uncertainty” section of 
Tealbook A as increasingly likely.  Consequently, they may no longer see a case for delaying the next increase in the federal funds rate.
1 
Regarding the Committee’s infla tion objective, policymakers may  note that 
various measures of the trend i n inflation have moved closer to  2 percent than was the 
case last year, with the 12- month change in core PCE inflation  and the Dallas Fed’s 
trimmed mean PCE inflation e dging up to 1.7 percent and 1.8 per cent, respectively, in 
February.  These policymakers may conclude that the effect of t ransitory factors has 
begun to subside, given the recent firming in oil prices and de cline in the dollar.  
Moreover, participants may have  only limited concerns about low  readings on longer-
1 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in the dr aft statement for Alternative C as 
premature in present circumstan ces but might nonetheless discus s whether this language, especially 
paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, would be appropriate when the time arri ves for another increase  in the target range 
for the federal funds rate.

term inflation compensation because they judge that these indic ators are depressed by 
movements in liquidity and risk premiums that are unrelated to longer-run inflation 
outcomes.  Similarly, they may attr ibute the softening in the m edian Michigan survey 
respondent’s expectation of ave rage inflation over the coming 5 or 10 years to the 
transitory influences of earlier declines in gaso line prices ra ther than to a reduction in 
expected inflation over the longer run.  Therefore, policymakers may have confidence 
that headline inflation will be  close to the 2 percent objective once the effects of earlier 
declines in energy and import pric es fade, and that the project ed further tightening of the 
labor market will suffice to return headline inflation to the C ommittee’s longer-run 
objective. 
These policymakers might further  argue that continuing to leave  rates unchanged 
in the face of rapid job growth and a closed unemployment rate gap would likely foster 
expectations of a prolonged shall ow path for the federal funds rate that would be 
insufficiently responsive to ec onomic conditions, creating exce ss demand and risking an 
upward drift in inflation expect ations, and thus eventually mak ing it necessary to raise the 
federal funds rate rapidly rather than gradually.  Leaving the stance of monetary policy 
unchanged thus runs the risk that inflation will persistently o vershoot 2 percent, eliciting 
an upward drift in inflation exp ectations.  In addition, such a n expected path could induce 
further “reach for yield” or exces sive risk-taking behavior in financial markets.   
Some policymakers might also bel ieve that monetary policy should focus 
primarily on progress toward the Committee's longer-run objecti ves.  These policymakers 
may be concerned that the public might misinterpret a statement  like Alternative B as an 
indication that the FOMC is continuing to place too much weight on transitory financial 
and economic developments, and too little weight on a solid cen tral outlook for the 
economy, labor markets, and inflation.  
For all of the above reasons, the se policymakers may judge that  it is appropriate 
to announce a 25 basis point increa se in the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to 
¾ percent, as in Alternative C .  Policymakers may note that, ev en with this increase, the 
real federal funds rate would s till lie well below the Tealbook -consistent estimate of the 
equilibrium real federal funds r ate reported in t he “Monetary P olicy Strategie s” section of 
Tealbook B.  An increase in the tar get range would also be cons istent with the level of the 
federal funds rate prescribe d by the optimal control policy rep orted there.

Respondents to the Desk’s latest  surveys perceive there to be n o material odds 
that the Committee will change t he target range at this meeting , and so a decision to 
increase the target range would be very surprising.  If market participants infer that, all 
else equal, the Committee intends to pursue a less accommodativ e stance of policy going 
forward than they had expected, th en medium- and longer-term re al interest rates would 
rise, equity prices and inflati on compensation would likely decline, and the dollar would 
appreciate.  In addition, financia l market volatility might inc rease, given responses to the 
Desk’s survey which attribute some of the recent decline in vol atility to Federal Reserve 
communication signaling a flatter  path for the federal funds ra te.  However, if investors 
see a statement like Alternative C as primarily reflecting an u pbeat assessment of the 
strength of the U.S. expansion and the economic outlook, then e quity prices and inflation 
compensation might fall less th an otherwise, or even rise.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Though the Committee has made substantial cumulative progress t oward its 
employment objective, policymaker s might stress that both core and headline inflation 
have run below 2 percent for a number of years, and project that headline inflation will 
linger at low levels well into 2016 because of earlier movement s in the exchange value of 
the dollar and in the prices of  oil and other commodities.  The se policymakers may note 
that FOMC participants, the st aff, and many other forecasters, have repeatedly 
overpredicted inflation in recen t years, and that, as shown in Tealbook A, the inflation 
forecast for 2016 has been revised down on net since the Decemb er Tealbook.2  These 
policymakers might want to see actual inflation move more convi ncingly toward their 
objective before increasing the target range.  Such policymakers may be hesitant to 
continue to predicate their  policy decisions on inflation forec asts that hinge on the weak 
and imprecisely estimated rela tionship between inflation and la bor market slack and on 
the assumption that inflation expectations are, and will remain , well anchored.  In sum, 
these policymakers might prefer  a statement along the lines of Alternative A, which 
asserts that the Committee judge s that an increas e in the targe t range “will not be 
warranted until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustai ned basis and the risks to 
the economic outlook are more closely balanced.” 
Policymakers might also find the unexpected weakness of spendin g indicators for 
the first quarter to be a cause  for concern.  They may view the data as weaker than can be

explained by any identifiable tr ansitory factors, and note that  the slowdown was broad-
based.  In addition, while policymakers may recognize the posit ive tone of incoming data 
on the labor market, they may believe that more still needs to be done to reach maximum 
employment.  The still-high rate  of involuntary part-time emplo yment, the low level of 
the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers, and t he surprisingly limited 
extent to which aggregate data  have indicated upward pressure o n wage growth may all 
suggest some remaining slack in labor markets.  Policymakers ma y also see virtues in 
allowing the labor market to firm more, beyond simply taking up  slack, in order to induce 
increased labor force participa tion over the medium term as a w ay of repairing the 
damage to the labor market that  resulted from a prolonged perio d of weak labor demand. 
In terms of the domestic economic outlook, policymakers might a rgue that the 
global economic and financial s ituation continues to pose downside risks, and see the 
factors that led to sharp deter ioration in financial conditions  earlier this year as still 
largely unaddressed.  Policymakers might also see new risks eme rging in the global 
outlook, such as those discussed i n the “Disorderly Brexit” sce nario in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A .  They might observe that, given the proximity to the 
effective lower bound, the scope for conventional policy measur es to support the 
economy would be quickly exhausted in the event that scenarios worse than those 
portrayed in Tealbook A were t o materialize.  In addition, poli cymakers might judge that 
the neutral rate of interest is l ow relative to its historical norm and likely to remain so for 
quite some time, thus exacerbating the risk that conventional p olicy could be constrained 
going forward.  They might also ju dge that unconventional monet ary policies provide 
imperfect substitutes for conventional policy.  Therefore, these policymakers may believe 
that risk management considerations call for signaling that any  further removal of policy 
accommodation is some time off.   
Policymakers might also worry that the failure of inflation to rise to target over 
the past several years has beco me ingrained in longer-term infl ation expectations.  They 
might note that the preliminary A pril reading of the Michigan s urvey measure of longer-
term inflation expectations decl ined to a very low level, and t hat the New York Fed’s 
measure of three-year-ahead expe cted inflation remains at the low end of its historical 
range.  They might add that market -based measures of inflation compensation have been 
at low levels for so long that it  is difficult to believe that these declines are entirely due to 
liquidity and risk premiums, and view an alternativ e scenario such as “Lower Long-Term 
Inflation Expectations” in the “ Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A as likely.  
On balance, they may see the weakness in those various measures  as suggesting that the 
Alternatives

inflation expectations relevan t for wage and price setting have  declined slightly.  Some 
policymakers might further dismiss the recent uptick in core in flation as likely to prove 
transitory, and instea d point to the recent  decline in wage inf lation to the low levels seen 
over the past several years as e vidence that there is little up ward pressure from resource 
utilization and little reason to be c onfident that inflation wi ll return to 2 percent in the 
medium term absent a stronger commitment to bring inflation to that level.  Moreover, 
these policymakers might argue that the chronic failure of poli cy to return inflation 
toward 2 percent risks eroding the credibility of the FOMC’s commitment to achieving 
that objective, or the credibil ity of the claim that deviations from this objective are 
considered on a symmetric basis.   
Most respondents in the Desk’s la test surveys expect the Commit tee to continue 
to emphasize the gradual natu re of its normalization approach a nd to convey that it still 
expects to raise rates this year.  Many respondents also report ed an expectation that the 
April statement would note an i mprovement in global financial m arket conditions.  
Therefore, the issuance of a postmeeting statement like Alterna tive A would surprise 
financial market participants .  Investors would likely push fur ther into the future the 
expected date of the next rate increase, the expected path for the federal funds rate would 
likely flatten further, and longer-term yields would decline.  If the statement is primarily 
seen as more accommodative, equity prices and inflation compens ation might rise, and 
the dollar would depreciate.  But if investors interpret the st atement as reflecting an 
unexpectedly downbeat assessment of global economic conditions and greater-than-
anticipated concerns over the dow nside risks to the outlook, eq uity prices and inflation 
compensation could fall.

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and key 
elements of the associated income statement under two scenarios  for the paths of 
monetary policy and longer-term in terest rates.  The first set of projections (labeled 
“April Tealbook baseline” in the accompanying exhibits) reflects the policy assumptions 
incorporated in the staff’s base line forecast presented in Teal book A.  The second set 
(labeled “Higher term premiums”)  incorporates a steeper near-te rm path for term 
premiums on longer-duration Treas ury securities, as assumed in the scenario labeled 
“Sharp Increases in Term Premiums” in the Risks and Uncertainty  section of Tealbook A. 
The paths of interest rates a nd macroeconomic variables differ across the two 
scenarios.  In the April Tealbook ba seline scenario, term premiums on Treasury securities 
increase gradually from current ne gative levels to their histor ical averages.  In the higher 
term premiums scenario, term prem iums return to their historica l averages more abruptly 
than in the baseline, rising more than 200 basis points in one year.  The resulting sharp 
increases in various interest rates trigger a sl owdown in economic growth.  
Under both scenarios, the federal funds rate is determined by an inertial version of 
the Taylor (1999) rule.  In additi on, reinvestments of maturing Treasury securities and 
agency debt as well as princip al received on agency MBS are ass umed to cease at the end 
of 2016 when the federal funds rat e is projected to be above 1 percent.  Once 
reinvestments cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks through full re demptions of maturing 
Treasury and agency debt securiti es as well as paydowns of principal from agency MBS.  
Regarding the Federal Reserve’s  use of its policy normalization  tools, the scenarios 
assume that overnight reverse r epurchase agreements (ON RRPs) r un at a level of 
$100 billion through the end of 2018 be fore declining to zero b y the end of 2019, and that 
term deposits and term RRPs are not used.1  Some key features of the two scenarios are 
highlighted below. 
1 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the overall size of the balance sheet.  We also assume that RRPs associated with

 Balance sheet. Under the baseline scenario, the size of the portfolio is 
normalized in the third quarter of 2021, unchanged from the Mar ch Tealbook (see 
the solid black lines in the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet 
Items” and the table that follows).2  At that time, total assets are projected to stand 
at $2.4 trillion, with about $2.2 tri llion in total SOMA securi ties holdings.  Total 
assets and SOMA Treasury holdings r ise thereafter , keeping pace  with the 
increases in both Federal Res erve notes in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank 
capital. 
Under the higher term premiums scenario, even though higher int erest rates on 
longer-dated Treasury securitie s put upward pressure on mortgag e rates, the 
trajectory of MBS prepayments is  only slightly lower than in the baseline.  
Consequently, the path of the ba lance sheet after reinvestments  cease at the end of 
2016 is not meaningfully different from the baseline scenario. 
 Federal Reserve earnings remittances. After record remittances to the Treasury 
in 2015 of nearly $100 billion, remitt ances under the baseline scenario are 
projected to decline to about $79 billion this year (see the so lid black lines in the 
“Income Projections” exhibit).3  The large step-down in 2016 primarily reflects 
increased interest expense on reserves.  Annual remittances con tinue to decline in 
subsequent years, reaching a low of roughly $29 billion in 2019, with no deferred 
foreign official and international accounts remain near their M arch 31, 2016, level of $247 billion 
throughout the projection period. 
2 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend, which is determ ined largely by currency in circulation and a 
projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  The projecte d timing of the normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet depends importa ntly on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct 
monetary policy; currently, we a ssume that level of reserve balances to be $100 billion.  However, ongoing 
regulatory and structural change s could result in a higher underlying demand for reserve balances.  In turn, 
a higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all els e equal, imply an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a $500 billion s teady-state level of r eserve balances, the 
balance sheet would likely normalize at the end of 2020. 
3 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balanc es will average about 15 basis 
points above the effective federa l funds rate and the ON RRP ra te will average about 10 basis points below 
the effective federal funds rate.

asset being recorded.4  Under this scenario, the Fede ral Reserve’s cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2025 total about $1.1 trillion. 
Under the higher term premiums scenario, cumulative remittances  over the 2009 
to 2025 period are projected to b e about $71 billion greater th an in the baseline 
projection, reflecting h igher interest income and, to a larger extent, lower interest 
expense through the projection per iod (see the da shed blue lines in the “Income 
Projections” exhibit).  Regarding interest income, the lower tr ajectory of MBS 
prepayments results in slightly greater MBS coupon income.  Reg arding interest 
expense, the sudden increase in t erm premiums leads to a tighte ning in overall 
financial conditions, inducing higher unemployment and a weaken ing in the pace 
of economic expansion.  As a consequence, because of the wider output gap, the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule implie s that the federal funds rate  increases at a slower 
pace than in the baseline scenario, and that fatter path for th e funds rate is 
reflected in a slower increase in IOER and interest expense. 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of about $219 billion at the end o f March.5  Going 
forward, the net unrealized gain or  loss position of the portfolio will depend 
importantly on the path of longer-term interest rates.  Under t he baseline scenario, 
because of the assumed rise in l onger-term interest rates over the next several 
years, the portfolio is projected to shift to a position of unrealized loss at the start 
of 2017, about one quarter later than estimated in the March Te albook.  The 
delayed onset of a net unrealized  loss position reflects a slig htly lower path for 
long-term interest rates.  The  portfolio is then expected to re cord a peak 
unrealized loss of about $230 bill ion in 2019, close to what was projected in the 
March Tealbook.  At that time , of the $230 billion loss, about $90 billion is 
attributable to losses on holdings of Treasury securities and $ 140 billion to losses 
on holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position then c ontracts through 
2025, as the value of securities previously acquired under the large-scale asset

its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset for int erest on Federal Reserve notes would be

purchase programs mature and new securities are added to the po rtfolio at 
prevailing market yields. 
Under the higher term premiums s cenario, the portfolio is proje cted to shift to a 
position of unrealized loss next qua rter, as the sudden increase in term premiums 
triggers price drops in SOMA Treasury and MBS holdings.  The ma rk-to-market 
value of the portfolio declines  more precipitously than in the baseline scenario, 
recording a peak unrealized loss of about $300 billion in 2017.   The net 
unrealized loss position of the  SOMA portfolio under both scenarios converge in 
2020, in line with the corresponding paths for longer-term interest rates.   
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” unde r the baseline scenario, the Federal 
Reserve’s elevated stock of longer-term securities is estimated  to hold down the 
term premium embedded in the 10 -year Treasury yield by 103 basi s points in the 
current quarter.  Over the next c ouple of years, the estimated term premium effect 
diminishes at a pace of about 4 basis points per quarter , reflecting in part the 
gradual projected shrinking of t he portfolio.  The projection f or the term premium 
effect under the baseline scenario is about unchanged from the March Tealbook. 
Under the higher term premiums  scenario, because the path of th e SOMA 
portfolio is not meaningfully diffe rent from the baseline scenario, there is little 
change in the term premium effect  stemming from SOMA holdings.6 
 SOMA Characteristics.   Regarding the size of t he portfolio, under both the 
baseline and the higher term premiums scenarios, approximately $216 billion in 
SOMA Treasury holdings will matu re this year, and a total of $1 .3 trillion will 
mature between 2016 and 2020 (see th e top panel of the exhibit “Projections for 
the Characteristics of SOMA Holdings”).7  The amounts of Treasury securities 
6 The overall term premium on long er-dated Treasury securities r eflects investors’ willingness to 
bear interest rate risk as well as the effects of the elevated stock of longer-term securities in the Federal 
Reserve’s portfolio.  The spike in the term premium assumed in the context of the “Sharp Increases in Term 
Premiums” scenario is entirely driven by the first component an d is thus unrelated to the effect stemming 
from the Federal Reserve’s portfolio holdings. 
7 While following its current reinvestment policy, the Desk repl aces maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the

maturing each month vary considerably, while projected MBS payd owns are 
much less variable.  However, r ealized MBS paydowns will reflec t the evolution 
over time of interest rates a nd other factors and could thus be  significantly more 
volatile than projected. 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6½ years (see the bottom panel of  the exhibit).  Under the base line and the higher 
term premiums scenarios, it is projected to be about four and five months shorter, 
respectively, at the end of this year.8  The weighted-average duration is projected 
to decline through 2017 under both scenarios, reflecting the en d of reinvestments 
as well as the aging of the portf olio, and subsequently to rise  through 2021, when 
the size of the balance sheet is normalized.9  After reaching its peak, duration is 
projected to resume its decline in both scenar ios as the Desk s tarts purchasing 
Treasury securities to keep pace w ith the increase in currency.   In particular, the 
duration contour in this latte r portion of the projection is ba sed on the key 
assumption that the Federal Reserve will buy only Treasury bills until those 
holdings are equal to approximate ly 30 percent of the Treasury portfolio, similar 
to the pre-crisis composition of  the portfolio (currently there  are no Treasury bill 
holdings).  Thereafter, purchases  of Treasury securities are as sumed to be spread 
across the maturity spectrum.10 
value of holdings maturing on the issue date of a newly issued security.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are p laced as noncompetitive tenders and are treated as a dd-ons to announced 
auction sizes. 
8 The July 2015 Tealbook B box “History and Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA 
Treasury Holdings” provides more information on the duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio. 
9 The duration of the SOMA Treas ury portfolio initially declines once reinvestments cease, as 
Treasury securities in the portfolio approach maturity.  Once t he pace of roll-offs accel erates starting in 
2018 and longer tenor securities  account for a larger share in the remaining portfolio, duration increases 
until the balance sheet  is normalized.    
10 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments cea se.
