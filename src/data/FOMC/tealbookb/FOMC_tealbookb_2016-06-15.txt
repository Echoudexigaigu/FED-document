Monetary Policy Strategies 
The top panel of the first exhibit, “P olicy Rules and the Staff Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions for the federa l funds rate from four policy rules:  the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an inertial vers ion of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap and inflation in the near term , shown in the middle panels.  
The top panel also includes as an addendum the staff’s baseline projection for the federal 
funds rate.  All three Taylor-t ype rules call for values of th e federal funds rate above the 
Tealbook baseline in the second half of 2016.  The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) 
rules, which feature no interest rate smoothing term, call for larger increases in the near 
term than the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the first-differe nce rule.  The prescriptions 
of the Taylor-type rules are similar to t hose in the April Tealbook because the staff’s 
revisions to inflation and the output gap in the near term are small and have offsetting 
effects.  The first-difference rule calls for leve ls of the federal funds rate that are slightly 
lower than in April because this rule is  forward-looking and responds to the staff’s 
projection of slower output growth over the next four quart ers; the near-term 
prescriptions of that rule are a little belo w the Tealbook baseline. 
The bottom panel of the exhibit report s the estimate of a Tealbook-consistent, 
medium-term notion of the equilibrium real fede ral funds rate that is generated using the 
FRB/US model.  This Te albook-consistent FRB/US r* corresponds to the level of the real 
federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-quarter period, woul d close the output gap 
in the final quarter of that period in the model.  The current-quarter estimate of r*, at 
0.96 percent, is below the estimate derived fr om the staff’s outlook in April, reflecting 
lower levels of resource utilization in the current projection.  The pane l also reports the 
average level of the real federal funds ra te in the Tealbook base line projection for the 
same 12-quarter period used to compute r*. 2  This average is -0.05 percent, about 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules.  The intercepts of the 
rules, where applicable, are constant and equal the staff’s  estimate of the real federal funds rate in the long 
run, which the staff revised down 25 basis points in  the current Tealbook to 1 percent.  To facilitate 
comparisons, the prescriptions labeled “Previous Teal book, adjusted” reflect th e current values of the 
intercepts.

12-quarter period, they need not be associated w ith the same macroeconomic outcomes even when their

     1. The lines denoted "Previous Tealbook, adjusted" report rule prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook
using the current rule specifications, where intercept terms have been adjusted for the staff's downward revision to the
longer−run real federal funds rate, and where rules with the lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable are conditional on
the current−Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
     2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that
period. The "average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same
12−quarter period as the Tealbook FRB/US r *. Statistics from the previous Tealbook have been adjusted to reflect the staff's
downward revision to the longer−run real federal funds rate as well as the introduction of a time−varying intercept in the
interest rate reaction function.

1 percentage point below the estim ate of Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*.  The 
difference between r* and the average projected real fede ral funds rate is  a little larger 
than in the April Tealbook as a result of the downward revision of the projected output 
gap. 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simula tions,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under the Taylor (1993) ru le, the Taylor (1999) rule, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, and th e first-difference rule.  These simulations reflect the 
endogenous responses of the output gap and infl ation when the federal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the different policy rules.3  The intercept terms of the Taylor rules 
correspond to the staff’s assumption that the l onger-run normal level of the real federal 
funds rate equals 1 percent.  The results for each rule presented in  these and subsequent 
simulations depend importantly on the assumpti ons that policymakers will adhere to the 
rule in the future, and that market participants as well as price and wage setters fully understand the implications for real activ ity and inflation of the policy rule. 
Starting with this Tealbook, the baseline polic y path in the staff forecast is based 
on a modified version of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a time-varying intercept.
4 
The implications of this adjustment to the intercept in the model can be seen by 
comparing the outcomes under the inertial Ta ylor rule, which contains no adjustment, 
with those of the baseline.  In the Tealbook baseline, the nominal federal funds rate 
increases by an average of ¼ percentage poi nt per quarter through the fourth quarter of 
2018, when it reaches 2.6 percent.  The pace of tightening subsequently slows, and the 
federal funds rate peaks at 3.6 percent in 2021, before eventually retu rning to its longer-
run normal level of 3 percent.  The inertial Ta ylor (1999) rule prescrib es a slightly higher 
path for the federal funds rate than in th e Tealbook baseline because, until late 2018, its 
intercept is higher than in the modified version of the rule used to construct the baseline.  
values are identical.  The reas on is that, when calculating r*, the real federal funds rate is held constant 
over the entire 12-quarter period, whereas, in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal funds rate can vary 
over time.  Distinct paths of real short-term rates can , in turn, generate different paths for inflation and 
economic activity, even if they have  the same 12-quarter average. 
3 Because of these endogenous responses, prescr iptions from the dynamic simulations can differ 
from those shown in the top panel of the first exhibit. 
4 The Taylor-type rules used in the exhibit do not incorporate time-varying intercepts.  For a 
discussion of the intercept adjustment made to the Tealbook baseline policy rule, see Christopher Erceg, 
Etienne Gagnon, David L ópez-Salido, Matthias Paustian, and James Trevino (2016), “Changes to the

Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of the tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline
inflation rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

However, this difference in policy rates is t oo small and short-lived to have a material 
effect on the real longer-term interest rates that influen ce economic activity in FRB/US, 
so macroeconomic outcomes are very  similar to the Tealbook baseline. 
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate sharp tightening 
and produce paths for the real federal funds ra te that lie significantly above the Tealbook 
baseline path over the next few years.  The sh arp initial tightening occurs in part because 
these rules do not include lagged values of the federal funds rate as a determinant of their 
current policy prescriptions.  With the output  gap essentially close d, core inflation only 
½ percentage point below the Committee’s objectiv e, and an intercept term of 1 percent, 
the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules pr escribe rates that are ½ percentage point 
below their longer-run level of 3 percent in the near term.  Ov er the next few years, these 
rules would cause the unemploy ment rate to undershoot the staff’s estimate of the natural 
rate by less than in the sta ff’s baseline projection.  The Taylor (1999) rule calls for 
somewhat higher policy rates than the Taylor (1993) rule over th e period shown because 
it places more weight on the output gap and output is projected to rise above potential for 
the next few years.  As a consequence, the Taylor (1999) rule generates a higher 
trajectory of the unemployment rate and a slight ly lower trajectory of inflation than the 
Taylor (1993) rule. 
The first-difference rule prescribes a mode rately higher path for the federal funds 
rate through 2018 than in the Teal book baseline.  Thereafter, th e federal funds rate levels 
off under the first-difference rule, whereas it keeps rising under the Tealbook baseline.  
This divergence occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to the sl ower pace of economic 
growth projected late in th e decade.  The lower path of the federal funds rate beyond 
2018 under the first-difference rule , in conjunction with expect ations of higher price and 
wage inflation in the future, implies lowe r longer-term real ra tes over the entire 
projection period, as well as higher levels of resource utilization and inflation.  The first-
difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate over the forecast period 
that are markedly below the unemployment rate paths generated under the other policy 
rules and well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.  Accordingly, the first-
difference rule also leads to somewhat highe r inflation over the peri od shown relative to 
the other simple rules.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the box "Optimal Control and the Loss Function" for a motivation

The third exhibit, “Optimal Control Si mulations under Commitment,” displays 
optimal control simulations under different a ssumptions about policymakers’ preferences, 
as captured by four specificat ions of the loss function.  The companion box “Optimal 
Control and the Loss Function” offers motiva tions for these specifications; the appendix 
provides technical details.  The concept of optimal contro l that is employed here 
corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that policymakers make today 
are assumed to constrain future policy choi ces in a way that imp roves overall economic 
outcomes.  The exhibit also shows the current Tealbook baseline forecast. 
The first simulation, labeled “equal weights,” presents the famili ar case in which 
policymakers are assumed to place the same  weights on keeping h eadline PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 percent goal, on k eeping the unemployment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  In the resulting optimal st rategy, the path for the federal funds rate is 
significantly higher than the Tealbook policy path.  This is because, in the current 
baseline projection, unemployment falls well below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate 
over the next several years.  Under the pr eferences embedded in optimal control with 
equal weights, policymakers judge this undersho oting of the natural rate to be costly, 
leading them to tighten policy appreciably more than in the Tealbook baseline.  This 
tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that runs substantially closer to 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflation is slightly lower than in the 
Tealbook baseline over the simula tion period, consistent with lower levels of resource 
utilization. 
The second simulation, labeled “asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss 
function that assigns no cost to unemployment rate outcomes below the natural rate but that is otherwise identical to the specificat ion with equal weights.   In the resulting 
optimal strategy, the path of the federal f unds rate is considerably below both the 
corresponding path in the case of equal weights and the path  in the Tealbook baseline.  
Policymakers choose this relatively low path for the policy rate because the desire to raise 
inflation to 2 percent is not  tempered by any aversion to the undershooting of the natural 
rate of unemployment that helps achieve this  outcome.  In this simulation, the tighter 
labor market causes inflation to reach 2 percen t more quickly than in the case of equal 
weights; inflation then edges above the Co mmittee’s longer-run objective for a few years.

Optimal Control and the Loss Function 
Beginning with the current Tealbook, the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under 
Commitment” presents optimal control simulations of the FRB/US model derived 
using four loss functions, illustrating how policymakers’ preferences concerning 
macroeconomic outcomes influence the choice of a policy path. Each optimal control 
policy is a path of the federal funds rate that minimizes a given loss function in the 
FRB/US model, conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection. The four loss 
functions differ with respect to the weights they assign to the discounted sum of 
squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference between the four quarter change 
in headline PCE prices and the Committe e’s 2 percent objective), unemployment gaps 
(measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate 
of the natural rate), and changes in the federal funds rate. The table below 
summarizes the weights assigned under the four loss functions.1 
Weights on the components in the loss function 
Inflation gap Unemployment gap Changes in the 
federal funds rate ugap<0 ugap≥0 
Equal weights 1 1 1 1 
Asymmetric weight 
on ugap 1 0 1 1 
Large weight 
on inflation gap 5 1 1 1 
Minimal weight on 
rate adjustment 1 1 1 0.01 
The first loss function (labeled “equal weights”) has been featured routinely in past 
Tealbooks; it assigns the same weight to each of the three sources of loss. With these 
penalties for inflation and unemployment gaps, this formulation recognizes the 
Committee’s dual mandate to promote stable prices and maximum employment— 
taking what is arguably a balanced view of the relativ e importance of these gaps to 
policymakers. The loss function also penalizes changes in the federal funds rate, thus 
embodying a preference for policy gradualism. This feature of the loss function may 
reflect a variety of non modeled concerns, such as caution associated with uncertainty 
about the structure and the state of the economy or policymakers’ desire to reduce 
the risks to financial stability from volatility in interest rates.2 
The second loss function (labeled “asymmetric weight on ugap ”) assigns no losses to 
unemployment outcomes below the natural rate but otherwise attaches equal 
weights to all arguments in the loss function. Policymakers with such preferences 
may subscribe to the view that the costs associated with output and employment

delivered at an economics luncheon cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco

falling short of their potential levels by some amount are appreciably larger than the 
costs associated with output and employment exceeding their potential levels to the 
same extent. For example, a sustained period of high unemployment may result in 
the loss of jobspecific skills and, more generally, in a deterioration of human capital; 
by contrast, there is no obvious cost when the unemployment rate is below the 
natural rate. Thus, policymakers who share these preferences may not view low 
unemployment as an undesirable outcome in itself.3 
The third loss function (labeled “large weight on inflation gap”) places a higher 
weight on inflation than the equal weights specification while keeping the weights 
assigned to the unemployment gap and changes in the federal funds rate the same. 
Policymakers with these preferences may be more concerned about the distortionary 
effects of inflation than is an equal weights policymaker. Moreover, they might note 
that, in response to aggregate demand shocks, policies that aim to close the inflation 
gap would also narrow the unemployment gap. Alternatively, placing a relatively high 
weight on inflation deviations can be interpreted as a pragmatic response to 
uncertainty about estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and the risk that 
responding to poorly estimated unemployment gaps could lead to policy mistakes. 
In contrast to the first three loss functions, the fourth loss function (labeled “minimal 
weight on rate adjustments”) describes the preferences of a policymaker who sees 
interest rate changes as entailing little, if any, cost. Such a policymaker may not feel 
burdened by the sort of “non modeled concerns” noted above, or may feel that such 
concerns do not warrant a preference for gradualism. Accordingly, policymakers with 
these preferences would find it desirable to adjust policy rates more quickly and by 
larger amounts in response to shocks to the economy than policymakers who 
penalize changes in the federal funds rate. 
All four loss functions aim to achieve the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objecti ve 
and a zero unemployment gap in the long run. However, the loss functions differ in 
terms of how they trade off deviations from the Committee’s long run objectives over 
the medium run. Accordingly, policymakers whose preferences are represented by 
different loss functions may have different views about which monetary policy 
strategies and associated macroeconomic outcomes are optimal. 
3 In stochastic simulations of a canonical New Keynesian model in which policymakers act under 
discretion and minimize expected losses that are symmetric in the inflation and output gaps, the 
average inflation rate is below policymakers’ objective if policy is occasionally constrained by the 
effective lower bound. By contrast, these policymakers may achieve, on average, an inflation rate 
closer to the central bank’s objective when they attach zero weight on positive output gaps; see

The third simulation, labeled “large we ight on inflation gap,” posits a loss 
function that assigns a cost to above-target or below-target inflation that is five times 
larger than under the specification with equa l weights.  The resulting optimal strategy is 
only a little more accommodative than in th e case with equal weights, even though the 
losses associated with unders hooting the inflation objective in  coming years are markedly 
larger.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US  model, policymakers face an unappealing 
tradeoff because inflation responds little to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers 
would need to engineer a substantial undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment, 
which they see as costly, in order to raise inflation in the near term by a modest amount.5 
The fourth simulation, labeled “minimal weight on rate adjustments,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very small cost to changes in the federal funds rate but is 
otherwise identical to the loss function with equal weights.  In the resulting optimal 
strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the sp ecification with equal weights 
over the next few years in an effort to c ontain the projected undershooting of the natural 
rate of unemployment.  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the real 10-year 
Treasury yield are also higher than in the case of equal weights.  While this policy affects 
the trajectory for inflation relatively little, it keeps the unemployment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate. 
The next four exhibits ta bulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal contro l simulations described above. 
5 If the “large weight on inflation gap” specification did not penalize the unemployment gap at all, 
then the adverse tradeoff would disappear an d policy would be markedly more accommodative.

Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for th e four simple policy rules reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, and the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period ( ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap 
(4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ l onger-run inflation objective, denoted πLR, is 2 percent. 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been f eatured prominently in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules, denoted ݎ௅ோ, are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 
2 percent longer-run inflation objective and a longe r-run real federal funds rate of 1 percent, a 
value used in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the curre nt and next quarters.  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the firs t quarter shown, and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the sec ond quarter shown.  The lines labeled “Previous 
Tealbook, adjusted” report prescriptions conditional on the previous Tealbook projections for 
inflation and the output gap but taking into account the current estimate of ݎ௅ோ; for rules that 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012). 
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported  in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal funds rate. Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully-compounded, 365-day basis and 
then converted to a 360-day basis. Taylor (1993) rule ܴ௧ ൌݎ௅ோ ൅ߨ௧ ൅ 0.5ሺߨ௧ െߨ௅ோሻ ൅ 0.5݌ܽ݃ݕ ௧

include a lagged policy rate, the prescriptions for the first quarter shown use the lagged policy 
rate in the current Tealbook projection. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES 
The bottom panel of the exhibit titled “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds rate, r*.  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintain ed over a 12-quarter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted so that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds 
rate that closes the output ga p conditional on the exog enous variables in the extended baseline 
forecast. 
The “average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 
12−quarter period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*.  The average projected real federal 
funds rate and r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic outcomes even when their 
values are identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal funds rate is held 
constant over the entire 12-quarter period to close the output gap at the end of this timeframe whereas, in the Tealbook baseline, the real federal funds rate can vary over time.  Distinct paths 
of real short-term rates can, in turn, generate different paths for inflation and economic activity. 
FRB/US MODEL SIMULATIONS 
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simula tions of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond the time horizon s hown in the exhibits.  The simulations are 
conducted under the assumption that market partic ipants as well as price and wage setters have 
perfect foresight, and are predicated on the st aff’s extended Tealbook projection, which includes 
the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of th e simulations begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICY UNDER COMMITMENT 
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as th e difference between four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation, ߨ௧௉஼ா, and the Committee’s 2 percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( ݌ܽ݃ݑ௧, 
measured as the difference between the unemploymen t rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulati ons under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The accompanying box “Optimal Control and the Loss 
Function” provides motivations for the four specifications of the weights. 
The first specification, titled “equal wei ghts,” assigns equal weights to all three 
components at all times.  The second specification, titled “asymmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the 
same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling 
below the natural rate.  The third specification, titled “large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a 
relatively large weight to inflation gaps.  The f ourth specification, titled “minimal weight on rate 
adjustments,” places almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.3  The table below 
shows the weights used in the four specificati ons.  The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than  the absolute) values of the weights. 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes th e loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect 
foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that decision makers in the 
model see this path as being a binding commitm ent on future Committee decisions; the optimal

calculated over a period that ends sufficiently far in the future that extending that period farther 
would not affect the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
 A key question for this meeting is whethe r the Committee sees the recent data as 
consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quar ter, labor market 
conditions continuing to strengthen, a nd inflation making progress toward the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective.  In light of  the crosscurrents in  the available data, 
the alternatives offer somewhat different answers to this key question as well as 
different characterizations of risks to  the economic outlook; accordingly, the 
statements offer different messages about th e current and future stance of policy.  
 Regarding the characterization of recent incoming economic data, each alternative 
says that “growth in economic activity appear s to have picked up” and that “the pace 
of improvement in the labor market has slowed,” but the sentence construction in 
Alternative A is intended to signal that the Committee places more weight on the 
weaker payroll data than on the stronger spending data. 
o With respect to specific labor market  indicators, Alternative B notes that 
“although the unemployment rate has decl ined, job gains have diminished.” 
o Alternative A highlights the deceleration in growth of payroll employment by 
stating that “job gains have  slowed noticeably.”   
o Alternative C, in contrast, emphasi zes the noticeable decline in the 
unemployment rate over the sl owdown in job gains.   
 The three alternatives convey different view s on the likelihood of inflation continuing 
to run below 2 percent. 
o Alternative C states that low inflation “largely” reflects earlier declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non-en ergy imports.  Continued low inflation 
“partly” reflects those factors, according to Alternative B, and “only partly” in 
Alternative A.   
o Alternatives B and C describe indica tors of inflation compensation as 
remaining “low,” and survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations as 
“little changed.”  Alternative A instea d notes that indicators of inflation 
compensation and longer-term inflati on expectations “have declined.”

 In summarizing the economic outlook a nd its implications for monetary policy, 
Alternatives B repeats language from th e April statement, noting the Committee’s 
expectation that “with gra dual adjustments in the st ance of monetary policy, 
economic activity will expand at a moderate p ace.”  Alternative C indicates that with 
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy “ec onomic activity and 
employment will expand at moderate rates.”  Alternative A signals that policy 
adjustments are not likely to occur s oon by dropping the reference to “gradual 
adjustments” and instead expressing an expectation that economic activity will 
expand at a moderate pace “with appr opriate monetary policy accommodation.” 
o All three statements reaffirm the Comm ittee’s expectation that inflation will 
“remain low in the near term,” in part because of earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy im ports, but that inflation will rise to 
2 percent over the medium term as th e transitory effects of those earlier 
declines dissipate and the labor mark et strengthens further.  And each 
Alternative notes that the Committee will closely monitor inflation. 
 Alternative B and Alternative C do not cont ain an explicit assessment of the balance 
of risks; they maintain the language fr om the April statement that the Committee 
“continues to closely monitor global ec onomic and financial developments” along 
with inflation indicators.  Alternative A cau tions that the Committee “sees the risks to 
the economic outlook as tilted somewhat to the downside.” 
 With respect to the policy d ecision, Alternative A, Alterna tive B, and one version of 
Alternative C maintain the current target  range; another versi on of Alternative C 
raises the target range.  More specifically: 
o Alternative B keeps the target range a nd repeats paragraphs 3 and 4 of the 
April statement.  By doing so, Alterna tive B indicates that the Committee still 
expects to increase the fede ral funds rate target ra nge but steps away from 
signaling the likely timing of that action. 
o Alternative A communicates a judgme nt that the economic outlook and 
associated risks warrant deferring increases  in the target range “until the risks 
to the economic outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer 
to 2 percent on a sustained basis.”  If the staff’s forecast proves correct, the 
inflation condition is unlikely to be met in short order.

-By the time the inflation and risk conditions specified in Alternative A 
are met, the labor market might have strengthened  substantially 
further, which would then call for relatively rapid increases in the 
target range.  Accordingly, Altern ative A drops the indication that 
future adjustments to the stance of  policy will be “only gradual.”  
o Alternative C with the first version of paragraph 3 maintains the current target 
range but strongly suggests that an increas e in the federal funds rate is likely 
in coming months if labor market in dicators and other incoming information 
suggest that the economy is growing at a moderate pace, consistent with sustaining maximum employment and a return to 2 percent inflation.  
-Under this version of Alternative C, policymakers would wait for additional information to increase their confidence that the economic 
outlook is progressing in line with the Committee’s objectives before 
increasing the target range, but also  would signal that they expect the 
uncertainty to be resolved in favor  of raising rates at an upcoming 
meeting. 
o Alternative C with the sec ond version of paragraph 3 ra ises the target range by 
25 basis points and maintains the exis ting guidance about future monetary 
policy actions, consistent with a view that the economy will likely evolve in a 
way that will warrant further gradual incr eases in the federal funds rate target 
range.

APRIL  2016 FOMC Statement 
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March 
indicates that labor market conditions ha ve improved further even as growth in 
economic activity appears to have slow ed.  Growth in household spending has 
moderated, although households’ real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer 
sentiment remains high.  Since the beginni ng of the year, the housing sector has 
improved further but business fixed investme nt and net exports have been soft.  A 
range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional 
strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation has c ontinued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation remain low; survey -based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations are little  changed, on balance, in recent months.   
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Comm ittee currently expects that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators wi ll continue to strengt hen.  Inflation is 
expected to remain low in the near term, in  part because of earlier declines in energy 
prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the me dium term as the transitory effects of 
declines in energy and import prices dissi pate and the labor market strengthens 
further.  The Committee conti nues to closely monitor infl ation indicators and global 
economic and financial developments. 
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the 
federal funds rate at ¼ to  ½ percent.  The stance of  monetary policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further im provement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size of future  adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will as sess realized and expected economic 
conditions relative to its objectives of ma ximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indica tors of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its in flation goal.  The Committee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manne r that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely  to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  Howe ver, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by 
incoming data.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Outlook 
 The somewhat conflicting information r eceived over the intermeeting period may 
have left policymakers more uncertain whethe r the data point to an economy that is 
evolving in line with their moda l forecasts of moderate growth. 
o Stronger-than-expected readings on some components of final demand, 
particularly household spending, led the st aff to raise its projection of real 
GDP growth in the first half of the year  to an annual rate of 1.5 percent, but 
left the projection for the year as a whole, now at 1.9 percent, essentially 
unchanged. 
o While the unemployment rate has dec lined since the Ap ril FOMC meeting, 
this decline largely reflects a step-down in the labor force participation rate; meanwhile, nonfarm payroll employment  decelerated significantly since 
March. 
o Policymakers may think that the sluggi sh employment growth is likely to 
prove transitory, and that a pickup in job gains is likely to follow the current 
quarter’s acceleration in economic  activity.  But policymakers may 
nonetheless see a risk that recent weakness in employment gains together with 
the ongoing contraction in business fixed investment point to a persistent 
slowdown in aggregate demand. 
 Twelve-month core and headline inflation ap pear to have been trending up since the 
fall of last year.  However, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent target.  Moreover, inflation comp ensation is low and survey measures of 
longer-run inflation expecta tions are little changed.   
o Policymakers may continue to judge th at the low readings of inflation 
compensation likely reflect risk and liquidity premiums, to a large extent. 
o Policymakers may continue to anticipate that PCE inflation will move up to 2 percent over the medium term, now th at energy prices ar e no longer falling.

Policy Strategy 
 Given the crosscurrents in recent data on the real economy, and with inflation 
continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 pe rcent target, policymakers may judge it 
prudent to wait for evidence that domes tic demand will continue to grow at a 
moderate pace and that the labor market will  strengthen further before taking the next 
step in normalizing the st ance of monetary policy. 
 In addition, policymakers may judge that downside risks from global economic and 
financial developments remain material.  Fo r example, they might see a U.K. vote to 
leave the EU as posing risks to the U. S. domestic outlook and note that this 
uncertainty might well be resolved by  the time of their July meeting. 
 Policymakers may conclude that the optimal response to such uncertainty and risks is 
to leave the federal funds ra te unchanged at this meeti ng, pending their assessment of 
future evidence on the economic outlook, and to avoid signaling the timing of the 
next policy move.  They might note that the proximity of nominal rates to the 
effective lower bound provides additional suppo rt to this wait-and-see posture.   
 A decision to maintain the current target ra nge for the federal funds rate would be in 
line with the expectations of financial market participants. 
o According to the Desk’s latest Survey  of Primary Dealers and Survey of 
Market Participants, respondents percei ve there to be only a negligible 
probability that the Committ ee will alter the target ra nge at this meeting.  
o The Desk’s surveys suggest that market participants will not be surprised by 
the changes in paragraph 1 of Alterna tive B, particularly the recognition of 
stronger spending data bu t weaker job gains.  
o Alternative B may not lead market part icipants to significantly change the 
odds they currently place on a target range increase in July or at subsequent 
meetings.  Rather, Alternative B may lead  market participants to adjust those 
odds over time depending on whether the da ta received after the June meeting 
prove to be largely consistent with the Committee’s expectation for sustained 
growth of spending and for further labor market strengthening.  Expectations 
will also be shaped by the new SEP and by the Chair’s press conference.

o Respondents do not anticipate any ch anges to the Committee’s forward 
guidance or reinvestment policy (that is, to paragraphs 4 or 5 of the 
statement), both of which Alternative B maintains.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Outlook 
 Policymakers might view the combination of a sizable drop in the unemployment rate 
and slowing job gains (taking into account that some of the slowing can be explained 
by clearly transitory factors) as consistent with the view that the economy has reached 
maximum sustainable employment and that  growth of labor supply is becoming a 
binding constraint on hiring.   
o Policymakers might also see the resu lts of the Job Openings and Labor 
Turnover Survey for April as consistent  with that view:  job openings and 
separations were stable while hires edged down over the month.  
o And policymakers might view the pickup in some measures of wage growth 
as consistent with this view, especially  in light of the evidence, discussed in 
Tealbook A, indicating that real wages are rising faster than labor 
productivity.  
 Household balance sheets have improved, ga ins in disposable income have been 
healthy, and the unemployment rate has d eclined noticeably.  Moreover, the drag 
from net exports appears to have diminish ed.  Policymakers may see conditions as 
favorable for solid consumption growth and further improvement in the housing 
sector and perhaps even in net exports, and so may project that aggregate demand will 
grow at a rate no slower th an the economy’s potential grow th rate even with gradual 
increases in the target range for the federal funds rate.   
o Accordingly, policymakers might anticipat e further tightening of labor market 
conditions with increasing upward pre ssure on wages and, subsequently, on 
expected and actual inflation.   
 Measures of the trend in inflation have move d closer to 2 percent.   Policymakers may 
conclude that the effect of transitory f actors is already subsiding, given the recent 
firming in oil prices.   
Alternatives

 For all of these reasons, policymakers may be increasingly confident that headline 
inflation will be close to the 2 percent objec tive once the effects of earlier declines in 
energy and import prices fade, while increase d labor market tightness will suffice to 
return headline inflation to th e Committee’s longer-run objective. 
o Policymakers may attribute the low levels of market-based measures of 
longer-term inflation compensation to movements in liquidity and inflation 
risk premiums that are unrelated to longer-run inflation outcomes, and the decline in some survey-based measures to previous declines in energy and import prices. 
 Policymakers may see the risks to the ec onomic outlook as approximately balanced, 
and the downside risks from global economic and financial developments as having 
diminished compared with  earlier this year.  
o Indeed, policymakers might see alterna tive scenarios such as the “Weaker 
Productivity” scenario in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A 
as increasingly likely. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that current conditions  and the outlook warrant a rate hike at 
the June meeting or in the near future.  
o They may be concerned that leaving policy rates unchanged in the face of an 
unemployment rate that is at or below its longer-run normal level would likely 
foster expectations of a prolonged shallo w path for the federal funds rate that 
would be insufficiently responsive to economic conditions.  Such expectations might well create excess demand and ri sk an upward drift in longer-term 
inflation expectations.  In  addition, such an expected path could induce further 
“reach for yield” or excessive risk-taki ng behavior in financial markets.   
o Policymakers may also be concerned th at the public might misinterpret a 
statement like Alternative B as an indication that the FOMC  is placing too 
much weight on transitory financial a nd economic developments and too little 
weight on a solid modal outlook for the economy, labor markets, and inflation.

Alternatives Policymakers might favor the first version of paragraph 3  if they judged it 
prudent not to raise the target  range in June but to signal a modest increase in coming 
months. 
o These policymakers might prefer to wa it for further evidence that limited 
slack in the economy can account fo r the recent slowdown in payroll 
employment growth, and that the growth  of GDP will continue to strengthen 
with inflation increasing toward the Comm ittee’s 2 percent target in the rest of 
the year. 
o Alternatively, policymakers might want to wait to see whether the weak 
employment report was an aberration or a sign of further softness ahead. 
o These policymakers may prefer to see th e uncertainty over the outcome of the 
upcoming U.K. referendum on EU membership resolved before the next 
increase in the target range. 
o They may thus prefer to si gnal a likely rate increase in  July to lean against the 
risk that the public might start to expect indefinite delays in policy 
normalization. 
 Policymakers might favor the second version of paragraph 3  if they judged that it 
is appropriate to announce a 25 basis point increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent. 
o These policymakers may note that, even af ter this increase, the real federal 
funds rate would still lie well below the prescriptions from most simple policy 
rules and optimal control exercises shown in the “M onetary Policy Strategies” 
section of Tealbook B. 
 Respondents to the Desk’s latest surveys pe rceive there to be no material odds that 
the Committee will change the target range at this meeting, and so a decision to increase the target range w ould be very surprising.  
o If market participants infer that the Committee intends to pursue a less accommodative stance of policy going forward than they had expected, for 
any given outlook, then medium- and longe r-term real interest rates would 
rise, equity prices and inflation comp ensation would likely decline, and the 
dollar would appreciate. 
Authorized for Public Release
o Nonetheless, if investors see a statem ent like Alternative C as primarily 
reflecting an upbeat assessment of the st rength of the U.S. expansion, then 
equity prices and inflation compensati on might fall less than otherwise, or 
even rise. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Outlook 
 While economic activity appears to have pi cked up in recent months, policymakers 
might view the weakness in spending indica tors for the first quarter, paired with 
recent softness of labor market indicato rs, as suggesting that the Committee’s 
previously stated expectation of moderate growth for the rest of the year is overly 
optimistic.  In particular, solid increases in consumer spending are unlikely to be 
sustained if employment con tinues to grow sluggishly.   
o The unexpected weakness in payroll empl oyment growth recently cannot be 
fully explained by identifiable  transitory factors.   
o Revised data now show that payroll gain s have been on a declining trend since 
last fall. 
o The still-high rate of involuntary part-time employment, the low level of the 
employment-to-population ratio for prime- age workers, and the limited extent 
to which aggregate data have indicated  upward pressure on wage growth may 
all suggest some remaining slack in labor markets. 
 Moreover, both headline and core inflati on continue to run no ticeably below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective and ma rket-based measures of inflation 
compensation are not only low but may be sliding, and survey-based measures remain 
at or near recent lows. 
o Market-based measures of inflation comp ensation have been at low levels for 
a long time.  The Michigan survey  measure of longer-term inflation

Policy Strategy 
 Some policymakers might judge that the re cent uptick in core inflation will prove 
transitory. 
o Policymakers might worry that the failure of inflation to rise to the 2 percent 
target over the past several years ha s become ingrained in longer-term 
inflation expectations and that th e persistent weakness in inflation 
compensation measures suggests that the inflation expectations relevant for 
wage and price setting have declined.  
o These policymakers might argue that the chronic failure of policy to return 
inflation toward 2 percent risks eroding the credibility of the FOMC’s 
commitment to achieving that objective, including the statement that 
deviations from this objective are co nsidered on a symmetric basis.   
 Policymakers may believe that the natural rate of unemployment may be lower than current measures suggest, as described in  the “Risk and Uncertainty” section of 
Tealbook A.  Alternatively, they may see virt ues in allowing the labor market to firm 
more over the medium term as a way of repairing the damage to the labor market that 
resulted from a prolonged period of weak labor demand. 
 Policymakers may believe that risk manageme nt considerations call for signaling that 
any further removal of policy accomm odation is some time off.     
o Policymakers might observe that, given the proximity to the effective lower bound, the scope for conventional policy measures to support the economy would be quickly exhausted in the event that adverse shocks were to hit the 
economy.   
o Policymakers might judge that the neutral rate  of interest is low, relative to its 
historical norm, and likely to remain so  for quite some time, thus exacerbating 
the risk that conventional policy could be constrained going forward.  Moreover, unconventional monetary polic ies provide imperfect substitutes for 
conventional policy.   
o In addition, policymakers might argue that a U.K. vote to leave the EU could pose material risks for the domestic outlook;  they also may see the factors that 
led to the sharp deterioration in financia l conditions earlier th is year as still

largely unaddressed.  Policymakers might also see new risks emerging in the 
domestic outlook, such as those discusse d in the “Recession” scenario in the 
“Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A. 
 For all these reasons, policymakers might  prefer a statement along the lines of 
Alternative A, to assert that the Committee judges that an increase in the target range 
“will not be warranted until the risks to th e outlook are more closely balanced and 
inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.” 
 Most respondents in the Desk’s latest surveys expect the Committee continue to 
emphasize the gradual nature of its normali zation approach and to  convey that it still 
expects to raise rates this year.  Th e issuance of a postmeeting statement like 
Alternative A would therefore surprise  financial market participants.   
o Investors would likely push further into the future the expected date of the 
next rate increase, the ex pected path for the federal funds rate would likely 
flatten further, and longer-ter m yields would decline.   
o If the statement is primarily seen as  more accommodative, equity prices and 
inflation compensation would likely rise , and the dollar would depreciate.   
o Nonetheless, if investors interpret the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly 
downbeat assessment of global economic conditi ons and greater-than-
anticipated concerns over the downside ri sks to the outlook, equity prices and 
inflation compensation could fall.

rate, an implementation note that indicat es no change in the Federal Reserve’s 
administered rates—the interest rates on requi red and excess reserves, the offering rate on 
overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the discount rate—would be issued.  If the 
Committee instead decides to raise the targ et range for the federal funds rate, an 
implementation note that communicates the chan ges the Federal Reserve decided to make 
to these three policy tools would be issued.

 As part of its policy decision, the Federal Op en Market Committee voted to authorize and 
direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed 
otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open Market Account in accordance 
with the following domestic policy directive: 
“Effective April 28 June 16 , 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee directs 
the Desk to undertake open market operations  as necessary to maintain the federal 
funds rate in a target range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an  offering rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts limited only

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has prepared a projection of th e Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and key 
elements of the associated income statement that is consistent with the monetary policy 
assumptions incorporated in the sta ff’s forecast presented in Tealbook A. 
For the purposes of our projections, we assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of maturing Treasury securitie s and agency debt as well as principal 
received on agency MBS when the federal funds rate reaches a range between 1¼ and 
1½ percent.  This assumption reflects the staff’s interpretation of the Committee’s 
statement that it anticipates continuing reinvestments until normalization of the level of 
the federal funds rate is “we ll under way.”  As a result of the more gradual rise in the 
federal funds rate in the sta ff’s current projection, the imp lied timing for the cessation of 
reinvestments has moved to the third quarter  of 2017, about three quarters later than 
posited in the April Tealbook.  Once reinvest ments cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks 
through redemptions of maturing Treasury a nd agency debt securities as well as 
paydowns of principal on agency MBS. 
Regarding the Federal Reserve’s use of policy normalization tools, we assume 
that the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion 
through the end of 2018 before declining to  zero by the end of 2019, and that term 
deposits and term RRPs are not used.1 
Some key features of the proj ection are highlighted below. 
 Balance sheet. The size of the portfolio  is normalized in the first quarter of 2022, 
two quarters later than in the April T ealbook, reflecting the change in the timing 
for the cessation of reinvestments (see th e solid black lines in the exhibit titled 
1 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve balances and an equal increase in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the overall size of the balance sheet. We also assume that RRPs associated with 
foreign official and international accounts remain  near their April 30, 2016, level of $243 billion 
throughout the projection period.

“Total Assets and Selected Balance Sh eet Items” and the table that follows).2  At 
that tim e, total assets are projected to st and at $2.4 trillion, wi th about $2.2 trillion 
in total SOMA securities holdings.  To tal assets and SOMA  Treasury holdings 
rise thereafter, keep ing p ace with the increases in both Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank cap ital.  See the box entitled “Implications 
of Different Reinvestm ent Strategies” for a discussion of the implications of 
alternative reinvestm ent strategies fo r the balance sheet and for effects on 
Treasury term prem iums. 
 Federal Reserve earnings remittances. After record remittances to the Treasury 
in 2015 (excluding remittances associated with the transfer of Federal Reserve 
surplus under the FAST Act) of nearly $100 billion, remittances are projected to 
decline to about $84 billion this year (see the solid black lines in the “Income 
Projections” exhibit).  The step-down in 2016 primarily reflects increased interest 
expense on reserves associated with the pr ojected firming in the stance of policy.  
Annual remittances continue to decline in  subsequent years, reaching a low of 
roughly $34 billion in 2019, with no deferred asset being recorded.3  Relative to 
the April Tealbook, the projecte d path of remittances is slightly higher in the 
medium term, as reinvestments are now assumed to continue through the third 
quarter of 2017, resulting in a larger SO MA portfolio and thus more interest 
income.  The Federal Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 
total about $1.1 trillion. 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of a bout $201 billion at the end of May.4 
2 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its longer-ru n trend; this trend is determined largely by currency in circulation and 
a projected steady-state level of reserve balances.  Th e projected timing of the normalization of the size of 
the balance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct 
monetary policy; currently, we assume that level of re serve balances to be $100 billion.  However, ongoing 
regulatory and structural changes could result in a higher underlying demand for reserve balances.  In turn, 
a higher steady-state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, imply an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a $500 billion steady-state level of reserve balances, the 
balance sheet would likely norma lize at the beginning of 2021. 
3 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset for earnings remittances due to the U.S. Treasury 
would be recorded. 
4 The Federal Reserve reports the level in the quarter-end net unrealized gain/loss position of the 
SOMA portfolio to the public in the “Federal Re serve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,”

  Implications  of Different  Reinvestment  Strategies  
The  Committee  has indicated  that it will cease reinvestments  when  the process for 
normalizing  the level of the federal funds  rate  is “well under  way.”  This box considers  
the differences  in balance  sheet and term premium  effects that arise when the 
cessation  of reinvestments  is based on different levels of  the federal funds rate.  In 
particular,  the scenarios  labeled “FF 0.8”, “FF 1.3”, and “FF 2.0”  consider the cases in 
which reinvestments  end when the  federal funds rate  reaches 0.8 percent, 1.3 
percent, and 2.0 percent,  respectively.1  The  FF 1.3 scenario corresponds  to the  staff’s 
current baseline assumption.   All told, there  are generally  only small differences  across 
strategies  under the baseline economic  outlook; however, the  incremental  policy 
accommodation  provided  by delaying the end of reinvestments  may provide some 
insurance  in the case of shocks  that call for additional  easing. 
As shown in figure 1, these  alternatives  for the  timing of the cessation  of 
reinvestments  largely resul t in “parallel” shifts  of the trajectory  for the  Federal 
Reserve’s  balance  sheet.  As shown in figure 2, these  different  paths for the  balance 
sheet would have corresponding  effects on the paths of the term  premium  embedded  
in long‐term interest  rates.  For example,  the delay in the cessation  of reinvestments  
under scenario FF 2.0 would  result in a larger average level of the balance sheet over 
the next few  years and a lower  path for the term premium.  All  else equal,  that would 
allow for somewhat  faster normalization  of the level of the federal funds  rate.  
Conversely, the  earlier  cessation  of reinvestments  under scenario FF 0.8 would result 
in a somewhat  higher path for the  term  premium  and a somewhat  slower pace of 
normalization  for the  level of the federal funds rate.  Finally, under all scenarios,  
remittances  to the Treasur y (not shown) decline until 2019 before rebounding  slowly, 
but differences  across  scenarios  are minor. 
 
                                                 
1 The reinvestment  end date under  FF 0.8 coincides  with that assumed in the April Tealbook  
baseline.  The  April Tealbook  projected  the federal funds  rate to be 1.3 percent at this end date.

Going forward, the net unrealized gain or  loss position of the portfolio will 
depend im portantly on the path of longer-t erm interest rates.  Because of the 
assum ed rise in longer-term interest rates over the next several years, the portfolio 
is projected to shift to an unrealized loss position in  mid-2017, about two quarters 
later than estim ated in the April Tealbook.  The delayed onset of a net unrealized 
loss position  reflects a slightly lower path  for long-term interest rates.  The 
portfolio is then expected to record a peak unrealized loss of  about $148 billion in 
2019, about $92 billion less than what wa s projected in the April Tealbook.  
About $46 billion of that peak unrealized loss is attributable to losses on holdings 
of Treasury securities and $102 billion to losses on holdings of agency MBS.  The 
unrealized loss position then contracts through 2025, as the value of securities 
previously acquired under the large-scale asset purchase programs return to par as 
they approach maturity and new securities  are added to the portfolio at prevailing 
market yields. 
 Term premium effects.  As shown in the table “Projections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” the Federal Reserve’s elevated stock of longer-
term securities is estimated to hold down the term premium embedded in the 
10-year Treasury yield by 98 basi s points in the current quarter.5  Over the next 
couple of years, the estimated term premiu m effect diminishes at a pace of about 
4 basis points per quarter, reflecting in part  the gradual projected shrinking of the 
portf olio. 
 SOMA Characteristics.   Regarding the size of th e portfolio, approximately 
$216 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings has already matured or will mature this 
year, and a total of $1.4 trillion will ma ture between 2016 and 2020 (see the top 
panel of the exhibit “Proj ections for the Characteristics of SOMA Holdings”).6 
available on the Board’s website at 
http://www.federalre serve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_ fedfinancials.htm#quarterly . 
5 The projection for the contemporaneous term premium effect is about 5 basis points less negative 
than what was reported in the Apr il Tealbook as a result of the staff’s refinement of assumptions in the 
underlying estimated model. 
6 While following its current reinvestment policy, the Desk replaces maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt at Treasury auctions .  Consistent with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Treasury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
value of holdings maturing on the issue date of a newly issued security.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed pr oportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s

The amounts of Treasury securities maturing each month vary considerably, while 
projected MBS paydowns are much less variable.  However, realized MBS 
paydowns will reflect the evol ution of interest rates a nd other factors and could 
thus be significantly more  volatile than projected. 
The weighted-average duration of the SOMA  Treasury portfolio is currently about 
6½ years (see the bottom panel of the exhi bit).  The weighted-average duration is 
projected to decline through 2017, reflecting the agi ng of the portfolio, and 
subsequently to rise until 2022, when the size of the balance sheet is normalized.7 
After reaching its peak, duration is projec ted to resume its decline as the Desk 
starts purchasing Treasury securities to keep pace with the incr ease in currency.  
In particular, the duration c ontour in this latter porti on of the projection is based 
on the key assumption that the Federal Reserve will buy only Treasury bills until those holdings are equal to approximatel y 30 percent of the Treasury portfolio, 
similar to the pre-crisis composition of the portfolio (currently there are no Treasury bill holdings).  Th ereafter, purchases of Treas ury securities are assumed 
to be spread across the maturity spectrum.
8 
bids at Treasury auctions are placed  as noncompetitive tenders and are treated as add-ons to announced 
auction sizes. 
7 The duration of the SO MA Treasury portfolio in itially declines once reinvestments cease, as 
Treasury securities in the portfolio approach maturity.  Once the pace of roll-offs accelerates starting in 
2018 and longer tenor securities account for a larger  share in the remaining portfolio, duration increases 
until the balance sheet is normalized.  
8 We assume zero purchases of agen cy MBS after reinvestments cease.
