The top panel of the first exhibit, “Policy Rules and the Staff  Projection,” 
provides near-term prescriptions f or the federal funds rate fro m four policy rules: the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, an inertial version  of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and a first-difference rule.1  These prescriptions take as given the staff’s baseline 
projections for the output gap a nd inflation in the near term, shown in the middle panels.  
The top panel also includes the staff’s baseline projection for  the federal funds rate.  All 
three Taylor-type rules call fo r values of the federal funds rate above the Tealbook 
baseline in the second half of  2016, whereas the first-differen ce rule calls for values that 
are a little below the Tealbook ba seline.  The Taylor (1993) an d Taylor (1999) rules, 
which feature no interest rate smoothing term, prescribe substa ntially higher values of the 
federal funds rate in the near ter m than the inertial Taylor (1 999) rule and the first-
difference rule.  The prescripti ons of all four simple rules ar e a tad lower than in the June 
Tealbook because the staff now proj ects a slightly lower path for the output gap in the 
near term. 
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a Tealb ook-consistent, 
medium-term notion of the equilib rium real federal funds rate t hat is generated using the 
FRB/US model.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  corresponds to the level of the real 
federal funds rate that, if main tained over a 12-quarter period , would result in the output 
gap being closed in the final quart er of that period.  The current estimate of r*, at 
0.96 percent, is a bit lower than t he estimate for the correspo nding period in the June 
Tealbook due to the slightly lower  path of the output gap in co ming years in the 
projection.  The second line of the  panel shows the average lev el of the real federal funds 
rate in the staff’s forecast for the same 12-quarter period use d to compute r*.2  This 
average, at 0.05 percent, is almost 1 percentage point below r*.  The relatively 
accommodative stance of policy in the Tealbook baseline projection reflects policy 
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of the four rules.  
2 Although r* and the average projected real f ederal funds rate are calculat ed over the same 
12-quarter period, they need not  be associated with the same ma croeconomic outcomes even when their 
values are identical.  The reas on is that, when calculating r*, the real federal funds rate is held constant 
over the entire 12-quarter perio d, whereas, in the Tealbook bas eline, the real federa l funds rate can vary 
over time.  Distinct paths of real  short-term rates can, in tur n, generate different pa ths for inflation and 
economic activity, even if they have the same 12-quarter averag e.

     1. For rules that have a lagged policy rate as a right−hand−side variable, the lines denoted "Previous Tealbook projection" report
prescriptions based on the previous Tealbook's staff outlook for inflation and the output gap, but conditional on the current−Tealbook value ofthe lagged policy rate.
     2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter period (beginning
in the current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period. The "average projected real
federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same 12−quarter period as the Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *.

considerations other than closing the output gap that are embed ded in the policy reaction 
function assumed by the staff.3 
The second exhibit, “Policy Rule Simulations,” reports dynamic simulations of 
the FRB/US model under the Tayl or (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999 ) rule, the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule, and the first -difference rule.  These simul ations reflect the 
endogenous responses of the outpu t gap and inflation when the f ederal funds rate follows 
the paths implied by the different policy rules.4  The constant intercept terms of the 
Taylor-type rules cor respond to the staff’s assumption that the longer-run normal level of 
the real federal funds rate equals 1 percent.  The results for each rule presented in these 
and subsequent simulations depend importantly on the assumption s that policymakers 
will adhere to the rule in the f uture, and that market particip ants as well as price and wage 
setters fully understand the imp lications for real activity and  inflation of the policy rule. 
As in the June Tealbook, the baseline policy path in the staff forecast is derived 
under a modified version of the i nertial Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward 
adjustment to the intercept.5  The implications in the model of this adjustment can be seen 
by comparing the outcomes under the Tealbook baseline policy to the outcomes under the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule for which the intercept is constant.  In the Tealbook baseline, 
the nominal federal funds rate increases by an average of ¼ percentage point per quarter 
through the middle of 2019, when it reaches 3 percent.  The pac e of tightening 
subsequently slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 3.6 percent in 2021, before 
eventually returning to its longer-run normal level of 3 percen t.  The inertial Taylor 
(1999) rule prescribes a slightl y higher path for the federal f unds rate than in the 
                                                 
3 In particular, the baseline policy reaction function embeds an  endogenous response to deviations 
of inflation from the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Further more, it features inertia regarding 
adjustments to the path of the nominal federal funds rate and a  judgmental downward adjustment to the 
stance of policy that gradually d iminishes over the next few ye ars; all else equal, inclusion of these two 
features in the baseline policy ru le makes the output gap at th e end of the 12-quarter period more positive 
than otherwise, which tends to increase the difference between the r* needed to close the output gap  and 
the corresponding average proj ected real federal funds rate. 
4 Because of these endogenous res ponses, the near-term prescript ions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the  first exhibit.

Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation

Tealbook baseline because, until late 2018, its intercept is hi gher than in the modified 
version of the rule used to constr uct the baseline.  However, t he difference in policy rates 
is small and dissipate s too rapidly to have a material effect o n the real longer-term 
interest rates that influence economic activity in FRB/US, so m acroeconomic outcomes 
are very similar to those  in the Tealbook baseline. 
The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate  sharp tightening 
and produce paths for the real fed eral funds rate that lie sign ificantly above the Tealbook 
baseline path over the next few years.6  The sharp initial tight ening occurs in part because 
these rules do not include la gged values of the federal funds r ate as a determinant of their 
current policy prescriptions.  W ith the output gap essentially closed, core inflation 
½ percentage point below the Committee’s objective, and an intercept term of 1 percent, 
the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules prescribe nominal rat es that, in the near term, 
are just 0.6 percentage point be low their longer-run level of 3  percent.  Over the next few 
years, these rules would cause t he unemployment rate to undersh oot the staff’s estimate 
of the natural rate by less than in the staff’s baseline projec tion.  The Taylor (1999) rule 
calls for somewhat higher policy r ates than the Taylor (1993) r ule over the period shown 
because it places more weight on the output gap, and output is projected to rise above 
potential for the next several years.  As a consequence, the Ta ylor (1999) rule generates a 
higher trajectory of the unemplo yment rate and a slightly lower  trajectory of inflation 
than does the Taylor (1993) rule. 
The first-difference rule prescri bes a moderately higher path f or the federal funds 
rate through 2018 than in the Tealbook baseline.7  Thereafter, the feder al funds rate levels 
off under the first-difference rule, whereas it keeps rising under the Tealbook baseline.  
This divergence occurs because the first-difference rule, which responds to the expected 
                                                 
6 An immediate 2-percentage-point increase in the federal funds r ate like the one prescr ibed by these rules 
would constitute a sharp departure from the policy strategy that the Committee has followed over the past 
several years—a period during which the Committee has emphasize d that it is not following a rule and that 
it intends to adjust policy gradually.  In the simulations, pri vate-sector agents are assumed to fully 
understand the central bank’s new rule and the implications for  the economy as well as to believe the 
central bank’s commitm ent to following the rule; accordingly, t he switch to following the Taylor (1993) or 
the Taylor (1999) rule and the resulting jump in the federal fu nds rate do not create confusion about the 
Committee’s reaction function or call into question the Committee’s credibility.  
7 For the current and next quarte rs, the policy response of the first-difference rule in the “Policy 
Rule Simulations exhibit” is similar to the baseline, in contra st with the modestly more accommodative 
stance shown earlier in the “Nea r-Term Prescriptions of Selecte d Policy Rules” exhibit.  This difference 
arises because of endogenous feed back from expected future infl ation and output growth in the current 
exhibit, whereas these variables were kept at their baseline va lues in the previous exhibit.

change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to th e slower pace of economic 
growth projected late in the decade.  The lower path of the fed eral funds rate from mid-
2019 onward under the first-differe nce rule, in conjunction wit h expectations of higher 
price and wage inflation in the f uture, implies lower longer-term real rates over the entire 
projection period, as well as higher levels of resource utiliza tion and inflation.  The first-
difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployment rate ov er the forecast period 
that are markedly below the unemployment rate paths generated u nder the other policy 
rules and well below the staff’ s estimate of the natural rate.  Accordingly, the first-
difference rule also leads to s omewhat higher inflation over the period shown relative to 
the other simple rules. 
The third exhibit, “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitmen t,” displays 
optimal control simulations unde r various assumptions about policymakers’ preferences, 
as captured by four specifications of the loss function.8  The concept of optimal control 
that is employed here corresponds to a commitment policy under which the plans that 
policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy choices in a way that 
improves overall economic outcome s.  The exhibit also shows the current Tealbook 
baseline forecast. 
The first simulation, labeled “e qual weights,” presents the cas e in which 
policymakers are assumed to plac e the same weights on keeping h eadline PCE inflation 
close to the Committee’s 2 pe rcent goal, on keeping the unemplo yment rate close to the 
staff’s estimate of the natura l rate of unemployment, and on minimizing changes in the 
federal funds rate.  In the resulting optimal strategy, the pat h for the federal funds rate is 
significantly higher than the T ealbook policy path.  This higher path arises because, in the 
current baseline projection, unemployment falls well below the staff’s estimate of the 
natural rate over the next sev eral years.  Under the preference s embedded in optimal 
control with equal weights, polic ymakers judge this undershooti ng of the natural rate to 
be costly, leading them to tight en policy appreciably more than  in the Tealbook baseline.  
This tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that runs substantially 
closer to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate; headline PC E inflation is slightly lower 
                                                 
8 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifica tions; the appendix provides technical 
details on the optimal control simulations.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent objective,
of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared changes in the
federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box "Optimal Control

than in the Tealbook baseline over the simulation period, consi stent with a limited 
response of inflation in the model to lower levels of resource utilization. 
The second simulation, label ed “asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss 
function that assigns no cost to unemployment rate outcomes bel ow the natural rate but 
that is identical to the specifi cation with equal weights when the unemployment rate is 
above the natural rate.  Under th is strategy, the path of the f ederal funds rate is 
considerably below both the pat h for the case of equal weights and the Tealbook baseline 
path; policymakers choose this relatively accommodative path fo r the policy rate because 
the desire to raise inflati on to 2 percent is not tempered by a n aversion to the 
undershooting of the natural rate of  unemployment that helps achieve this outcome.9  In 
this simulation, the tighter lab or market causes inflation to reach 2 percent more quickly 
than in the case of equal weights; inflation then edges above t he Committee’s longer-run 
objective for a few years.  
The third simulation, labeled “large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss 
function that assigns a cost to a bove-target or below-target in flation that is five times 
larger than under the specificat ion with equal weights.  The re sulting optimal strategy is 
only a little more accommodative than in the case with equal we ights, even though the 
losses associated with undershooting the inflation objective in  coming years are markedly 
larger.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing 
tradeoff because inflation res ponds little to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers 
would need to engineer a substa ntial undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment, 
which they see as costly, in orde r to raise inflation in the ne ar term by a modest amount.10 
The fourth simulation, labeled “ minimal weight on rate adjustme nts,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very sma ll cost to changes in the feder al funds rate and assigns 
relatively larger but equal wei ghts on the unemployment gap and  the inflation gap. In the 
resulting optimal strategy, the f ederal funds rate rises faster than under the specification 
with equal weights over the ne xt few years in an effort to cont ain the projected 
undershooting of the natural rate of unemployment.  The paths f or the real federal funds 
                                                 
9 That said, this desire is tempered a bit by a modest overshooting of the natural rate of 
unemployment beyond the period shown, which occurs as policymak ers keep the feder al funds rate above 
its longer-run level for a time to prevent the high degree of a ccommodation early in the simulation from 
raising inflation much above 2 percent. 
10 If the “large weight on inflation gap” specification did not p enalize the unemployment gap at 
all, then the adverse tradeoff would disappear and policy would  be markedly more accommodative.

rate and the real 10-year Treasur y yield are also higher than i n the case of equal weights.  
While this policy affects the traj ectory for inflation relative ly little, it keeps the 
unemployment rate close to the s taff’s estimate of the natural rate. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations described above.

Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for the four simple policy rules reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, and the 
right -hand-side  variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four -quarter core PCE inflation  
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead  (𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 and 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+3 |𝑡𝑡), the output gap estimat e for the 
current period (y gap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap 
(∆4ygapt+3|t).  The value of  policymakers’ longer -run inflation objective , denoted πLR, is 2  percent.  
 
The first two of the selected  rules were studied  by Taylor (1993, 1999) , while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in analysis by Board staff .1  The 
intercept s of the se rules, denoted 𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿, are constant and chosen  so that they are consistent with a 
2 percent longer-run inflation objective and a longer -run real federal funds rate of 1 percent, a 
value used  in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first -difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer -run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).  
Near -term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculated taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.   When the Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter , the prescriptions are shown for the current and next quarters.   When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.   Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right -hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter shown, and then conditioned on their simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.   To isolate the effects o f 
changes in the macroeconomic projection s on the  prescriptions of these inertial rules, the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook  projection ” report prescriptions conditional on the previous Tealbook 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others ( 2012).  
2 All nominal and real federal funds rates reported in the Monetary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360 -day basis as the published federal funds rate.   Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully -compounded, 365 -day basis and 
then converted to a  360-day basis.  Taylor (1993) rule 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡=𝑟𝑟𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿+𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡+0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡− 𝜋𝜋𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿)+0.5𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡

projections for inflation and the output gap but using the value of the lagged federal funds rate in 
the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown.  
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit titled “Policy Rules and the Staff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real feder al funds rate, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a  12-quarter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that period using the  output 
projecti on from FRB/US , the staff’s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy .  This 
“Tealbook -consistent  FRB/US  r*” depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected values of the model’s exogenous variables.   It is ge nerated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model  are adjusted so that they match those in  the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine the value of the real federal funds 
rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogenous variables in the extended baseline 
forecast.  
The “average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12 -quarter 
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*.  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic outcomes even when their values are 
identical.  The reason is that, in the r*  simulations, the real federal funds rate is held constant over 
the entire 12 -quarter period to close the output gap at the end of this timeframe whereas, in the 
Tealbook baseline, the real federal funds rate can vary over time.  Distinct paths of real short -term 
rates can, in turn, generate different paths for inflation and economic activity.  
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.   Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation; this period 
extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.   The simulations are 
conducted under the assumption that market participants  as well as price and wage setters have 
perfect foresight, and are predicated on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Committee’s large-scale asset purchase programs.   When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter ; when the 
Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in the subsequent quarter.  
COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICY UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimize a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps ( measured as the difference between four -quarter headline PCE 
inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃, and the Committee’s 2  percent objective), squared unemployment gaps ( 𝑢𝑢𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑡𝑡, 
measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and the staff’s estimate of the natural

rate), and squared changes in the federal funds rate.  The resulting loss function, shown below, 
embeds the assumption that  policymakers discount the future using a quarterly discount factor

The exhibit “Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment” considers four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the  
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function.  
The first specification, titled “equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three 
components  at all times.  T he second specification, titled “asymmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the 
same weights as the equal -weights specification whenever the unemployment rate is above the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling below the natural rate.  T he third specification, titled “large weight on inflation gap,” attaches a 
relatively large weight to inflation gaps.  T he fourth specification, titled “minimal weight on rate 
adjustments,”  places almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.
3  The table below 
shows the weights used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) values of the weights.  
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates, under the assumption of perfect foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.   Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the Tealbook baseline.  The path chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that decision makers in the

ensure a well -behaved numerical solution.

model see this path as being a binding commitment on future Committee decisions; the optimal 
control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the federal funds rate but is otherwise unconstrained by policy decisions made prior to the simulation period.   The discounted losses are 
calculated over a period that ends sufficiently far in the future that extending that period farther 
would not affect the policy prescriptions shown in the exhibits.

Monetary Policy  Alternatives 
Indicators received since the Committee’s last meeting show a rebound in payroll 
gains in June along with continued moderate GDP growth , while readings on 12-month 
inflation  are little changed , consistent with the staff outlook.  And al though the United 
Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union initially roiled financial markets and 
highlighted continued economic and political risks in Europe, the likely implications  of 
Brexit  for the U.S. economic outlook now appear mild.  The key question for 
policymakers is whether these positive developments warrant a change in the stance of policy at this meeting  (or a strong signal to that effect) , or whether  current policy and 
communications remain  appropriate to achieve the Committee’s  outlook for continued 
moderate growth, labor market strengthening, and a return of inflation to 2 percent .  The 
alternative statements offer  somewhat different assessments of the implications of recent 
developments for the economic outlook and the associated risks surrounding the outlook; accordingly, they differ in either their setting of the current policy rate or the signal they provide about the likely stance of policy going forward . 
• In characterizing  incoming economic data, all three a lternatives describe the 
recent rate of expansion in  economic activity  as “moderate,” and all acknowledge 
strength in household spending and  recent weakness in residential investment.  
While all three alternatives state that the labor market has “strengthened ,” the 
statements differ somewhat in their assessment s of overall labor utilization.  
o Alternative B note s that “ on balance, payrolls and other labor market 
indicators point to some increase in labor utilization ,” while Alternative C 
expresses a slightly more optimistic view by replacing “some” with “an.”   
Alternative A takes a less optimistic view, noting that “the unemployment 
rate has held steady, on net, since the beginning of the year.” 
• The three alternatives offer different interpretations of the incoming price data. 
o Alternatives A and B retain the language used in  recent statements 
acknowledging that  inflation “has continued to run below” the Committee’s 
2 percent longer -run objective, and note that this situation either “partly” 
reflects  (in the case of Alternative B) or “only partly” reflects ( in the case 
of Alternative A ) earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-
energy imports.  By contrast, Alternative C states that inflation “has risen

  this year, moving closer to” the Committee’s objective, and does not cite a 
contribution from energy prices and non-energy import prices. 
o Alternatives B and C note that measures of inflation compensation “ remain 
low” and that survey measures of longer -term inflation expectations are 
“little changed .”  Alternative A instead says that  inflation compensation 
and measures of longer -term inflation expectations “ remain near their 
lows.” 
• Turning to the outlook for economic activity and inflation  and its implications for 
monetary policy:  
o Alternative  B retains the June statement  language affirming the 
Committee’s expectation that, “with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and 
labor market indicators will strengthen .”  Alternative C , while using the 
same gradual adjustment language for monetary policy, gives a different 
outlook for the labor market, stating that “employment growth will 
gradually slow to a rate in line with its longer -run trend;” these words 
signal  that some slowing in employment growth would be seen as 
appropriate.  By contrast,  Alternative A signals that increases in the federal 
funds rate are unlikely in the near term (and indeed hints that the next adjustment in the stance of policy could be an easing ) by express ing the 
Committee’s expectation that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace “with appropriate monetary policy accommodation” rather than “with gradual adjustments.”  
o Alternatives A and B  reaffirm the Committee’s expectation that inflation 
will “remain low in the near term,” in part because of earlier declines in energy prices  and in prices of non- energy imports, but that inflation will 
rise to 2  percent  over the medium term—“gradually” in Alternative A —as 
the transitory effects of  those earlier declines dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.   Alternative C, in contrast, emphasizes the expected 
return of inflation to 2 percent by dropping the reference to low inflation in 
the near term , and , consistent with its labor ma rket outlook, omits the 
reference to further labor market  strengthening . 
• Unlike the June statement, each of t he alternatives offer s some form of an  
assessment of the risk s to the economic outlook:

  o While Alternative  B do es not describe the current balance of risks  
explicitly , it does contain a statement on how risks have shifted since June.  
In light of the rebound in job gains in  June and the minimal disruptions in  
global financial market s following the Brexit vote, Alternative B says  that 
“near -term risk s to the economic outlook appear to have diminished.”  
o Reflecting a more optimistic assessment and foreshadowing its policy 
decision, Alternative  C describes the near -term risks as “nearly balanced.”  
o Alternative  A, in contrast, describes the current  balance of risks  “as tilted 
somewhat to the downside.”   
• With respect to the policy decision, Alternatives A and  B maintain the current 
target range for the federal funds rate; Alternative C provides the option to either 
raise the target range or  to signal  that an increase will likely soon be warranted.   
o Alternative B leaves the target range unchanged and uses the same 
language in paragraphs 3 and 4 as the June statement.  By doing so, Alternative B suggests that the Committee still expects to increase the  
federal funds rate target range but refrains  from signaling the likely timing 
of that action. 
o The first  version of paragraph 3 in Alternative C  raises the target range by  
25 basis points ; it also notes  that monetary policy remains accommodative 
and supportive of inflation returning to 2 percent, but omits a reference to 
the labor market.  
o The second  version of Alternative C’s paragraph 3 maintains the current 
target range but  states that the Committee “ sees the case for an increase in 
the federal funds rate as having strengthened since its June meeting .”  
These words would signal  that an increase in the target range is likely in 
coming months if incoming information continues to suggest that the economy is evolving as the Committee expects.   
o Alternative A co mmunicates a judgment that the  outlook and associated 
risks warrant deferring  increases  in the target range “until the risks to the 
economic outlook are more closely balanced  and inflation moves closer to 
2 percent on a sustained basis.”  I f the staff ’s forecast  proves correct,  the 
inflation condition is unlikely to be met in short order.  Accordingly, Alternative A drops references to future adjustments in the stance of policy, and instead focuses on the policy rate remaining low in the nea r term.

  JUNE  2016  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April 
indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth 
in economic activity appears to have picked up.  Although the unem ployment rate has 
declined, job gains have diminished.  Growth in household spending has strengthened.  Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment has been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’ s 
2 percent longer -run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and 
in prices of non-energy imports.  Market -based measures of inflation compensation 
declined; most survey- based measures of longer -term inflation expectations are little 
changed, on balance, in recent months. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part be cause of earlier declines in energy prices, but to 
rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor  inflation indicators and global economic and 
financial developments . 
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including 
measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectatio ns, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time,

1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April  June  
indicates  that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth 
in strengthened  and that  economic activity  appears to have picked up has b een 
expanding at a moderate rat e.  Although the unemployment rate has declined, job 
gains have diminished.  Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in 
May; on average, payrolls have risen at a moderate pace in recent months.  
Although some labor market indicators point to improvement in labor market 
conditions, the unemployment rate has held steady, on net, since the beginning of 
the year.   Growth in Ho usehold spending has been growing strongly strengthened.  
Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the 
drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment and 
residential investment  has have  been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer -run objective, only partly reflecting earlier declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Moreover,  market -based 
measures of inflation compensation decli ned; and  most survey- based measures of 
longer- term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months 
remain near their low s.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum 
employment and price stability.   The Committee currently  expects that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of appropriate  monetary policy accommodation , 
economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will 
strengthen  further.  Inflation is expected to  remain low in the near term, in part 
because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise gradually to 2 percent over 
the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens furthe r.  The Committee continues to 
closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.  
In light of global economic and financial  developments, the Committee sees the 
risks to the U.S. economic outlook as tilted somewhat to the downside.  
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary po licy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.  The Committee judg es that an increase in th e 
target range will not be warranted until  the risks to the outlook are more closely 
balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis . 
4. In determining the timing and size of future w hen adjustments to the  target range for 
the federal funds rate might become appropriate , the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation , along with risks to the economic outlook .  This assessment 
will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall 
of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
progress toward i ts inflation goal.   The Committee expects that economic conditions

 THE CASE  FOR ALTERNATIVE  B 
Economic Outlook 
• Policymakers may view the information they have received about the labor 
market and real activity as consistent, on balance, with their modal forecasts at the 
time of the June FOMC meeting.   
o Strong growth in payroll employment in  June indicates that the sharp 
slowing of job gains in May was transitor y.  A range of labor market 
indicators point to increasing utilization ; however, the unemployment rate, 
at 4.9 percent  in June, is unchanged on net since the beginning of the year.  
o Strong consumption data was tempered by disappointing data on business and residential investment.  In conjunction with weaker growth prospects 
abroad, these data led staff to mark  down their outlook for 2016 real GDP 
growth slightly , to 1.7 percent.  
• Twelve-month core and headline inflation have drifted  up since the fall of last 
year.  However, inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Moreover, longer -term inflation compensation remains near its lows.  
Similarly, survey measures of longer- run inflation expectations are little changed 
and only slightly above their lows.  
• Policymakers may judge that near-term risks to the economic outlook have 
diminished, in light of the rebound in payroll employment gains in June and 
minimal disruptions in global financial markets following the Brexit vote . 
Policy Strategy  
• While near -term risks to the economy appear to have diminished, policymakers 
may still judge it prudent to wait for more evidence that domestic demand will continue to grow at a moderate pace and that the labor market will strengthen further before taking their next step in adjusting the stance of monetary policy, particularly with inflation continuing to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  The rebound in job gains represents only one month of data.  By the 
time of the September FOMC meet ing, policymakers will have seen  two more 
employment reports, and may have a better sense of the underlying trend in 
employment growth.

 • Policymakers may conclude that, with inflation still clearly below 2 percent and 
inflation compensation quite low, the optimal response to uncertainty about the 
outlook is to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting, and to avoid signaling the timing of the next policy move.  They might note that risk management considerations associated with the proximity of nominal rates to the 
effective lower bound provides additional support for the wait -and-see posture.  
• A decision to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would be in line with the expectations of financial market participants.  
o Accor ding to the Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of 
Market Participants, respondents perceive there to be only a negligible 
probability that the Committee will alter the target range at this meeting.  
o The Desk’s surveys suggest that market par ticipants will not be surprised 
by the changes in paragraph 1 of Alternative B, particularly the recognition of the rebound in payroll employment growth.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  C 
Economic Outlook 
• Policymakers might view the rebound in job growth and sol id retail sales in June 
as confirmation that both the slowdown in employment growth in May  and the 
modest output growth in the first quarter reflected transitory factors. 
• Gains in real disposable income have been healthy , reflecting both rising 
employment and the earlier period of very low headline inflation, and household balance sheets have improved further.  Policymakers may see economic conditions as favorable for solid consumption growth going forward .  Thus, they 
may project that aggregate demand will grow faster than the economy’s potential 
output absent further increases in the target range for the federal funds rate in the 
near term , and they may view resource utilization as already tight.  
o In addition, policymakers  might anticipate that further tightening of labor 
market conditions combined with mediocre productivity growth will put increasing upward pressure on wages  and on prices of goods and services 
unless policymakers  resume raising the target range for the fed eral funds 
rate at the July meeting or shortly thereafter.

 • Some m easures of the trend in inflation, such as trimmed means, are close to 2 
percent.  Policymakers may conclude that the effect of transitory factors on 
inflation  is already subsiding.  
• Policymakers might point to the absence of lasting disruptions of financial market 
conditions following the Brexit vote as supporting the outlook for continued 
moderate economic growth.  
Policy Strategy  
• Policymakers may judge that current conditions and the outlook warrant a rate 
hike now, or, at a minimum, a signal that such a hike is likely in the near future.  
o They may be concerned that leaving policy rates unchanged in the face of 
an unemployment rate that is at or below estimates of its longer -run normal 
level would foster expectations that monetary policy will be insufficiently responsive to economic conditions.  Such expectations might well create excess demand and risk an upward drift in longer- term inflation 
expectations.  In addition, such expectations could induce further “reach for 
yield” and other excessive risk -taking behavior in financial markets.  
o Policymakers may also be concerned that the public might misinterpret a 
statement like Alternative B as indicating that the FOMC is placing too much weight on transitory financial and economic developments and too little weight on the solid modal outlook for the economy, labor markets, and inflation.  In particular, if the Committee indicates that in coming data 
since April has roughly been in line with its expectations for the labor 
market  and inflation—and  that the risks associated wi th Brexit have not 
materialized —the public may see the decision to further delay an increase 
in the policy rate as inc onsistent with earlier FOMC communications. 
• For these reason s, policymakers may want to increase the target range for the 
federal funds rate by 25 basis points or signal that they will likely do so in the 
near future.  
o Policymakers may note that, even if th ere is an  increase, the stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative.  Consistent with such an assessment, the real federal funds rate would still lie well below the prescriptions from most simple policy rules and optimal control exercises shown in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook B.

 • Respondents to the Desk’s latest surveys perceive there to be no material odds 
that the Committee will change the target range at this meeting, and so a decision 
to increase the target range would be ver y surprising.  Respondents’ written 
comments suggest that they would also be surprised by the language in paragraph 3ʹ of Alternative C.  
o If market participants infer that the Committee intends to pursue a less accommodative stance of policy going forward than they had expected, for any given outlook, then medium- and longer- term real interest rates would 
rise, equity prices and inflation compensation would likely decline, and the dollar would appreciate. 
o Nonetheless, if investors see a statement like Alter native C as primarily 
reflecting an upbeat assessment of the strength of the U.S. expansion, then equity prices and inflation compensation might fall less than otherwise, or even rise.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE  A 
Economic Outlook 
• While economic activity ha s picked up in recent months from its low level in the 
first quarter, and job growth rebounded in June, policymakers may be concerned that the previously stated expectation of moderate growth for the rest of the year is overly optimistic.  
o Though payroll growth for June allayed some concerns  raised by the 
disappointing numbers for May, a longer- term perspective indicates that 
the pace of payroll growth has stepped down markedly since the beginning of the year.  In addition, the unemployment rate , the share o f employees 
working part -time for economic reasons, and the long- term unemployment 
share have remained mostly unchanged over the past  three quarters . 
o Continued weakness in business fixed investment suggests that firms may 
not expect aggregate deman d to grow as much as policymakers have been 
projecting. 
• Moreover, both headline and core inflation continue to run noticeably below the Committee’s 2 percent objective and market -based measures of inflation 
compensation are at or near historic lows.   
Alternatives

 • Policymak ers may judge that the risks to the economic outlook a re tilted to the 
downside.  Although the Brexit vote has so far resulted in  minimal disruptions to 
global financial markets, it could ultimately lead to renewed  financial stress in 
Europe and beyond because of contentious Brexit  negotiations, by encouraging 
other EU breakaway movements , or by  increas ing market scrutiny o f the 
vulnerabilities in the European banking system.  P olicymakers might also point to 
downside risk associated with  persistently low  realized inflation and measures of 
longer-run inflation expectations.  Indeed, policymakers may view alternative 
scenarios such as “Severe Financial Stress in Europe” or “Lower Inflation 
Expectations from Weaker Demand” in the “Risks and Uncertainty” s ectio n of 
Tealbook A as increasingly likely.  
Policy Strategy  
• Some policymakers might judge that this year’s uptick in core inflation will prove 
transitory.  
o Policymakers might worry that the failure of inflation to rise to 2 percent 
over the past several years has become ingrained in longer -term inflation 
expectations and that the persistent weakness in  inflation compensation 
measures suggests that the inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting have declined.  
o These policymakers might argue that the chronic failure of policy to raise inflation back to 2 percent is eroding the credibility of the FOMC’s 
commitment to achieving that objective, including the statement that 
positive and negative deviations from this objective are treated symmetrically.  
• Policymakers may believe that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than the 
current unemployment rate —and lower than they estimated previously, or they 
may see virtues in allowing the labor market to firm more over the medium term 
as a way of repairing the damage to the labor market that resulted from the 
prolonged period of weak labor demand follow ing the financial crisis.  
• Policymakers may believe that risk management considerations call for signaling that any further removal of policy accommodation is some time off.  
o Policymakers might observe that, given the proximity to the effective lower 
bound, the scope for conventional policy measures to support the economy 
Alternatives
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 would be limited  in the event that adverse shocks were to hit the economy.  
Moreover, unconventional monetary policies provide imperfect substitutes 
for conventional policy. 
o Policymakers might judge that the neutral rate of interest is low,  relative to 
its historical norm, due to lingering headwinds, which include restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth.  The neutral rate is likely to remain low for quite some time, thus exacerbating the risk that conventional policy could be constrained going forward.   
• Most respondents in the Desk’s latest surveys expect the Committee to emphasize 
the gradual nature of its normalization approach, but about three quarters of respondents expect the FOMC to raise rates this year.  A postmeeting statement 
like Alternative A would therefore be somewhat surprising to financial market participants.  
o Investors would likely push further into the future the expected date of the next rate increase, and the expected path for the federal funds rate would likely flatten further, and longer-term yields would decline.  
o If the statement is primarily seen as more accommodative , equity prices 
and inflation compensation would likely rise, and the dollar would depreciate.  
o Nonetheless, if investors interpret the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat assessment of global economic conditions and greater -than-anticipated concerns over the downside risks to the outlook, 
equity prices and inflation compensation could fall.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared a projection of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet , and of 
key elements of the associated income statement , that is consistent with the monetary 
policy assumptions incorporated in the staff forecast presented in Tealbook A. 
For the purpose of our projection, we assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of maturing Treasury securities and agency debt as well  as principal 
received on agency MBS when the federal funds rate is between 1¼ and 1½ percent, 
which , in the staff forecast,  occur s in the third quarter of 2017.  This assumption reflects 
the staff’s interpretation of the Committee’s statement that it anticipates continuing reinvestments until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is “well under way.”  Once reinvestments cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks through redemptions of maturing Treasury and agency debt securities as well as paydowns of principal on agency 
MBS.  
Regarding the Federal Reserve’s use of policy normalization tools, we assume 
that the level of overnight reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) runs at $100 billion 
through the end of 2018 before declining to zero by the end of 2019, and that term deposits and term RRPs are not used.

Some key features of the projection are highlighted below. 
• Balance sheet.   The size of the portfolio is normalized in the fourth quarter of 
2021, one quarter earlier than in the June Tealbook (see the solid black lines in the 
exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that 
follows).2  At that time, total assets are projected to stand at roughly $2.4 trillion, 
                                                 
1 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in the composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities —a decline in reserve balances and an equal increase in term RRPs or term deposits —but would 
not produce a change in the overall size of the balance sheet.  We also assume that RRPs associated with 
foreign official and international accounts remain near their June 30, 201 6, level of $ 265 billion throughout 
the projection period.  
2 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the secu rities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its longer -run trend ; this trend is determined largely by currency in circulation and 
a projected steady -state level of reserve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of

with about $2.3 trillion in total SOMA securities holdings.  Total assets and 
SOMA Treasury holdings rise thereafter, keeping pace with the increases in both 
Federal Reserve notes in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  
• Federal Reserve earnings remittances.   After record remittances to the Treasury 
of nearly $100 billion in 2015 (excluding remittances associated with the transfer of Federal Reserve surplus under the FAST Act), remittances are projected to decline to about $90 billion this year (see the solid black lines in the “Income Projections” exhib it).  The step -down in 2016 primarily reflects increased interest 
expense on reserves associated with the firming in the stance of policy.  Annual remittances continue to decline in subsequent years, reaching a low of roughly $36 billion in 2019, with no deferred asset being recorded.
3  Relative to the June 
Tealbook, the projected path of remittances is slightly higher in the medium term, primarily reflecting reduced  interest expense associated with a lower path for 
short- term interest rates .  The Federal R eserve’s cumulative remittances from 
2009 through 2025 total about $1.1 trillion.  
• Unrealized gains or losses.  The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of $282 billion at the end of June.
4  Going forward, 
the net unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio will depend importantly on 
the path of longer- term interest rates.  Because of the rise in longer -term interest 
rates assumed over the next several years, the portfolio is projected to shift to an unrealized loss position in the fourth quarter of 2017, one quarter later than estimated in the June Tealbook.  The later onset of a net unrealized loss position 
reflects a slightly lower path for long er-term interest rates.  The portfolio is 
expected to record a peak unrealized loss of approximately  $145 billion in 2019, 
nearly  the same as projected in the June Tealbook.  About $44 billion of that peak 
                                                 
the ba lance sheet depends importantly on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct 
monetary policy .  Currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to be $100 billion ; however, ongoing 
regulatory and structural changes could result in a higher underlying demand for reserve balances.  In turn, 
a higher steady -state level for reserve balances would, all else equal, imply an earlier normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a $500 billion steady -state level of reserve b alances, the 
balance sheet would likely normalize at the beginning  of 2021. 
3 In the event that a Federal Reserve Bank’s earnings fall short of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset for earnings remittances d ue to the U.S. Treasury  
would be recorded. 
4 The Federal Reserve reports the quarter- end net unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s web site at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials.htm#quarterly .

unrealized loss is attributable to losses on holdings of Treasury securities and 
$101 billion to losses on holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position 
contracts from 2020 through 2025, as the value of securities previously acquired under the large- scale asset purchase programs return to par as they approach 
maturity and new securi ties are added to the portfolio at prevailing market yields.  
• Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projections for the 10- Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” the Federal Reserve’s elevated stock of longer -
term securities is estimated to be holding down the term premium embedded in 
the 10-year Treasury yield by 94 basis points in the current quarter.  Over the next 
couple of years, the estimated term premium effect diminishes at a pace of about 4
 basis points per quarter, reflecting in part the proje cted gradual shrinking of the 
portfolio. 
• SOMA c haracteristics.   Approximately $216 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings 
has already matured or will mature this year, and a total of $1.5 trillion will mature between 2016 and 2020 (see the top panel of the exhibit “Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA Holdings”).
5  The amounts of Treasury securities 
maturing each month vary considerably, while projected MBS paydowns are much less variable.  However, realized MBS paydowns will reflect the evolution of interest rates and other factors and thus could be significantly more volatile than projected.
6 
The weighted -average duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about 
6½ years (see the bottom panel of the exhibit).  The weighted-average duration i s 
projected to decline through 2017, reflecting the aging of the portfolio, and subsequently to rise until late 2021 when the size of the balance sheet is 
                                                 
5 While following its current reinvestment policy, the Desk replaces mat uring Treasury securit y 
holdings with newly issued debt at Treasury auctions.   Consistent with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Treasury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a  par amount equal to the 
value of holdings maturing on the issue date of new ly issued  securit ies.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.   The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are placed as noncompetitive tenders and are treated as add -ons to announced 
auction sizes.  
6 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $17  billion of maturing T reasury securities, 
purchased $38 billion of 15 - and 30- year agency MBS under the r einve stment program, and rolled $1.2  
billion in expected settlements .

normalized.7  After reaching its peak, duration is projected to decline as the Desk 
purchases Treasury securities to keep pace with the increase in currency.  T he 
duration contour in this latter portion of the projection is based on the key 
assumption that the Federal Reserve will buy only Treasury bills until those holdings are equal to approximately 30 percent of the Treasury portfolio, similar to the pre-crisis composition of the portfolio (currently there are no Treasury bill holdings).  Thereafter, purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread 
across the maturity spectrum.

7 The duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio initially declines as Treasury securities in the 
portfolio approach maturity.   Once the pace of roll -offs accelerates , starting in 2018, a nd longer tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfolio , the duration increases until the  size of the 
balance sheet is normalized.     
8 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments cease.
