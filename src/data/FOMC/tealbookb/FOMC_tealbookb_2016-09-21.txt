Monetary Policy Strategies 
This section considers a sele ction of monetary policy strategie s for setting the 
federal funds rate and compares the associated policy paths and  macroeconomic 
outcomes to those in the Tealbook baseline forecast.  The strat egies fall into one of two 
categories.  Under simple policy rules, policymakers set the fe deral funds rate according 
to a reaction function that incl udes a small number of macroeco nomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that 
minimizes a loss function meant to capture policymakers’ prefer ences over 
macroeconomic outcomes.  Both approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual 
mandate.  Unless otherwise noted, the simulations assume that p olicymakers will adhere 
to the policy strategy in the futu re and that financial market participants, price setters, and 
wage setters not only believe that policymakers will follow thr ough with their strategy 
but also fully understand the macr oeconomic implications.  Such  policy strategies are 
described as commitment strategies. 
The two approaches have differe nt merits and limitations.  The parsimony of 
simple rules makes them relativ ely easy to communicate to the p ublic, and because they 
respond only to variables that are  central to a range of models, proponents argue that they 
may be more robust to uncertainty  about the structure of the economy.  However, simple 
rules omit, by construction, othe r potential influences on poli cy decisions; thus, strict 
adherence to such rules may, a t times, lead to unsatisfactory o utcomes.  By comparison, 
optimal control policies respond to a broader set of economic f actors; their prescriptions 
optimally balance various po licy objectives.  And although this  section focuses on 
policies under commitment, optim al control policies can more ge nerally be derived under 
various assumptions about the degr ee to which policymakers can commit.  That said, 
optimal control policies assume substantial knowledge on the part of policymakers and are sensitive to the assumed loss function and the specifics of  the particular model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approac hes, they are 
probably best considered together , possibly along with others, as a means to assess the 
various tradeoffs policymakers may face when pursuing their man dated objectives.  
As was the case in the July T ealbook, most of the policy strate gies considered 
herein, though not all, prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than 
assumed in the staff forecast.  Relative to the July Tealbook, the simple rules and optimal

control exercises generally ca ll for a slightly less accommodat ive stance of monetary 
policy, reflecting a bit more pos itive output gap in the staff’ s projection.  
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhib it provides near-term prescript ions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules:   the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first-differe nce rule.1  These prescriptions 
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output g ap and inflation in the near 
term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and middle panels al so include the staff’s 
baseline projection for the federal funds rate. 
 The Taylor-type rules call for federal funds rates above those in the Tealbook 
baseline at the end of 2016. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999 ) rules, which feature no int erest rate smoothing 
term, prescribe substantially hi gher federal funds rates in the  near term than the 
inertial Taylor (1999)  or the first-di fference rules. 
 All three Taylor-type rules cal l for slightly higher policy rates than they did in the 
July Tealbook (after adjusti ng previous-Tealbook values to acco unt for the staff’s 
new estimate of the real fede ral funds rate in the long run) be cause the staff now 
projects a modestly highe r path for the output gap.2  The prescriptions of the first-
difference rule, which depend on e xpected changes in the output  gap and inflation, 
are essentially unchanged.  
A MEDIUM -TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estimate of a Tealb ook-consistent, 
medium-term notion of the equilib rium real federal funds rate t hat is generated using the 
FRB/US model.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r*  corresponds to the level of the real

     1. The prescriptions of rules conditional on the previous Tealbook projection reflect, where applicable, the downward
revision to the staff's estimate of the long−run equilibrium real federal funds rate, as implemented in the current Tealbook.
Moreover, the previous−Tealbook prescriptions of rules featuring the lagged policy rate are conditional on the current−
Tealbook value of the lagged policy rate.
     2. The "Tealbook−consistent FRB/US r *" is the level of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12−quarter
period (beginning in the current quarter) in the FRB/US model, sets the output gap equal to zero in the final quarter of that
period. The "average projected real federal funds rate" is calculated under the Tealbook baseline projection over the same
12−quarter period. Statistics for the previous Tealbook are adjusted to reflect the downward revision to the time−varying
intercept of the baseline policy rule implemented in the current Tealbook.

federal funds rate that, if main tained over a 12-quarter period , sets the output gap to zero 
in the final quart er of that period. 
 The current estimate of r*, at 1.03 percent, is a bit higher than in the July Tealbook 
due to the higher path of the out put gap in the current projection.   
 At 2 basis points, the average level of the real federal funds rate in the staff's forecast 
for the same 12-quarter period used to compute r* is about 1 percentage point below 
r*.  The relatively accommodative stance of policy in the Tealboo k baseline 
projection reflects policy consid erations other than closing th e output gap that are 
embedded in the policy reacti on function assumed by the staff.  
SIMPLE POLICY RULES SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports dynamic simulations of the FRB/US mo del under the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, and the first-
difference rule.  These simulati ons reflect the endogenous responses of the output gap 
and inflation when the federal f unds rate follows the paths implied by the different policy 
rules.3  The intercepts of the Taylor-t ype rules correspond to the sta ff’s assumption that 
the long-run level of the equili brium real federal funds rate e quals ¾ percent. 
 The baseline policy path in the staff forecast is based on a ve rsion of the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the intercept.4  In the 
Tealbook baseline, the nom inal federal funds rate increases abo ut 85 basis points per 
year through the final quar ter of 2019, when it reaches 3.2 percent.  The pace of 
tightening subsequently slows, and t he federal funds rate peaks at 3½ percent in 2021, 
before eventually returning to its longer-run normal level of 2¾ percent. 
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a constant intercept presc ribes a slightly higher 
path for the federal funds rate  over the next few years than th e version with a 
judgmental downward intercept adj ustment used to construct the Tealbook baseline.  
However, the difference in policy rates arising from alternativ e intercept assumptions 
                                                 
3 Because of these endogenous res ponses, the near-term prescript ions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the  first exhibit. 
4 This temporary downward intercept adjustment was made consisten t with the new staff estimate 
of the long-run equilibrium value  of the real fed eral funds rate.  For a motivation of the adjustment, see

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation
rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

is small and dissipate s too rapidly to have a material effect o n the real longer-term 
interest rates that influence economic activity in FRB/US, so m acroeconomic 
outcomes under the inertial Taylo r (1999) rule are similar to t hose in the Tealbook 
baseline. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate  sharp tightening in 
policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that l ie significantly above the 
Tealbook baseline path over the ne xt few years largely because these two policy rules 
do not put weight on the lagged polic y rate.  The Taylor (1999) rule calls for slightly 
higher policy rates than the Tayl or (1993) rule over the period shown because it 
responds more strongly to the pr ojected rise in output above it s potential level over 
the next several years.  As a consequence, the Taylor (1999) ru le generates a higher 
trajectory of the unemployment ra te and a slightly lower trajectory of inflation than 
does the Taylor (1993) rule. 
 The first-difference rule presc ribes a slightl y higher path for  the federal funds rate 
through the first half of 2019 than the Tealbook baseline.  The reafter, the federal 
funds rate edges down whereas i t keeps rising under the Tealboo k baseline.  This 
divergence occurs because the fi rst-difference rule, which resp onds to the expected 
change in the output gap rather than to its level, reacts to th e slower pace of economic 
growth projected late in the decade and beyond.  The lower path  of the federal funds 
rate after 2019, in conjunction wit h expectations of higher price and wage inflation in 
the future, implies lower longer- term real rates over the entir e projection period, as 
well as higher levels of resource utilization and inflation.  T he first-difference rule 
generates outcomes for the unempl oyment rate that are markedly below the 
unemployment rate path s generated under the other policy rules and well below the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under va rious assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specificat ions of the loss function.5  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a c ommitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy 
                                                 
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifica tions; the appendix provides technical 
details on the optimal control simulations.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

choices in a way that improves overall economic outcomes.6  The exhibit also shows the 
current Tealbook baseline forecast. 
 The first simulation, labeled “e qual weights,” presents the cas e in which 
policymakers are assumed to plac e the same weights on keeping h eadline PCE 
inflation close to the Committ ee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping t he unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployment, and on changes in 
the federal funds rate.  Under th is strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is 
significantly higher than the T ealbook baseline policy path.  T his higher path arises 
because, in the current baseline projection, unemployment falls  well below the staff’s 
estimate of the natural rate ove r the next several years.  Under equal-weight 
preferences, policymakers j udge this undershooting of the natur al rate to be costly (as 
would be a similar-sized deviati on of the unemployment rate abo ve the natural rate), 
leading them to tighten policy app reciably more than in the Tea lbook baseline.  This 
tighter policy results in a path of the unemployment rate that is substantially closer to 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate; headline PCE inflatio n is somewhat lower than 
in the Tealbook baseline over th e period shown, consistent with a limited response of 
inflation in the model to lower levels of resour ce utilization.  
 The second simulation, label ed “asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviati ons of the unemployment rate from the natural rate 
when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, b ut that is identical to 
the specification with equal wei ghts when the unemployment rate  is above the natural 
rate.  Under this strat egy, the path of the f ederal funds rate is considerably below both 
the Tealbook baseline path and the path for the case of equal w eights.  Policymakers 
choose this relatively accommodative path for the policy rate b ecause their desire to 
raise inflation to 2 percent is  not tempered by an aversion to the undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment that helps achieve this outcome.  The tighter labor 
market causes inflation to reach 2 percent more quickly than in  the case of equal 
weights; inflation then edges above the Committee’s longer-run objective for the next 
decade.7 
                                                 
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, polic ymakers improve current economic 
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ acti ons; however, the simulations are not 
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.  
7 The simultaneous overshooting of the long-run inflation object ive and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term is time incon sistent, in the sense that, if given the

 The third simulation, labeled “large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function 
that assigns a cost to above-targe t or below-target inflation t hat is five times larger 
than under the specification with e qual weights.  The resulting  optimal strategy is 
only slightly more accommodative than in the case with equal we ights, even though 
the losses associated with undershooting the inflation objectiv e in coming years are 
larger.  The reason is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face an unappealing 
tradeoff because inflation res ponds little to resource utilization.  Hence, policymakers 
would need to engineer a substa ntial undershooting of the natural rate of 
unemployment, which they see as  costly, in order to raise infla tion in the near term by 
a modest amount. 
 The fourth simulation, labeled “ minimal weight on rate adjustme nts,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very sma ll cost to changes in the feder al funds rate but is 
otherwise identical t o the loss function with equal weights.  I n the resulting optimal 
strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the sp ecification with equal 
weights over the next few years in an effort to contain the pro jected undershooting of 
the natural rate of unemployment .  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the 
real 10-year Treasury y ield are also higher for a couple of years than in the case of 
equal weights.  While this policy leaves the trajectory for inf lation almost unaffected, 
it keeps unemployment rate close  to the staff’s estimate of the  natural rate.  
NOMINAL INCOME TARGETING  
With inflation having run below 2 pe rcent for the past several years, the 
Committee may want to explore poli cy strategies that entail com mitments to achieving 
inflation outcomes that are, on average, near its longer-run ob jective by seeking to offset 
past deviations from that object ive.  Moreover, with the federa l funds rate still near its 
effective lower bound (ELB), the C ommittee may wish to examine possible ways to 
deliver additional monetary stimu lus, either in general or in t he event of adverse 
macroeconomic outcomes.  In that sp irit, the pair of special ex hibits, titled “Nominal 
Income Targeting (Tealbook Baseline Scenario)” and “Nominal Inc ome Targeting 
(Recession Scenario),” use the FRB/US model to explore the impl ications of following a 
nominal income (NI) targeting rule—in which monetary policy reacts to the gap between 
                                                 
opportunity to reoptimize the path  of the federal funds rate wi thout regards to past policy commitments, 
policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter mon etary policy.  When we instead simulate 
the model under the assumption of discretion, policy rates and macroeconomic outcomes are roughly 
between those under the Tealbook baseline and those under commi tment.  For the other three specifications 
of the loss function, the simulation results under commitment a nd discretion are similar.

the level of actual nominal GDP and a target path—under the staff’s baseline outlook and 
a recession scenario, respectively.  In thes e scenarios, policy makers adopt the NI 
targeting rule beginning in t he first quarter of 2017, when the  simulations begin.  And as 
in the simulations presented a bove, it is assumed that economic  agents understand the 
model and that policymakers can credibly commit to following an  NI targeting rule for an 
extended period.8 
Because the amount of stimulus that NI targeting delivers depen ds importantly on 
the target path for nominal i ncome and, in particular, on the shortfall in nominal income 
that policymakers seek to offset, w e consider two specification s of the target path.  Under 
the “2016:Q4 NI target,” policymak ers target a path for the lev el of nominal income that, 
in 2016:Q4, equals real potential GDP multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; 
subsequently, the target grows 2 percentage points  faster than the staff’s baseline 
projection for real potential GDP.  Under the “2011:Q4 NI targe t,” policymakers seek to 
make up for the shortfall in nomin al income relative to a path anchored in 2011:Q4, just 
before the Committee announced i ts 2 percent inflation objectiv e.9   
 The first special exhibit show s the effects of responding to th e 2011:Q4 and 2016:Q4 
NI targets conditional on the staff’s current baseline.  The pu rsuit of the 2016:Q4 NI 
target leads to paths for the nom inal federal funds rate and associated macroeconomic 
outcomes that are similar to t hose under the Tealbook baseline.   This similarity arises 
because policymakers begin with only a small NI gap to close (s hown in the upper-
left panel), whereas the output  gap and inflation gap entering the Tealbook baseline 
rule (shown on the first exhibit)  have largely offsetting effects on the prescriptions of 
that rule. 
 The pursuit of the 2011:Q4 NI target entails closing a nominal income gap that is 
initially 2½ percentage points larger than under the 2016:Q4 NI target; accordingly, 
policy in this instance is significantly more accommodative.  U nder the 2011:Q4 NI 
                                                 
8 For increased comparability, the NI targeting rule used herein  features the same weight on the 
lagged federal funds rate and temporary intercept adjustment as  the inertial Taylor (1999) rule used to 
construct the Tealbook baseline.   In the Monetary Policy Strate gies section of the March 2016 Tealbook B 
and in earlier memos to the FOMC, the NI targeting rule typical ly featured a lower degree of inertia and no 
temporary intercept adjustment. 
9 Under both NI targets, we use th e current estimates of the pat h of real potential GDP and the 
GDP deflator to compute the respective NI target paths.  Were t he Federal Reserve to pursue such targets, 
revisions to these estimates coul d affect the level of the nomi nal income gap that the rule seeks to close, 
thus requiring an adjustment to the stance of policy.

target, the federal funds rate does not exceed 1 percent until the second half of 2018, 
about one year later than under th e 2016:Q4 NI target.  As a result, inflation 
persistently exceeds 2 percent,  an outcome that reduces real in terest rates and, in turn, 
exacerbates the undershooting of t he natural rate of unemployme nt.  
 The second special exhibit shows the effects of adopting the sa me 2011:Q4 and 
2016:Q4 NI targets under a recession scenario that begins in ea rly 2017.  The ensuing 
drop in resource utilization and weakening of inflation cause a  large shortfall in 
nominal income.  Both NI targeti ng policies are notably more ac commodative than 
the intercept-adjusted inertial Taylor rule policy, with the federal funds rate remaining 
at the ELB longer and rising somew hat more gradually after departing from the 
ELB.10  Accordingly, the unemployment ra te falls somewhat more rapidl y than in the 
baseline recession scenario; inf lation rises back toward 2 perc ent more quickly and 
then stays above this level for an extended period of time, esp ecially under the 
2011:Q4 NI target.  Because monetary policy works with a lag, t he NI policies have 
little effect on the severity of  the recession but are, nonethe less, more effective than 
the Tealbook baseline policy ru le at hastening the recovery. 
 The ability of NI targeting rules  to speed the economic recovery relies on the 
assumption that policymakers can credibly commit to high levels  of resource 
utilization and infla tion over the medium run to make up for pa st shortfalls in nominal 
income growth.11  However, once that situation ari ses, policymakers may well fi nd it 
preferable to scale back on the amount of accommodation embedde d in the rule.  To 
the extent that the public antic ipates such a shift, policymakers’ ability to improve 
near-term macroeconomic outcomes would be reduced. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations described above. 
                                                 
10 In constructing the recession scenario, we assume that policym akers immediately lower the 
federal funds rate to the ELB even if the interest rate smoothi ng term in the NI rule might have called for 
doing so gradually. 
11 The assumed credibility of mone tary policy in the model also g uarantees that inflation 
expectations will not become unanchored over the medium term as  the economy modestly overheats.

Appendix 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for the four simple polic y rules reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, and the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period ( ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap 
(4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ l onger-run inflation objective, denoted πLR, is 2 percent. 
 
The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (199 3, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently  in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules, denoted ݎ௅ோ, are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 
2 percent longer-run inflation objective and a longer-run real federal funds rate of ¾ percent, a 
value used in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rat e; see Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculat ed taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When th e Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are s hown for the current and next q uarters.  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the  prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter sho wn, and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of changes in the macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions o f these inertial rules, the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook proj ection” report prescriptions con ditional on the previous Tealbook 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012). 
2 All nominal and real f ederal funds rates reported in the Monet ary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal fu nds rate.  Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully-compounded, 365-day basis and 
then converted to a 360-day basis. Taylor (1993) rule ܴ௧ൌݎ௅ோ൅ߨ௧൅0.5ሺߨ௧െߨ௅ோሻ൅0.5݌ܽ݃ݕ ௧

projections for inflation and the output gap but using the valu e of the lagged federal funds rate in 
the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit titled “Policy Rules and the St aff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds ra te, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-qu arter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quart er of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric mod el of the U.S. economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected val ues of the model’s exogenous vari ables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted s o that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  Model simulations then determine t he value of the real federal funds 
rate that closes the output ga p conditional on the exogenous va riables in the extended baseline 
forecast. 
The “average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the  panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter 
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r *.  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic outcomes even when their values are 
identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal f unds rate is held constant over  
the entire 12-quarter period to c lose the output gap at the end  of this timeframe whereas, in the 
Tealbook baseline, the real federal funds rate can vary over ti me.  Distinct paths of real short-term 
rates can, in turn, generate different paths for inflation and economic activity. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The exhibits of “Monetary Policy Strategies” that report results from simulations of 
alternative policies are derive d from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model.  Each simulated 
policy rule is assumed to be in force over the whole period covered by the simulation; this period 
extends several decades beyond the time horizon shown in the exhibits.  The simulations are conducted under the assumption that market participants as well  as price and wage setters have 
perfect foresight, and are predicated on the staff’s extended T ealbook projection, which includes 
the macroeconomic effects of the  Committee’s large-scale asset purchase programs.  When the 
Tealbook is published early in a quarter, all of the simulations begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations  begin in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF THE OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICY UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimiz e a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference betwe en four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation, ߨ௧௉஼ா, and the Committee’s 2 percen t objective), squared unemploymen t gaps (݌ܽ݃ݑ௧,

embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future usi ng a quarterly discount factor

The exhibit “Optimal Control Si mulations under Commitment” cons iders four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
The first specification, titled “equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three 
components at all times.  The second specification, titled “asy mmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the 
same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the un employment rate is above the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling 
below the natural rate.  The third specification, titled “large  weight on inflation gap,” attaches a 
relatively large weight to inflation gaps.  The fourth specific ation, titled “minimal weight on rate 
adjustments,” places almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.3  The table below 
shows the weights used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) valu es of the weights. 
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates,  under the assumption of perfect 
foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the T ealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that decision makers in the 
                                                 
3 The inclusion of a minimal but  strictly positive weight on cha nges in the federal funds rate helps 
ensure a well-behaved numerical solution.

model see this path as being a binding commitment on future Com mittee decisions; the optimal 
control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the f ederal funds rate but is otherwise 
unconstrained by policy decisions  made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are 
calculated over a period that ends sufficiently far in the futu re that extending that period farther 
would not affect the policy pr escriptions shown in the exhibits . 
NOMINAL INCOME TARGETING RULE 
The nominal income targeting rule used in the pair of special e xhibits titled “Nominal 
Income Targeting (Tealbook Baseline Scenario)” and “Nominal Income Targeting (Recession 
Scenario)” is expressed as 
ܴ௧ൌ 	0.85ܴ ௧ିଵ൅0.15ሺݎ௧∗	൅ߨ௧	൅	݊ݕ௧െ݊ݕ௧∗ሻ.4 
The prescriptions of this rule depend on the lagged federal funds rate, a time-varying intercept 
(ݎ௧∗), four-quarter core PCE inflati on, and a nominal income gap de fined as the difference 
between nominal income (denoted ݊ݕ௧ and calculated as 100 times the log of the level of nominal 
GDP) and a time-varying target (denoted ݊ݕ௧∗ and calculated as 100 times the log of target 
nominal GDP).  The target ݊ݕ௧∗ grows 2 percentage points fast er per year than the staff’s estimate 
of real potential GDP growth.5  In the special exhibit, the level of ݊ݕ௧∗ is calibrated in two ways.  
In the first calibration, the initial target value is set so that policymakers address only nominal income shortfalls since 2016:Q4.  In the second calibration, th e initial value for ݊ݕ
௧∗ is set so that 
the rule seeks to offset the cumulative nominal income gap sinc e 2011:Q4.  In both cases, the 
resulting nominal income gap can be expressed as the sum of the  current estimate of the output 
gap and the shortfall of the GDP deflator from the level it wou ld have attained had it grown at a 
2 percent annual pace since the da te associated with the calibr ation.6 
To emphasize the role of the nominal income gap, the nominal in come rule used in this 
Tealbook puts the same weight on the lagged federal funds rate and features the same time-
varying intercept as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule used to construct the Tealbook baseline.  In 
past Tealbooks and staff analysis (such as Erceg and others (2012)), the weight on the lagged 
federal funds rate was typically set to 0.75 and the intercept was held constant at  rLR.

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
During the first half of the year, the outlook for economic activity and inflation 
had become clouded:  Output grow th in the first and second quar ters appeared sluggish, 
payroll gains in May were qui te weak, and policymakers were con fronted by increases in 
some near-term global risks.  Consequently, the Committee elect ed to hold off on further 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate.  More  recently, those global risks 
appear to have abated and incomi ng economic data—including the available readings on 
spending in the third qua rter—have generall y supported the view  that growth has picked 
up.  Nevertheless, while recent job gains have, on average, bee n solid—suggesting that 
the very weak growth in payrolls  in May was an aberration—many measures of labor 
utilization, including the unemp loyment rate, have shown little or no change since the 
beginning of this year.  Meanwh ile, both headline and core PCE inflation, measured on a 
12-month basis, have continued t o run below 2 percent and have shown no further 
increase since stepping up a t the start of the year. 
The key question for policymakers is whether, given the current ly available 
information, an increase in the f ederal funds rate is warranted  at this meeting, or whether, 
at least for the time being, it is appropriate to maintain the current target range (and 
possibly update the Committee’s communications about future pol icy) in order to ensure 
continued progress toward the C ommittee’s objectives.  While th e three alternative policy 
statements provide similar descri ptions of the incoming data an d the economic outlook, 
they offer different settings of  the policy rate in the near te rm as well as different signals 
about the likely stance  of policy going forward.   
 In characterizing the recent data , all three alte rnatives highl ight a pickup in growth of 
economic activity “from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year,” and 
acknowledge strength in household spending as well as remaining  softness in 
business fixed investment.  While all three alternatives note t hat the labor market “has 
continued to strengthen,” the s tatements differ somewhat in the ir characterization of 
the details of labor market conditions. 
o Alternatives B and C point to sol id job gains, while cautioning  that “the 
unemployment rate is little  changed in recent months.”

 o While also noting that job gains “have been solid” on average, Alternative A 
emphasizes “little change in lab or utilization” based on labor market 
indicators other than payrolls, “including the unemployment rat e.”   
 The three alternatives largely a gree in their interpretations o f the incoming price data.   
o All three retain language used in recent statements acknowledging that 
inflation “has continued to run below” the Committee’s 2 percen t longer-run 
objective, and note that this situ ation either “partly” reflect s (in the case of 
Alternatives B and C) or “only par tly” reflects ( in the case of  Alternative A) 
earlier declines in energy pri ces and in prices of non-energy i mports.   
o Furthermore, all three alternativ es indicate, as in the July st atement, that 
measures of inflation compensati on “remain low” and that most s urvey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations a re “little chan ged.” 
 With respect to the outlook for economic activity and inflation and its implications 
for monetary policy: 
o Alternatives B and C retain the J uly statement language affirmi ng the 
Committee’s expectation that, “with gradual adjustments in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pa ce” while 
adding that labor market conditions will strengthen “somewhat further” (instead of “labor market indica tors will strengthen” as in Jul y).  The addition 
of “somewhat further” signals t hat the Committee does not expect labor 
market conditions to strengthen indefinitely.  
o By contrast, Alternative A expresses the Committee’s expectatio n that 
economic activity will expand at a moderate pace “with the appropriate stance 
of monetary policy” rather than “ with gradual adjustments.”  (L ike 
Alternatives B and C, A lternative A replaces labor market “indi cators” with 
“conditions,” but omits “somewhat” in characterizing how they w ill 
strengthen further.)  
o All three alternatives reaffirm  the Committee’s expectation tha t inflation will 
“remain low in the near term,” in part because of earlier decli nes in energy 
prices, but that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medi um term as the 
transitory effects of  those earlier declines  dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.  Alternati ve A, however, qualifies that fo recast by noting 
that inflation will rise “gradually” to 2 percent.

  Alternatives B and C offer different ways of updating the Commi ttee’s assessment of 
risks to the economic outlook, whereas Alternative A removes fr om the statement any 
characterization of risks:   
o In light of the incoming data on spending and the labor market, Alternative B 
characterizes near-term risks to the economic outlook as appear ing “roughly 
balanced” rather than as having “ diminished” (as in July).  The  
characterization of risks is lim ited to the near term.  This is  because certain 
risks—such as those stemming fro m yet-to-be-started Brexit nego tiations or 
from the limited ability of monetary policy to stabilize the ec onomy in 
response to adverse developments w hile short-term interest rate s remain near 
zero—may remain tilted to the downside at horizons beyond the n ear-term.  
o Reflecting a more optimistic assessment and foreshadowing its p olicy 
decision, Alternative C describes the near-term risks to the ec onomic outlook 
as appearing “balanced.”  
o Alternative A, in contrast, mer ely drops the previous assertion that “near-term 
risks to the economic outlook have diminished,” thereby suggesting there has been no change in the Committee’s assessment of risks since Jul y.   
 Turning to the policy decision, A lternatives A and B maintain t he current target range 
for the federal funds rate but o ffer very different signals about the Committee’s likely 
next steps; Alternative C raises the target range.   
o While noting that “the case for a n increase in the federal fund s rate has 
strengthened,” Alternative B adds that the Committee “decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its 
objectives.”  With these words , Alternative B acknowledges past  progress in 
labor market conditions and inflation, indicates that the Commi ttee is adopting 
a wait-and-see posture, but signa ls that, if the economy evolve s about as 
expected, it may not take long for the Committee to see suffici ent evidence to 
warrant raising rates. 
o Alternative C raises the tar get range by 25 basis points; it no tes that, even 
after that increase, monetary policy remains accommodative and thus will 
support further (or “some furthe r”) strengthening in labor market conditions 
and inflation returning to 2 percent, consistent with the econo mic outlook 
summarized in paragraph 2 of the statement.

 o Alternative A communicates a j udgment that the outlook and asso ciated risks 
warrant deferring an increase in t he target range “until inflat ion moves closer 
to 2 percent on a sustained basis.”  If the staff’s forecast pr oves correct, the 
inflation condition will not be met in short order.

 JULY 2016  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in June indicates 
that the labor market strengthe ned and that economic activity h as been expanding at a 
moderate rate.  Job gains were  strong in June following weak gr owth in May.  On 
balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators point to so me increase in labor 
utilization in recent months.  Household spending has been grow ing strongly but 
business fixed investment has been soft.  Inflation has continu ed to run below the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run o bjective, partly reflecting e arlier declines in 
energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation remain l ow; most survey-based measures o f longer-term 
inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recen t months.   
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee currently expect s that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.  Inf lation is expected to 
remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier decline s in energy prices, but to 
rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effect s of past declines in 
energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengt hens further.  Near-
term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.  The Commit tee continues to 
closely monitor inflation indi cators and global economic and fi nancial developments.   
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ per cent.  The stance of monetary p olicy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions 
and a return to 2 percent inflation.   
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run.  H owever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data.  
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the  level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may view the infor mation they have received so far  about the labor 
market and real activity as consistent, on balance, with earlie r expectations for stronger 
output growth and continued improvement in labor markets.  They  might also conclude 
that developments with regard to inflation have proceeded about as expected.  While 
these developments may have st rengthened the case for raising t he target range for the 
federal funds rate, policymakers may prefer to wait for additio nal evidence supporting 
their expectations of continued p rogress in labor markets and inflation returning to 2 
percent before committing to the  next rate rise.  Moreover, policymakers may judge that 
not much additional evidence may be needed to warrant a rate hi ke and might wish to 
indicate so in the statement. 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The solid average gain in payroll employment over recent months has exceeded most 
estimates of longer-run labor for ce growth, indicating further increases in labor 
utilization.1  However, since the beginning of t he year, the unemployment ra te has, on 
net, remained unchanged at 4.9 perc ent, suggesting little incre ase in resource 
utilization (an impression suppor ted also by other labor market indicators, such as the 
share of employees working part- time for economic reasons, and the long-term 
unemployment share).  
 While recent data on inventories, business fixed investment, an d residential 
construction continued to show weakness, generally strong readings on consumer 
spending have led the staff to mark up its outlook for 2016:H2 real GDP growth to 
about 2.6 percent.  
 Policymakers may judge that, in lig ht of incoming data that lar gely confirm their 
earlier outlook, downside risks, i ncluding those from abroad, h ave diminished further 
since July, and may see near-ter m risks to the U.S. economic ou tlook as roughly 
balanced. 
 Twelve-month core and headlin e inflation stepped up at the begi nning of the year but 
have not increased since, and head line inflation continues to r un below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective .  Policymakers may have expected inflation to return

Gains” shown in Tealbook A.

 only slowly to 2 percent all along, as in the staff forecast.  But historically low levels 
of longer-term inflation compensation and survey measures of lo nger-run inflation 
expectations might still be tempering policymakers’ confidence in this outlook.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge it prudent to wait for more evidence that domestic demand 
will continue to grow at a moderate pace and that the labor mar ket will strengthen 
somewhat further before taking their next step in adjusting the stance of monetary 
policy.   
o While job gains have rebounded sin ce May, the unemployment rate  and 
several other measures of res ource utilization have changed lit tle since the 
beginning of the year.  Waiting somewhat longer before raising the federal 
funds rate could allow the Com mittee to better assess underlyin g trends in 
employment, productivity, and inflation.   
o In light of mostly favorable ec onomic and financial development s in recent 
months, policymakers may be lean ing toward removing some policy  
accommodation.  However, the combination of slow-to-moderate ou tput 
growth, little changed labor uti lization, and persistently low wage and price 
inflation since the start of t he year—while policy rates have r emained low—
may have tempered somewhat policymakers’ confidence in their es timates of 
the amount of accommodation pr ovided by current policy settings.  As a 
result, policymakers may judge it appropriate to take a wait-and-see posture.  
o In addition, policymakers may pref er to postpone a rate hike, f or the time 
being, in light of risk management considerations related to th e proximity of 
nominal rates to the effectiv e lower bound, which limits the ab ility of 
monetary policy to respond to negative shocks. 
 A decision to maintain the curren t target range for the federal funds rate would be in 
line with the expectations of fin ancial market participants.  
o The probability of an increase i n the federal funds rate target range at the 
September meeting derived from fe deral funds futures quotes is 
approximately 15 percent.  Similarl y, respondents to the Desk’s  latest Survey 
of Primary Dealers and Survey of  Market Participants perceive o nly a modest 
probability that the Committee will alter the target range at t his meeting.

 o The Desk’s surveys suggest tha t market particip ants will not be  surprised by 
the changes in paragraph 1 of A lternative B.  In contrast, few respondents 
expect the Committee to upgrade its assessment of risks to the outlook, 
suggesting that many market participants may be surprised by th e sentence 
indicating that near-t erm risks to the economic outlook “appear  roughly 
balanced” in paragra ph 2 of Alternative B.   
o The majority of respondents to both surveys see the December me eting as the 
most likely timing of the next inc rease in the target range for the federal funds 
rate, and the new language in pa ragraph 3 of Alternative B coul d reinforce 
such expectations.  While the new  language may s till surprise m arket 
participants to some extent, at least several survey respondent s expected the 
Chair to reiterate at her press conference earlier remarks (mad e at the Jackson 
Hole conference in August) that “t he case for an increase in th e federal funds 
rate has strengthened.”  
o Of course, the market reaction t o alternative B could also be i nfluenced by the 
economic and policy outlook reported in the Committee’s Summary  of 
Economic Projections (SEP) that will also be released at the co nclusion of this 
meeting.  Respondents to the Desk’ s surveys generally expect th e median of 
FOMC participants’ federal funds  rate projections in the SEP fo r year-end 
2016 to reflect just one rate hi ke this year, down from two hik es in the June 
SEP; they continue to expect an implied pace of tightening of three hikes per 
year for 2017 and 2018.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Based on continued readings of the u nemployment rate at a level  within the 
central tendency of the Committee’s long-run projections of thi s measure (as published in 
the June 2016 SEP), policymakers may see the real economy as op erating near levels 
consistent with its longer-run capacity and close to maximum su stainable employment.  
Moreover, with core PCE inflation averaging above 1.5 percent a nd trimmed mean PCE 
inflation near 2 percent, policym akers may judge that inflation  is not so low as to warrant 
concern—particularly if they exp ect inflation to rise as output  growth and resource 
utilization pick up in the second half of the year.  Furthermor e, policymakers may see 
financial stability risks arising from excessive risk taking be havior in a low interest rate 
environment.  Accordingly, policymakers may judge that an incre ase in the target range 
for the federal funds rate is  called for at this meeting.

 Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers might view the so lid average pace of job growth co upled with the 
strong increase in consumer spending in recent months as confir mation that both the 
slowdown in employment growt h in May and the modest output grow th in the first 
half of the year were transitory.   
 Gains in real disposable incom e have been solid—reflecting both  rising employment 
and the earlier period of very l ow headline inflation—and household balance sheets 
have improved further.  Policymakers may see economic condition s as favorable for 
solid consumption growth going forward.   
 Policymakers might see the average pace of job gains in recent months, though less 
rapid than last year and early t his year, as nonetheless faster than their projections of 
trend growth in the labor force. 
 Policymakers may project that aggregate demand will grow more r apidly than the 
economy’s potential output, absent further increases in the target range for the federal 
funds rate in the near term, a nd they may view resource utiliza tion as already tight. 
o Policymakers might anticipate th at further tightening of labor market 
conditions, combined with medioc re productivity growth, will pu t increasing 
upward pressure on wages and on prices of goods and services—po ssibly 
going beyond what is captured by th e “Temporarily Weaker Produc tivity” 
scenario described in the “Risk s and Uncertainty” section of Te albook A—
unless policy accommodation was removed soon.  
o Moreover, with oil prices apparently having stabilized in a fai rly narrow 
range, policymakers may conclude t hat the restraint on inflatio n from 
transitory factors is  already subsiding.  
 Policymakers might see the news received since the last meeting as consistent with describing the near-term risks t o the outlook as “balanced,” ra ther than “roughly 
balanced” (as in Alternative B).  In addition to the incoming d ata on employment and 
spending, they may view developmen ts in financial markets, whic h seem more 
favorable than in the first half  of the year, as supporting the ir new assessment of the 
balance of risks.

 Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that cu rrent conditions and the outlook warrant an increase 
in the target range for the fed eral funds rate of 25 basis points at this meeting.  
o Policymakers may see a higher ch ance of growth picking up much more 
forcefully than anticipated, for  example, under the staff’s bas eline forecast, 
calling for much quicker increases  in the federal funds rate in  the future that 
could eventually contribute to a nother recessi on.  Accordingly,  policymakers 
may deem a tightening of the stance of monetary policy at this meeting as 
appropriate to reduce the risk that an undesirably rapid pace o f increases will 
become necessary in the future.  
o Policymakers might worry that no t raising the target range for the federal 
funds rate at this meeting could lead the public to question th e credibility of 
the Committee’s earlier communi cations.  In particular, if the Committee 
indicates that incoming data ha ve roughly been in line with its  projections for 
the labor market and inflation, the public may see the decision  to further delay 
an increase in the policy rate a s inconsistent with earlier communications.  
o Policymakers may be concerned th at leaving policy rates unchang ed in the 
face of an unemployment rate tha t is at or below estimates of i ts longer-run 
normal level would foster expectations that monetary policy wil l be 
insufficiently responsive to evolving economic conditions.  If the public were 
to begin doubting policymakers’ co mmitment to maintaining low a nd stable 
inflation, longer-term inflation e xpectations cou ld rise too much.   
o In addition, policymakers might be worried that maintaining the  federal funds 
rate at its current low level w ill induce further “reach for yi eld” and other 
excessive risk-taking behavior i n financial markets.  For example, they may 
point to elevated valuations in c ommercial real estate as indic ative of rising 
risks to financial stability t hat should be countered by reduce d monetary 
policy accommodation.  
o Policymakers may note that, eve n after a 25 basis point increas e, the stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative.  Consistent with such an  
assessment, the real federal f unds rate would still lie well below the 
prescriptions from most simple  policy rules and optimal control  exercises 
shown in the “Monetary Polic y Strategies” s ection of Tealbook B .

 o Policymakers may see little differe nce in the direct effects on the economy 
between raising the federal funds  rate now rather than later.  However, they 
might point to good momentum in incoming data as supporting rai sing rates 
now rather than later, when f resh but noisy readings on incomin g data or some 
transitory financial turbulence may complicate the communicatio n of an 
otherwise appropriate rate increase. 
 Respondents to the Desk’s latest  surveys perceive there to be a  roughly 15 percent 
probability that the Committee will change the target range at this meeting, and so a 
decision to increase the target  range would be very surprising.    
o If market participants infer t hat the Committee intends to purs ue a less 
accommodative stance of policy going forward than they had expe cted, for 
any given outlook, then it is lik ely that medium- and longer-te rm real interest 
rates will rise, that equity pri ces and inflation compensation will decline, and 
that the dollar will appreciate.  
o Nonetheless, if investors see a statement like Alternative C as  primarily 
reflecting an upbeat assessment of the strength of the U.S. expansion—
supported by a continuation of only gradual increases in the fe deral funds 
rate—then equity prices and inflati on compensation might fall l ess than 
otherwise, or even rise.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
While economic growth appears to have picked up from its modest pace in the 
first half of the year, and j ob growth has rebounded since May,  policymakers may be 
concerned that their stated e xpectation of moderate growth could again prove overly 
optimistic.  In addition, they might be worried that this year’ s small uptick in core 
inflation will prove transitor y.  In light of such concerns, po licymakers may judge it 
appropriate to signal that any f urther removal of policy accomm odation is off until a 
more sustained increase i n inflation has been observed. 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Both headline and core inflati on continue to run noticeably bel ow the Committee’s 2 
percent objective and market-base d measures of i nflation compen sation are at or near 
historical lows.  In particular , policymakers might worry that the failure of inflation to 
rise to 2 percent over the past s everal years has become ingrained in longer-term 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
September 15, 2016
Page 40 of 60

 inflation expectations and that the persis tent weakness in infl ation compensation 
measures suggests that the infla tion expectations relevant for wage and price setting 
have declined. 
 Though payroll growth over recent months allayed some concerns raised by the 
disappointing numbers for May, the average pace of payroll grow th has stepped down 
markedly since the beginning of the year.  In addition, the une mployment rate, the 
share of employees working part- time for economic reasons, and the long-term 
unemployment share have change d little over the past three quar ters. 
 Moreover, continued weakness in inventories and business fixed investment suggests 
that firms may not expect aggregate demand to grow as much as policymakers have 
been projecting.  
 Policymakers may judge that the ri sks to the economic outlook are still tilted to the 
downside.   
o So far, the Brexit vote has resu lted in minimal disruptions to global financial 
markets.  Nevertheless, the outcome of the vote could ultimatel y lead to 
renewed financial stress in Europe and beyond because of conten tious future 
Brexit negotiations, the possibi lity of other EU breakaway movements, or 
increased market scrutiny of the vulnerabilities in the Europea n banking 
system.   
o Furthermore, policymakers might  see the volatility in financial  markets during 
the past week as an indication that markets remain fragile.   
o Policymakers might also point to downside risk associated with persistently 
low readings on realized inflation and measures of longer-run i nflation 
expectations.  Indeed, policymaker s may view developments as outlined, for 
example, in the alternative scen arios “Weak Business Investment ” in the 
“Risks and Uncertainty” sect ion of Tealbook A as increasingly l ikely.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may believe that risk management considerations ca ll for signaling that 
any further removal of policy a ccommodation is some time off.  
o Policymakers might observe that , given the proximity to the effective lower 
bound, the scope for conventiona l policy measures to support th e economy 
would be limited in the event that adverse shocks were to hit t he economy.  
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 Moreover, unconventional monetary policies provide imperfect su bstitutes for 
conventional policy.  
o Policymakers might judge that the  neutral rate of interest is l ow, relative to its 
longer-run level, due to restrain t on U.S. economic activity from economic 
and financial developments abroad, subdued household formation,  or meager 
productivity growth.  They may see the neutral rate as likely t o remain low for 
quite some time, thus exacerbating the risk that conventional p olicy could be 
constrained going forward.   
 Some policymakers might argue that the chronic failure of polic y to raise inflation to 
2 percent is eroding th e credibility of the FOMC’s commitment to achieving that 
objective and calling into question its statement that positive  and negative deviations 
from this objective are treated symmetrically.  
 Policymakers may believe that th e natural rate of unemployment is lower than the 
current unemployment rate.  Alter natively, they may see virtues in allowing the 
unemployment rate to undershoot t emporarily its natural rate as  a way of repairing the 
damage to the labor market that  resulted from the prolonged period of weak labor 
demand following the financial c risis.  Accordingly, they may s ee increases in the 
federal funds rate, at least ove r the near-term, as counterprod uctive for achieving the 
Committee’s statutory goals.  
 Most respondents to the Desk’s la test surveys expect the Commit tee to continue to 
emphasize the gradual nature of i ts normalization approach, but  a large majority of 
respondents expects th e FOMC to raise rates this year.  A postm eeting statement like 
Alternative A would therefore be surprising to financial market participants.  
o Investors would likely push furth er into the future the expecte d date of the 
next rate increase, and the expected path for the federal funds rate would 
likely flatten further and longe r-term yields would likely decl ine. 
o If the statement is primarily seen as more accommodative, equit y prices and 
inflation compensation would lik ely rise, and the dollar would depreciate.  
o Conversely, if investors interpre t the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly 
downbeat assessment of global economic conditions and greater-t han-
anticipated concerns about the  downside risks to the outlook, e quity prices and 
inflation compensation could fall.

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet, and of 
key elements of the associated income statement, under two scen arios for the paths of 
monetary policy and longer-t erm interest rates.   
 The “September Tealbook baseline” scenario is consistent with t he monetary policy 
assumptions incorporated in the s taff’s baseline forecast prese nted in Tealbook A.  In 
this scenario, the federal funds  rate path is projected to rise  to about 3½ percent by the 
end of 2020, with a corresponding increase in longer-term inter est rates.   
 The “Greenspan conundrum” scenari o incorporates a flat path for longer-term interest 
rates in the near term, as assumed in the scenario of the same name in the Risks and 
Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.1  Under this scenario, longe r-term interest rates 
remain fixed at their levels  as of the third quarter of 2016 ov er the next six quarters 
despite the projected rise in the policy rate as prescribed by the inertial Taylor (1999) 
rule.  Thereafter, the conundr um slowly unwinds.  In the meanti me, lower longer-
term rates spur a faster pace of economic expansion and, consequently, a steeper path 
for the policy rate relative to the baselin e scenario. 
The key policy assumptions associated with these scenarios are highlighted below.  
 Reinvestment policy:   We continue to assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of maturing Treas ury securities and agency debt a s well as principal 
received on agency MBS when the target range for the federal fu nds rate reaches 1¼ 
and 1½ percent, which occurs in the third qu arter of 2017 under  both scenarios.  Once 
reinvestments cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks through redemptions of maturing 
Treasury and agency debt securiti es as well as paydowns of principal on agency MBS 
until reserve balances reach a level of $100 billion.   
 Use of policy normalization tools:   The scenarios assume that take-up of overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement s (RRPs) runs at a level of $100 bi llion through the end 
                                                 
1 The alternative view box titled “A Return to the Greenspan Con undrum” in the DEDO section of 
Tealbook A details possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon. 
Projections

of 2018 before declining to zero by the end of 2019, and that t erm deposits and term 
RRPs are not used.2 
Other features of these scen arios are described below. 
 Balance sheet.   Under the baseline scenario, th e size of the portfolio is normalized in 
the fourth quarter of 2021, unchange d from the July Tealbook (s ee the solid black 
lines in the exhibit titled “Tot al Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the 
table that follows).3  At that time, total assets are  projected to stand at roughly $2.4 
trillion, with about $2.3 trillion in total SOMA securities holdings.  Total assets and 
SOMA Treasury holdings rise thereafter, keeping pace with the i ncreases in both 
Federal Reserve notes in circul ation and Federal Reserve Bank c apital. 
Under the conundrum scenario, rela tively lower interest rates o n longer-dated 
Treasury securities through the medium term put downward pressu re on mortgage 
rates, causing the trajectory of  MBS prepayments to be higher during this period.  
Therefore, after reinvestment s cease, SOMA holdings of agency M BS are projected 
to be lower than in the baseline scenario.  As a result, the si ze of the portfolio is 
normalized in the third quart er of 2021, one quarter earlier th an in the baseline 
scenario.4  
 
                                                 
2 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the over all size of the balance sheet.  We assume that RRPs associated with foreign 
official and international accounts remain near their August 31 , 2016 level of $251 billion throughout the 
projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend; this trend is determined largely by cu rrency in circulation and 
a projected long-run level of re serve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the 
balance sheet depends importantly  on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct monetary 
policy.  Currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to  be $100 billion; howev er, policymakers’ 
choice of a long-run operating framework, as well as ongoing re gulatory and structural changes, could 
result in a higher long-run level  of reserve balances.  In turn , a higher long-run level of reserve balances 
would, all else equal, imply an earlier normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet.  For instance, with a 
$500 billion long-run level of reserve balances, the balance sheet would likely normalize at the beginning 
of 2021, roughly three quarters earlier than in the baseline sc enario. 
4 The lower level of MBS in the c onundrum scenario implies a nee d to resume purchases of 
Treasury securities somewhat sooner that in the baseline scenar io in order to accommoda te rising currency 
demand.  Consequently, at the end of the projection period, the  share of Treasury holdings relative to MBS 
is larger in the conundrum scenario than in the baseline.

 Federal Reserve earnings remittances.   Under the baseline scenario, annual 
remittances are projected to decline from $98 billion in 2015 t o about $93 billion this 
year (see the solid black lines i n the “Income Projections” exh ibit).5  The step-down 
primarily reflects increased int erest expense on reserves resul ting from the decision to 
increase the target range for the federal funds rate, and thus the IOER rate, in 
December 2015.6  Annual remittances are projected to continue to decline, reac hing a 
low of roughly $35 billion in 2019, with no deferred asset bein g recorded.7  Under the 
baseline scenario, the Federal Reserve’s projected remittances from 2009 through 
2025 total about $1.1 trillion.  
Under the conundrum scenario, cumulative remittances over the 2 009 to 2025 period 
are projected to be about $58 bil lion lower than in the baselin e projection, reflecting 
the combination of lower interest income and higher interest ex pense throughout the 
projection period (see the dotted red line i n the “Income Proje ctions” exhibit).  
Regarding interest income, the hi gher path for MBS prepayments results in lower 
MBS coupon income, especially in the medium term.  Regarding in terest expense, 
flat longer-term rates in the near  term lead to a more rapid increase in the pace of 
economic expansion and, in turn, t o a steeper path for the poli cy target and for the 
IOER rate, which translates into higher interest expense.8  
 
   
                                                 
5 Earnings remittances for 2015 exclude a one-time transfer of $ 19 billion in Federal Reserve 
surplus associated with the FAST Act. 
6 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balance s will average 12.5 basis points 
above the effective federal funds rate and the ON RRP rate will  average 12.5 basis points below the 
effective federal funds rate.  The effective federal funds rate  has averaged 40 basis points over the 
intermeeting period. 
7 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury. 
8 This feature arises even as res erve balances are somewhat lowe r than in the ba seline scenario 
until the balance sheet is normalized.

 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of $265 billion at the end of August.9  Going forward, the net 
unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio will depend i mportantly on the path of 
longer-term interest rates.  Under the baseline scenario, becau se of the rise in longer-
term interest rates assumed over the next several years, the po rtfolio is projected to 
shift to an unrealized loss position in the second quarter of 2 018.  The portfolio is 
expected to record a peak unrealized loss of approximately $118  billion in 2019.  
About $28 billion of that peak unrea lized loss is attributable to losses on holdings of 
Treasury securities and $90 bill ion to losses on holdings of agency MBS.  The 
unrealized loss position contracts from 2020 through 2025, as t he value of Treasury 
and agency debt securities previo usly acquired under the large-scale asset purchase 
programs return to par as they a pproach maturity and new securi ties are added to the 
portfolio at prevailing market yields. 
Under the conundrum scenario, the portfolio is projected to shift to a position of 
unrealized loss about one year lat er than in the baseline scena rio, as the assumed six-
quarter period of unchanged longer-term interest rates leads to higher valuations for SOMA Treasury and MBS holdings.  The  mark-to-market value of th e portfolio 
decreases at a steeper pace than  in the baseline scenario in th e medium term, and 
records a peak unrealized loss of about $127 billion in 2022 be fore trending toward 
the baseline scenario by the end of 2025.  
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” the Feder al Reserve’s elevated holdings o f longer-term 
securities is estimated to be reducing the term premium embedded in the 10-year 
Treasury yield by 91 basis points in  the current quarter.  Over  the next couple of 
years, the estimated term premium effect diminishes at a pace o f about 4
 basis points 
per quarter, in large part reflecting the projected gradual shr inking of the portfolio. 
Under the conundrum scenario, the  term premium effect is roughl y 5 basis points less 
negative than under the baseline  scenario for the next couple o f years, reflecting 
marginally lower SOMA holdings of agency MBS. 
                                                 
9 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

 SOMA characteristics.  Regarding the size of the portf olio, under both the baseline 
and the conundrum scenarios, approximately $216 billion in SOMA  Treasury 
holdings have already matured or will mature this year, and a t otal of $1.5 trillion will 
mature between 2016 and 2020 (for the baseline scenario, see th e top panel of the 
exhibit “Projections for the Cha racteristics of SOMA Holdings”) .10  The amounts of 
Treasury securities maturing each month will vary considerably over time, while 
projected MBS paydowns are much l ess variable.  H owever, realiz ed MBS paydowns 
will reflect the evolution of interest rates and other factors and thus could be 
significantly more volatile than projected.11 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 6½ 
years (see the bottom panel of t he exhibit).  Under the two sce narios, the weighted-
average duration is projected  to decline through 2017, reflecting the aging of the 
portfolio, and subsequently to rise until mid- to late 2021, wh en the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized.12  After reaching its peak, durat ion is projected to resume 
its decline as the Desk conducts open market purchases of Treas ury securities to keep 
pace with the increase in currency.  The duration contour in th is latter portion of the 
projection is based on the key assu mption that the Federal Rese rve will buy only 
Treasury bills until those holdings are equal to approximately 30 percent of the 
Treasury portfolio, similar to the pre-crisis composition of th e portfolio (currently 
SOMA holds no Treasury bills).  Ther eafter, purchases of Treasu ry securities are 
assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum.13 
                                                 
10 While following its current reinvestment policy, the Desk repl aces maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
face value of holdings maturing on the issue date of newly issu ed securities.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are p laced as noncompetitive tenders and are treated by Treasury as add-ons to 
announced auction sizes. 
11 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $21 billion of maturing Treasury securities 
and is expected to purchase a to tal of $65 billion of 15- and 3 0-year agency MBS under the reinvestment 
program.  Additionally, on August 16 , the Desk conducted a smal l-value buyback operation on behalf of 
the U.S. Treasury to ensure oper ational readiness of its buybac k infrastructure.  
12 The duration of the SOMA Treas ury portfolio initially declines as Treasury securities in the 
portfolio approach maturity.  Once the pace of roll-offs accele rates, starting in 2018, and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o, the duration increases  until the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized. 
13 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments cea se.
