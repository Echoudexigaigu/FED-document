Monetary Policy Strategies 
This section considers a sele ction of monetary policy strategie s for setting the 
federal funds rate and compares the associated policy paths and  macroeconomic 
outcomes with those in the Tealbook baseline forecast.  The nea r-term prescriptions of 
the simple rules and optimal control exercises considered below  are similar to those in the 
September Tealbook because the upward revision to inflation and the downward revision 
to resource utiliza tion in the staff projection are small and o ffsetting.  However, over the 
medium term, the effect of low er resource utilization dominates  and all strategies call for 
a marginally more accomodative stance of policy.  As was the case in the September 
Tealbook, most of the simple rules and optimal control exercise s considered below 
prescribe a more rapid increase in the federal funds rate than assumed in the staff 
forecast.  A special exhibit examines the effects of inertia in  the policy response to 
unexpected shocks on the distribu tion of economic outcomes arou nd the baseline 
forecast. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhib it provides near-term prescript ions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first-differe nce rule.1  These prescriptions 
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output g ap and inflation in the near 
term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and middle panels al so include the staff’s 
baseline assumption for t he federal funds rate. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999 ) rules, which feature no interest-rate smoothing 
term, prescribe substantially hi gher federal funds rates in the  near term than the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and the  Tealbook baseline. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999 ) rules call for only slightl y higher policy rates 
than they did in the September Tealbook because, in the near te rm, the effect of a 
modest upward revision to infla tion is largely offset by the ef fect of a downward 
revision to output relative to potential. 
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of these  four simple rules.

   The prescriptions of the first-d ifference rule and of the inert ial Taylor (1999) rule are 
essentially unchanged from their  values in the September Tealbo ok and are close to 
the current Tealbook baseline values. 
A MEDIUM -TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estim ate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds  rate that is generated using  the FRB/US model, given 
the staff’s baseline projecti on.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/ US r* corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds r ate that, if maintained over a  12-quarter period, sets the 
output gap to zero in the fi nal quarter of that period. 
 At 84 basis points, FRB/US r* is well above the average l evel of the real federal 
funds rate in the staff forecast for the same 12-quarter period , at 4 basis points. 
 The fact that the real federal  funds rate in the baseline staff  forecast is, on average, 
below FRB/US r* reflects policy considerations  other than closing the output g ap that 
are embedded in the policy reaction function assumed by the sta ff, including the 
objective of increasing the infl ation rate over the medium term to the Committee’s 
2 percent objective. 
 The current estimate of FRB/US r* is 38 basis points lower than in the September 
Tealbook, reflecting the lower pa th of the output gap in the cu rrent projection. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULE SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports dynamic simulations of the FRB/US mo del under the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, the inertial versio n of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and the first-difference rule.2  These simulations reflect t he endogenous responses of the 
output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows th e paths implied by the 
different policy rules.3 
                                                 
2 Unless otherwise noted, the policy rules and optimal control s imulations assume that 
policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future a nd that financial market participants, price 
setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers wi ll follow through with their strategy but also 
fully understand the macroeconomic implications of that policy strategy.  Such policy strategies are 
described as commitment strategies. 
3 Because of these endogenous res ponses, the near-term prescript ions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the  first exhibit.

Simple Policy Rule Simulations
     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation
rates as predictors of the medium−term behavior of headline inflation.Nominal Federal Funds Rate

   The policy path in the staff forecast is constructed using a ve rsion of the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the intercept.  In the 
Tealbook baseline, the nom inal federal funds rate increases on average about 80 basis 
points per year through the f inal quarter of 2019, when it reac hes 3 percent.  The pace 
of tightening subsequently slows , and the federal funds rate pe aks at 3¼ percent in 
2021, before eventually returning to its longer-run normal leve l of 2¾ percent. 
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a constant intercept presc ribes a slightly higher 
path for the federal funds rate  over the next few years than th e version with a 
judgmental downward intercept adj ustment used to construct the Tealbook baseline.  
However, the difference in polic y rates arising from this alter native intercept 
assumption is small and dissipate s too rapidly to have marked e ffects on the real 
longer-term interest rates that  influence economic activity in FRB/US.  Consequently, 
macroeconomic outcomes under the inertial Taylor (1999) rule ar e similar to those in 
the Tealbook baseline. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate  sharp tightening in 
policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that l ie significantly above the 
Tealbook baseline path over the next few years largely because these two policy rules 
do not put weight on the lagged policy rate.  Despite these initially higher policy 
paths, the macroeconomic outcomes under these two rules are not  far from those 
under the Tealbook baseline because of the assumptions that the public immediately understands the macroeconomic e ffects of following the rules an d believes the 
policymakers’ commitment to sta bilize the economy in the future .  The Taylor (1999) 
rule calls for slightly higher pol icy rates than the Taylor (19 93) rule over the period 
shown because it responds more strongly to the projected rise in output above its potential level over the next several years.  As a consequence,  the Taylor (1999) rule 
generates a higher trajectory of  the unemployment rate and a slightly lower trajectory 
of inflation than does the Taylor (1993) rule. 
 The first-difference rule presc ribes a slightl y higher path for  the federal funds rate 
through the first quarter of  2019 than the Tealbook baseline.  Thereafter, the federal 
funds rate hovers around 2¾ percen t, whereas it rises above 3 p ercent under the 
Tealbook baseline.  This divergence occurs be cause the first-di fference rule, which 
responds to the expected change i n the output gap rather than t o its level, reacts to the 
slower pace of economic growth projected late in the decade and  beyond.  The lower

     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter h eadline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squaredchanges in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

  path of the federal funds rate after 2019, in conjunction with expectations of higher 
price and wage inflation in the f uture, implies lower longer-te rm real rates over the 
entire projection period, as well as higher levels of resource utilization and inflation.  
The first-difference rule generates outcomes for the unemployme nt rate that are 
markedly below the unemployment rate paths generated under the other policy rules 
and farther below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under va rious assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specificat ions of the loss function.4  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a c ommitment policy under 
which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy 
choices in a way that improves overall economic outcomes, given  the baseline outlook.5 
 The first simulation, labeled “e qual weights,” presents the cas e in which 
policymakers are assumed to plac e the same weights on keeping h eadline PCE 
inflation close to the Committ ee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping t he unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployment, and on changes in 
the federal funds rate.  Under th is strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is 
significantly higher than the T ealbook baseline policy path.  T his higher path arises 
because, in the current baseline projection, the unemployment r ate falls well below 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that is 
judged to be costly.  A tighter po licy results in a path of the unemployment rate that is 
substantially closer to the sta ff’s estimate of the natural rat e; headline PCE inflation is 
somewhat lower than in the Teal book baseline over the period sh own, consistent with 
a limited response of inflation i n the model to lower levels of  resource utilization. 
 The second simulation, label ed “asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviati ons of the unemployment rate from the natural rate 
when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, b ut that is identical to 
                                                 
4 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifica tions; the appendix provides technical 
details on the optimal control simulations. 
5 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, polic ymakers improve current economic 
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ acti ons; however, the simulations are not 
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

  the specification with equal wei ghts when the unemployment rate  is above the natural 
rate.  Under this strat egy, the path of the f ederal funds rate is considerably below both 
the Tealbook baseline path and the path for the case of equal w eights.  With the 
asymmetric loss function, policym akers choose this relatively a ccommodative path 
for the policy rate because the ir desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered 
by an aversion to the undershooti ng of the natural rate of unem ployment that helps 
achieve this outcome.  The tighter  labor market causes inflatio n to reach 2 percent 
more quickly than in the case of  equal weights; inflation then edges above the 
Committee’s longer-run object ive for the next decade.6 
 The third simulation, labeled “large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function 
that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent t hat is five times larger 
than the “equal weights” speci fication, but is otherwise identi cal.  The resulting 
optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in th e “equal weights” 
case, even though the losses asso ciated with undershooting the inflation objective in 
coming years are larger.  The reas on is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face 
an unappealing tradeoff because inf lation responds little to re source utilization.  
Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial unders hooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment, w hich this specification of the l oss function sees as 
costly, in order to raise infla tion in the near term by a modest amount. 
 The fourth simulation, labeled “ minimal weight on rate adjustme nts,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very sma ll cost to changes in the feder al funds rate but is 
otherwise identical t o the loss function with equal weights.  I n the resulting optimal 
strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the sp ecification with equal 
weights over the next few years in an effort to contain the pro jected undershooting of 
the natural rate of unemployment .  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the 
real 10-year Treasury y ield are also higher for a couple of years than in the case of 
                                                 
6 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation obje ctive and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term is time incon sistent, in the sense that, given the 
opportunity to reoptimize the path  of the federal funds rate wi thout regard to past policy commitments, 
policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter mon etary policy.  Under the assumption of 
optimal control under discretion with “asymmetric weight on ugap ” preferences, policy rates and 
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook bas eline and optimal  control under 
commitment.  For the other thre e specifications of the loss fun ction, the simulation results under 
commitment and discre tion are similar.

  equal weights.  While this policy leaves the trajectory for inf lation almost unaffected, 
it keeps the unemployment rate c lose to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate. 
POLICY INERTIA AND UNEXPECTED SHOCKS TO THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  
The dynamic simulations discussed above display outcomes under the assumption 
that the economy going forward will not be affected by economic  disturbances other than 
those already embedded in the  Tealbook baseline.  However, there is considerable 
uncertainty attending the staff projection and a non-negligible probability that the policy 
response to unforeseen shocks will be constrained by the effect ive lower bound.  In the 
next exhibit, we summarize the re sults of stochastic simulation s we conducted to examine 
how the speed at which policymakers respond to unforeseen shock s affects the 
distribution of economic outcomes around the baseline forecast.   In the first set of 
simulations (labeled “without inertia”), we assume that policym akers respond to the 
macroeconomic effects of incomi ng shocks as dictated by the Tay lor (1999) rule; for 
example, policymakers immediately adjust the federal funds rate  one-for-one to 
innovations in the output gap.  In t he second set (labeled “with inertia”), we assume that 
policymakers initially respond onl y partially to innovations in  resource slack and 
inflation, in the manner prescrib ed by the inertial Taylor rule .7  Under both policy 
responses, the path of the feder al funds rate in the absence of unforeseen shocks 
coincides with the Tealbook baseline path; however, the two rul es respond differently to 
economic shocks that push the ec onomy away from that baseline p ath and hence generate 
different outcomes in those circumstances. 
The upper-left panel shows the m ean paths of the federal funds rate with and 
without policy inertia as well as 70-percent uncertainty bands around these paths.  The simulations without policy inertia  generate a wi der distributio n of policy rate paths (the 
red shaded area) over the next sev eral years than the simulatio ns with policy inertia (the 
area between the dotted blue lines).  As a consequence, there i s a greater chance that the 
federal funds rate will be at it s effective lower bound at some  time over the next couple 
of years under the non-inertial response.  For example, as show n by the red and blue bars 
in the upper-right panel, the probability of the federal funds rate being at its effective 
                                                 
7 These stochastic simulations use  a linearized version of the F RB/US model with model-
consistent expectations and take into account an effective lowe r bound on the federal funds rate, which is 
assumed to be 12.5 basis points.  The shocks used in the simula tions are drawn from historical values of 
model disturbances estimated between 1969:Q1 and 2014:Q4.  The simulations begin in 2016:Q4.

  lower bound in 2017:Q4 under the non- inertial response is almost 30 percent, compared 
with a small probability under the inertial counterpart.8,9  Relatively frequent episodes in 
which the effective lower bound pr events policy rates from fall ing explain why the mean 
federal funds rate is a touch hi gher in the simulations without  policy inertia than in the 
simulations with policy inertia. 
The middle-left and lower-left  panels display the mean and disp ersion of 
outcomes across stochastic simul ations for the unemployment rat e and core PCE 
inflation, respectively.  Overall,  the distributions of macroec onomic outcomes under both 
policies are similar throughout the simulation period, with the  unemployment rate under 
no policy inertia being only a little less dispersed beyond the next two years than under 
policy inertia.  The reason for  this similarity is that both po licies have similar effects on 
the real long-term rates (not s hown) that influence economic activity in the model, with 
the non-inertial policy response fr ontloading the adjustment in  the real short-term rate 
required to move real long-term rates relative to the inertial response.  Although the 
non-inertial policy response i s constrained by the lower bound more often than the 
inertial policy response as a res ult of unforeseen shocks, the episodes in which the 
effective lower bound is binding a re typically short-lived and do not markedly affect the 
distribution of macroeconomic outcomes. 
The middle-right and lower-right panels show density distributi ons for the 
unemployment rate and core PCE  inflation in 2017:Q4.  These pan els highlight that, even 
though the simulations with policy i nertia give rise to a distribution of the federal funds 
rate that is much less dispersed than under no po licy inertia, the non-inertial and inertial 
policy simulations are associa ted with similar distributions of  macroeconomic outcomes. 
                                                 
8 The fact that, in our simulati ons with inertia, policy is rare ly constrained in the near term by the 
effective lower bound  reflects the slow p ace at which policymak ers lower the federal funds rate in response 
to adverse shocks.  If policymakers were to employ a policy rule that reduced the federal funds rate 
disproportionately strongly and rapidly to shocks that they per ceived as likely to trigger a recession—as 
seems to have been the case with  FOMC decisions over the postwa r period—then the probability of 
returning to the effective lower bound would be larger. 
9 The median probability of moving to the effective lower bound at some point over the 2016–
2019 period among responses to the November Survey of Primary D ealers is 25 percent,  compared with a 
probability of moving to the effective lower bound in the same time frame of around 10 percent for the 
policy strategy with inertia and  around 50 percent for the poli cy strategy without inertia in the model 
simulations described herein.

  The simulation results presented above may be sensitive to a nu mber of 
maintained assumptions.  For exa mple, the finding of similar macroeconomic outcomes 
with and without policy inertia de pends importantly on expectations formation and, in 
particular, on the public’s understanding of how monetary polic y will respond to 
unforeseen economic developments.  I f market participants were more surprised by large 
adjustments of short-term rates than assumed in the simulations , then policy responses 
without inertia could prove disr uptive to financial markets and  economic activity.  
Alternatively, if inertial polic y were viewed as insufficiently  responsive to economic 
developments, then the policy responses with inertia may be les s stabilizing than shown.  
Moreover, the incidence of periods in which policy is constrained by the effective lower 
bound depends on assumptions about the distribution of economic shocks.  If adverse shocks prove more likely than a ssumed, then the incidence and s everity of effective lower 
bound episodes could be accentuated. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations described earlier.

  Appendix 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Te albook B typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simp le policy rules, policymakers  set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number o f macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over m acroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unles s otherwise noted, the 
simulations assume that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future and that 
financial market participants, p rice setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers 
will follow through with their strategy but also fully understa nd the macroeconomic implications.  
Such policy strategies are describ ed as commitment strategies. 
The two approaches have differe nt merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and be cause they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure  of the economy.  However, simpl e rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict ad herence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal contro l policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And although this section focuses on policies under commitment, opt imal control policies can more 
generally be derived under vari ous assumptions about the degree  to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal contro l policies assume substantial  knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to  the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular 
model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approac hes, they are probably 
best considered together, possibl y along with others, as a means to assess the various tradeoffs 
policymakers may face when pursu ing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for the four simple polic y rules reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, and the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period ( ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap 
(4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ l onger-run inflation objective, denoted πLR, is 2 percent.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (199 3, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently  in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules, denoted ݎ௅ோ, are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 
2 percent longer-run inflation objective and a longer-run real federal funds rate of ¾ percent, a 
value used in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rat e; see Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculat ed taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When th e Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are s hown for the current and next q uarters.  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the  prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter sho wn, and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of th ese inertial rules, the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook proj ection” report prescriptions con ditional on the previous Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap but using the valu e of the lagged federal funds rate in 
the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit titled “Policy Rules and the St aff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds ra te, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-qu arter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quart er of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric mod el of the U.S. economy.  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of which 
take the form of projected val ues of the model’s exogenous vari ables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted s o that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  A model simulation then determines  the value of the real federal 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012). 
2 All nominal and real f ederal funds rates reported in the Monet ary Policy Strategies section are 
expressed on the same 360-day basis as the published federal fu nds rate.  Consistent with the methodology 
in the FRB/US model, the simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-day basis and 
then converted to a 360-day basis. Taylor (1993) rule ܴ௧ൌݎ௅ோ൅ߨ௧൅0.5ሺߨ௧െߨ௅ோሻ൅0.5݌ܽ݃ݕ ௧

  funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogen ous variables in the extended 
baseline forecast. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the  panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter 
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r *.  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic outcomes even when their values are 
identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal f unds rate is held constant over  
the entire 12-quarter period to c lose the output gap at the end  of this timeframe whereas, in the 
Tealbook baseline, the real federal funds rate can vary over ti me.  Distinct paths of real short-term 
rates can, in turn, generate different paths for inflation and economic activity. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhi bits “Simple Policy Rule Simul ations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in forc e over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond t he time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are  conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters have perfect foresight, and are predicat ed on the staff’s extended Tealbook 
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Com mittee’s large-scale asset 
purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a q uarter, all of the simulations 
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin 
in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimiz e a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference betwe en four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation, ߨ௧௉஼ா, and the Committee’s 2 percen t objective), squared unemploymen t gaps (݌ܽ݃ݑ௧, 
measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and th e staff’s estimate of the natural 
rate), and squared changes in t he federal funds rate.  The resu lting loss function, shown below, 
embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future usi ng a quarterly discount factor

The exhibit “Optimal Control Si mulations under Commitment” cons iders four 
specifications of the weights on the inflation gap, the unemployment gap, and the rate change 
components of the loss function.  The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the 
Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
Strategies
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

  The first specification, titled “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three 
components at all times.  The second specification, titled “Asy mmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the 
same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the un employment rate is above the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling 
below the natural rate.  The third specification, titled “Large  weight on inflation gap,” attaches a 
relatively large weight to inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, titled “Minimal weight on rate 
adjustments,” places almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.3  The table below 
shows the weights used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) valu es of the weights. 
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates,  under the assumption of perfect 
foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the T ealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that decision makers in the 
model see this path as being a binding commitment on future Com mittee decisions; the optimal 
control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the f ederal funds rate but is otherwise 
unconstrained by policy decisions  made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are 
calculated over a period that ends sufficiently far in the futu re that extending that period farther 
would not affect the policy pr escriptions shown in the exhibits .

Monetary Policy Alternatives 
At its September meeting, the Com mittee judged that the case fo r an increase in 
the federal funds rate had str engthened, but decided, “for the time being,” to wait for 
further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.  Since then, incoming data 
have supported the view that inflation will rise to 2 percent o ver the medium term.  In 
addition, the employment report fo r September indicated that th e labor market continued 
to improve:  Payroll gains remained solid, and the employment-t o-population ratio edged 
up.  However, the unemployment ra te has changed little over the  past 12 months. 
A key question for the Committee is  whether the evidence accumulated since the 
September FOMC meeting is suffici ent to merit an increase in th e target range for the 
federal funds rate.  If policymakers decide at this meeting to maintain the current target 
range, a second key question is what guidance to provide about the conditions that would 
warrant an increase at a futur e meeting.  The three policy stat ements discussed below 
provide different characterizati ons of realized and expected progress toward the 
Committee’s objectives and arrive at different conclusions rega rding the appropriate 
setting for the federal funds rate and the desired policy stance going forward. 
 The alternatives offer different  characterizations of incoming inflation data. 
o Alternative B says tha t “inflation has incre ased somewhat since  earlier this 
year,” but acknowledges that it is still “below the Committee’s 2 percent 
longer-run objective, pa rtly reflecting earlier declines in ene rgy prices and in 
prices of non-energy imports.” 
o Alternative C upgrades the Comm ittee’s inflation assessment further, omitting 
the “somewhat” qualifier from the  “inflation has increased” phrase.1 
o Alternative A makes no referen ce to an increase in inflation.  Moreover, 
Alternative A characterizes the  shortfall of inflation from 2 p ercent as “only 
partly” the result of earlier ene rgy and import price declines,  suggesting that 
inflation is being held back by other factors that have more persistent effects. 
                                                            
1 Paragraph 1 of Alte rnative C makes no m ention of “earlier decl ines in energy prices and in prices 
of non-energy imports.”  Some policymakers might view dropping this language as premature at the 
November meeting, but nonetheless expect to delete it at a late r meeting, when presumably those declines 
will not be as important a factor in the 12-month inflation rat e as they are today.

  o All three alternatives continue t o state that market-based meas ures of inflation 
compensation have remained low, bu t Alternatives B and C offer the option of 
also noting that they have “moved up.” 
 The alternatives also provide di fferent assessments of the pace at which the labor 
market is strengthening.  The assessments may express differenc es in the weights that 
policymakers apply to various ind icators, including the unemplo yment rate and job 
gains.  The assessments might a lso reflect differing interpreta tions of the data; for 
example, the increase in labor force participation might be see n as a sign of 
diminishing slack, a positive sh ift in labor supply, or a mix of both. 
o Alternative B slightly upgrades  the assessment of the labor mar ket provided in 
September, which noted that “j ob gains have been solid, on average.”  The 
deletion of “on average” is meant to convey that, since the disappointing 
employment report for May, job ga ins have consistently been solid. 
o The assessment of the labor market in Alternative C has an even  more upbeat 
tone: Solid job gains, “along wit h other indicators, suggest th at labor 
utilization has increased.” 
o In contrast, Alternative A states that “the unemployment rate a nd other 
indicators of labor utilizati on have changed little, on balance .” 
 All three alternatives characterize growth in economic activity  as “moderate,” but 
they offer somewhat different a ssessments of household and busi ness spending.2 
o Alternatives B and C note that  household spending has been “ris ing 
moderately,” a downgrade from the assessment provided in Septem ber 
(“growing strongly”); Alternativ e A states that growth in house hold spending 
“has slowed.”  
o Alternatives B and C acknowledge a pickup in business fixed inv estment—
though Alternative B offers t he option of qualifying the pickup  as modest—
while Alternative A retains the assessment in the September statement that 
business fixed investment “has remained soft.”  
 Relative to the September sta tement, Alternatives B and C upgra de the outlook for 
inflation, while Alterna tive A downgrades it.

  o Alternatives B and C no longer say that the Committee expects i nflation “to 
remain low in the near term.”  B oth now simply say that the Com mittee 
expects inflation “to rise to 2 pe rcent over the medium term.” 
o In addition to retaining the asse ssment that inflation is expec ted to remain low 
in the near term, Alternative A  notes that inflation is expecte d to rise 
“gradually” to 2 percent over the medium term. 
 The alternatives offer different c haracterizations of risks to the economic outlook. 
o Alternative B conveys an assessmen t that near-term risks are “r oughly 
balanced,” as in the September statement. 
o Alternative C says that near-term risks are “balanced,” deletin g the qualifier 
“roughly.”  In addition, Alternativ e C omits the sentence “the Committee 
continues to closely monitor in flation indicators and global ec onomic and 
financial developments,” consistent with the judgment that risk s are 
“balanced.” Instead, Alternati ve C acknowledges, in paragraph 4 , that the 
Committee will assess “risks to the economic outlook” when dete rmining the 
timing and size of future adjustme nts to the target range for t he federal funds 
rate. 
o Alternative A retains the “closely monitor” language and omits any 
characterization of risks. 
 Turning to the policy decision, Alt ernative B maintains the current target range, but 
signals that the economy is closer than before to conditions th at would warrant an 
increase.  Alternative C sees those conditions as already in pl ace and raises the target 
range.  In contrast, Alternative A maintains the current target  range and signals that 
the Committee sees a rate hike a s unlikely to be appropriate in  the near term. 
o Although Alternative B maintains the current ¼ to ½ percent target range for 
the federal funds rate,  it states tha t the case for an increase  in the funds rate 
“has continued to strengthen” (in stead of “has strengthened”) and notes that 
the Committee is waiting for “some” further evidence of continu ed progress 
toward its objectives.  The additi on of “some” is meant to sign al that the 
Committee is close to having the  evidence that it needs. 
o Alternative C increases the targe t range for the federal funds rate to ½ to 
¾ percent but continues to signa l, as does Altern ative B, that “the Committee 
Alternatives

  expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant 
only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.” 
o Alternative A indicates that , partly in light of subdued pressures in the labor 
market, an increase in the targe t range for the federal funds r ate will not be 
appropriate until “evidence emerges that inflation is moving cl oser to 
2 percent on a sustained basis.”  Coupled with the assessments in Alternative 
A that current below-target inf lation “only” part ly reflects ea rlier energy and 
import price declines and that inflation will rise “gradually” to 2 percent over 
the medium term, this signals t hat the Committee sees a rate hi ke as unlikely 
to be appropriate in the near term.

  SEPTEMBER 2016  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in July indicates 
that the labor market has conti nued to strengthen and growth of  economic activity has 
picked up from the modest pace see n in the first half of this y ear.  Although the 
unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid, on 
average.  Household spending has  been growing strongly but business fixed 
investment has remained soft.  I nflation has cont inued to run below the Committee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier decli nes in energy prices and 
in prices of non-energy imports.  Mar ket-based measures of inflation compensation 
remain low; most survey-based m easures of longer-term inflation  expectations are 
little changed, on balance , in recent months. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market co nditions will strengthen somew hat further.  
Inflation is expected to remai n low in the near term, in part b ecause of earlier declines 
in energy prices, but to rise to 2 pe rcent over the medium term  as the transitory 
effects of past declines in ener gy and import prices dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly 
balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation  indicators and global 
economic and financial developments. 
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ per cent.  The Comm ittee judges that the case for an 
increase in the federal funds r ate has strengthened but decided , for the time being, to 
wait for further evidence of c ontinued progress toward its obje ctives.  The stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a r eturn to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run.  H owever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data. 
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at

financial conditions.

1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in July 
September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of 
economic activity has p icked up from the modest pace seen in th e first half of this 
year has been expanding at a moderate pace .  Although the unem ployment rate is 
little changed in recent months , Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent 
months, but the unemployment rate and other indicators of labor  utilization 
have changed little, on balance.  Growth of household spending has been growing 
strongly but slowed and  business fixed investment has remained soft.  Inflation has 
continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, only partly 
reflecting earlier declines in e nergy prices and in prices of n on-energy imports.  
Market-based measures of infla tion compensation remain low; mos t survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little chang ed, on balance, in 
recent months.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of appropr iate monetary policy, economic activity will 
expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will stre ngthen som ewhat 
further.  Inflation is expected t o remain low in the near term,  in part because of earlier 
declines in energy prices, but to rise gradually  to 2 percent over the medium term as 
the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import pr ices dissipate and the 
labor market strengthens further.  Near-term  risks to the econo mic outlook appear

and global economic and financial developments.  
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  In light of subdued pressures in the labor 
market and still-low levels of inflation,  the Committee judges that the case for an 
increase in the federal funds r ate has strengthened but decided , for the time being, to 
wait for further evidence of c ontinued progress toward its obje ctives will not be 
warranted until evidence emerges that inflation is moving close r to 2 percent on 
a sustained basis.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby  
supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a  return to 2 percent 
inflation.  
4. In determining the tim ing and size of future when  adjustments to the target range for 
the federal funds rate might become appropriate , the Committee will assess realized 
and expected economic conditions r elative to its objectives of maximum employment 
and 2 percent inflation , along with risks to t he economic outlook .  This assessment 
will take into account a wide range of information, including m easures of labor 
market conditions, indicators of  inflation pressures and inflat ion expectations, and 
readings on financial and inter national developments.  In light  of the current shortfall 
of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
progress toward its inflation goal .  The Committee expects that  economic conditions

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may view the information received over the interme eting period as 
providing some additional evidence of continued progress toward  the Committee’s 
objectives, although not enough eviden ce to warrant an increase in the federal funds rate 
at the November meeting.  Policymakers may judge—and wish to si gnal—that the 
economy is close to conditions that would warrant an increase. 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Data received over the intermee ting period suggest that inflati on has increased 
somewhat relative to its pace ea rlier this year.  However, the evidence of a firming in 
inflation likely will still be limited at the November meeting.  
o The 12-month change in overall P CE prices has been running at r oughly 
1 percent over the first eight m onths of this year.  However, t he staff estimates 
that the PCE price index for Sept ember (to be rele ased the day before the 
November FOMC meeting) will show  that 12-month headline inflati on 
increased to 1¼ percent. 
o In addition, oil prices rose over the intermeeting period, and consumer energy 
prices are therefore likely t o provide a boost to headline infl ation in the fourth 
quarter. 
o Twelve-month core PCE infla tion in August was 1.7 percent, abou t 10 basis 
points higher than the year-ove r-year pace during the first hal f of the year.  
The staff projects that 12-month core PCE inflation will remain  about 
1.7 percent over the near term. 
 The employment report for Septem ber indicated that labor market  conditions 
continued to strengthen.  Job ga ins remained solid, and both th e employment-to-
population ratio and the labor for ce participation rate moved u p, with the latter 
contributing to a slight uptick in the unemployment rate.  Thes e developments were 
consistent with recent labor market trends:  
o The employment-to-population ra tio and the labor force particip ation rate 
have increased notably since  one year ago—notwithstanding downw ard 
structural trends—suggesting that the labor market has continue d to 
strengthen.  These developments  may also suggest that the cycli cal shortfalls 
of these variables from their trends were larger than previously estimated.  
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
October 27, 2016

  o The unemployment rate is little  changed over the past 12 months.  A broader 
measure of unemployment that inc ludes marginally attached worke rs and 
workers employed part time for economic reasons has decreased o nly slightly, 
on net, since last year an d was unchanged in September.  
 Measures of inflation compensation moved up moderately over the  intermeeting 
period, but remain low.  In additi on, the Michigan survey measu re of longer-run 
inflation expectations remains  at the low end of its historical  range.3 
 Recent weaker-than-expected readings on consumer spending have led the staff to 
revise down slightly its forecast of 2016:H2 GDP growth, to 2¼ percent.  However, 
gains in household income and emp loyment have continued to be s olid and indicators 
of consumer sentiment have rem ained upbeat, supporting expectat ions of continued 
moderate consumption growth over the second half of this year.  In addition, business 
fixed investment, which declined no tably in the first half of t he year, shows signs of 
picking up in Q3.  With the drill ing rig count increasing recen tly and new orders for 
nondefense capital goods running ab ove shipments, the Board staff forecasts business 
investment will rise moderately in Q4.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers might wish to signal that the case for an increase  in the federal funds 
rate has strengthened further , and that only some additional ev idence of continued 
progress toward maximum employm ent and 2 percent inflation is n eeded to make an 
increase appropriate. 
o For many indicators, policymakers now have only one additional reading in 
hand beyond the data that were available when the Committee met  in 
September.  Over the next int ermeeting period, the Committee wi ll receive 
two employment reports, a range of  additional price data that could 
corroborate its outlook for infla tion, and a number of spending  indicators.  
Thus, policymakers may see leav ing the policy rate unchanged at  this meeting 
as consistent with the approach l aid out in the September FOMC statement. 
o Policymakers might anticipate th at a rate hike is likely to be appropriate soon, 
but may also wish to avoid giving calendar-based guidance.  Policymakers 
may see a statement like Alterna tive B as preserving flexibility going forward

  by keeping the focus on the Committ ee’s assessment of incoming data and the 
outlook.  Staying away from calendar-based guidance would also avoid 
reinforcing a perception on the pa rt of some market participant s that the 
Committee will give explicit adva nce notice one meeting before any rate hike. 
 Federal funds futures quotes imp ly that market participants see  about a 70 percent 
probability that the federal funds rate will be raised this yea r, but only about a 
10 percent probability of a rate hike at this meeting.  Thus, a  statement like 
Alternative B would be roughly in line with the expectations of  financial market 
participants, although the langua ge on inflation in paragraphs 1 and 2 might surprise 
some. 
o On average, respondents to the Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Dealers and 
Survey of Market Participants  perceive a 60 percent probability  of an increase 
this year in the federal funds r ate, but only a negligible like lihood of a rate 
hike at this meeting.  
o Several respondents to the Desk surveys expected that the Commi ttee would 
note that inflation compensa tion has moved up but remained low.   However, 
few respondents anticipated that the Committee would upgrade it s description 
of current or expected inflati on.  Thus, some investors might s ee the changes 
in language regarding inflati on in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Altern ative B as 
reflecting more confidence on the  part of the Committee in a pickup of 
inflation than they had anticipat ed.  If so, these investors ma y read the 
statement as suggesting a grea ter likelihood of a rate hike in December than 
they currently anticipate. 
o Respondents to the Desk surveys  provided a wide range of views about 
changes to paragraph 3, with som e respondents expecting changes  broadly in 
line with those in Alternative B.  Other respondents expected t hat the 
statement would include calenda r-based guidance about the next rate hike, 
such as an indication that a decision will be made “at its next  meeting” (as in 
the October 2015 statement).  S till others expected no changes.   Thus, it is not 
clear what effect the change s to paragraph 3 might have on investors’ 
assessments of the probability of a rate increase in December.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may judge that the evidence accumulated since the September meeting is 
sufficient to warrant an increase in the target range for the f ederal funds rate at their 
November meeting.  In particular, policymakers might point to continued solid job gains, 
an uptick in the labor force par ticipation rate, and further ev idence suggesting that 
inflation is on track to reach t he Committee’s 2 percent object ive soon.4 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The Board staff expects that 12-month overall PCE inflation wil l be 1¼ percent in 
September and will step up further in subsequent months, reachi ng 2 percent in 
March 2017. 
o Oil prices increased over the intermeeting period and Board staff estimates 
that core import prices rose at an annual ra te of 1¾ percent in  the third 
quarter, the largest increase in over two years.  Policymakers may anticipate 
that 12-month headline inflati on will run above core inflation relatively soon, 
and they may see the effects of  earlier declines in energy and import prices as 
having largely r un their course. 
o Twelve-month core PCE infla tion in August was 1.7 percent, near  the 
Committee’s longer-run objective. 
 Job gains have been consistently solid from June through Septem ber.  In addition, the 
employment-to-population ratio and the labor force participatio n rate ticked up in 
September and have increase d notably over the past year. 
o Policymakers may see the half-per centage-point increases over the past year 
in the employment-to-populati on ratio and labor force participa tion rate—
which have downward structural tr ends—as supporting a view that  labor 
utilization has conti nued to increase. 
o Though the unemployment rate ticked up slightly in September, t hat move 
importantly reflected an increase in the participation rate.  M oreover, the 
unemployment rate remains only slightly above most participants ’ estimates 
of its longer-run level (as publis hed in the September SEP). 
                                                            
4 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in Altern ative C as premature in present 
circumstances but might nonetheless discuss whether this langua ge would be appropriate when the time 
arrives for another increase in the target range for the federa l funds rate.

  o A variety of measures of labor m arket tightness have been running near or 
above pre-crisis levels, such a s the job openings rate and the quits rate (the 
share of employees volunt arily leaving their jobs). 
 The Board staff’s estimate of five-year inflation compensation increased 
¼ percentage point over the inte rmeeting period, bringing the t otal increase since its 
low in June (after the Brexit referendum) to ½ percentage point .  In addition, the 
staff’s estim ate of five-year, f ive-year-forward inflation comp ensation moved up over 
the in termeeting period, reaching ¼ percentage point above its post-referendum low. 
o A straight read of quotes from th e market for inflation caps su ggests that, over 
the intermeeting period, market participants marked up their assessment of the 
probability that headline CPI inflation over the next five year s will run well 
above 2 percent. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that cu rrent conditions and the outlook warrant an increase 
in the target range for the fed eral funds rate of 25 basis points at this meeting. They 
may also judge, and wish to reaffirm, that further gradual increases are likely if 
incoming data are about as expected. 
o Policymakers may favor removing some accommodation at this meet ing, in 
part to reduce the risk that pol icy may need to be tightened ra pidly in the 
future, possibly cutting short the expansion.  Policymakers may  be concerned 
that further delaying the rem oval of policy accommodation could  lead to 
substantial undershooting of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, and they may be skeptical that such undershooting can be unwound sm oothly. 
o Policymakers might also be worried  that maintaining the federal  funds rate at 
its current low level will lea d to excessive r isk-taking in fin ancial markets that 
could eventually endanger financial stability. 
o Policymakers might emphasize that several measures of wage grow th have 
increased in recent years, even as productivity growth has rema ined low.  
They might anticipate that, if la bor market tightening leads to  additional 
acceleration of wages without a pickup in productivity growth, inflation 
would rise, requiring a higher policy rate—as envisioned in the “Higher Labor 
Costs” scenario descri bed in the “Risks and Uncertainty” sectio n of 
Tealbook A.

  o Policymakers may judge that, eve n after a 25 basis point increase, the stance 
of monetary policy would remain accommodative.  Even with a rat e hike at 
their November meeting, the real federal funds rate would still  lie below the 
prescriptions from a wide range  of policy frameworks—including most simple 
policy rules and optimal control ex ercises shown in the “Moneta ry Policy 
Strategies” section of Tealbook B. 
o Some policymakers may also judg e that the Committee should give  significant 
weight to the prescr iptions of simple polic y rules, which they may view as 
helpful for enhancing public  understanding and robust to variou s types of 
uncertainty.  Policymakers might note that the simple rules rep orted in 
Tealbook B call for an increase i n the federal funds rate even when taking into 
account a substantial decline (rela tive to the pre-crisis perio d) in the 
longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate. 
 On average, respondents to the D esk’s latest surveys perceive t here to be a 60 percent 
probability that the Committee will increase the target range t his year, slightly below 
the probability implied by quotes on federal funds futures.  However, the Desk 
surveys and federal funds futures  imply that the perceived likelihood of a rate hike at 
this meeting is very low, suggesti ng that a statement like Alte rnative C would surprise 
the market considerably. 
o If market participants infer t hat the Committee intends to purs ue a less 
accommodative stance of policy going forward than they had expe cted, for 
any given outlook, then it is lik ely that medium- and longer-te rm real interest 
rates will rise, that equity pri ces and inflation compensation will decline, and 
that the dollar will appreciate.  
o However, if investors see a statement like Alternative C as pri marily reflecting 
an upbeat assessment of the str ength of the U.S. expansion—toge ther with a 
view that only gradual increases in the federal funds rate will  likely be 
necessary—then equity prices and i nflation compensation might f all less than 
otherwise, or even rise.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers might view informa tion received since the Septembe r FOMC as continuing 
to indicate that labor market sl ack is diminishing very slowly,  if at all.  Policymakers 
might see risk management consid erations as reinforcing the cas e against removing

  accommodation.  Thus, with inflation still low, they may judge it appropriate for the 
Committee to signal that a hike i n the federal funds rate will not be appropriate until 
incoming data indicate that i nflation is moving toward 2 percen t on a sustained basis. 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Recent readings on consumer spe nding suggest that output may grow more slowly in 
the near term than policymakers may have been expecting.  Residential investment 
has continued to shrink, and busin ess investment is increasing only modestly after 
notable declines earlier this year. 
 A number of indicators have c ontinued to suggest that improveme nt in the labor 
market has flattened out this year, including the unemployment rate, the share of 
employees working part time for economic reasons, and measures of the duration of 
unemployment. 
 Survey measures of longer-run in flation expectations and readin gs on longer-term 
inflation compensation are very low by their historical standar ds.  Policymakers may 
be concerned that if forecasts  of a pickup in inflation prove t oo optimistic, longer-run 
inflation expectations could decrease. 
 Policymakers may assess the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the 
downside—especially over the me dium term—in part because advers e developments 
abroad could lead to tightening g lobal financial conditions and  decreased demand for 
U.S. exports. 
o The Brexit process could lead t o financial stress in Europe and  beyond if 
negotiations are especially cont entious.  Indeed, the marked de preciation of 
the British pound over the interm eeting period points to the po tential for 
abrupt changes in financial cond itions as the Brexit process continues.  
Financial stress could also ris e if other EU breakaway movement s emerge.  
Policy Strategy  
 Policymakers might assess that labor market conditions are strengthening only slowly and that significant r oom remains for labor market improvement.   Policymakers 
might also judge that inflation dynamics in recent decades demo nstrate that the 
Phillips curve is fairly flat, implying that greater resource u tilization will have only a 
muted effect on inflation.  Taken t ogether, these observations may lead policymakers 
to conclude that further strengthening in the labor market is c alled for to return 
inflation to 2 percent.  Thus, po licymakers might want to commu nicate that an 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

  increase in the federal funds  rate will not be warranted until there is evidence that 
inflation is moving back to 2 per cent on a sustained basis. 
o Policymakers might judge that the  neutral rate of interest is l ow, relative to its 
longer-run level, due to restrain t on U.S. economic activity from economic 
and financial developments abr oad, meager productivity growth, or borrowing 
conditions that remain tight for some households.  They may see such 
headwinds as unlikely to subside in the near term.  
o Policymakers might see risk management considerations related t o the 
effective lower bound on nominal inte rest rates as especially r elevant after the 
recent additional markdowns by man y FOMC participants of their estimates 
of the longer-run equilibri um federal funds rate.  
o Moreover, policymakers may see benefits — not just risks — asso ciated with 
some undershooting of unemployment.  For example, a tight labor  market 
might have persistent positive effects on the productive capaci ty of the 
economy, as explored in the “Posi tive Hysteresis” scenario desc ribed in the 
“Risks and Uncertainty ” section of Tealbook A. 
o Policymakers may judge that a hike will not be warranted without evidence that inflation is moving closer to 2 percent on a sustained bas is, but may also 
view it as appropriate to consid er a broad range of indicators— possibly 
including measures of labor market conditions, inflation expect ations, and 
economic activity—in assessing whether that evidence is in plac e. 
 Although federal funds futures quote s suggest that market participants see only a very 
small probability of a rate hike  at this meeting, they imply ab out a 70 percent 
probability of a rate increase this year.  A postmeeting statem ent like Alternative A, 
which suggests that a near-ter m increase is unlikely, would the refore be very 
surprising to financial market participants. 
o Investors would likely push furth er into the future the expecte d date of the 
next rate increase, and the expected path for the federal funds rate would likely flatten further, putting a dditional downward pressure on  longer-term 
yields.  
o If the statement is primarily seen as more accommodative, equit y prices and 
inflation compensation would lik ely rise, and the dollar would depreciate.

concerns about the downside risk s to the outlook, equity prices and inflation 
compensation could fall.

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet, and of 
key elements of the associated income statement, under three sc enarios for the paths of 
monetary policy and longer-term interest rates.1 
 The “October Tealbook baseline” sc enario is consistent with the  monetary policy 
assumptions incorporated in the s taff’s baseline forecast prese nted in Tealbook A.  In 
this scenario, the federal funds  rate is projected to rise to a little more than 3¼ percent 
at the end of 2021, before moving down to just under 3 percent by the end of the 
projection, with a corresponding e volution in longer-term inter est rates. 
 Under the “Higher Labor Costs” scenario presented in the Risks and Uncertainty 
section of Tealbook A, labor costs i ncrease faster than in the baseline and inflation 
rises above 2½ percent.  As a result, the federal funds rate ri ses more steeply than in 
the baseline, reaching about 3¾ percent at the end of 2021, bef ore decreasing to about 
3 ¼ percent by the end of th e projection period. 
 The “Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate” scenario pr esented in the 
Risks and Uncertainty section of  Tealbook A incorporates a long -run equilibrium real 
federal funds rate of zero, cons istent with persistently weaker  underlying growth of 
domestic aggregate demand over the next decade relative to the Tealbook baseline.  
Because policymakers are assu med to recognize this situation on ly gradually and 
because the policy rule is inertia l, the federal funds rate fai ls to fall sufficiently to 
fully offset the weakness in aggr egate demand in the near term.  Over the longer run, 
monetary policy fully accommodates the low equilibrium real rat e, with the federal 
funds rate decreasing to 2 percen t by the end of the projection  period. 
                                                 
1 In all the scenarios, the respo nse of the federal funds rate t o deviations of the endogenous 
variables from their baseline va lues is determined by the inert ial Taylor (1999) policy rule.

Despite the differences in the evolution of interest rates acro ss these scenarios, the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and associated income statements are only modestly 
different.2 
The key policy assumptions associated with these scenarios are highlighted below. 
 Reinvestment policy:   We continue to assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of maturing Treas ury securities and agency debt a s well as principal 
received on agency MBS when the target range for the federal fu nds rate reaches 
1¼ to 1½ percent.  As a result, unde r both the baseline and the  “Higher Labor Costs” 
scenarios, reinvestments cease during the third quarter of 2017, while under the 
“Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate” scenario they c ease one quarter 
later.  Once reinvestments cease, the SOMA portfolio shrinks through redemptions of 
maturing Treasury and agency debt  securities as well as paydowns of principal on 
agency MBS until reserve balances reach their assumed longer-ru n level of 
$100 billion. 
 Use of policy normalization tools:   All of the scenarios  assume that take-up of 
overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion through the 
end of 2018, before declining to zero by the end of 2019, and t hat term deposits (the 
TDF) and term RRPs are not used.3 
Other features of these scen arios are described below. 
 Balance sheet.   Under the baseline scenario, th e size of the portfolio is normalized in 
the fourth quarter of 2021, unchanged from the September Tealbo ok (see the solid 
black lines in the exhibit titled “ Total Assets and Selected Ba lance Sheet Items” and 
the table that follows).4  At that time, total assets are projected to stand at roughly 
                                                 
2 The box entitled “Confidence Int erval Projections of the Balan ce Sheet” in the December 2015 
Tealbook B presents an assessment of the degree of uncertainty around the projected dynamics of the 
Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and income. 
3 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the over all size of the balance sheet.  Separately, we assume that RRPs associated 
with foreign official and international accounts remain near th eir September 30, 2016 level of $253 billion 
throughout the projection period. 
4 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend; this trend is determined largely by cu rrency in circulation and 
the assumed long-run level of re serve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the 
Projections

$2.4 trillion, with about  $2.2 trillion in tot al SOMA securitie s holdings.  Total assets 
and SOMA Treasury holdings rise thereafter, keeping pace with t he increases in 
Federal Reserve notes in circul ation and Federal Reserve Bank c apital. 
Under the “Higher Labor Costs” and the “Lower Long-Run Equilibr ium Federal 
Funds Rate” scenarios, the implie d timing for the normalization  of the size of the 
balance sheet is the same as  in the baseline projection.  Under  the first of the two 
alternative scenarios, although mo rtgage rates are somewhat hig her than in the 
baseline, the trajectory of MBS prepayments is not noticeably c hanged.  As a 
consequence, the difference in M BS and total SOMA holdings rela tive to the baseline 
scenario is projected to be sma ll after the cessation of reinve stments.  Conversely, 
under the second alternative scen ario, mortgage rates move mode stly lower beginning 
in 2020, leading to a small upward s hift in the trajectory of M BS prepayments.5  As a 
result, the path of SOMA holdings o f agency MBS is projected to  be slightly lower 
relative to the baseline sce nario, from 2020 to the end of the projection period. 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   Under the baseline scenario, annual remittances are 
projected to decline fr om $98 billion in 2015 to about $92 bill ion this year (see the 
solid black lines in the “Income Projections” exhibit).6  The step-down primarily 
reflects increased interest expe nse on reserves resulting from the FOMC’s decision to 
increase the target range for the federal funds rate, and thus the IOER rate, in 
December 2015.7  Thereafter, annual remittances are projected to continue to d ecline, 
                                                 
balance sheet depends importantly  on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct monetary 
policy.  Currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to  be $100 billion; howev er, policymakers’ 
choice of a long-run operating framework, as well as ongoing re gulatory and structural changes, could 
result in a higher long-run level  of reserve balances.  In turn , a higher long-run level of reserve balances 
would, all else equal, imply an earlier normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet.  For an illustration of 
the implications of different choices for the long-run level of  reserve balances, see the accompanying box, 
“The Effects of the Long-Run Level of Reserve Balances on SOMA Holdings and on the Term Premium.” 
5 The difference in the projected  pace of MBS prepayments between the two alternative scenarios 
mostly reflects the asymmetric e ffects of changes in interest r ate paths on MBS prepa yments.  Specifically, 
interest rates rising above the baseline path would slow refina ncing activity only slightly more, thereby 
producing a relatively muted effect on the path of prepayments for agency MBS.  Altern atively, rates below 
the baseline path will likely hast en prepayments, thus reducing  the amount of agency MBS holdings. 
6 Earnings remittances for 2015 exclude a one-time transfer of $19 billion in Federal Reserve 
surplus associated with the FAST Act. 
7 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balance s will average 12.5 basis points 
above the effective federal funds rate and the offering rate on ON RRPs will average 12.5 basis points 
below the effective federal funds rate.  The effective federal funds rate has averaged 40 basis points over 
the intermeeting period.

reaching a low of roughl y $35 billion in 2019, with no deferred asset being recorded.8  
Under the baseline scenario, the Federal Reserve’s projected re mittances from 2009 
through 2025 total about $1.1 trillion.  
Under the “Higher Labor Costs” scenario, cumulative remittances  over the 2009 to 
2025 period are projected to be onl y $4 billion lower than in t he baseline projection.  
Higher interest expense due to the steeper path for the policy target throughout the 
projection period, and thus for the IOER rate, offsets the larg er amount of income 
received over the longer run stemm ing from the higher yields ea rned on longer-dated 
securities purchased during both t he reinvestment and the post- normalization periods.  
Conversely, under the “Lower Long-Run Equilibrium Federal Funds  Rate” scenario, 
cumulative net earnings are pr ojected to be about $20 billion h igher than in the 
baseline scenario (see the dashe d blue line in the “Income Proj ections” exhibit).  This 
result primarily reflects the re duced interest expense implied by the lower path for the 
policy target and assumed for the I OER rate relative to the bas eline, with this factor 
more than offsetting the dampene d interest income over the long er run from the 
purchase of lower-y ielding securities.9  
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of $260 billion at the end of Septembe r.10  Going forward, 
the net unrealized gain or lo ss position of the portfolio will depend importantly on the 
path of longer-term interest rates.  Under the baseline scenari o, because of the rise in 
longer-term interest rates assumed over the next several years,  the portfolio is 
projected to shift t o an unrealized loss position in the third quarter of 2018.  In 
particular, the portfolio is expected to record a peak unrealized loss of approximately 
$90 billion in 2019, about $15 billion of which is attributable  to holdings of Treasury 
securities and $75 billion to hol dings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position 
then contracts from 2020 through 202 5, as the value of securiti es previously acquired 
                                                 
8 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury. 
9 This feature arises even as res erve balances are somewhat lowe r than in the ba seline scenario 
until the balance sheet is normalized. 
10 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

under the large-scale asset purchase programs return to par as they approach maturity 
and new securities are added to the portfolio a t prevailing mar ket yields. 
Under the “Higher Labor Costs” s cenario, the portfolio is projected to shift to a 
position of unrealized loss at abou t the same time as under the  baseline scenario.  
Thereafter, under this scenario, the portfolio is expected to r ecord slightly larger 
unrealized loss positions rela tive to the baseline scenario, be cause of the steeper rise 
in yields on longer-dated securi ties.  In contrast, under the “Lower Long-Run 
Equilibrium Federal Funds Rate” scenario, the portfolio is proj ected to shift to an 
unrealized loss position nearly t wo quarters later and the loss es that would be 
recorded are expected to be smalle r, reflecting the lower path of longer-term interest 
rates. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” the Feder al Reserve’s elevated holdings o f longer-term 
securities are estimated to be r educing the term premium embedd ed in the 10-year 
nominal Treasury yield by 86 basis points in the current quarte r.  The estimated term 
premium effect depends importan tly on the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet over coming years relative to a benchmark counterfactual projection for 
the balance sheet that excludes the effects of asset purchases.  Over time, the term 
premium effect gradually fades a s the projected path of the bal ance sheet converges 
to the benchmark path.  Under both alternative scenarios, the implied paths for the 
term premium effect track the ba seline path closely, with the d ifferences across the 
scenarios projected to be less than 2 basis points in any given quarter, on average. 
 SOMA characteristics.  Regarding the size of the portfolio, under all three scenario s, 
approximately $216 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings have alrea dy matured or will 
mature this year, and a total  of nearly $1.5 trillion will matu re between 2016 and 
2020 (for the baseline scenario, s ee the top panel of the exhib it “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Holdings”).11  The amount of Treasury securities maturing 
                                                 
11 Under the FOMC’s current reinvestment policy, the Desk replace s maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
face value of holdings maturing on the issue date of newly issu ed securities.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are p laced as noncompetitive tenders and are treated by Treasury as add-ons to 
announced auction sizes.

each month will vary considerably over time, while projected MB S paydowns are 
much less variable.  Realized M BS paydowns will reflect the evolution of interest 
rates and other factors and thus could be significantly more vo latile than projected.12 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6½ years (see the middle panel  of the exhibit).  Under the thre e scenarios, the 
weighted-average duration is projected to decline through 2017,  reflecting the aging 
of the portfolio as securities approach maturit y, and subsequen tly to rise until the size 
of the balance sheet is normalized in late 2021.13  After reaching its peak, duration is 
projected to resume its decline as the Desk resumes open market  purchases of 
Treasury securities to keep pace w ith the increase in currency and Federal Reserve 
Bank capital.  The duration contour in this latter portion of the projection is based on 
the key assumption that the Fede ral Reserve will buy only Treas ury bills until those 
holdings are equal to approximate ly 30 percent of the Treasury portfolio, similar to 
the pre-crisis composition of the portfolio (currently SOMA holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, purchases of Treasur y securities are assumed to be spread across the 
maturity spectrum (as depicted in the exhibit, “Projections for  the Composition of 
SOMA Treasury Holdings).

12 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $14 billion of maturing Treasury securities 
and is expected to purchase a to tal of $47 billion of 15- and 3 0-year agency MBS under the reinvestment 
program. 
13 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 a s the pace of roll-offs accelerates  and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o, causing duration to increase until the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized. 
14 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments cea se.

  The Effects  of the Long‐Run Level of Reserve Balances  on SOMA 
Holdings  and on the Term  Premium  
Policymakers’  decisions  about the role that the balance sheet might play  in a long‐run 
operating  framework  will  have implications  regarding  the evolution  of the size and 
composition  of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.   This box focuses on one aspect of  
these implications,  namely how the long‐run level of  reserve balances  affects the size 
of the SOMA portfolio and  the 10‐year Treasury  term premium. 1 
One crucial variable that, among others, determines  the size of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet  is the long‐run level of reserve balances.   To illustrate  the implications  
of different long ‐run levels  of reserve balances  for the  10‐year Treasury  term premium,  
we consider  three values: $100 billion  in reserve balances,  a level that  is in line with the 
October Tealbook  baseline forecast,  $500 billion,  and $1 trillion.  As shown in  panel A, 
under each scenario, reserve  balances  decline over time  from the current level as  
assets held in the SOMA portfolio mature, until  they reach the assumed  long‐run level.   
Normalization of  the size of the balance sheet,  shown in panel B, occurs later with 
lower long ‐run reserve  balances:   Reserve  balances  are projected  to reach the long ‐
run levels  of $100 billion,  $500 billion,  and $1 trillion in November  2021, December  2020, 
and November  2019, respectively. 
The size of  the Federal Res erve’s portfolio affects  financial conditions  and the degree 
of policy accommodation  by exerting  downward  pressure  on term premiums on  
long‐dated securities.   To quantify this effect, we  estimate the  10‐year Treasury  term 
premium  effect for the three long ‐run levels  of reserve balances.   We assume that 
market participants  learn the intended  long‐run level  of reserve balances  immediately,  
thereby affecting  the term premium  in the current quarter.  As expected,  higher levels 
of reserve balances  boost the  long‐run 10‐year equivalent  measure  of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio (panel  C), and as such, the term premium  effect is greater in 
magnitude with larger  long‐run reserve  balances.   As shown in  panel D, the 
differences  in the term premium  effects across the three scenarios  peak near the end 
of 2021, soon after the balance sheet has  normalized  under the $100 billion scenario.   
The difference  in the term premium  effects between the  $100 billion  and the $1 trillion 
scenarios  is about 20 basis points in 2021:Q4.   After normalization  occurs in all three 
scenarios, the  difference  in the term premium  effects generally  narrows over time.   
Overall, the  term premium  effects become less negative,  reflecting  in part the 
shortening  duration  of SOMA Treasury  holdings.2 
                                                 
1 For the purposes  of this box, we abstract from the implications  of different SOMA portfolio or 
liability  compositions.  
2 Our assumptions  about  the long‐run composition  of the SOMA portfolio are the same as those 
underlying  the baseline projection  presented  in the main text.  Specifically,  we assume that, as the 
Desk resumes open market purchases  of Treasury securities  to keep pace with the increase in 
currency and Federal  Reserve capital  after the normalization  of the size of the balance sheet, only
