 Monetary Policy Strategies 
This section considers a selec tion of strategies for setting th e federal funds rate 
and compares the associated policy paths and macroeconomic outc omes with those in the 
Tealbook baseline forecast.  The sim ple rules and optimal contr ol exercises considered 
below prescribe a tighter stance of monetary policy in the medi um term than they did in 
the October Tealbook in response to more expansionary fiscal po licy assumptions in the 
staff projection.  As was the case in the October Tealbook, mos t simple rules and optimal 
control exercises prescribe a more rapid increase in the federa l funds rate than assumed in 
the staff forecast.  A special exhibit examines the changes in optimal control paths 
associated with the assumed shift to a more accommodative stanc e of fiscal policy. 
NEAR-TERM PRESCRIPTIONS OF SELECTED SIMPLE POLICY RULES  
The top panel of the first exhib it provides near-term prescript ions for the federal 
funds rate from four policy rules: the Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor (1999) rule, an 
inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, and a first-differe nce rule.1  These prescriptions 
take as given the staff’s baseline projections for the output g ap and inflation in the near 
term, shown in the middle panels.  The top and middle panels al so include the staff’s 
baseline assumption for t he federal funds rate. 
 The near-term prescriptions of all of the Taylor-type rules are  higher than in the 
October Tealbook because incoming data over the intermeeting pe riod led to a 
modest upward revision to the s taff’s estimate of the output ga p in the near term and 
because the real federal funds rate expected by the staff in th e long run has been 
revised up by ¼ percentage point.  T he Taylor (1993), Taylor (1 999), and inertial 
Taylor (1999) rules prescrib e rates that are 34, 46, and 7 basi s points higher in 
2017:Q1 and are 28, 33, and 11 basis  points higher in 2017:Q2. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999 ) rules, which feature no interest-rate smoothing 
term, prescribe substantially hi gher federal funds rates in the  near term than the 
inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, and the  Tealbook baseline. 
                                                 
1 The appendix to this section provides details on each of these  four simple rules.

 A MEDIUM -TERM EQUILIBRIUM REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE  
The bottom panel of the exhibit reports the estim ate of a medium-term notion of 
the equilibrium real federal funds  rate that is generated using  the FRB/US model, given 
the staff’s baseline projecti on.  This Tealbook-consistent FRB/ US r* corresponds to the 
level of the real federal funds r ate that, if maintained over a  12-quarter period, sets the 
output gap to zero in the fi nal quarter of that period. 
 The current estimate of FRB/US r* is 32 basis points higher than in the October 
Tealbook, reflecting the revision to the forecast in the near t erm due to incoming data 
as well as the new fiscal assumptions.   
 At 1.16 percent, FRB/US r* is well above the average lev el of the real federal funds 
rate in the staff forecast for the same 12-quarter period, at 1 0 basis points, and above 
the staff’s estimate of the real  federal funds rate in the long  run, at 1 percent.   
 The fact that the real federal  funds rate in the baseline staff  forecast is, on average, 
below FRB/US r* reflects policy considerations  other than closing the output g ap that 
are embedded in the policy reaction function assumed by the sta ff. 
SIMPLE POLICY RULES SIMULATIONS  
The second exhibit reports dynamic simulations of the FRB/US mo del under the 
Taylor (1993) rule, the Taylor ( 1999) rule, the inertial versio n of the Taylor (1999) rule, 
and the first-difference rule.2  These simulations reflect t he endogenous responses of the 
output gap and inflation when the federal funds rate follows th e paths implied by the 
different policy rules.3  
There has been a significant upward shift in the trajectory prescribed by each rule 
relative to the October Tealbook.  T he magnitude of the shift r anges from 0.5 to 
0.6 percentage point over th e period from 2019 to 2022 during which the federal funds 
rate reaches its peak under each policy rule.  The shift in the  Tealbook baseline policy 
                                                 
2 Unless otherwise noted, the policy rules and optimal control s imulations assume that 
policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future a nd that financial market participants, price 
setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers wi ll follow through with their strategy but also 
fully understand the macroeconomic implications of that policy strategy.  Such policy strategies are 
described as commitment strategies.  
3 Because of these endogenous res ponses, the near-term prescript ions from the dynamic 
simulations can differ from those shown in the top panel of the  first exhibit.

     Note: The policy rule simulations in this exhibit are based on rules that respond to core inflation.  This choice of rule
specification was made in light of a tendency for current and near−term core inflation rates to outperform headline inflation

 over the same period is of similar magnitude.  These higher pol icy paths primarily reflect 
the staff’s assumption that Congress will enact changes in fiscal policy that will boost 
demand for goods and services but  have essentially no effect on  potential GDP. 
The relative position of the polic y paths prescribed by the sim ple rules and 
associated relative macroeconom ic implications remain the same as in the October 
Tealbook.  These features are dis cussed in the bullets below.   
 The policy path in the staff forecast is constructed using a ve rsion of the inertial 
Taylor (1999) rule with a temporary downward adjustment to the intercept.4  In the 
Tealbook baseline, the nom inal federal funds rate increases, on average, about 
80 basis points per year through the first quarter of 2020, whe n it reaches 3.5 percent.  
The pace of tightening subsequent ly slows, and the federal funds rate peaks at 
4 percent in 2021, before eventua lly returning to its long-run level of 3 percent.  Over 
the period from 2019 to 2022, the pat h of the federal funds rat e runs, on average, 
0.5 percentage point higher than  in the October Tealbook projec tion. 
 The inertial Taylor (1999) rule with a constant intercept presc ribes a slightly higher 
path for the federal funds rate  over the next few years than th e version with a 
judgmental downward intercept adj ustment used to construct the Tealbook baseline.  
The difference in policy rates ar ising from this alternative in tercept assumption is 
small and dissipates too rapidl y to have marked effects on the real longer-term 
interest rates that influen ce economic activity in FRB/US.  Thu s, macroeconomic 
outcomes under the inertial Taylo r (1999) rule are similar to t hose in the Tealbook 
baseline.  Over the period f rom 2019 to 2022, the path of the f ederal funds rate runs 
on average 0.5 percentage point a bove its counterpart in the Oc tober Tealbook. 
 The Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules call for an immediate  sharp tightening in 
policy and produce paths for the real federal funds rate that l ie significantly above the 
Tealbook baseline path over the next few years largely because these two policy rules 
do not put weight on the lagged policy rate.  Despite these initially higher policy 
paths, the macroeconomic outcomes under these two rules are not  far from those 
                                                 
4 In response to the new fiscal a ssumptions, the staff has increased its estimate of the real federal 
funds rate in the long run from ¾ percent to 1 percent and raised the equilibrium spread between the 10-
year Treasury yield and the expected federal funds rate over the valuation window by 12.5 basis points.  
The temporary adjustment to the intercept of the inertial Taylo r (1999) rule used to construct the Tealbook 
baseline projection is phased out by the end of 2019.  See Teal book A for details.

 under the Tealbook baseline because of the assumption that the public immediately 
understands the macroeconomic e ffects of following the rules an d believes the 
policymakers’ commitment to sta bilize the economy in the future .  The Taylor (1999) 
rule calls for slightly higher pol icy rates than the Taylor (19 93) rule over the period 
shown because it responds more strongly to the projected rise in output above its 
potential level over the next several years.  As a consequence,  the Taylor (1999) rule 
generates a higher traj ectory for the unemp loyment rate and a s lightly lower trajectory 
for inflation than does the Taylor (1993) rule.  Over the period from 2019 to 2022, the paths of the federal funds rate prescribed by the two rules are  0.6 and 0.5 percentage 
point higher, respectively, than their counterpart s in the October Tealbook. 
 The first-difference rule presc ribes a slightl y higher path for  the federal funds rate 
through the end of the decade than the Tealbook baseline.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate slowly drifts down t o near its long-run level of 3 percent.  In contrast, the 
federal funds rate in the Teal book baseline continues to rise f or a while and reaches a 
level of about 4 percent over muc h of this period. This divergence occurs because the 
first-difference rule, which r esponds to the expected change in the output gap rather 
than to its level, reacts to the  slower pace of economic growth  projected late in the 
decade and beyond.  The lower path  of the federal funds rate af ter 2020, in 
conjunction with expectations of higher price and wage inflatio n in the future, implies 
lower longer-term real rates ove r the entire pr ojection period,  as well as higher levels 
of resource utilization and inflation.  Thus, the first-differe nce rule generates 
outcomes for the unemployment rate that are markedly below the unemployment rate 
paths generated under the other  policy rules and farther below the staff’s estimate of 
the natural rate.  As with the other simple rules, the path of the federal funds rate 
under the first-difference rule r uns on average 0.5 percentage point higher than its 
counterpart in the October Tealbook over the period from 2019 t o 2022. 
OPTIMAL CONTROL SIMULATIONS UNDER COMMITMENT  
The third exhibit displays optimal control simulations under va rious assumptions 
about policymakers’ preferences, as captured by four specificat ions of the loss function.5  
The concept of optimal control employed here corresponds to a c ommitment policy under 
                                                 
5 The box “Optimal Control and the Loss Function” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of 
the June 2016 Tealbook B offers motivations for these specifica tions; the appendix provides technical 
details on the optimal control simulations.

 which the plans that policymakers make today are assumed to constrain future policy 
choices in a way that improves overall economic outcomes, given  the baseline outlook.6 
Since the October Tealbook, there  has been an upward shift in t he federal funds 
rate paths prescribed by optimal  control under each of the four loss functions, though 
there is considerable dispersion in the size of these shifts ac ross loss functions.  For most 
optimal control policy prescriptio ns, the magnitude of the revi sion in the path of the 
federal funds rate since the October Tealbook ranges from 0.8 t o 1 percentage point over 
the period from 2019 to 2022 during wh ich the federal funds rat e reaches its peak under 
each policy rule.  The exception is the rule that places asymmetric weight on the 
unemployment rate gap (ugap).  This rule prescribes a traj ectory of the federal funds rate  
that is only 0.4 percentage point tighter than the October pres cription over the period 
from 2019 to 2020.  We will consider this difference in more de tail in the exhibit 
“Optimal Control Response to Fiscal Stimulus.”  As in the previ ous exhibit, these shifts 
reflect the staff’s projection of greater resource utilization.    
The relative position of the po licy paths prescribed by optimal  control under each 
loss function remain the same as in the October Tealbook.  The relative implications of 
these paths also remain the sam e.  These features are discussed  in the bullets below.   
 The first simulation, labeled “e qual weights,” presents the cas e in which 
policymakers are assumed to plac e the same weights on keeping h eadline PCE 
inflation close to the Committ ee’s 2 percent goal, on keeping t he unemployment rate 
close to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate of unemployment, and on changes in 
the federal funds rate.  Under th is strategy, the path for the federal funds rate is 
significantly higher than the T ealbook baseline policy path.  T his higher path arises 
because, in the current baseline projection, the unemployment r ate falls well below 
the staff’s estimate of the natural rate over the next several years, an outcome that the 
“equal weights” loss function j udges to be costly.  A tighter p olicy results in a path of 
the unemployment rate that is s ubstantially closer to the staff ’s estimate of the natural 
rate; headline PCE inflation is somewhat lower than in the Teal book baseline over the 
period shown, consistent with a l imited response of inflation i n the model to lower 
levels of resource utilization.  The path of the federal funds rate runs on average 
                                                 
6 Under the optimal control policies shown in the exhibit, polic ymakers improve current economic 
outcomes by making promises that bind future policymakers’ acti ons; however, the simulations are not 
conditioned on policy commitments that might have been made in the past.

Optimal Control Simulations under Commitment
     Note: Each set of lines corresponds to an optimal control policy under commitment in which policymakers minimize a
discounted weighted sum of squared deviations of four−quarter headline PCE inflation from the Committee's 2 percent
objective, of squared deviations of the unemployment rate from the staff's estimate of the natural rate, and of squared
changes in the federal funds rate. The weights vary across simulations. See the appendix for technical details and the box

 0.9 percentage point higher than its counterpart in the October Tealbook projection 
over the period from 2019 to 2022. 
 The second simulation, label ed “asymmetric weight on ugap,” uses a loss function 
that assigns no cost to deviati ons of the unemployment rate from the natural rate 
when the unemployment rate is running below the natural rate, b ut that is identical to 
the specification with equal wei ghts when the unemployment rate  is above the natural 
rate.  Under this strat egy, the path of the f ederal funds rate is considerably below both 
the path for the case of equal weights and the Tealbook baselin e path.  With the 
asymmetric loss function, policym akers choose this relatively a ccommodative path 
for the policy rate because the ir desire to raise inflation to 2 percent is not tempered 
by an aversion to the undershooti ng of the natural rate of unem ployment that helps 
achieve this outcome.  The tighter  labor market causes inflatio n to reach 2 percent 
more quickly than in the case of  equal weights; inflation then edges above the 
Committee’s longer-run object ive for the next decade.7  The path of the federal funds 
rate runs on average 0.4 percenta ge point higher than its count erpart in the October 
Tealbook projection over the period from 2019 to 2022. 
 The third simulation, labeled “large weight on inflation gap,” posits a loss function 
that assigns a cost to deviations of inflation from 2 percent t hat is five times larger 
than the “equal weights” speci fication, but is otherwise identi cal.  The resulting 
optimal strategy is only slightly more accommodative than in th e “equal weights” 
case, even though the losses asso ciated with undershooting the inflation objective in 
coming years are larger.  The reas on is that, in the FRB/US model, policymakers face 
an unappealing tradeoff because inf lation responds little to re source utilization.  
Hence, policymakers would need to engineer a substantial unders hooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment, w hich this specification of the l oss function sees as 
costly, in order to raise infla tion in the near term by a modest amount.  The path of 
                                                 
7 The simultaneous overshooting of the longer-run inflation obje ctive and undershooting of the 
natural rate of unemployment over the medium term is time incon sistent, in the sense that, given the 
opportunity to reoptimize the path  of the federal funds rate wi thout regard to past policy commitments, 
policymakers in the future would choose to pursue a tighter mon etary policy.  Under the assumption of 
optimal control under discretion with “asymmetric weight on ugap ” preferences, policy rates and 
macroeconomic outcomes are between those under the Tealbook bas eline and optimal  control under 
commitment.  For the other thre e specifications of the loss fun ction, the simulation results under 
commitment and discretion are not  much different from each othe r.

 the federal funds rate runs on average 1 percentage point highe r than its counterpart in 
the October Tealbook projecti on over the period from 2019 to 20 22. 
 The fourth simulation, labeled “ minimal weight on rate adjustme nts,” uses a loss 
function that assigns a very sma ll cost to changes in the feder al funds rate but is 
otherwise identical t o the loss function with equal weights.  I n the resulting optimal 
strategy, the federal funds rate rises faster than under the sp ecification with equal 
weights over the next few years in an effort to contain the pro jected undershooting of 
the natural rate of unemployment .  The paths for the real federal funds rate and the 
real 10-year Treasury y ield are also higher for a couple of years than in the case of 
equal weights.  While this policy leaves the trajectory for inf lation almost unaffected, 
it keeps the unemployment rate c lose to the staff’s estimate of  the natural rate.  The 
path of the federal funds rate runs on average 0.9 percentage p oint higher than its 
counterpart in the October Teal book projection over the period from 2019 to 2022. 
OPTIMAL -CONTROL RESPONSE TO FISCAL STIMULUS  
All simple rules and optimal cont rol exercises presented above prescribe paths for 
the federal funds rate that are h igher than they were in the October Tealbook.  These 
higher paths reflect a different  mix of accommodation from fiscal and monetary policies 
in the projection; greater fis cal stimulus results in less mone tary stimulus, with the size of 
the adjustment in monetary policy reflecting the assumed strate gy of the policymakers.  
In this next exhibit, we explore how policy settings and associ ated macroeconomic 
effects are sensitive to both t he nature of the fiscal stimulus  and the assumed monetary 
policy strategy. 
To this end, we consider optimal -control simulations for the “e qual weights” (the 
red lines) and “asym metric weight on ugap” (the green lines) speci fications of the loss 
function under two alternative a ssumptions regarding fiscal sti mulus:  
 In the “no stimulus” scenari o, we drop the assumption of a pers onal income tax cut 
equivalent to 1 percent of GDP introduced in the Tealbook basel ine, leaving the fiscal 
assumptions identical to t hose in the October Tealbook.   
 In the “larger stimulus” scenar io, we include a 1 percentage po int increase in 
government purchases as a frac tion of GDP, phased in over a fou r-year period starting 
in 2017:Q3, in addition to the person al income tax cut considered in the Tealbook

 baseline.  Half of the additional spending is assumed to be dir ected to public 
infrastructures; however, the st aff’s estimates suggest that th is has only small supply-
side effects. 
The consideration of a no-stimulus scenario provides a comparis on point to assess 
the economic response to fiscal s timulus shocks of the kind inc orporated in the baseline 
and larger-stimulus scenarios.8 
In response to the fiscal stimulus, the policy paths are 1.1 pe rcentage points and 
0.8 percentage point higher in the e qual-weights baseline (soli d red line) and asymmetric-
weights baseline (solid green l ine) scenarios, respectively, th an under their counterparts 
in the no-stimulus scenario over the period 2019 to 2020.9  By comparison, in response to 
the larger stimulus scenari o, the policy paths are 3.2 percenta ge points and 2.8 percentage 
points higher, respectively, than under their no-stimulus scena rios over the same period.  
These optimal control simulations show substantially larger inc reases in the federal funds 
rate than prescribed by the sta ff’s baseline policy rule, which  implies 0.6 and 
1.7 percentage points of tightening in response to the same fis cal policy shocks that are 
illustrated in the Risk and U ncertainty section of Tealbook A.  Under all policy strategies, 
though, the introduction of fiscal s timulus helps policymakers raise the federal funds rate 
to levels well above its effec tive lower bound more rapidly tha n otherwise. 
The strong policy response pres cribed by the equ al-weight optim al control 
simulation results in similar path s of the unemployment rate an d inflation under all fiscal 
                                                 
8 The “no stimulus” scenario assu mes that the real federal funds  rate in the long run is ¾ percent 
and that the equilibrium spread between the 10-y ear Treasury yi eld and the expected f ederal funds rate over 
the valuation window is 12.5 basis points lower than in the Dec ember Tealbook.  The “larger stimulus” 
scenario assumes that the real f ederal funds rate in the long r un is 1¼ percent and that the equilibrium 
spread between the ten-year Treas ury yield and th e expected federal funds rate over the valuation window 
is 12.5 basis points higher than  in the December Tealbook.  Whi le these scenarios allow expansionary 
fiscal policy to raise long-term interest rates in part by rais ing term premiums, the optimal control 
simulations take the term premi um paths in each scenario as exo genous.  See the Risks and Uncertainty 
section of Tealbook A for further description of the alternativ e scenarios and simulations under the 
Tealbook baseline moneta ry policy assumptions. 
9 As noted in the Risk and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A, in  both alternative scenarios, the 
responses of inflation to fiscal  stimulus are likely larger tha n the revisions that the staff would implement 
using its judgmental apparatus because inflation in FRB/US gene rally moves more with demand than it 
does in the staff’s projection.  Thus, the policy responses to fiscal stimulus in these scenarios are larger than 
would be the case in the judgmental projection.

 stimulus packages.10  This result is consistent with  the assumed ability of monetar y policy 
to offset a (positive) aggregate demand shock in FRB/US and in a broad class of 
macroeconomic models.11  The asymmetric weight on ugap optimal control prescribes 
somewhat less policy tightening, p rimarily because for much of the horizon 
unemployment undershoots the na tural rate and thus these policy makers focus on 
harnessing the fiscal stimulus’  inflationary implications. 
We have also run optimal control si mulations under the other specifications of the 
loss function described in the exhibit “Optimal Control Simulat ions under Commitment.”  
Optimal monetary policy in response to fiscal stimulus results in little altered paths for 
unemployment and inflation regar dless of the loss function cons idered.  Each 
specification of the loss functi on results in a significantly l ess accommodative path of 
monetary policy as fiscal stimulus  increases such that nearly t he entire impact of fiscal 
stimulus is offset. 
These simulations are subject t o a number of caveats.  One such  caveat is that not 
only are the size and nature of  fiscal measures to come uncerta in, but so are their 
economic effects.  As such, the a ppropriate speed at which to n ormalize monetary policy 
is also uncertain.  For instance,  if the fiscal policy changes turn out to be ones that have a 
larger positive effect on potenti al output than staff currently anticipates, then fiscal 
stimulus would, all else equal , have smaller effects on the inflation and unemployment 
gaps; as a consequence, policymakers in the simulations might p refer a slower 
normalization than shown.  Alternat ively, if fiscal stimulus we re to have larger effects on 
                                                 
10 The asymmetric loss function permits a limited increase in the  undershooting of the 
unemployment rate:  the “no stimulus” and “large stimulus” aver age path of the unemployment rate are 
within 13 basis points over the forecast horizon.  The equal-we ight loss function permits even less increase 
in the undershooting of the unemployment rate:  the “no stimulu s” and “large stimulus” average path of the 
unemployment rate are within 5 basis points over the forecast h orizon.  By comparison, the paths implied 
by the staff’s baseline assumptions, illustrated in the Risk and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A, imply 
that the unemployment gap significantly widens and the path of inflation becomes steep er as fiscal stimulus 
increases under the policy paths prescribed:  Compared with the  “no stimulus” scenario, the unemployment 
gap is nearly 25 basis points wider at its peak under the basel ine scenario and just over 80 basis points 
wider under the “larger stimulus” scenario.  Inflation remains below 2 percent over the projection horizon 
in the scenario with no fiscal sti mulus, it overshoots 2 percen t by 1 basis point in the baseline and by 
5 basis points with larger fiscal stimulus. 
11 With the federal funds rate in proximity of its effective lowe r bound, policymakers have more 
limited ability to respond to a negative than a positive fiscal  shock.

 inflation than assumed in the sim ulations, then the federal fun ds rate would eventually 
need to increase faster than otherwise.12 
Another caveat is that, because the simulations are conducted u nder the 
assumption of perfect foresight, the optimal control policies a bstract from risk 
management considerations, and in particular the possibility th at the monetary policy 
response to shocks might be res trained by the effective lower b ound (ELB) on the federal 
funds rate.  Such considerations  could induce policymakers to n ormalize the stance of 
policy more rapidly as the size  of the fiscal stimulus package grows and the ELB-related 
risk wanes. 
The next four exhibits tabulate the simulation results for key variables under the 
policy rule and optimal control simulations described above.

Appendix 
The monetary policy strategies considered in this section of Te albook B typically fall into 
one of two categories.  Under simp le policy rules, policymakers  set the federal funds rate 
according to a reaction function that includes a small number o f macroeconomic factors.  Under 
optimal control policies, policymakers compute a path for the federal funds rate that minimizes a 
loss function meant to capture policymakers’ preferences over m acroeconomic outcomes.  Both 
approaches recognize the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Unles s otherwise noted, the 
simulations assume that policymakers will adhere to the policy strategy in the future and that 
financial market participants, p rice setters, and wage setters not only believe that policymakers 
will follow through with their strategy but also fully understa nd the macroeconomic implications.  
Such policy strategies are describ ed as commitment strategies. 
The two approaches have differe nt merits and limitations.  The parsimony of simple rules 
makes them relatively easy to communicate to the public, and be cause they respond only to 
variables that are central to a range of models, proponents argue that they may be more robust to 
uncertainty about the structure  of the economy.  However, simpl e rules omit, by construction, 
other potential influences on policy decisions; thus, strict ad herence to such rules may, at times, 
lead to unsatisfactory outcomes.  By comparison, optimal contro l policies respond to a broader set 
of economic factors; their prescriptions optimally balance various policy objectives.  And although this section focuses on policies under commitment, opt imal control policies can more 
generally be derived under vari ous assumptions about the degree  to which policymakers can 
commit.  That said, optimal contro l policies assume substantial  knowledge on the part of 
policymakers and are sensitive to  the assumed loss function and the specifics of the particular 
model. 
Given the different strengths and weaknesses of the two approac hes, they are probably 
best considered together, possibl y along with others, as a means to assess the various tradeoffs 
policymakers may face when pursu ing their mandated objectives. 
POLICY RULES USED IN “MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES ” 
The table below gives the expressions for the four simple polic y rules reported in 
“Monetary Policy Strategies.”  ܴ௧ denotes the nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, and the 
right-hand-side variables include the staff’s projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation 
for the current quarter and three quarters ahead ( ߨ௧ and ߨ௧ାଷ|௧), the output gap estimate for the 
current period ( ygap t), and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap 
(4ygap t+3|t).  The value of policymakers’ l onger-run inflation objective, denoted πLR, is 2 percent.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (199 3, 1999), while the inertial 
version of the Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently  in analysis by Board staff.1  The 
intercepts of these rules, denoted ݎ௅ோ, are constant and chosen so that they are consistent with a 
2 percent longer-run inflation objective and a longer-run real federal funds rate of 0.9 percent, a 
value used in the FRB/US model.2  The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on 
the level of the output gap or the longer-run real interest rat e; see Orphanides (2003). 
Near-term prescriptions from the four policy rules are calculat ed taking as given the 
Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap.  When th e Tealbook is published early in a 
quarter, the prescriptions are s hown for the current and next quarter.  When the Tealbook is 
published late in a quarter, the  prescriptions are shown for the next two quarters.  Rules that 
include a lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable are conditioned on the lagged federal 
funds rate in the Tealbook projection for the first quarter sho wn, and then conditioned on their 
simulated lagged federal funds rate for the second quarter shown.  To isolate the effects of 
changes in macroeconomic projections on the prescriptions of th ese inertial rules, the lines 
labeled “Previous Tealbook proj ection” report prescriptions con ditional on the previous Tealbook 
projections for inflation and the output gap but using the valu e of the lagged federal funds rate in 
the current Tealbook for the first quarter shown. 
REAL FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ESTIMATES  
The bottom panel of the exhibit titled “Policy Rules and the St aff Projection” provides an 
estimate of one notion of the equilibrium real federal funds ra te, r* .  This measure is an estimate 
of the real federal funds rate that, if maintained over a 12-qu arter period (beginning in the current 
quarter), makes the output gap equal to zero in the final quart er of that period using the output 
projection from FRB/US, the staff’s large-scale econometric mod el of the U.S. economy.3  This 
“Tealbook-consistent FRB/US  r*” depends on a broad array of economic factors, some of which 
                                                 
1 See, for example, Erceg and others (2012). 
2 In the October Tealbook,  Taylor-type rules used a value of  ݎ௅ோ equal to 0.75 percent, 
corresponding to the staff’s est imate the real federal funds ra te in the long run at that time.  All nominal and 
real federal funds rates reporte d in the Monetary Policy Strate gies section are expressed on the same 360-
day basis as the published federal funds rate.  Consistent with  the methodology in the FRB/US model, the 
simple rules are first implemented on a fully compounded, 365-d ay basis and then converted to a 360-day 
basis.

take the form of projected val ues of the model’s exogenous vari ables.  It is generated after the 
paths of exogenous variables in the FRB/US model are adjusted s o that they match those in the 
extended Tealbook forecast.  A model simulation then determines  the value of the real federal 
funds rate that closes the output gap conditional on the exogen ous variables in the extended 
baseline forecast. 
The “Average projected real federal funds rate” reported in the  panel is the average of the 
real federal funds rate under the Tealbook baseline projection calculated over the same 12-quarter 
period as the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US r *.  The average projected real federal funds rate and 
r* need not be associated with the same macroeconomic outcomes even when their values are 
identical.  The reason is that, in the r* simulations, the real federal f unds rate is held constant over  
the entire 12-quarter period to c lose the output gap at the end  of this timeframe whereas, in the 
Tealbook baseline, the real federal funds rate can vary over ti me.  Distinct paths of real short-term 
rates can, in turn, generate different paths for inflation and economic activity. 
FRB/US  MODEL SIMULATIONS  
The results presented in the exhi bits “Simple Policy Rule Simul ations” and “Optimal 
Control Simulations under Commitment” are derived from dynamic simulations of the FRB/US 
model.  Each simulated policy strategy is assumed to be in forc e over the whole period covered 
by the simulation; this period extends several decades beyond t he time horizon shown in the 
exhibits.  The simulations are  conducted under the assumption that market participants as well as 
price and wage setters have perfect foresight, and are predicat ed on the staff’s extended Tealbook 
projection, which includes the macroeconomic effects of the Com mittee’s large-scale asset 
purchase programs.  When the Tealbook is published early in a q uarter, all of the simulations 
begin in that quarter; when the Tealbook is published late in a quarter, all of the simulations begin 
in the subsequent quarter. 
COMPUTATION OF OPTIMAL CONTROL POLICIES UNDER COMMITMENT  
The optimal control simulations posit that policymakers minimiz e a discounted weighted 
sum of squared inflation gaps (measured as the difference betwe en four-quarter headline PCE 
inflation, ߨ௧௉஼ா, and the Committee’s 2 percen t objective), squared unemploymen t gaps (݌ܽ݃ݑ௧, 
measured as the difference between the unemployment rate and th e staff’s estimate of the natural 
rate), and squared changes in t he federal funds rate.  The resu lting loss function, shown below, 
embeds the assumption that policymakers discount the future usi ng a quarterly discount factor 
ߚ ൌ 0.9963 :

Monetary Policy Strategies section of the June 2016 Tealbook B provides motivations for the four 
specifications of the loss function. 
The first specification, titled “Equal weights,” assigns equal weights to all three 
components at all times.  The second specification, titled “Asy mmetric weight on ugap ,” uses the 
same weights as the equal-weights specification whenever the un employment rate is above the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate but it assigns no penalty to the unemployment rate falling 
below the natural rate.  The third specification, titled “Large  weight on inflation gap,” attaches a 
relatively large weight to inflation gaps.  The fourth specification, titled “Minimal weight on rate 
adjustments,” places almost no weight on changes in the federal funds rate.4  The table below 
shows the weights used in the four specifications.  The optimal control policy and associated 
outcomes depend on the relative (rather than the absolute) valu es of the weights. 
 
For each of these four specifications of the loss function, the optimal control policy is the 
path for the federal funds rate that minimizes the loss function in the FRB/US model, subject to 
the effective lower bound constraint on nominal interest rates,  under the assumption of perfect 
foresight, and conditional on the staff’s extended Tealbook projection.  Policy tools other than the 
federal funds rate are taken as given and subsumed within the T ealbook baseline.  The path 
chosen by policymakers today is assumed to be credible, meaning that decision makers in the 
model see this path as being a binding commitment on future Com mittee decisions; the optimal 
control policy takes as given the initial lagged value of the f ederal funds rate but is otherwise 
unconstrained by policy decisions  made prior to the simulation period.  The discounted losses are 
calculated over a period that ends sufficiently far in the futu re that extending that period farther 
would not affect the policy pr escriptions shown in the exhibits .

 Monetary Policy Alternatives 
At its November meeting, the Com mittee judged that the case for  an increase in 
the federal funds rate had continued to strengthen, but elected , “for the time being,” to 
wait for “some” further evidence  of continued progress toward i ts objectives.  Incoming 
data have supported the view that inflation will rise to 2 perc ent over the medium term, 
and the two job market reports received in the interim indicate d that labor market 
conditions continued to improve:   Payroll gains remained solid,  and the unemployment 
rate declined. 
This month’s meeting presents the Committee with two key decisi ons.  The first 
decision is whether the evidence accumulated since the end of s ummer is sufficient to 
merit an immediate increase in t he target range for the federal funds rate.  The second is 
what signal, if any, to provide r egarding the prospects for fut ure rate increases.    
 With regard to the first decisi on, Alternative B and Alternativ e C both raise the target 
range to ½ to ¾ percent.  In contrast , Alternative A maintains the current target range. 
o Alternatives B and C point to “r ealized and expected labor mark et conditions 
and inflation” as the rationale for raising rates, thereby implying that the 
“progress” previous s tatements had indicated was needed has bee n achieved.  
Alternative A cites “subdued la bor market pressures and below-t arget 
inflation” as sufficient reason to maintain the current stance of policy, thus 
hinting that the Committee might not raise rates until inflatio n climbs to 2 
percent or until greater wage pressures provide evidence of tig ht labor 
markets. 
o Alternatives B and C both emphasi ze that the stance of monetary  policy, after 
the increase in the federal funds  rate, remains sufficiently ac commodative to 
support “some” further strength ening in labor market conditions  and a return 
to 2 percent inflation.  The additi on of the word “some” could be taken as a 
signal that the Committee now sees  less need than before for fu rther 
strengthening in the labor marke t.  The insertion of “some” mig ht also be read 
as suggesting that the gap between the midpoint of the new target range and the current level of the neutral  federal funds rate—the level c onsistent with the 
economy growing at its potential r ate—might not be all that lar ge.

  As for the second decision, the t hree alternatives’ summaries o f the economic outlook 
and future monetary polic y, contained in paragraphs 2 and 4, differ only modestly 
from one another and from the November statement.  
o All three alternatives maintai n the outlook from the November statement that 
economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions 
will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent 
over the medium term.   
o Alternatives A and B continue to s tate that “gradual adjustment s” in the 
federal funds rate are anticipa ted in order to achieve the Comm ittee’s 
objectives and that the expected rise in inflation will reflect  the fading 
influence of past declines in ene rgy and import prices along wi th 
strengthening in labor markets; Alternative C drops the referen ce to past 
declines in energy and import  prices.  In so doin g, Alternative  C might be 
taken as suggesting greater conf idence that these temporary fac tors are 
playing less of a role than before.   
o Alternative C notes t hat “additional” gradual adjustments in th e stance of 
monetary policy will be needed for the Committee to achieve its  objectives, 
which suggests a faster, albeit still gradual, pace of rate increases than do 
Alternatives A and B.   
o All three alternatives retain the  November statement’s characte rizations of 
risks to the economic outlook as being “roughly balanced.”  How ever, 
Alternative C omits the sentenc e indicating that the Committee “continues to 
closely monitor” inflation i ndicators and global economic and f inancial 
developments; this would likely be  taken as a signal that the C ommittee is 
currently less concerned about dow nside risks to the economic o utlook than 
before. 
 Turning to developments in infla tion, described in paragraph 1,  the alternatives differ 
in a few respects. 
o Alternative B says that “infla tion has increased since earlier this year,” 
differing from the November statement by omitting the “somewhat ” qualifier 
that had tempered the “inflati on has increased” phrase.  As in November, 
Alternative B acknowledges that i nflation “is still below the C ommittee’s 
2 percent longer-run objective, part ly reflecting earlier decli nes in energy 
prices and in prices of  non-energy imports.”

 o Alternative C also omits “somewhat” but emphasizes that, with t he recent 
increase, inflation is “moving closer” to the Committee’s objec tive.  With this 
addition, Alternative C suggests gr eater confidence that inflat ion is evolving 
as expected, and so alludes to the  possibility that increases i n the federal funds 
rate might come earlier than marke t participants currently appe ar to expect. 
o The summary of inflation developm ents in Alternative A differs from the 
November statement in two ways: First, it characterizes the sho rtfall of 
inflation from 2 percent as “onl y partly” the result of earlier energy and 
import price declines, hinting t hat inflation is being held back by other factors 
that have more persistent effects; and second, it retains from the November 
statement the modifier “somewhat,” thereby putting less emphasi s on recent 
increases in inflation th an do Alternatives B and C. 
o Alternatives B and C up grade the November statement’s descripti on of 
market-based measures of inflation compensation, stating that t hey have not 
just “moved up,” but have “moved up considerably.”  Alternative  C reinforces 
this message by no longer characteriz ing their levels as “low.”   Alternative  A 
retains the language of the November statement.  
 On the labor market, all three a lternatives state that it has “ continued to strengthen.”  
In this regard, they all speak t o the condition the Committee s et out in November that 
it needed to see “some further evidence of continued progress” toward its objectives 
in order to tighten the stance of policy.   
o Alternatives B and C are succinc t in how they characterize deve lopments in 
labor markets.  Both state that job gains have been “solid” and  add the 
observation that the unemployment rate has declined. 
o Alternative A tempers the a ssessment by noting the “subdued pac e” of wage 
growth in recent months.  
 All three alternatives charact erize economic activity as having  “been expanding at a 
moderate pace since mid-year.” 
 The three alternatives are lar gely the same in describing how t he Committee’s 
outlook is likely to affect its decisions.   
o In paragraph 4, Alternatives A and B continue to call out “the current shortfall 
of inflation from 2 percent” as a factor that warrants special attention, while

 Alternative C delete s this reference.  Alternative A notes, in addition, that the 
Committee’s inflation goal is “symmetric.”   
o Alternatives A and B state, as di d the November statement, that  economic 
conditions are likely to “warrant  only gradual in creases” in th e target range; 
by contrast, Alternative C replace s “only” with “additional,” t hereby 
suggesting  more increases, and perhaps earlier increases, may be forthcoming  
than previously thought.   
  Two of the three altern atives differ from the November statement in their 
characterization of the role that the Committee’s assessment of  risks plays in its 
policy decisions. 
o Alternatives A and C add to para graph 4 a phrase that states th at the 
Committee will assess not only the economic outlook but also “r isks to the 
economic outlook” as it determines the timing and size of futur e adjustments 
to the target range for the fed eral funds rate.  Alternative C tempers that 
message—and differs from the other alternatives—in removing the final 
sentence of paragraph 2 which state s that the Committee is “clo sely 
monitoring” certain developments.  
 Finally, the three Alternatives are unchanged from November in how they describe 
the Committee’s policy concerning reinvestment of maturing secu rities from the 
System Open Market Account.

 NOVEMBER 2016  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in September 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  growth of economic 
activity has picked up from the mo dest pace seen in the first h alf of this year.  
Although the unemployment rate i s little changed i n recent mont hs, job gains have 
been solid.  Household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed 
investment has remained soft.  I nflation has increased somewhat  since earlier this 
year but is still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly 
reflecting earlier declines in e nergy prices and in prices of n on-energy imports.  
Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up b ut remain low; 
most survey-based measures of long er-term inflation expectation s are little changed, 
on balance, in recent months.  
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market co nditions will strengthen somew hat further.  
Inflation is expected to rise t o 2 percent over the medium term  as the transitory 
effects of past declines in ener gy and import prices dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly 
balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation  indicators and global 
economic and financial developments. 
3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the ta rget range for the 
federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ per cent.  The Comm ittee judges that the case for an 
increase in the federal funds rat e has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time 
being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.  
The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby su pporting further 
improvement in labor market c onditions and a return to 2 percen t inflation.   
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run.  H owever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data.   
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Policymakers may view the information received over the interme eting period as 
providing the evidence of continued progress toward the Committ ee’s objectives 
necessary to warrant an increase in the federal funds rate at t he December meeting.  They 
might also see the modal outlook a s not greatly different from what they previously 
thought.  Or policymakers may decide that it is premature to reach or express a judgment 
about the implications of future fiscal and trade policies for their forecasts until they have 
more information about those pol icies.  Accordingly, policymakers may choose for now 
to say little that is new about t he likely future path of the f ederal funds rate. 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Data received over the intermeeti ng period indicate that inflat ion has increased 
relative to its pace earlier this year. 
o The 12-month change in overall P CE prices had been running at r oughly 
1 percent over the first eight m onths of this year but is now e stimated to have 
increased to 1.4 percent over th e 12 months ending in October. 
o Oil prices firmed over the past several months, and with earlie r declines in 
energy prices dropping out of the calculation, consumer energy prices are 
likely to provide a boost to 12-m onth headline PCE inflation in  the fourth 
quarter. 
o Twelve-month core PCE infla tion in October was 1.7 percent, up about a tenth 
from mid-year.   
 Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to move up over the 
intermeeting period.  Over the same period, 5-year, 5-year ahea d inflation 
compensation rose 33 basis point s, an unusually large increase,  and is coming on the 
heels of a 21 basis point increase over the previous intermeeting period.  In addition, the Michigan survey measure of l onger-run infla tion expectation s in November 
returned to the level se en earlier in the year. 
 The two employment reports received since the Committee met in November 
provided evidence that labor mar ket conditions continued to str engthen.   
o Both reports showed further sol id gains in payroll employment.  
o The employment-to-population ra tio and the labor force particip ation rate 
have increased since a year a go—notwithstandin g downward struct ural trends.

 o The unemployment rate decline d to 4.6 percent in November, foll owing a 
lengthy period over which it had changed little.  A broader measure of 
unemployment that includes margin ally attached workers and workers 
employed part time for economic r easons (U-6) also declined in November, 
albeit by less than did the offi cial unemployment rate (U-3).  
o New data for all three measures of  labor compensation that the staff regularly 
monitor—compensation per hour, t he employment cost index, and a verage 
hourly earnings—have been received since the November FOMC meeting.  
Taken together, these series co ntinue to show modest gains in compensation 
over the past year.  However, measures that focus narrowly on w ages and 
salaries, including average hourl y earnings and the Atlanta Fed  Wage Growth 
Tracker, have shown some acceleration recently, albeit from low  levels.1 
 Real GDP growth for the thir d quarter turned out to be markedly  higher than was 
expected when the October Teal book was completed.  However, mos t of the upward 
surprise is attributable to a jump in net exports that staff ex pects to be largely 
reversed in the fourth quarter .  Growth in private domestic final purchases—normally 
thought to be a more reliable ga uge of the underlying state of aggregate demand—
was more moderate, in line wit h what staff wrote down in Octobe r.  
o Looking ahead, staff expects continued moderate consumption growth during the first half of next year in part because household income an d employment 
have continued to grow at solid rates, indicators of consumer s entiment 
climbed further, and financial c onditions have stayed broadly supportive.  In 
the second half of the year, rea l PCE is expected to accelerate  in response to 
the assumed fiscal stimulus. 
o Business fixed investment, after  declining notably in the first half of the year, 
finally shows signs of picking up i n the third quarter and appe ars to be on 
track to make a small positive contribution to GDP growth in the fourth 
quarter.

  Looking out to the medium term, the Congress seems likely to en act a package of tax 
and government spending programs that  will provide some fiscal stimulus, but no 
specific aspects of such a package are known at this time.2 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers might judge that they have accumulated sufficient further evidence of 
continued progress toward maxim um employment and 2 percent infl ation, and that an 
increase in the target range for the feder al funds rate is therefore appropriate.  They 
might also continue to expect that the pace of further increase s in the target range will 
be gradual.   
o Leading up to the November meeting, policymakers had little new  hard 
information, relative to Septe mber, to chalk up as “further evidence” of 
“continued progress” toward their goals.  Only one new employme nt report 
was available.  For the December meeting, policymakers have two  more solid 
employment reports and tangibl e evidence of firming inflation.  
o Given the uncertainty about the timing, size, and composition of prospective 
changes in fiscal policy, policymakers may consider it premature to 
communicate that they see an apprec iable change in their modal economic 
outlook, or in the associated path of  the federal funds rate th at would be 
consistent with achieving their  statutory goals.  Or, even if t hey judge that the 
appropriate path for the feder al funds rate has steepened, part icipants may still 
see the pace of likely rate increases as gradual by historical standards.  To the 
extent this is so, they may see  paragraphs 2 and 4 of Alternati ve B, which are 
unchanged from the November state ment, as appropriately preserv ing the 
Committee’s flexibility going forward.    
 Federal funds futures quotes imp ly that market participants regard a rate hike at this 
meeting as highly likely, and res ponses to the Desk’s latest su rveys suggest that 
dealers concur in this assessment.3  Thus, the change in the stance of policy

Tealbook forecast a cu t in personal income taxes amounting to 1  percent of GDP, beginning in the third 
quarter of 2017.  A m emo circulated recentl y to participants pr ovides details.  See, B yron Lutz and William

“Risks and Uncertainties” section of Tealbook A for an analysis  of the implications of a fiscal stimulus 
program that is larger than the baseline assumption, as well as  the implications of no program at all.

  Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Over the intermeeting  period, market participants  became increasingly  convinced  
about a rate increase  at the December  FOMC meeting.   The market ‐implied probability  
of a December rate hike  now stands at 90 percent  (figure 1).  Results from the Desk’s 
December  Survey of  Primary Dealers showed a similar conviction  among survey 
respondents  (figure 2).   
Looking ahea d, investors  seem to recognize  that the economy  and the federal funds  
rate could  evolve in a variety of  ways over  the coming year.  For  example,  the 
probability  distribution  of the federal funds  rate at the end  of 2017 implied by quotes 
on Eurodollar  futures options (figure 3) shifted to the right but still attaches  
considerable odds to a wide  range of  outcomes.  The distribution  from the December  
Desk survey (figure 4) is somewhat less dispersed.  
The federal funds  rate path  implied by a straight read of OIS quotes  (the black lines in 
figure 5) steepened  noticeably  following  the outcom e of the U.S. elections.    If term 
premiums are  zero, these  market‐implied forward rates  would imply fewer than 2 
hikes (of 25 basis points each) in 2017 and 2 hikes in 2018 and  with the target policy  
rate not reaching  2 percent until the end of 2020.  However, results  from the staff’s 
OIS‐based term structure  model, which  takes the effective  lower  bound into account,  
suggest that OIS rates  beyond six months  likely contain negative  term premiums.   The 
expected  federal funds  rate path adjusted  for those term  premiums  (the light blue  
line in figure 5) points to a  somewhat  faster expected  pace of tightening  of about 3 
hikes in both 2017 and 2018, and  reaches 3 percent  by the end of 2020.  As shown in  
figure 6, the model‐ based path (the light blue line) lies above the  modal federal funds  
rate path from  the primary dealer survey  (the brown line) but is  roughly consistent  
with the staff’s baseline path in the December  Tealbook  (the dark blue line).    
Results from the model and  the survey also shed light on market participants’  
expectations  of the longer‐run level of  the federal funds  rate (the dots  in figure 6).  
The staff’s  term structure  model estimates  that the federal funds  rate will reach  about 
3¾ percent in the longer run, in line with  the longer‐term average of the target funds  
rate in the staff’s December  baseline projection  but 1 percentage point higher  than 
the median estimate  of the longer ‐run federal  funds rate  from the primary dealer 
survey.   
The Desk’s December  survey also asked  primary dealers about their assessment  of the 
current level  of the neutral real federal funds  rate, as well as the levels at the end  of 
the next three years.  Compared  with the November  survey, the  median estimates  of 
the current level and the level at the en d of 2019 were revised down  by 25 basis points 
each to 0 and  1 percent,  respectively, while  the levels for the end  of 2017 and 2018 
were little changed  at ¾ and 1 percent,  respectively  (not shown).

 announced in Alternative B would be completely in line with the  expectations of 
financial market participants.   
o The market-implied path for the  federal funds rate shifted up b y 26 and 55 
basis points at year-end 2017 a nd year-end 2018, respectively, and now points 
to a level of the federal f unds rate at the end of 2018 of about 1.4 percent.  The 
modal path for the funds rate of  the median dealer also steepened:  Dealers 
now expect three 25-basis-point r ate hikes in 2018 and two in 2 019, one more 
in each year than was the case in November; at two rate hikes, expectations 
for 2017 are unchanged.  Thus, the market expectation for the f ederal funds 
rate has moved notably closer t o the median of the dealers’ sur vey.   
o Survey respondents were asked f or estimates of the probability distribution of 
10-year Treasury rates in the future.  They expected the recent  increase in 
Treasury yields of about ½ percen tage point to persist for some  time.  Dealers 
cited expectations of a more accommodative fiscal policy stance  as playing a 
major role in the changes to the ir forecasts for the federal fu nds rate and yields 
on Treasury securities. 
o Nonetheless, the Survey of Prima ry Dealers reveals that dealers  do not expect 
significant changes to statement  language regarding the future of monetary 
policy.  The near-absence of a change in language in the forward-looking 
portions of Alternative B woul d likely be greeted placidly.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Policymakers may judge not only that the evidence accumulated s ince the November 
meeting is sufficient to warrant an immediate increase in the target range for the federal 
funds rate, they might also regard it as prudent for the Committee’s statement to include 
language signaling that the feder al funds rate may rise somewha t more quickly than 
previously expected, tho ugh still at a gradual pace.  
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The staff expects that 12-mont h overall PCE inflation will be 1 .7 percent in 
December and will step up further in subsequent months, reachin g 2 percent in March 
2017.  And while the staff expects PCE inflation to edge down after March, the U.S. 
                                                            
likelihood of a rate increase at  the December FOMC meeting.  Th e box also notes that the new model-
implied levels of expected future federal funds rates are highe r than the more familiar market-implied 
estimates.

 economy has not experienced a perio d of excess demand for some time; inflation 
could well come in above 2 percent in the not-to-distant future .   
o Oil prices increased significan tly since mid-year, and the Nove mber 30 
agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producing countries to reduce 
production suggests that at leas t some portion of the increase might be 
sustained over time.   
o With rising prices of energy and a lower unemployment rate, som e 
policymakers may anticipate th at 12-month headline inflation will run above 2 
percent relatively soon, and they may see the effects of earlie r declines in 
energy and import prices as having largely run their course. 
o Twelve-month core PCE infla tion in October was 1.7 percent, not  very far 
from the Committee’s 2 percen t objective, and staff projects th at the 12-month 
core PCE inflation rate will remain near the current rate throu gh March, 
before gradually moving higher. 
 Indicators of expected future inflation are on the rise.  
o Estimates of 5-year, 5-year ah ead expected inflation based on B oard term 
structure models increased a round 10 basis points over the inte rmeeting 
period; inflation compensati on, measured on the same basis, inc reased 
33 basis points, bringing the total  increase since its low in June to 64 basis 
points.  The staff’s estimate of five-year inflation compensation also moved 
up appreciably over the intermeeting period. 
o A straight read of quotes for inflation caps suggests that, ove r the intermeeting 
period, market participants marked up noticeably their assessme nt of the 
probability that headline CPI inflation over the next five year s will run 
somewhat above 2 percent.  Rising inflation compensation appear s to be 
driven in part by increased cost  of protection against above-ta rget inflation 
outcomes. 
 The two employment reports relea sed since the Committee last me t in November 
were notably uniform in the furt her progress th ey portrayed in labor markets, with 
solid job gains and reductions i n the U-3 unemployment rate as well as broader 
measures of unemployment and underemployment.   
 Taking a somewhat longer-term perspective, job gains have been consistently solid 
from June through November.

 o Policymakers may see the ¼ percentage point increases over the past year in 
the employment-to-population ra tio and labor force participatio n rate—despite 
their downward structural trends—as supporting a view that labo r utilization 
has continued to increase. 
o The U-3 measure of unemployment is now at its lowest level since the onset 
of the Great Recession.  
 A variety of measures of labor m arket tightness have been running near or above pre-
crisis levels; these include the job openings rate and the quit s rate.  And initial claims 
for unemployment insurance have for some time been below levels  seen around 
recent business cycle peaks. 
o While the three primary measures of labor compensation suggest only 
moderate wage growth, the Wage  Growth Tracker constructed by th e Federal 
Reserve Bank of Atlanta, has for some time shown a more marked 
acceleration.4 
 Growth in real GDP in the thir d quarter was nearly a percentage  point higher than 
projected in October, and the underprediction in  real gross dom estic income was even 
larger.  And while the miss in GDP  was largely a result of a tr ansitory boom in net 
exports, with the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment  having climbed 
markedly in November and the Confidence Board confidence index reaching its 
highest level since the recessi on, participants may see some up side risk in the outlook 
for real PCE and hence GDP.   
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that cu rrent conditions and the outlook warrant an increase 
in the target range for the fed eral funds rate of 25 basis points at this meeting.  They 
may also judge, and wish to communicate, that additional gradual increases are likely 
in the not-too-distant future. 
o Some policymakers may favor re ducing accommodation at this meet ing and 
may see a need for several addit ional gradual increases in the federal funds 
rate over the coming year, in part  to lower the risk that polic y may need to be 
tightened rapidly in the futu re, possibly cutting short the exp ansion.  
                                                            
4 The box “Measures of Labor Compensation,” which appears in the current Tealbook A, 
discusses, among other things, t he construction of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth 
Tracker and how it differs from the other measures that staff m onitor.

 Policymakers may be concerned that reducing policy accommodatio n too 
slowly could lead to substantia l undershooting of the longer-ru n normal 
unemployment rate, and they may b e skeptical that such undersho oting can be 
unwound smoothly. 
o These policymakers might emphasize that several measures of wage growth 
have increased in recent years , even as productivity growth has  remained low.  
They might anticipate that, if la bor market tightening leads to  additional 
acceleration of wages without a pickup in productivity growth, inflation 
would rise, requiring a higher policy rate. 
o Policymakers might also be worried  that maintaining the federal  funds rate at 
its current low level, or raising it too slowly, w ill lead to e xcessive risk-taking 
in financial markets that could e ventually endanger financial s tability. 
o Policymakers may judge that, eve n after a 25 basis point increase, the stance 
of monetary policy would remain overly accommodative; they migh t note that 
the real federal funds rate would still lie below the prescript ions from a wide 
range of policy frameworks—includ ing most simple policy rules a nd optimal 
control exercises shown in the “ Monetary Policy Strategies” sec tion of 
Tealbook B.  Policymakers also might note that the simple rules  reported in 
Tealbook B call for an increase i n the federal funds rate even when taking into 
account a substantial decline (rela tive to the pre-crisis perio d) in the 
longer-run equilibrium level of the federal funds rate. 
 The prospect of sizable fiscal  policy stimulus presents another  risk that is novel by 
recent experience. 
o Staff has included a moderate-si zed tax cut within the Tealbook  forecast, but 
the actual fiscal pack age could turn out to be much larger.  Ac cordingly, some 
participants might worry about an outcome such as the “Larger F iscal 
Stimulus” alternative scenar io in Tealbook A.  Regardless of its size, some 
additional fiscal stimulus appears likely, and its  effects are likely to be felt at a 
time of significant undershooting of the unemployment rate, whi ch could 
present higher-than-normal risks to inflation or financial stab ility.  
 On average, respondents to the D esk’s latest surveys put the pr obability that the 
Committee will increase the target range at this meeting at abo ut 90 percent.  Federal 
funds futures also imply that the perceived likelihood of a rat e hike at this meeting is 
very high.  It follows that the por tion of a statement like Alternative C that raises the

 target range for the federal  funds rate by 25 basis points woul d not surprise the 
market.  The question is how change s in the statement that speak to future changes in 
the stance of policy would be interpreted. 
o The inclusion of the word “additional” before “gradual increase s in the federal 
funds rate” might be taken as s uggesting that further increases  in the target 
range will come sooner than market participants would have othe rwise 
expected—indeed, that is the intent.  To the extent this is so,  medium- and 
longer-term real interest rates would likely rise, equity price s and inflation 
compensation would decline, and th e dollar would appreciate.  H owever, if 
Alternative C were taken as an expression of optimism about the  underlying 
forces driving the economy, the m arket responses could be diffe rent. 
o As noted in the accompanying box , “Monetary Policy Expectations and 
Uncertainty,”  investors seem to recognize that  the economy and the funds rate  
could evolve in a variety of ways over the coming year.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Policymakers might view informa tion received since the November FOMC as indicating 
not only that further progress is  being made in labor markets b ut also that there remain 
opportunities for further improveme nt in labor market outcomes.   In light of how long 
inflation has been running below  2 percent, they might elect to  defer an increase in the 
federal funds rate.  Rather, they may emphasize the importance of having inflation be 
close to 2 percent in order to confirm that 2 percent is not a ceiling for inflation in the 
minds of Committee members.  These policymakers might see risk management 
considerations as reinforcing the case against reducing accommo dation immediately. 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 GDP growth in the third quarter came in unexpectedly strong, bu t growth in private 
domestic final purchases—a measure commonly considered to be mo re representative 
of underlying demand conditions than is GDP—slowed and was only  moderate.   
o Recent readings on consumer spe nding suggest that output may grow more 
slowly in the near term than policymakers may have been expecti ng.   
o Residential investment in the t hird quarter continued to shrink, and business 
investment is increasing only mode stly after notable declines e arlier this year. 
Alternatives

The November employment situat ion report showed solid job gains and a surprisingly
large drop in the unemployment ra te, but also a  disappointing decline in average
hourly earnings that could be taken as indicating that labor ma rket pressures are
subdued.  In addition, the labor for ce participation rate slipp ed and the average work
week was flat.
Core inflation rates are higher now than they were earlier in t he year, but no higher
than had been expected.
oSurvey measures of longer-run in flation expectations and readin gs on longer-
term inflation compensation, while higher than they once were, are still low
by historical standards.  Policym akers may be concerned that if  forecasts of a
pickup in inflation prove too optimistic, longer-run inflation expectations
could decrease.  If this were t o occur now, after a lengthy period of
underperformance on inflation, the Committee’s reputation could  suffer.
oWhile 5-year, 5-year ahead inflation compensation rose 33 basis points over
the intermeeting period, at 2.0 percent, it remains at a low level by historical
standards, and is lower still wh en recast in terms of PCE infla tion.
Policymakers may still assess the risks to the economic outlook  as tilted to the
downside—especially over the me dium term—in part because advers e developments
abroad could lead to tightening g lobal financial conditions and  decreased demand for
U.S. exports.
oThe Brexit process could lead t o financial stress in Europe and  beyond if
negotiations are esp ecially contentious.
oThe growing populist movement in Europe, coming as it does during a periodwhere several key elections a re looming, presents a risk. The outcome of the
constitutional referendum in Ita ly and the ensuing resignation of President
Renzi also represents a source of downside risk.
oThe divergence between the monetary policy outlook in the Unite d States and
many major economies suggests the possibility of additional upw ard pressure
on the exchange value of the U.S. dollar, as well as financial stresses in
emerging market economies.
Policy Strategy
 
Policymakers might judge that labor market conditions are stren gthening only slowly
and that significant r oom remains for labor market improvement.  They might take

comfort from the fact that recen t increases in inflation were c lose to expectations and 
therefore regard labor market pressures as subdued.  If so, pol icymakers might want 
to communicate that an increase in the federal funds rate is not yet warranted, and that 
it would be appropriate to wait fo r further progress toward max imum employment 
and 2 percent inflation.  
oPolicymakers might also judge that inflation dynamics in recent  decades
demonstrate that the Phillips cu rve is fairly flat, implying th at greater resource
utilization will have only a muted effect on inflation.
oWith inflation remaining below the Committee’s 2 percent objective and the
Phillips curve as flat as it a ppears to be, policymakers might conclude that
further strengthening in the la bor market is appropriate in ord er to assure that
inflation returns to 2 per cent in a timely fashion.
oIn addition, policymakers might judge that the ne utral rate of interest is low,
relative to its longer-run level , due to restraint on U.S. econ omic activity from
economic and financial developm ents abroad, meager productivity  growth, or
borrowing conditions that remain tight for some households.  Th ey may see
such headwinds as unlikely to subside in the near term.
oSome policymakers may see benefi ts—not just risks—associated wi th some
undershooting of unemployment.  For example, policymakers might judgethat a tight labor market could have persistent positive effect s on the
productive capacity of the economy.
Additionally, noting that longer-term interest rates, the exchange value of the dollar,
and equity prices, have all risen appreciably since the Committ ee last met,
policymakers might conclude tha t, on balance, financial conditions have tightened
and that no further actions or sta tements that might tighten th ose condition further are
necessary.
oThese policymakers might argue that there may be some merit to waiting to
see how financial markets and the real economy respond to the e xtant
tightening in conditions before considering further policy acti ons.
In recognition of the asymmetric risks noted above, policymakers might regard it asprudent risk management to maintai n the current target range fo r the federal funds
rate for the time being.

Some policymakers might regard t he prospects for fiscal stimulu s as still highly
uncertain, and might therefore think that the optimism that has  been built into asset
prices over the last few weeks is overdone.
oAny fiscal package could turn out to be smaller, perhaps because of concerns
about budget deficits, and therefo re disappoint market expectat ions.  Or the
fiscal package could turn out to be dominated by corporate tax cuts which
have much smaller fiscal multipliers than do personal income ta x cuts.  It is
also possible that the Congress will be unable to come to any a greement.
Thus, some participants might regard as likely an outcome such as “No Fiscal
Stimulus” alternativ e scenario in Tealbook A.
Federal funds futures quotes sugge st that market participants s ee a very high
probability of a rate hike at this meeting.  A postmeeting stat ement like Alternative A,
which suggests that a near-ter m increase is unlikely, would the refore be very
surprising to financial market participants.
oInvestors would likely push furth er into the future the expecte d date of the
next rate increase, and the expected path for the federal funds rate wouldlikely flatten, putting downward pressure on longer-term yields .
oIf the statement is primarily seen as more accommodative, equit y prices and
inflation compensation would lik ely rise, and the dollar would depreciate.
oConversely, if investors interpre t the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly
downbeat assessment of economic conditions and greater-than-ant icipated
concerns about the downside risk s to the outlook, equity prices and inflation
compensation could fall.

If the Committee decides to raise the target range for the fede ral funds rate, an 
implementation note that communicat es the changes the Federal R eserve decided to make 
to its administered rates—the interest rates on required and ex cess reserves, the offering

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet, and of 
key elements of the associated income statement, under a baseli ne scenario for the paths 
of monetary policy and longe r-term interest rates.1  In the analysis below, we have 
extended the projection peri od through 2030 from the 2025 projection period reported in 
previous Tealbooks. 
 The “December Tealbook baseline” s cenario is consistent with the monetary policy 
assumptions incorporated in the s taff’s baseline forecast prese nted in Tealbook A.  In 
this scenario, interest rates ar e higher than those in the Octo ber Tealbook, with the 
federal funds rate projected to rise to nearly 4 percent at the  end of 2021, before 
moving down to about 3 percent by the end of the projection per iod.  Longer-term 
interest rates follow a simila r pattern, reaching peak levels b y 2022 before declining 
somewhat through the remainde r of the projection period. 
Compared with the baseline projection in October, higher intere st rate paths result in a 
slightly slower pace of MBS prep ayments and therefore higher MB S holdings throughout 
the projection period.  Together, th e higher rate paths and the larger MBS holdings result 
in smaller unrealized gains on the  SOMA portfolio early in the projection period, and 
larger unrealized losse s in later years.  
The key policy assumptions associated with the projections are highlighted below. 
 Reinvestment policy:   We continue to assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of maturing Treas ury securities and agency debt a s well as principal 
received on agency MBS when the target range for the federal fu nds rate reaches 
1¼ to 1½ percent.  As in the previo us Tealbook, reinvestments a re expected to cease 
during the third quarter of 2017 based on thi s criterion.  Once reinvestments cease, 
the SOMA portfolio shrinks thr ough redemptions of maturing Trea sury and agency 
                                                 
1 In this scenario, the response o f the federal funds rate to de viations of the endogenous variables 
from their baseline values is determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) policy rule.

debt securities as well as paydow ns of principal on agency MBS until reserve 
balances reach their assumed longer-run level of $100 billion. 
 Use of policy normalization tools:   We continue to assume that take-up of overnight 
reverse repurchase agreement s (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion th rough the end of 
2018, before declining to zero by the end of 2019, and that term deposits (the TDF) 
and term RRPs are not used.2 
Other features of these scen arios are described below. 
 Balance sheet.   Under the baseline scenario, th e size of the portfolio is normalized in 
the first quarter of 2022, one quarter later than projected in the October Tealbook (see 
the solid black lines in the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows).
3  The projected timing of the normalization of the 
size of the balance sheet occurs later in this Tealbook because  of the slower wind-
down of MBS holdings that results from the higher path of mortg age rates.  At the 
time of normalization, total assets  are projected to stand at r oughly $2.4 trillion, with 
about $2.3 trillion in total SOMA  securities holdings.  Total a ssets and SOMA 
Treasury holdings rise thereafte r, keeping pace with the increa ses in Federal Reserve 
notes in circulation and Fede ral Reserve Bank capital.  
 Federal Reserve remittances.   Under the baseline scenario, annual remittances are 
projected to decline fr om $98 billion in 2015 to about $93 bill ion this year (see the 
solid black lines in the “Income Projections” exhibit).4  The step-down primarily 
reflects increased interest expe nse on reserves resulting from the FOMC’s decision to 
                                                 
2 Use of term RRPs or term deposits would result in a shift in t he composition of Federal Reserve 
liabilities—a decline in reserve b alances and an equal increase  in term RRPs or term deposits—but would 
not produce a change in the over all size of the balance sheet.  Separately, we assume that RRPs associated 
with foreign official and international accounts remain near th eir October 31, 2016 level of $247 billion 
throughout the projection period. 
3 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend; this trend is determined largely by cu rrency in circulation and 
the assumed long-run level of re serve balances.  The projected timing of the normalization of the size of the 
balance sheet depends importantly  on the level of reserve balances deemed necessary to conduct monetary 
policy.  Currently, we assume that level of reserve balances to  be $100 billion; howev er, policymakers’ 
choice of a long-run operating framework, as well as ongoing re gulatory and structural changes, could 
result in a higher long-run level  of reserve balances.  In turn , a higher long-run level of reserve balances 
would, all else equal, imply an earlier normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet.   
4 Earnings remittances for 2015 exclude a one-time transfer of $19 billion in Federal Reserve 
surplus associated with the FAST Act.

increase the target range for the federal funds rate, and thus the IOER rate, in 
December 2015.5  Annual remittances are projected to continue to decline throu gh 
2020 as the size of the SOMA portf olio falls and the target ran ge for the federal funds 
rate increases, reaching a low of roughly $36 billion.  Thereaf ter, remittances 
gradually increase as higher-yie lding Treasury securities are a dded to the SOMA 
portfolio.  No deferred asset is projected.6   
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of about $260 billion at the end of Se ptember.7  Preliminary 
staff estimates show that the net unrealized gain position fell  to about $121 billion by 
the end of November as a result of  the rise in interest rates.  Going forward, the net 
unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio will depend i mportantly on the path of 
longer-term interest rates.  Because of the rise in longer-term  interest rates assumed 
over the next several years in the baseline scenario, the portf olio is projected to shift 
to an unrealized loss positi on in the third quarter of 2017, on e year earlier than the 
October Tealbook baseline.  In partic ular, the portfolio is exp ected to record a peak 
unrealized loss of approxi mately $212 billion in 2019, about $7 7 billion of which is 
attributable to holdings of Tr easury securitie s and $135 billio n to holdings of agency 
MBS.  The unrealized loss posit ion then narrows through 2030, a s the value of 
securities previously acquired unde r the large-scale asset purchase programs return to 
par as they approach maturity a nd new securities are added to the portfolio at 
prevailing market yields. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” the Feder al Reserve’s elevated holdings o f longer-term 
securities are estimated to be de pressing the term premium embe dded in the 10-year 
nominal Treasury yield by 91 basis points in the current quarte r.  The estimated term 
premium effect depends importan tly on the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet over coming years relative to a benchmark counterfactual projection for 
                                                 
5 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balance s will average 12.5 basis points 
above the effective federal funds rate and the offering rate on ON RRPs will average 12.5 basis points 
below the effective federal funds rate.  The effective federal funds rate has averaged 41 basis points over 
the intermeeting period. 
6 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury. 
7 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

the balance sheet that excludes the effects of asset purchases.  Over time, the term 
premium effect gradually fades a s the projected path of the bal ance sheet converges 
to the benchmark path.  Until 2022, the estimated TPE path in t he current Tealbook is 
more negative than in the Octobe r baseline scenario, primarily because of the larger 
SOMA portfolio holdings as a resu lt of larger MBS balances.  Th ereafter, the 
December Tealbook baseline reports an even more negative term premium effect 
relative to the Octobe r baseline.  This additional widening is related to the extension 
of the projection period in this Tealbook, and reflects the assumptions made in 
modeling the SOMA portfolio in t he years beyond t he previous forecast period. 
 SOMA characteristics.  Regarding the size of the  portfolio, approximately 
$216 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings have already matured or will mature this 
year, and a total of nearly $1.5 t rillion will mature between 2 016 and 2020 (see the 
top panel of the exhibit “Projec tions for the Characteristics o f SOMA Holdings”).8  
The amount of Treasury securiti es maturing each month will vary  considerably over 
time, while projected MBS paydowns  vary less.  Realized MBS pay downs will reflect 
the evolution of interest rates and other factors and thus coul d be significantly more 
volatile than projected.9 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6½ years (see the middle panel  of the exhibit).  The weighted-a verage duration is 
projected to decline slightly next year, as the securities in t he portfolio approach 
maturity, and to subsequently rise until the size of the balanc e sheet is normalized in 
early 2022.10  After reaching its peak, duration is projected to resume its decline as 
the Desk resumes open market purchases of Treasury securities t o keep pace with the 
increase in currency and Federa l Reserve Bank capital.  The dur ation contour in this 
                                                 
8 Under the FOMC’s current reinvestment policy, the Desk replace s maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
face value of holdings maturing on the issue date of newly issu ed securities.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are p laced as noncompetitive tenders and are treated by Treasury as add-ons to 
announced auction sizes. 
9 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $24 billion of maturing Treasury securities 
and is expected to purchase a to tal of $52 billion of 15- and 3 0-year agency MBS under the reinvestment 
program. 
10 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 a s the pace of roll-offs accelerates  and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o, causing duration to increase until the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized.

latter portion of the projecti on is based on the key assumption  that the Federal 
Reserve will buy only Treasury bills until those holdings are equal to approximately 
30 percent of the Treasury portfo lio, similar to the pre-crisis  composition of the
