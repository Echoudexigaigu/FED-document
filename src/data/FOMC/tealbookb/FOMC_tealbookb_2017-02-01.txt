Data received since the Committee’s meeting in December indicat e that the 
economy continues to expand at a moderate pace and that inflati on is increasing toward 
the FOMC’s 2 percent objective .  The key question for the Commi ttee now is whether the 
funds rate path suggested by the D ecember FOMC statement and SE P remains 
appropriate or whether the economic outlook and associated risks warrant signaling a 
somewhat different path of rate hikes. 
 All three draft statements characterize recent economic activit y as having continued 
to expand at a moderate pace, with solid job gains and the unemployment rate near its 
recent low.  Alternatives B and C  also acknowledge the recent increase in consumer 
and business sentiment.  The description of the medium-term out look for economic 
activity in all three Alternatives  is unchanged from the Decemb er FOMC statement. 
 The three Alternatives no longer reference the transitory effec ts of earlier declines in 
energy and non-energy import pric es when describing recent infl ation data and the 
medium-term outlook for inflation.  In their characterization o f recent data, the 
Alternatives differ in the rela tive weight they place on change s in, and the level of, 
inflation. 
o Alternative A emphasizes that inflation remains below the 2 percent objective, 
while Alternative B places sligh tly more weight on the fact tha t inflation 
increased over the second half  of 2016.  Alternative C highlights only the 
recent upward trend in inflation. 
o Alternatives A and B characterize market-based measures of infl ation 
compensation as remaining low, while Alternative C emphasizes t hat those 
measures were unchanged.  All thre e Alternatives note that surv ey-based 
measures of expected inflation are little changed. 
o In describing the medium-te rm outlook for inflation, only Alter native A 
retains the reference from the  December statement that points t o continued 
strengthening of the labor marke t as directly contributing to i nflation rising 
toward 2 percent.  Alternative A can be interpreted as suggesti ng that the 
Committee sees a further strengthening of the labor market as a n important 
reason for expecting inflation t o rise, while Alternatives B an d C are

 noncommittal about the relationship between prospective movemen ts in 
inflation and labor market conditions. 
 Alternatives A and B maintain the  current target range for the federal funds rate, 
while Alternative C raises the target range to ¾ to 1 percent.  Alternatives A and B 
repeat language from earlier st atements indicating that the sta nce of monetary policy 
“remains accommodative.”  Alternative C characterizes the stanc e of monetary policy 
after the rate hike, as “moderately accommodative.” 
o Except for the policy action itself, paragra phs 3 and 4 of Alte rnative B 
maintain the language from the December 2016 FOMC statement, co nsistent 
with the view that the econom y has evolved roughly in line with  expectations 
and that no change in the guidan ce about future policy is warra nted. 
o Alternative C deletes the refere nce to the “shortfall of inflat ion from 
2 percent” when outlining the prospe cts for future increases in the federal 
funds rate.  This deletion, combi ned with the removal of “only”  in describing 
gradual rate increases, likel y would be read as suggesting a le ss gradual 
expected pace of rate increases t han the language  of the curren t statement and 
Alternative B. 
o Alternative A signals a more patient approach to future rate increases.  It 
emphasizes that the Committee is  “waiting for evidence of further progress 
toward its employment and inf lation objectives.”  Paragraph 4 o f Alternative 
A cites “risks to the economic  outlook” as an explicit additional consideration 
when determining future changes to the stance of monetary polic y, which, 
under current circumstances, underscores a more cautious pace o f rate 
increases than outlined in Altern atives B and C.  A lternative A  notes, in 
addition, that the Committee’s inflation goal is “symmetric.” 
 None of the Alternatives change the description of the Committe e’s policy 
concerning reinvestment of maturi ng securities from the System Open Market 
Account.

 DECEMBER 2016  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in November 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic activity 
has been expanding at a moderate pace since mid-year. Job gains  have been solid in 
recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. Household  spending has been 
rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained so ft. Inflation has 
increased since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-
run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy pri ces and in prices of non-
energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation  have moved up 
considerably but still are low; most survey-based measures of l onger-term inflation 
expectations are little change d, on balance, in recent months.  
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, wit h gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market co nditions will strengthen somew hat further. 
Inflation is expected to rise t o 2 percent over the medium term  as the transitory 
effects of past declines in ener gy and import prices dissipate and the labor market 
strengthens further. Near-term risks to the economic outlook ap pear roughly 
balanced. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global 
economic and financial developments.  
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 
percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, t hereby supporting 
some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a ret urn to 2 percent 
inflation.  
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation. 
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments. In light of the 
current shortfall of inflation f rom 2 percent, the Committee wi ll carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress towa rd its inflation goal. The Com mittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run. Ho wever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data.  
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the  level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way. T his policy, by keeping the Commi ttee's holdings of

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Spending data received during the  intermeeting period largely c onfirmed earlier 
assessments of economic activ ity during the second half of 2016 , leaving the outlook 
for economic growth over the medium term virtually unchanged. 
 The incoming data suggested that th e labor market continued to tighten gradually, 
with nonfarm payroll employment now estimated to have increased  an average of 
165,000 per month over the three months through December.  The unemployment 
rate, at 4.7 percent in December, remained near its recent low.  
 On a 12-month basis, total PCE pric e inflation continued to ris e toward the FOMC’s 
2 percent objective, while core PCE price inflation has stayed around 1.7 percent 
since the middle of 2016. 
 Recent data do not indicate a material shift in longer-term inflation expectations.  In 
the Michigan Survey of Consumers, median inflation expectations  over the next 5 to 
10 years dropped to a historical low of 2.3 percent in December  and then rebounded 
to 2.5 percent in the January pre liminary report.  The TIPS-bas ed measure of 5-to-10-
year-forward inflation compensa tion, which had increased notabl y to 2 percent in the 
last few months of 2016 (returning to the level  seen during the  first half of 2015), is 
little changed from the time o f the December FOMC meeting.  
 Consumer and business sentiment recently have improved.  These higher levels of 
sentiment may presage a pickup i n spending later this year, or they may reflect 
transitory election-related shifts that ultimately will have li ttle effect on spending.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may view the information received over the interme eting period as 
largely consistent with their exp ectations as of the time of th e December FOMC 
meeting.  Moreover, policymakers m ay decide that it is premature to reach or express 
a judgment about the implicati ons for the outlook of potential fiscal and other 
economic policies, or of recent changes in consumer and busines s sentiment.  
Accordingly, policymakers may choose to leave unchanged, for now, both the target range for the federal funds rate and their communications about the likely future path 
of that rate. 
Alternatives

  Even if they judge that a somewh at steeper federal funds rate p ath is appropriate, 
policymakers may still see the pace of likely rate increases as  “gradual” by historical 
standards.  To the extent this is so, they may see paragraph 4 of Alternative B, which 
is unchanged from the December statement, as appropriately pres erving the 
Committee’s flexibility going forward. 
 A decision to maintain the curren t target range for the federal funds rate would be in 
line with the expectations of fin ancial market participants.  A s shown in figure 1 of 
the box “Monetary Policy Expectat ions and Uncertainty,” financi al market quotes 
embed a negligible probability that the Committee will alter th e target range at this 
meeting.  Reponses to the Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Deale rs point to a similar 
assessment—see figure 2 in the box .  Moreover, maintaining the current language 
about the prospects for future r ate hikes also would be consist ent with the 
expectations of respondents to the Desk’s survey. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Recent spending data confirmed the step-up in growth of private  domestic final 
purchases, a measure that exclu des some volatile components of GDP, in the second 
half of 2016.  Moreover, the substantial recent increases in co nsumer and business 
sentiment may support a view that the upside risks to the outlook for household 
spending and business investment in 2017 have risen. 
 The labor market continues to strengthen, with the December emp loyment report 
pointing to a labor market near o r at full employment:  The une mployment rate is at 
or below most participants’ es timates of its longer-run normal level and below the 
staff’s estimate of the natural rate, while the employment-to-population ratio is 
currently a little above the sta ff’s estimate of its structural  trend.  Data on labor 
compensation, including the recen t acceleration in average hour ly earnings, are also 
indicative of a tightening labor market. 
 Twelve-month headline PCE infla tion has continued to rise towar d the FOMC’s 
2 percent objective in recent qua rters.  With consumer energy p rices likely to rise 
further, policymakers may anticip ate that 12-month headline inf lation will run above 
2 percent relatively soon.

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Market participants’  perceptions  of the probabilities  that the next increase in the 
target range for the federal  funds rate will occur  at the upcoming  FOMC meeting,  at 
the March meeting,  or later, are  about the same now as they were at the  time of the 
December  meeting (figure 1).  The market ‐implied probability  of the next rate hike 
occurring  at the upcoming  meeting is neglible,  but the market ‐implied probability  of 
the next hike occurring  at the March FOMC  meeting stands at about  30 percent.   The 
Desk’s January Survey of Primary Dealers showed roughly similar results  (figure 2). 
Looking ahead, the probability  distributi on of the federal funds  rate at the  end of 2017 
implied by quotes on Eurodollar  futures options (figure 3) shifted to the right a bit,  
but is still quite  diffuse.  The distribution  from the January Desk survey (figure 4) is 
somewhat  less diffuse  and attaches notably smaller probabilities  to interest rate 
outcomes  at or below 1 percent.   The larger  odds on lower‐ rate outcomes  implied by 
options compared  with those  from surveys may reflect investors’  perception that  
future adverse economic  scenarios  are likely associated  with lower rates.  Risk‐ averse 
investors  would be willing to pay higher prices for options  that pay off in those 
scenarios, pushing  up the associated  option‐implied probabilities  relative to inves tors’ 
subjective  probabilities.   The mean of the option‐implied distribution lies  to the left  of 
that of the survey‐implied distribution,  suggesting  negative  term premiums.  
The federal funds  path implied by a straight  read of OIS quotes (the black lines in 
figure 5) was little changed  over the  intermeeting  period.  Assuming  zero term 
premiums,  these market ‐implied forward rates imply two hikes  (of 25 basis points 
each) in 2017 and again in 2018, with the target policy  rate reaching  2 percent by the 
end of 2020.   However, results  from the staff’s experimental  OIS‐bas ed term structure 
model, which  takes the effective  lower  bound into account and incorporates  
information  from Blue Chip  survey forecasts  of the federal funds  rate, suggest that 
OIS rates  beyond six months  contain negative term  premiums.   With the caveat that 
there is considerable  uncertainty  surrounding  the term premium  estimates,  the 
expected  federal funds  rate path adjusted  for these term  premiums  (the light blue  
lines in figure 5) points to a  somewhat  faster expected  pace of tightening  of about 
three hikes  per year in  both 2017 and 2018, with the funds rate reaching  3 percent  by 
the end of 2020.  As shown in  figure 6, the model‐ based path (the light blue line)  lies 
above the modal  federal funds  rate path  from the primary dealer survey  (the brown 
line) but is  roughly consistent  with the  median federal funds  rate projections  (in blue) 
from the FOMC’s December  Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP). 
Results from the model and  the survey also shed light on market participants’  
expectations  of the longer‐run level of  the federal funds  rate (the far ‐right dots  in 
figure 6).  The staff’s  experimental  term structure model  estimates  that the federal 
funds rate will reach  about 3¾ percent in the longer run, about ¾ percentage point 
above the median projected  longer‐run federal funds  rate in the December  SEP and 
the January primary dealer survey.

  Market-based measures of longer-t erm inflation compensation hav e not reversed the 
sharp upward movement that oc curred in late 2016, and the drop in survey-based 
measures seen late last year proved transitory. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that an immediate increase in the target  range for the federal 
funds rate is warranted; they m ight also regard it as prudent f or the Committee’s 
statement to include language signaling that the federal funds rate may rise somewhat 
more quickly than previously e xpected, though still at a gradua l pace. 
 Policymakers may judge that the evidence accumulated since the December meeting, 
in combination with earlier data , reflects sufficient progress toward the Committee’s 
objectives of maximum employme nt and 2 percent inflation to jus tify a small 
reduction in policy accommodati on at next week’s meeting. 
 The timing and effects of the ant icipated fiscal stimulus may b e hard to predict.  The 
effects could be felt at a tim e of significant undershooting of  the unemployment rate, 
a situation that could lead to i ncreased upside risks to inflat ion.  In addition, there is 
considerable uncertainty about the size of the stimulus.  The staff forecast assumes a 
moderate-sized tax cut, but the a ctual fiscal package could tur n out to be much larger.  
Accordingly, policymakers might  be concerned about an outcome s uch as the “Larger 
Fiscal Stimulus” alternat ive scenario in Tealbook A. 
 Policymakers may be concerned that reducing policy accommodatio n too slowly 
could lead to substantial unders hooting of the longer-run norma l unemployment rate, 
and they may be skeptical that such undershooting can be unwoun d smoothly.  They 
might be concerned that the Phil lips curve relationship between  economic slack and 
inflation may be nonlinear, meaning that sustained undershootin g of unemployment 
could lead to an undesirably large  increase in inflation. 
 Policymakers might also be worried  that maintaining the federal  funds rate at its 
current low level, or raising it too slowly, will lead to exces sive risk-taking in 
financial markets that could e ventually endanger financial stability. 
 Respondents to the Desk’s latest  surveys perceive no material o dds that the 
Committee will change the target range at this meeting, and so a decision to increase 
the target range would be very surprising. 
o If market participants infer that the Committee intends a less accommodative 
stance going forward than they had expected, the n it is likely that real interest

 rates will rise, that equity pri ces and inflation compensation will decline, and 
that the dollar would appreciate. 
o However, if investors interpret a statement like Alternative C as primarily 
reflecting an upbeat assessment of the strength of the U.S. expansion or a 
greater likelihood of large fiscal  stimulus than previously ant icipated, then 
equity prices and inflation compe nsation might fall less than otherwise, or 
even rise. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Data on spending received during the intermeeting period point to GDP growth of 
about 2 percent in 2016:Q4 and do not suggest a strengthening trend. 
 Core inflation is somewhat higher  now than earlier in the year, but no higher than had 
been expected.  In addition, the fur ther rise in the dollar is expected to hold down core 
inflation in the near term, a nd part of the recent rise in head line inflation might not be 
sustained because it reflects a  transitory step-up in energy prices.  The incoming data 
on longer-term inflation expect ations have been mixed. 
 Smoothing through short-term ups and downs, inflation still see ms likely to remain 
below the Committee’s objective in the near term and to rise on ly gradually toward 
the objective over the medium term. 
 While policymakers may see near-term risks to the economic outl ook as roughly 
balanced, they may remain concerned about downside medium-term risks in part because adverse developments abroad could lead to tightening gl obal financial 
conditions and decreased demand fo r U.S. exports, and in part because proximity to 
the ELB is still limiting the FOM C’s ability to reduce the fede ral funds rate in 
response to adverse shocks. 
 Policymakers may think it likely t hat the eventual increase in fiscal stimulus in the 
United States will lag far behind t he post-election increase in  longer-term interest 
rates and appreciation of the dollar, and judge that financial conditions have already 
tightened. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers might view informa tion received since the December  FOMC as 
indicating not only that progress is being made in labor market s but also that 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
January 26, 2017

 opportunities remain for further i mprovement in labor market ou tcomes, particularly 
for those marginally attache d to the workforce.  In light of how long inflation has 
been running below 2 percent, they might elect to defer any add itional increases in 
the federal funds rate until ther e is more evidence of further progress toward the 
Committee’s objectives in order to  maintain the c redibility of the Committee’s 
2 percent inflation goal. 
 Policymakers might also judge that inflation dynamics in recent decades demonstrate 
that the Phillips curve is fairly flat, implying that greater resource utilization will have 
only a muted effect on inflation. 
 Some policymakers may see benefi ts associated with a somewhat p ersistent 
undershooting of unemployment.  For example, policymakers might judge that a tight 
labor market could have lasti ng positive effects on the productive capacity of the 
economy. 
 Policymakers might judge that the  neutral rate of interest is c urrently well below its 
longer-run level, reflecting res traint on U.S. economic activit y from economic and 
financial developments abroad, a sustained period of low productivity growth, or 
borrowing conditions that remain tight for some households.  Th ey may see such 
headwinds as unlikely to subside in the near term. 
 Some policymakers might regard the prospects for, and compositi on of, fiscal 
stimulus as still highly uncer tain.  They might therefore think  that the optimism that 
recently has been built into asset prices is overdone and likel y to be reversed, at least 
in part. 
 In recognition of the asymmetric risks noted above, policymakers might regard it as prudent risk management to signa l a slower expected pace of rate increases than the 
December 2016 FOMC statement and SEP indicated.  
 Markets would be surprised by a sig nal of a more patient approa ch to future rate 
hikes.  As discussed in the box “Mo netary Policy Expectations a nd Uncertainty,” the 
probability distribution of the federal funds rate at the end of 2017 derived using 
options on Eurodollar futures has shifted to the right a bit an d the same distribution 
computed from answers to the J anuary Desk survey attaches notab ly smaller 
probabilities to interest rate  outcomes at or below 1 percent.

 o Financial market participants might push further into the futur e the expected 
date of the next rate increase , the expected path for the feder al funds rate 
would likely flatten, and longer- term yields would likely decli ne. 
o If the statement is primarily interpreted as more accommodative than 
anticipated, equity prices and inflation compensation would lik ely rise, and 
the dollar would depreciate.  Conve rsely, if investors read the  statement as 
reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat  assessment of the economic outlook, 
equity prices and inflati on compensation could fall.

 IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
If the Committee decides to raise the target range for the fede ral funds rate, an 
implementation note that communicat es the changes the Federal R eserve decided to make 
to its administered rates—the interest rates on required and ex cess reserves, the offering 
rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primar y credit rate—would be 
issued.  If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range for the federal 
funds rate, an implementation no te that indicates no change in these three policy tools 
would be issued.   
The Board has decided to adopt a procedural change in its revie w and 
determination of the discount rat es (the primary credit, second ary credit, and seasonal 
credit rates) established by the  Reserve Banks.  The change app lies to joint Board and 
FOMC meetings, and to separate B oard meetings, whenever discoun t rates are on the 
Board’s agenda.  Under the new procedure, the Board will vote t o determine the primary 
credit rate and formulas for th e secondary and seasonal credit rates whether or not any of 
them are being changed.  A parallel change will be made to the Board’s procedure for 
setting the interest rates on res erve balances (IOR).  Before t hese procedural changes, the 
Board voted on IOR and discount rat es only when it altered thos e rates or formulas.  The 
procedural changes do not alter i n any way Reserve Banks’ responsibility for establishing 
discount rates or the Board’s res ponsibility for the review and  determination of discount 
rates and for setting the interes t rates on reserve balances.  Board votes on IOR and 
discount rates at all joint Bo ard and FOMC meetings will reinfo rce the consistency of the 
settings of the instruments of  monetary policy and will increas e the transparency of the 
Board’s role in monetary policy.  
We anticipate that, after the FOMC’s policy vote at next week’s  joint meeting, the 
Chair will request, from the Bo ard, a motion and vote to mainta in or change the interest 
rates on reserves, consistent w ith the FOMC’s decision on the t arget range for the federal 
funds rate.  We anticipate that  the Chair also will request, fr om the Board, a motion and 
vote on the establishment of disc ount rates and formulas, again consistent with the 
FOMC’s decision.  The Board’s votes on IOR and the primary cred it rate will be 
announced in the implementation not e that is released with the FOMC statement.  A draft 
implementation note consistent with no change in rates, and another draft consistent with an increase in the target ra nge and associated rates, appear on  the following pages;

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and of 
key elements of the associated inc ome statement that are consis tent with the staff 
projections for the path of monetary policy and longer-term int erest rates, under two 
scenarios for the longer-run level of reserve balances.1 
 In the “$100 billion reserve” s cenario, the longer-run level of  reserve balances is 
assumed to be $100 billion, the same assumption as in the December Tealbook.  
Interest rates in this projecti on are similar to those in the D ecember Tealbook, with 
the federal funds rate project ed to rise to 4 percent by the en d of 2021, before moving 
down to 3 percent by the end of the projection period.  Longer- term interest rates 
follow a similar pattern, reachi ng peak levels slightly earlier  before declining 
somewhat throughout the remainde r of the projection period. 
 In the “$500 billion reserve” s cenario, the longer-run level of  reserve balances is 
assumed to be $500 billion.  In their discussion of the “Long-R un Monetary Policy 
Implementation Framework” at the November FOMC meeting, partici pants 
commented on the advantages of di fferent operating regimes, som e of which could be 
associated with a higher demand for reserve balances.  While there is considerable 
uncertainty about the longer-run level of demand for reserve ba lances associated with 
various operating frameworks, $500 billion of reserves could be consistent with the 
longer-run level of reserve demand in some frameworks.2  The interest rate paths 
associated with this scenario are very similar to those in the $100 billion reserve 
scenario.3 
Under the $100 billion reserve s cenario, the evolution of the F ederal Reserve’s balance 
sheet and associated income stat ement are only minimally differ ent from those presented 
in the December Tealbook.  In the  $500 billion reserve scenario , the size of the balance 
sheet normalizes about one year earlier than in the $100 billio n reserve scenario and, as 
                                                 
1 In these scenarios, the respons e of the federal funds rate to deviations of the endogenous 
variables from their baseline va lues is determined by the inert ial Taylor (1999) policy rule. 
2 The longer-run level of the demand for reserve balances can be  affected by various factors such 
regulatory developments and other structural changes. 
3 The interest rate paths for thi s scenario are consistent with those presented in Tealbook A.

 discussed in more detail below, results in a slightly less negative path for the term 
premium over the medium term. 
The key policy assumptions associated with the projections are highlighted below. 
 Reinvestment policy:   We continue to assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of principal from  maturing Treasury securities an d agency debt as well 
as principal received on agency M BS when the target range for the federal funds rate 
reaches 1¼ to 1½ percent.  Based on this criterion, reinvestments are expected to 
cease during the third quarter of 2017, the same timing as in t he December Tealbook.  
Thereafter, the SOMA portfolio w ould be allowed to shrink passi vely until reserve 
balances reach their assumed longer-run level of either $100 bi llion or $500 billion.  
The box “Market Interpretations of  the Committee’s Reinvestment Policy” discusses 
market participants’ expectati ons about the timing of a change in the Committee’s 
reinvestment policy. 
 Use of policy normalization tools:   We assume that take- up of overnight reverse 
repurchase agreements (ON RRPs ) runs at $100 billion until the level of reserve 
balances is closer to its longer-run level.  Specifically, the level of ON RRP take-up 
declines to zero over the course  of one year once the level of reserve balances is 
within $500 billion of its longer-run level. 4,5  
Key features of the $100 billion a nd $500 billion reserve scenarios are described below. 
 Balance sheet.   Under the $100 billion reserve s cenario, normalization of the s ize of 
the balance sheet occurs in the  first quarter of 2022, the same quarter as in the 
                                                 
4 The use of ON RRPs results in a shift in the composition of Fe deral Reserve liabilities—a 
decline in reserve balances and  a corresponding increase in rev erse repurchase agreements—but does not 
produce an overall change in th e size of the balance sheet unle ss ON RRP take-up conti nues after the size 
of the balance is normalized.  Separately, we assume that RRPs associated with foreign official and 
international accounts remain throughout the projection period near their December 31, 2016 level of 
$257 billion. 
5 In previous Tealbooks, we assum ed that ON RRPs outstanding wou ld begin to decline at the end 
of 2018 and fall to zero by the end of 2019.  The new assumptio n makes the ON RRP decision state 
contingent.  Under the path for interest rates embedded in the staff’s baseline forecast, the new assumption 
delays the phaseout of the ON RRP facility by less than one year.  If policymakers decide to maintain the 
ON RRP facility through the projection period and take-up conti nues at $100 billion, the size of the balance 
sheet would normalize one quarter  earlier.  In this case, the b alance sheet size would be $100 billion larger, 
but there would be only minor income and interest-rate effects.

 Market Interpretations  of the Committee’s  Reinvestment  Policy  
The Committee has  indicated  that it will  continue reinvestments  until normalization  of  
the level of the federal funds  rate is “well under way.”   This box provides information  
on the range of views among market participants  about when the  Committee will 
choose to taper  or cease reinvestments.  
The Desk’s  Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants  include questions  that 
ask for respondents’ views about  the most likely timing of the first change in the 
Committee’s  reinvestment  policy.  Figure 1 presents  a histogram  of respondents’  
expectations  for the number of  months after the date of the surveys this change will 
take place.1  The red bars in the figure indicate that, in the January surveys, nearly half 
of respondents  expect reinvestment policy  to be changed  within the  next 7 to 
12 months, and another 30 percent expect the first change in 13 to 18 months.  
Relative to the December  surveys (the dashed blue line), many respondents  now 
expect reinvestment policy  to be changed  sooner.  This shift appears  to reflect  a 
reevaluation  after the release of the minutes of the December  2016 FOMC meeting,  
which noted that several FOMC  participants  had indicated  that circumstances  that 
might warrant  changes to the path for the federal funds rate could  also have 
implications  for reinvestment policy.   Subsequent  speeches   on this topic by 
policymakers  also garnered  significant  mark et attention.2 
 
                                                 
1 We report the earliest  date that respondents  indicate a change in either Treasury or MBS 
reinvestment. 
2 Several respondents  cited increased  discussion  of reinvestment  policy in recent Federal 
Reserve communication  as informing  the change in their expectations.

 Figure 2 presents  a histogram  of respondent’s  expectations  for the most likely level of 
either the target federal funds  rate or the midpoint  of the target range  when 
reinvestment  policy is first changed.  In  the January surveys, the majority of 
respondents  expect a federal funds  rate within the 1  to 1.5 percent range and  the 
median respondent  expects a midpoint  level of 1.375 percent,  in line with the staff’s 
assumptions  in the January Tealbook.   Relative  to the  December  surveys, most 
respondents  now expect a lower level of  the policy rate when reinvestment policy  is 
first changed.  
 
Figure 3 combines  respondents’  expected number  of months until the time of a 
change in reinvestment policy  (horizontal  axis) and the most likely level of the target 
federal fund  rate (vertical axis)  into a scatterplot.   The  solid red and hollow blue dots 
capture the  responses  from the January and the December  surveys, respectively.  
Overall, the  responses  suggest that  market participants’  expectations  have started to 
coalesce in  recent weeks,  pointing to a lower  degree of dispersion  in expectations  
about the timing of the first change in the Committee’s  reinvestment policy  and the 
concurrent  level of the federal funds  rate.3  
Figure 4 illustrates  that, based on  our usual methodology,  there would  be at most a 
modest effect on the staff’s estimate for the  term premium  effect (TPE) if we

 changed our assumption  for the timing  of ending reinvestments.4  The red line shows 
our estimate  of the TPE under our baseline scenario,  which is based on the 
assumption  that the cessation  of reinvestment occurs  at the end  of September  2017, 
when staff  projects that the federal funds  rate will reach 1.375 percent.   As noted, this 
is also the federal  funds rate level at which the  median respondent  to the January 
surveys expects the first change in the reinvestment  policy.  The blue  line shows our 
TPE estimate under  an alternative scenario  that incorporates  the assumption  that 
reinvestments  will cease  when the  federal funds rate reaches  2.125  percent, just above 
the level corr esponding  to the 95th percentile  of the expectations  in the January 
surveys for the federal funds  rate prevailing  when reinvestment policy  is first 
changed.  Along  the projected  path for the federal funds  rate in Tealbook  A, this level 
is reached in June 2018.  Pushing  out the end date of reinvestment  by 9 months makes 
the TPE about 7 basis points more negative,  on averag e, through 2019.  These 
calculations  assume that the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet affects  term premiums  
entirely through the so‐called “stock effect,” and that the public would not infer from 
a change  in reinvestment policy  any changes to the future path of short‐term  interest 
rates.  While this is  a useful framework,  the experience of  the so‐called “taper 
tantrum” in  the summer of  2013 suggests  that market participants’  policy 
expectations  were sensitive  at that  time to relatively  modest potential  changes in the

 December Tealbook (see the solid black lines in the exhibit tit led “Total Assets and 
Selected Balance Sheet Items” a nd the corresponding table that follows).6  At the time 
of normalization, total assets are projected to stand at roughly $2.4 trillion, with about 
$2.3 trillion in total SOMA secu rities holdings, composed of $1 .1 trillion of Treasury 
securities and $1.2 tri llion of MBS.  Total assets and SOMA Tre asury holdings rise 
thereafter, keeping pace with the p rojected increases in Federa l Reserve notes in 
circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
Under the $500 billion reserve s cenario, the size of the portfo lio is normalized in the 
first quarter of 2021, four quarter s earlier than projected in the $100 billion reserve 
scenario (see the dotted red lin es and the cor responding table that follows), reflecting 
the higher longer-run level of res erve balances and the resulti ng need to hold a larger 
securities portfolio. 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   Under both the $100 billi on and $500 billion reserve 
scenarios, annual remittances a re projected to decline from $92 billion in 2016 to 
about $75 billion this year (see the solid black lines in the “Income Projections” 
exhibit).  The step-down reflects increased interest expense on  reserves resulting from 
the FOMC’s decision to increase the target range for the federa l funds rate and the 
Board’s accompanying decision to r aise the IOER rate in December 2016.  In 
addition, the decline in remittan ces reflects the staff forecas t of further increases in 
the policy rate over the course of this year.7  Annual remittances are projected to 
continue to decline, reaching a low of roughly $36 billion in 2 020, as the size of the 
SOMA portfolio falls and the target range for the federal funds  rate increases.  
Thereafter, remittances gradually increase as higher-yielding T reasury securities are 
added to the SOMA portfolio.  The remittance paths are similar for both scenarios, 
                                                 
6 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend; this trend is determined largely by the rising level of Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and the assumed long-run level of reserve balances. 
7 We assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balance s will average 12.5 basis points 
above the effective federal funds rate and the offering rate on ON RRPs will average 12.5 basis points 
below the effective federal funds rate.  The effective federal funds rate has averaged 65 basis points over 
the intermeeting period.

 though underlying interest income and expense differ after 2020 .  No deferred asset is 
projected.8  
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of about $260 billion at the end of Se ptember 2016.9  
Preliminary staff estimates show  that the net unrealized gain p osition fell to about 
$70 billion by the end of December as a result of the rise in i nterest rates over this 
period, including an 88 basis poi nt increase in the yield on 10-year Treasury 
securities.  Going forward, the ne t unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio will 
depend importantly on the path of l onger-term interest rates.  Because of the rise in 
longer-term interest rates assumed over the next several years in both scenarios, the 
portfolio is projecte d to shift to an unreal ized loss position in the third quarter of 
2017, the same as in the December Tealbook baseline.  The portf olio is expected to 
record a peak unrealized loss  of approximately $210 billion in 2019, about $75 billion 
of which is attributable to holdings of Treasury securities and  $135 billion to holdings 
of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position then narrows throu gh the projection 
period, as the value of securi ties previously acquired under th e large-scale asset 
purchase programs returns to par as they approach maturity and new securities are 
added to the portfolio at prevailing market yields. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” under the $100 billion reserve scenario, the extra securities 
held in the SOMA portfolio as a result of the Federal Reserve’s  large-scale asset 
purchases (LSAPs) and reinvestme nts are estimated to be depress ing the term 
premium embedded in the 10-ye ar nominal Treasury yield by 86 ba sis points in the 
current quarter.  The estimated term premium effect depends imp ortantly on the 
expected path of the Federal Res erve’s balance sheet over comin g years relative to a 
counterfactual projection for the  balance sheet that excludes t he effects of asset 
purchases.  This contemporaneous estimate is comparable to that  reported in the 
December Tealbook.  Over time, the term premium effect graduall y fades as the 
projected path of the balance shee t converges to the counterfactual path.  Even after 
                                                 
8 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury. 
9 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

 the normalization of its size, the  balance sheet continues to p ut downward pressure on 
longer-term interest rates b ecause the average duration of securities holdings remains 
above the level that arises in the benchmark counterfactual pro jection that excludes 
the effects of the asset purchases. 
Under the $500 billion reserve scenario, the estimated term pre mium effect in the 
current quarter is about 10 basis  points less negative than und er the $100 billion 
reserve scenario.  The smaller magnitude of the term premium effect in this scenario 
stems from the fact that these effects are based on the project ed path of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet over co ming years relative to a counter factual projection that 
embeds the $500 billion longer-run l evel of reserve balances (a nd thus a SOMA 
portfolio that is $400 billion large r in the long run than in t he $100 billion reserves 
scenario).  So in effect, a portion of  the term premium attribu ted to LSAPs in the 
$100 billion scenario is attributed instead to the larger stead y state size of the balance 
sheet in the $500 billion scenari o.  The term premium effects o f the LSAPs are thus 
smaller in magnitude in the $500 bi llion reserve scenario than in the $100 billion 
reserve scenario.  The  estimated TPE path remains less negative  than in the 
$100 billion reserve scenario  through the beginning of 2022, wh en the size of balance 
sheet has normalized in both scen arios.  By the time that the s ize of the balance sheet 
is normalized, the term premium effect differs little in the tw o reserve scenarios. 
 SOMA characteristics.  Portfolio characteristics a re roughly the same under the 
$100 billion and $500 billion reserve scenarios until 2020, giv en that the balance 
sheet is shrinking toward normali zation under both scenarios un til then.  
Approximately $195 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings have already matured or 
will mature this year, and a total of nearly $1.3 trillion will  mature between 2017 and 
2020 (for the baseline scenario, s ee the top panel of the exhib it “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Holdings”).10  The amount of Treasury securities maturing 
each month will vary considerably over time, while projected MB S paydowns vary 
                                                 
10 Under the FOMC’s current reinvestment policy, the Desk replace s maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
face value of holdings maturing on the issue date of newly issu ed securities.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new securities.  The Desk’s 
bids at Treasury auctions are p laced as noncompetitive tenders and are treated by Treasury as add-ons to 
announced auction sizes.

 less.  Realized MBS paydowns will reflect the evolution of inte rest rates and other 
factors and thus could be significantly more volatile than projected.11 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6½ years (see the middle panel  of the exhibit).  The weighted-a verage duration is 
projected to decline sl ightly this year, as  the securities in the portfolio approach 
maturity, and subsequently to rise until the size of the balanc e sheet is normalized.12  
After reaching its peak, duration is projected to resume its de cline as the Desk restarts 
open market purchases of Treasury securities to keep pace with the increase in 
Federal Reserve notes in circul ation and Federal Reserve Bank c apital.  The duration 
contour in this latter portion of  the projection is based on the key assumption that the 
Federal Reserve will limit its  purchases to Treasury bills unti l those holdings are 
equal to approximately 30 percen t of the Treasury portfolio, si milar to the pre-crisis 
composition of the portfolio (currently SOMA holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread acros s the maturity 
spectrum (see the bottom panel, “ Maturity Composition of SOMA T reasury 
Portfolio”).13 
 
                                                 
11 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $22 billion of maturing Treasury securities 
and is expected to purchase a to tal of $55 billion of 15- and 3 0-year agency MBS under the reinvestment 
program. 
12 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 a s the pace of roll-offs accelerates  and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o, causing duration to increase until the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized. 
13 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments cea se.
