Data received since the Committee met in February indicate that the economy has 
continued to expand at a modera te pace and that inflation moved  closer to the FOMC’s 
2 percent longer-run objective.  There are two key questions for the Committee at this 
meeting:  first, whether the ava ilable information warrants rai sing the federal funds rate; 
and second, whether the economic outlook and associated risks indicate that the funds rate path suggested by recent FOMC  statements remains appropria te or call for signaling 
a somewhat different path of rat e hikes.  The employment report  for February will be 
released after this Tealbook i s published but before the FOMC m eeting; consequently, 
this Tealbook includes four draf t statements.  Alternatives A, B, and C are intended for 
consideration if the employment r eport shows that the labor mar ket has developed 
broadly in line with expectati ons or that it has strengthened m ore than expected.  
Alternative Bʹ is intended for c onsideration if the employment report falls significantly 
short of expectations.   
 Alternatives A, B, and C all char acterize recent economic activ ity as having 
continued to expand at a modera te pace.  The Alternatives diffe r somewhat in their 
interpretation of the incomi ng data on inflation, unemployment,  and business fixed 
investment.  
o These three Alternatives recogni ze that inflation has increased , moving 
“toward” (Alternative A) or “cl ose to” (Alternat ives B and C) t he 
Committee’s 2 percent objective.  A t the same time, Alternative A states that 
the rise “largely reflected the  temporary effects of recent inc reases in energy 
prices” while Alternative B indicates that  “excluding energy an d food prices, 
inflation is little changed a nd continues to run somewhat below  2 percent.”  
When discussing longer-term inflation expectations, Alternative s A and B 
characterize market-based measures of inflation compensation as remaining 
low, while Alternative C states that such measures are little c hanged.  All 
three Alternatives note that survey-based measures of expected inflation are 
little changed. 
o With respect to the labor marke t, Alternative A indicates that it “strengthened 
somewhat in recent months,” while Alternatives B and C note tha t the labor 
market “has continued to stren gthen.”  Moreover, Alternative A,  unlike 
Alternatives B and C, states that “the unemp loyment rate and ot her indicators

  of labor utilization have cha nged little, on balance,” and that “wage pressures 
have remained subdued.” 
o All of the Alternatives indicate that consumer spending has con tinued to rise 
moderately.  Whereas Alternativ es B and C state that business f ixed 
investment “appears to have firm ed somewhat,” Alternative A says it “has 
risen modestly.”  Inasmuch as the Committee now has information  indicating 
how consumer and business spendi ng have evolved since the elect ion, the 
draft Alternatives no longer reference recent improvements in m easures of 
consumer and business sentiment.   
 In describing the medium-term  outlook for inflation, Alternativ es B and C anticipate 
that inflation “will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium  term,” whereas 
Alternative A preserves the language of paragraph 2 of the February statement, 
predicting that infla tion “will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.”  The language 
concerning the medium-term outlook for economic activity and la bor market 
conditions is unchanged in the thr ee Alternatives .  Alternatives A and B continue to 
condition the outlook on “gradual ad justments” in the stance of  monetary policy; 
Alternative C uses “further gradual adjustments.” 
 All of the Alternatives retain the assessment that near-term ri sks to the economic 
outlook “appear roughly balanced.” 
 Alternatives B and C raise the t arget range for t he federal funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent, 
whereas Alternative A maintains t he current target range.  The Alternatives repeat the 
formulation from earlier statem ents indicating that the stance of monetary policy 
“remains accommodative.”  All of  the Alternatives state that su ch a stance supports “a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation.”   
 The Alternatives differ somewhat in their description of the pr ospects for future 
increases in the federal funds rate.  
o All of the Alternatives delete t he February statement’s reference to the 
“current shortfall of inf lation from 2 percent.”   
o Alternatives A and B e mphasize that the inflation goal is “symm etric.”  The 
combination of “stabilize ar ound 2 percent” and “symmetric” may  be seen as 
a signal that the Committee will be neither more nor less concerned when it

  sees inflation running temporarily  above 2 percent than when it  sees inflation 
running temporarily below 2 percent.  
o Alternatives B and C strike the word “only” in describing gradu al rate 
increases.   
o Alternative C indicates that th e Committee “currently” expects that the federal 
funds rate will remain, for some time, below levels that are ex pected to prevail 
in the longer run.   
 None of the three Alternatives changes the description of the C ommittee’s policy 
concerning reinvestment.  
 Inasmuch as Alternative Bʹ i s predicated upon the release, on M arch 10, of a quite 
weak February employment report,  it declares that “the pace of improvement in the 
labor market diminished in recen t months.”  Moreover, it indica tes that “job gains 
slowed sharply and the unemployment rate rose.” 
o Alternative Bʹ maintains the cur rent target range for the feder al funds rate and 
indicates that the Committee will be assessing “whether incomin g information 
is consistent with the Committ ee’s current economic outlook.”

  JANUARY -FEBRUARY 2017  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in December 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic activity 
has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains remained  solid and the 
unemployment rate stayed near its recent low.  Household spendi ng has continued to 
rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained so ft.  Measures of 
consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. Inflatio n increased in recent 
quarters but is still below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-ru n objective.  Market-
based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expect ations are little changed, on ba lance.   
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat  further, and 
inflation will rise to 2 percent ov er the medium term.  Near-te rm risks to the 
economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee contin ues to closely 
monitor inflation indicators a nd global economic and financial developments. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 
percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a ret urn to 2 percent 
inflation.  
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  In light of 
the current shortfall of infla tion from 2 percent, the Committe e will carefully monitor 
actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Co mmittee expects that 
economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant o nly gradual increases 
in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, 
below levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer run.  H owever, the actual path 
of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook a s informed by 
incoming data.  
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the  level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of 
longer-term securities  at sizable levels , should help maintain accommodative 
financial conditions.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen.  Total 
payrolls rose 227,000 in January; th e three-month moving averag e of total payroll 
gains was 183,000, well above proj ected trend growth in the labor force.  Also 
indicative of a tightening labor market, the labor force partic ipation rate has remained 
unchanged on net since late 2013, an d thus has risen cumulatively about 1 percentage 
point relative to i ts trend, as shown in the box “Labor Force P articipation and Labor 
Market Flows” in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook  section in 
Tealbook A.  Although the unemployment rate ticked up in December and January, it 
is at or near most participants’ estimates of its longer-run no rmal level.  
 Real GDP growth for the four th quarter of 2016 is estimated by the staff at 2 percent, 
a touch above estimated potential growth.  
 Private domestic final purchase s continue to grow at a solid pa ce, with gains in 
household income and wealth supp orting growth in consumer spend ing.        
 Data received over the intermeeti ng period indica te that total PCE price inflation has 
increased relative to its pace last year.  Twelve-month headlin e PCE inflation, at 
1.9 percent in January, has moved further toward the FOMC’s 2 p ercent objective.  
The increase over recent quarters in large part reflects rising  consumer energy prices; 
12-month core PCE inflation, at  1.7 percent in January, has bee n essentially constant 
since the middle of last year.  T he trimmed mean PCE inflation measure published by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Da llas stands at 1.9 percent.   
 Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation are  little changed;  
5-year, 5-year-forward CPI infla tion compensation remains close  to 2 percent, which 
is low by historical standards .  Survey based measures of longe r-term inflation 
expectations also are basicall y unchanged:  The first-quarter S urvey of Professional 
Forecasters median 10-year inflation projection for PCE prices ticked up a tenth of a 
percentage point after being essentially flat at 2 percent sinc e early 2013.  The 3-year-
ahead measure of inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 
Survey of Consumer Expectations increased a tenth to 3 percent in February. 
 The staff’s view of the economic outlook for the next few years —and of the risks to 
the outlook—has not changed appreciably since the Committee las t met.

  o Real GDP is projected to rise a t a 2 percent rate  this year, an d then to pick up 
to a 2¼ percent pace in 2018 as the assumed fiscal policy chang es kick in, 
before moving back down to 2 percent in 2019.   
o Labor market conditions are proj ected to strengthen somewhat fu rther over the 
medium term, with the unemplo yment rate declining to 4.1 percen t by the end 
of 2019.  Average monthly payroll gain s are expected to slow fr om 170,000 in 
2017 to 120,000 in 2019—just a little faster than the range of gains that is 
consistent with no change in labor market slack. 
o Total PCE price inflation is e xpected to move a bit above 2 per cent in coming 
months, and then to drop back to a  touch below 2 percent during  the second 
half of the year.  Core PCE price inflation is expected to remain close to 
1¾ percent this year, and then to move up to 2 percent by 2019 as the restraint 
from earlier declin es in energy prices and non-energy import pr ices dissipates 
and the labor market tightens further.  With consumer food and energy prices 
projected to rise roughly in lin e with core prices beyond the n ear term, the 
staff expects total PCE price inflation to run at about the sam e pace as core 
inflation over the next few years.     
Policy Strategy 
 If the February employment re port is not too far below expectat ions, policymakers 
may judge that they have accumulated sufficient evidence that t he real economy and 
inflation are evolving about as expected to warrant an increase in the target range for 
the federal funds rate.  Given a n expectation that the neutral rate of interest will 
gradually increase toward its  longer-run level, policymakers might continue to expect 
that the appropriate pace of furth er increases in the target ra nge will also be gradual.  
As shown in the special exhibit “O ptimal Control Using a Projec tion Consistent with 
the SEP” in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook A, such a gradual 
path would be consistent with optimal control simulations that take the median 
responses to the December SEP as the baseline outlook. 
 Given the uncertainty about the timing, size, and composition o f prospective changes 
in fiscal policy, policymakers may still consider it premature to communicate that 
they see an appreciable change e ither in their modal economic o utlook or in the 
associated path of the federal f unds rate that would be consist ent with achieving their 
statutory goals.  Or, even if they judge that the appropriate p ath for the federal funds

  rate has steepened, participants may still see the pace of likely rate increases as 
gradual by historical standards .  To the extent this is so, par ticipants may see 
paragraphs 2 and 4 of Alternative B as appropriately preserving the Committee’s 
flexibility going forward.   
o In contrast to the February sta tement, paragraph 2 of Alternative B expresses 
the expectation that inflation “will stabilize around 2 percent  over the medium 
term” (rather than “will rise t o 2 percent over the medium term ”), and 
paragraph 4 acknowledges progress toward the 2 percent inflatio n goal by 
striking the reference to the “current shortfall of inflation f rom 2 percent.”  
These changes, combined with the  deletion of the word “only” in  describing 
gradual rate increases in para graph 4 of Alternative B, may be seen as 
suggesting greater confidence in a pace of rate hikes that is f aster than that 
observed in 2016. 
 As shown in figure 1 of the box “Mo netary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty,” 
financial market quotes embed a  probability of about 90 percent  that the Committee 
will raise the target range at this meeting.  Respondents to th e Desk’s latest Surveys 
of Primary Dealers and Market P articipants (figure 2) concur in  this assessment.  
Looking ahead, respondents expect three rate hikes this year (o f 25 basis point each) 
but, importantly, they do not seem t o have revised their estima tes for the number of 
rate hikes in 2018 (with a median estimate of three hikes) and 2019 (two hikes).   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Labor market conditions are str ong and have continued to streng then.  Despite a 
recent uptick, the unemployment ra te is at or near participants ’ estimates of its  
longer-run normal level and below the staff’s estimate of the n atural rate.  Total 
payroll gains in January as we ll as their three-month moving av erage are well above 
estimates of the pace needed to maintain a constant unemploymen t rate over time.  
Given a declining trend in the lab or force participation rate o f about 0.3 percentage 
point per year (the staff’s curre nt estimate), the flat partici pation rate over the past 
three years represen ts a cyclical improve ment of nearly 1 perce ntage point, as shown 
in the box “Labor Force Participa tion and Labor Market Flows” i n the Domestic 
Economic Developments and Ou tlook section in Tealbook A.

  Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Market participants’  perceptions  of the odds  that the next increase in the target range for 
the federal funds rate will occur  at the March FOMC meeting rose notably over the 
intermeeting  period (figure 1).  The market‐implied  probability  of the next rate hike 
occurring  in March moved  up from about 25 to 90 percent, with most  of the increase 
occurring  toward the end of the intermeeting  period following  comments  by various 
FOMC participants.   The Desk’s March Surveys of Primary Dealers  and Market Participants  
showed similarly high odds  on a rate increase at the March meeting (figure 2). 
Looking further ahead, the probability  distribution  of the federal funds  rate that will 
prevail at the end of 2017 implied by quotes on Eurodollar  futures options  (figure 3) shifted 
to the right; it now shows  about equal odds of two, three, or four (or more)  rate hikes (of 
25 basis points each) this year.  The distribution  from the Marc h Desk Surveys (figure 4) 
also shifted  to the right and now attaches the highest  odds  to three rate hikes in the 
federal funds rate by year‐end.  Similarly,  the median of respondents’  modal expectations  
(not shown) suggests  that respondents  now view three rate hikes over the course of 2017 
as the mostl y likely outcome,  up from two hikes in the January survey.   Beyond the current 
year, median estimates  suggest that respondents  continue to see three rate hikes in 2018 
and two in 2019 as the most  likely outcome.      
The federal funds rate path implied  by a straight read of OIS quotes (the black lines  in 
figure 5) moved up about 20 basis points over the intermeeting  period.  Assuming  zero risk 
premiums,  these market‐implied forward rates imply about two and a half rate hikes in 
2017 and two in 2018,  with the target rate reaching  a little less than 2¼ percent  by the end 
of 2020.  The staff’s OIS‐based  term structure  model, which takes the effective lower 
bound into account and incorporates  information  from Blue Chip survey forecasts  of the 
federal funds rate,  provides an estimate of the expected  federal funds rate that is adjusted 
for term premiums.   The expected  path from the model (the light  blue lines  in figure 5) 
rose a touch; it suggests  that  the federal funds rate will rise at a somewhat  faster pace of 
about four hikes per year in 2017 and three hikes in 2018,  with the funds rate nearing 
3¼ percent  by the end of 2020.  The difference  between  the term premium ‐adjusted  and 
unadjusted  paths narrowed  somewhat  over the intermeeting  period,  suggesting  that OIS 
rates  beyond six months now contain slightly less negative term premiums.  
As shown in figure 6, the model‐based  path for the federal funds rate (the light‐blue  line) 
continues  to lie above the modal path from the Desk Surveys (in brown) but is roughly 
consistent  with the staff’s  March baseline projection  through 2018 (in dark blue).  
Results from the model and the surveys also shed light  on market  participants’  
expectations  of the longer‐run level of the federal funds rate (the far‐right dots  in 
figure 6).  The staff’s  term structure  model continues  to estimate that the federal funds 
rate will reach about 3¾ percent over the next five to ten years, about in line with the 
average of the target funds rate in the staff’s Marc h baseline projection  over that same 
time  period, but about ¾ percentage  point  above the median projected  longer‐run federal 
funds rate in the March Desk Surveys.

   Growth in real GDP in the four th quarter of 2016 is estimated at 2 percent, the same 
as in the January Tealbook.  Wit h the survey measures of consum er confidence still 
elevated from the respective pre-election levels, and with hous ehold wealth having 
increased appreciably in recent months with the rise in equity prices, participants may 
see some upside risk to the outlook for real PCE and hence for real GDP. 
 Spending data received during the  intermeeting period point to some firming of 
business fixed investment.  Indicators of business sentiment have been favorable 
lately, with the headline indexe s in the Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing ISM 
reports, and the Manufacturing Bus iness Outlook Survey from the  Federal Reserve 
Bank of Philadelphia all signaling expansion. 
 Twelve-month headline PCE infla tion has continued to rise towar d the FOMC’s 
2 percent objective in recent qua rters and is expected to run a bove 2 percent in the 
near term.   
 Market-based measures of longer-t erm inflation compensation sug gest that downside 
risks to inflation receded during t he fall of last year.  Moreo ver, the drop in survey-
based measures seen late la st year proved transitory.   
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may conclude that the information accumulated sinc e the February 
meeting, in combination with earlie r data, provides ample evidence that the real 
economy and inflation are evolvi ng about as expected and thus w arrants a further 
reduction in policy accommodation a t next week’s meeting.  They  might note that 
with stock prices having climbe d substantially in the past few months, and business 
and consumer confidence at elevat ed levels, there is now a noteworthy risk of “falling 
behind the curve” in tightening the stance of monetary policy. 
 In addition, policymakers might regard it as prudent for the Committee’s statement to 
include language signaling that the federal funds rate may rise  more quickly than 
previously expected, though stil l at a gradual pace.  To that e nd, paragraph 4 of 
Alternative C suggests deleti ng the word “only” and paragraph 2  adding the word 
“further” when describing gradual adjustments in the federal fu nds rate.  
Additionally, paragraph 4 uses the phrase “The Committee curren tly expects” when 
describing prospects for future increases in the federal funds rate.

   Policymakers may be concerned th at, with an economy projected to be operating 
above its long-run potential, infl ation might well increase mor e than the staff expects.  
This view is consistent with the predictions of m odels that emphasize nonlinear 
effects of economic slack on inflation, a possibility that is explored in the alternative 
scenario “Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and More Sensitive Long-R un Inflation 
Expectations” in the Risks a nd Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.  
 Policymakers might also be worried  that maintaining the federal  funds rate at its 
current low level, or raising it too slowly, will lead to exces sive risk-taking in 
financial markets that could e ventually endanger financial stability. 
 Responses to the Desk’s latest surveys, like financial market q uotes, indicate that 
market participants now see an approximately 90 percent probability that the Committee will raise the target range at this meeting.  However , the recent jump in 
the perceived probability of a rate hike at this meeting has no t been accompanied by 
the expectation of a steeper pat h for the federal funds rate go ing forward.  
Consequently, signaling that the  federal funds rate may rise mo re quickly, as done in 
this Alternative, could induce fi nancial market participants to  revise upward their 
policy path expectations, which i n turn might trigger a drop in  stock prices and 
inflation compensation as well as a strengthening of the dollar .  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The incoming data suggest that the pace of improvement in the l abor market 
moderated in recent months.  In pa rticular, average job gains slowed relative to the 
summer months of last year, and the unemployment rate ticked up .  Even though the 
labor force participation ra te is unchanged, on net, since 2013 , measures of labor 
compensation have shown hardly any  acceleration in recent years .   
 GDP growth in the fourth quart er of 2016 is estimated to have i ncreased at an annual 
rate of 2 percent, the same as i n the January Tealbook.  Howeve r, real personal 
consumption expenditures declined in January. 
 Although total PCE price inflation has increased in recent months, the increase 
largely reflects rising consumer  energy prices; core inflation has been essentially 
constant at 1.7 percent.  In addition, the projected divergence between domestic and 
foreign monetary policies could ge nerate greater appreciation o f the dollar than

  assumed in the staff’s baselin e, holding down core inflation.  Furthermore, part of the 
recent rise in headline inflation might not be sustained becaus e it reflects a transitory 
step-up in energy prices.  
 Survey measures of longer-run in flation expectations and readin gs on longer-term 
inflation compensation are stil l low by historical standards.  Policymakers may be 
concerned that if forecasts  of a pickup in inflation prove too optimistic, longer-run 
inflation expectations could decrease.  If this were to occur n ow, after a lengthy 
period of underperformance on inflation, the Committee’s reputa tion could suffer. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers might view informa tion received since the February  FOMC meeting as 
indicating not only that progress i n the labor market has slowed but also that 
opportunities remain for further i mprovement in labor market ou tcomes, particularly 
for those marginally attache d to the workforce.  In light of how long inflation has 
been running below 2 percent, they might elect to defer any add itional increases in 
the federal funds rate until ther e is more evidence of sustaine d progress toward the 
Committee’s inflation objective i n order to maintain the credib ility of the 
Committee’s 2 percent inflation goal. 
 Policymakers might also judge that inflation dynamics in recent decades demonstrate 
that the Phillips curve is fairly flat, implying that greater resource utilization will have 
only a muted effect on inflation. 
 Policymakers might estimate that the neutral federal funds rate is currently well 
below its longer-run level, refle cting restraint on U.S. econom ic activity from 
economic and financial developments abroad, a sustained period of low productivity 
growth, or borrowing conditions that remain tight for some hous eholds and 
businesses.  Policymakers may s ee such headwinds as unlikely to  subside in the near 
term. 
 Some policymakers might regard the prospects for, and compositi on of, fiscal 
stimulus as still highly uncer tain.  They might therefore think  that the optimism that 
recently has been built into asset prices is overdone and likel y to be reversed, at least 
in part.  
 Market participants would be s urprised by a decision to maintai n the target range for 
the federal funds rate:  Responses to the Desk’s latest surveys , like financial market

  quotes, indicate that market pa rticipants now see an approximately 90 percent 
probability that the Committee will raise the target range at t his meeting.  Going 
forward, market partic ipants attach notably smaller probabiliti es to federal funds rate 
outcomes at or below 1 percent at the end of 2017. 
o Financial market participants would likely push further into th e future the 
expected date of the next rate increase, the expected path for the federal funds 
rate would likely flatten, and longer-term yields would likely decline.  
o If the statement is primarily i nterpreted as signaling a more a ccommodative 
stance than anticipated, equit y prices and inflation compensati on would likely 
rise, and the dollar w ould depreciate.  Conversely, if investor s read the 
statement as reflecting an unexp ectedly downbeat assessment of the economic 
outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation could fall.  
THE CASE FOR CONTINGENCY ALTERNATIVE B′ 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The unemployment rate in January was at or near many participan ts’ estimates of its 
longer-run normal level, and staff made no material changes to its near-term labor 
market forecast in reaction to the January employment report an d other recent 
indicators.  Staff currently projects that total payroll employ ment will increase 
182,000 in February, roughly in line with private s ector forecasters.  These 
predictions are notably above t he pace estimated to be consiste nt with the longer-run 
trend in labor force growth—between 75,000 and 125,000 per mont h.  However, if 
the employment report for Februa ry is significan tly weaker than  anticipated, the 
Committee might want to consider Alternative Bʹ. 
Policy Strategy 
 Should the employment report tu rn out to be particularly disapp ointing, policymakers 
may be concerned that the combination of sharply slowing employment growth and a 
rising unemployment rate in recen t months could signal that the  economy is not 
evolving as expected.  Accordingly, the Committee might choose to leave unchanged 
the target range for the federal  funds rate as well as its comm unications about the 
likely future path of that rate  “while assessing whether incomi ng information is 
consistent with the Committee’s current economic outlook.”

   Even if they anticipate that t he appropriate path for the feder al funds rate might be 
somewhat steeper or somewhat less steep than suggested by the D ecember SEP, 
policymakers may still see the pace of likely rate increases as  “gradual” by historical 
standards.  If so, they may see  paragraph 4 of Alternative Bʹ, as appropriately 
preserving the Committee’s flexibility going forward.  
 Current pricing of federal funds  futures and options suggests t hat financial market 
participants attach only a small probability to a decision to m aintain the current target 
range for the federal funds rat e.  Of course, the perceived pro bability could increase 
substantially if the March 10 emp loyment report turns out to be  quite weak.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared two proj ections of the Federal Reserve’s  balance sheet and 
key elements of the associated income statement.  The projectio ns are distinguished by 
the assumed longer-run level of reserve balances.  Both project ions are consistent with 
the interest rate paths incorpor ated in the staff’s baseline economic outlook presented in 
Tealbook A.1 
 In the “March Tealbook baseline” scenario, the longer-run level  of reserve balances is 
assumed to be $100 billion.2  In this scenario the federal f unds rate is projected to rise 
to 4 percent by the end of  2021, before moving down to 3 percen t by the end of the 
projection period.  Longer-term inte rest rates generally follow  a similar pattern, 
reaching peak levels slightly ear lier before declining somewhat throughout the 
remainder of the projection period. 
 In the “$500 billion reserves” scenario, the longer-run level of reserve balances is 
assumed to be $500 billion.  The inter est rate paths associated  with this scenario are 
very similar to those i n the baseline scenario. 
The key policy assumptions associat ed with the two projections are highlighted below. 
 Reinvestment policy:   We continue to assume that the FOMC will cease 
reinvestments of principal repa yments on securities in the Syst em Open Market 
Account when the target range for the federal funds rate reache s 1¼ to 1½ percent. 
(See the accompanying box for a s ummary of when and how respondents to the 
Desk’s surveys expect the Comm ittee’s reinvestment policy to ch ange.)   As in the 
previous Tealbook, reinvestments cease in full at the end of th e third quarter of 2017 
under both scenarios.  Thereafter , the SOMA portfolio shrinks passively until reserve 
                                                 
1 In these scenarios, the respons e of the federal funds rate to deviations of inflation and the output 
gap from their baseline values i s determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) policy rule. 
2 For a discussion of key factors that have increased the demand  for reserve balan ces over the past 
10 years, see the appendix of the memo “Changing the FOMC’s Rei nvestment Policy:  Approaches and 
Considerations” that was distributed to the FOMC on March 3, 20 17.

 Expectations  for Changes  to Reinvestment  Policy  
The Desk’s  latest Surveys of  Primary Dealers and Market Participants  indicate that 
respondents  hold diffuse views, within certain ranges, of  when the  Committee will 
first announce  a change  in its reinvestment policy  and of what the  level of the federal 
funds rate will be  at that time.  
The March survey  asked respondents  to provide a point estimate and  probability  
distribution  for the level of  the federal funds  rate expected  to prevail  when the  
Committee first  announces  a change  to its reinvestment policy.1  The median point 
estimate was 1.625 percent,  but, as shown in  figure 1, respondents  on average 
assigned only a 30 percent  probability  to the federal funds  rate being  between 1.51  
and 1.75 percent when a change in reinvestment policy  is announced.2  The reported  
probabilities  of the federal funds rate falling  within any  particular  range varied  
considerably  across respondents,  except that nearly all respondents  saw a 5 percent 
or lower probability  of an announcement  occurring  before the federal funds  rate 
exceeds 1 percent.
Figure 2 plots respondents’  point estimates  of the expected  level of the federal funds  
rate at the time  of a change  in reinvestment policy,  as reported  in the March surveys,  
against their responses  to the January surveys.3  A majority  of the dots in the scatter 
plot lie above the 45‐degree line, indicating  that most respondents  now expect a 
higher level of the federal funds  rate to  prevail when  reinvestment  policy is first 
                                                 
1 The surveys pose these  questions  only to those participants  that assign some positive 
probability  to the Committee  making a future change to its reinvestments  policy. 
2 In figure 1, and similarly in figure 3 below,  the size of the green bubbles represents  the number

  changed.  When  asked to explain  the factors behind changes in their views, two 
factors commonly  cited were an expected  earlier start  or faster pace of rate hikes in  
2017, and recent Federal Reserve  communications.  
Figure 3 summarizes  respondents’  probability  distributions  for the timing  of the first 
announcement  of a change  in reinvestment policy.   Respondents  on average assigned  
a 44 percent probability  to an announcement  occurring  in the fourth quarter of 2017 
or the first quarter of 2018, and  the vast majority of respondents  assigned  a 5 percent 
or lower probability  to a policy  change announcement  occurring  before the third 
quarter of 2017.  The repor ted probabilities  of a policy change announcement  
occurring  at any particular  time, however,  were diverse.  Figure 4  plots respondents’  
expectations  for the most  likely timing of a policy change announcement  derived from  
their responses  to the March and January surveys.4  While a majority  of respondents  
revised earlier their  modal expectations,  the average expectation did  not change 
significantly.5  
 
The Desk’s  surveys also asked for respondents’  views on whether  the Committee  will 
cease reinvestments  all at once, phase out  reinvestments  over time,  or not change its 
reinvestment  policy during the process of policy normalization.  The  median 
respondent attached  roughly a 75 percent likelihood  to the Committee  phasing out 
reinvestments  over time,  little changed  from recent surveys.  The median expectation 
was that reinvestments  of Treasury  securities  and MBS would each be phased out 
over 12 mont hs, the same as in the December  Primary Dealer Survey.6 
                                                 
4 For each respondent  the date plotted for the March surveys is the date or average  of dates for 
which the respondent  reported  the highest likelihood  of a policy change announcement.  The date 
plotted for the January  survey is derived from the number of months forward the respondent  first 
expected  a change in reinvestment  policy for either Treasuries  or MBS. 
5 In the January  surveys, the median estimate for the most likely timing  of the first  change in 
reinvestment  policy, across both asset classes,  was about  12 months forward, corresponding  to 
January  2018.  In the March surveys,  the median of the modes of individual  views  of this timing 
derived from their probability  distributions  of timing  outcomes  was quite  similar—the  first  quarter 
of 2018. 
6 Note that the December  Survey of Market Participants  did not ask about  the number of 
months over  which  reinvestments  would be phased out.

 balances reach their assumed longer-run level of either $100 bi llion, in the baseline 
scenario, or $500 billion, in t he alternative scenario. 
 Use of policy normalization tools:   We continue to assume that take-up of overnight 
reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion un til the level of 
reserve balances is closer to i ts longer-run leve l.  More speci fically, in each scenario, 
once the level of reserve bala nces is within $500 billion of it s assumed longer-run 
level, ON RRP take-up declines  to zero over the course of one year.3  
Key features of the two scenar ios are described below: 
 Balance sheet.   Under the Tealbook baseline sce nario, normalization of the size  of 
the balance sheet occurs in the  first quarter of 2022, the same quarter as in the 
$100 billion reserve scenario in t he January Tealbook (see the exhibit titled “Total 
Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).4  At 
the time reserve balances reac h $100 billion, total assets are projected to stand at 
roughly $2.4 trillion, with about $2.3 trillion in total SOMA securities holdings 
composed of $1.1 trillion of T reasury securities and $1.2 trill ion of MBS.  Total 
assets and SOMA Treasury holdings r ise thereafter , keeping pace  with the projected 
increases in Federal Reserve not es in circulation and Federal R eserve Bank capital. 
Under the $500 billion reserves scenario, the size of the portf olio is normalized in the 
first quarter of 2021, four quarter s earlier than projected in the baseline scenario (see 
the dotted red lines and the corresponding table that follows),  reflecting the higher 
longer-run level of reserve bala nces and the resulting need to hold a commensurately 
larger securities portfolio.  At that time, total assets are pr ojected to be about $2.8 
trillion, with total SOMA secu rities holdings of $2.6 trillion.  
                                                 
3 The use of ON RRPs results in a shift in the composition of Fe deral Reserve liabilities—a 
decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in RRP s—but does not produ ce an overall change 
in the size of the balance sheet  unless ON RRP take-up continue s after the size of the balance sheet is 
normalized.  Separately, we assu me that RRPs associated with fo reign official and international accounts 
remain throughout the projection period near their January 31, 2017 level of $263 billion. 
4 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized when  the securities portfolio reverts to 
the level consistent with its lo nger-run trend; this trend is determined largely by the rising level of Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and the assumed long-run level of reserve balances and other Federal Reserve 
liabilities.

  Federal Reserve remittances.   Under both the baseline and $500 billion reserves 
scenarios, remittances are projected to decline from $92 billio n in 2016 to about 
$74 billion this year (see the “I ncome Projections” exhibit).  The step-down reflects 
increased interest expense resulting from the December 2016 inc rease in the target 
range for the federal funds rate and the staff forecast of furt her increases in that target 
range over the course of this year.5  Annual remittances are projected to continue to 
decline in coming years, reaching a low of roughly $36 billion in 2020 under the 
baseline scenario, as the size of the SOMA portfolio falls and the target range for the federal funds rate increases further.  Subsequently, remittances gradually increase as 
higher-yielding Treasury securiti es are added to the SOMA portf olio.  The remittance 
paths are similar for both s cenarios, though underlying interest income and expense 
differ after 2020.  No deferred asset is projected under either scenario.
6  
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of a bout $82 billion at the end of Feb ruary.7  Going forward, 
the net unrealized gain or lo ss position of the portfolio will depend primarily on the 
path of longer-term interest rates.  Because these rates are as sumed to rise over the 
next several years in both scenar ios, the portfolio is projecte d to shift to an unrealized 
loss position in the third quarter of 2017, the same timing as in the January Tealbook.  
The portfolio is expected to record a peak unrealized loss of $ 197 billion in 2019, 
about $68 billion of which is attri butable to holdings of Treas ury securities and 
$129 billion to holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss po sition then narrows 
through the remainder of the pr ojection period, as the value of securities previously 
acquired under the large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) returns to par as 
those securities approach matur ity and new securities are added  to the portfolio at 
prevailing market yields. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” under the baseline scenario, the securities held in the SOMA 
                                                 
5 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the 
effective federal funds rate.  We  also continue to assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve 
balances will be set at the top of  the range, and that the offe ring rate on ON RRPs w ill be set at the bottom 
of the range.  
6 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury.  
7 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

 portfolio as a result of the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs and reinve stments are estimated 
to be depressing the term prem ium embedded in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield 
by 87 basis points in the current  quarter.  The evolution of th e estimated term 
premium effect depends importan tly on the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s 
balance sheet over coming years relative to a benchmark counterfactual projection for 
the balance sheet that excludes the effects of asset purchases.  The term premium 
effect under the baseline scenar io gradually fades over time, reflecting the 
convergence of the balance shee t to the path implied by the cou nterfactual projection. 
Under the $500 billion reserves s cenario, the estimated term premium effect is a bit 
more negative than under the base line projection.  Relative to the baseline scenario, 
the Federal Reserve permanentl y holds a larger securities portf olio after the size of 
the balance sheet normalizes, which depresses the term premium embedded in  
longer-term Treasury s ecurities.  The difference in the term pr emium effects between 
the two scenarios peaks at a bout 8 basis points around the time  the balance sheet has 
normalized under the baseline scenario.  
 SOMA characteristics.  Portfolio characteristics a re roughly the same under both 
scenarios until the start of 2021, when the size of the balance  sheet normalizes under 
the $500 billion reserves scenario.  
Approximately $195 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings have already matured or 
will mature this year, and a total of nearly $1.3 trillion will  mature between 2017 and 
2020 (see the top panel of the exhi bit, “Projections for the Ch aracteristics of SOMA 
Holdings”).8  The amount of Treasury securi ties maturing each month will va ry 
considerably over time, while projected MBS paydowns implied by  the staff’s 
prepayments model vary less.  Realized MBS paydowns will reflec t the evolution of 
                                                 
8 Under the FOMC’s current reinvestment policy, the Desk replace s maturing Treasury security 
holdings with newly issued debt  at Treasury auctions.  Consiste nt with longstanding practice, these 
rollovers are carried out at Tr easury auctions by placing bids for the SOMA in a par amount equal to the 
face value of holdings maturing on the issue date of newly issu ed securities.  Moreover, across the various 
maturities, these bids are placed  proportionately to the issue amounts of the new sec urities offered.  The 
Desk’s bids at Treasury auctions  are placed as noncompetitive t enders and are treat ed by Treasury as  
add-ons to announced auction sizes.

 interest rates and other factor s, and thus could be significantly more volatile than 
projected.9 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6¼ years (see the middle panel, “SOMA Weighted-Average Treasury  Duration”).  
The weighted-average duration i s projected to decline slightly this year, as the 
securities in the por tfolio approach maturity, and to rise subsequently until the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized.10  After reaching its peak, duration is projected to 
again decline as the D esk restarts open market purchases of Tre asury securities to 
keep pace with the increase in Federal Reserve notes in circula tion and Federal 
Reserve Bank capital.  The durat ion contour in this latter port ion of the projection is 
based on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will limit its  purchases to Treasury 
bills until they account for one-third of the Treasury portfoli o, similar to the pre-crisis 
composition of the portfolio (currently SOMA holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread acros s the maturity

9 Over the intermeeting period, the Desk reinvested $20 billion of maturing Treasury securities 
and is expected to purchase a to tal of $38 billion of 15- and 3 0-year agency MBS under the reinvestment 
program. 
10 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 a s the pace of roll-offs accelerates  and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o, causing duration to increase until the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized. 
11 We assume zero purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments of such securities cease.
