Two key questions for the Committ ee as it makes its policy deci sions at this 
meeting are:  first, whether the  available information warrants  raising the federal funds 
rate; and second, whether the recen t data call for repeating vi ews about the economic 
outlook, associated risks, and likel y path for the federal fund s rate contained in recent 
FOMC statements or, instead, ca ll for signaling a somewhat different economic outlook 
and policy path.  Averaging through recent fluctuations in the monthly data, information 
received since the Committee met in March indicates that the la bor market has continued 
to strengthen in the first quart er even as growth in economic a ctivity slowed.  Measured 
on a 12-month basis, all-items P CE inflation has been running close to 2 percent in recent 
months, but core PCE inflation ha s continued to run somewhat be low 2 percent.  The 
headline CPI registered a surpr ising decline in March, as did t he index excluding food 
and energy.  The advance GDP report for 2017:Q1 will be released on April 28, and data on personal income and outlays in March—along with the PCE pric e indexes—will be 
issued on May 1.  Consequently, the first paragraph of each draft statement may need to 
be updated ahead of the FOMC meeting. 
 The draft statements for each A lternative offer somewhat differ ent characterizations 
of the most recent information on inflation, labor market condi tions, and economic 
activity. 
o All three Alternatives report that the 12-month change in consu mer prices has 
recently been running close to the Committee’s 2 percent object ive.  All three 
also report that, excluding energy and food, “inflation continu ed to run 
somewhat below 2 percent.” Altern ative A, unlike the others, em phasizes that 
although overall inflation has increased in recent quarters, th e rise “largely 
reflected the temporary effects  of higher energy prices.”  Whil e Alternative C 
makes no mention of the surpris ing drop in core consumer prices  in March, 
Alternatives A and B refer to it explicitl y.  Both Alternatives  A and B also 
drop the reference to core inflation being “little changed” tha t appeared in the 
March statement.  In describing lon ger-term inflation expectati ons, 
Alternatives A and B characterize market-based measures of infl ation 
compensation as remaining low, while Alternative C states that such measures 
are little changed.  All three Al ternatives note that survey-ba sed measures of 
expected inflation are little changed.

o Alternatives A and B indicate that  the labor market “has contin ued to 
strengthen,” while Alternative C  notes that the labor market “h as continued to 
tighten in recent months.”  More over, Alternative A—in contrast  to the 
statements in Alternatives B a nd C—downplays the decline in the  
unemployment rate while emphasi zing that job gains slowed and t hat wage 
pressures remained subdued. 
o All of the Alternatives recognize that growth in economic activ ity and in 
consumer spending has slowed.  A lternatives B and C suggest tha t the slowing 
may be transitory by observing that some key determinants of consumer 
spending—household income and wea lth, and consumer sentiment—re main 
favorable.  Alternative A instea d observes that growth of real PCE 
“weakened” and does not mention positive fundamentals.  All thr ee 
alternatives acknowle dge that business fixe d investment firmed somewhat; 
alternative C adds that housi ng investment expanded strongly. 
 The description of the Committee’ s view of the medium-term outlook is little 
changed from the March statement:  Each Alternative again state s that economic 
activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market condition s will strengthen 
somewhat further, and inflati on will stabilize around 2 percent in the medium term.  
Alternatives A and B continue to condition this outlook on “gradual adjustments” to 
the stance of monetary policy.  Alt ernative C incorporates an immediate increase in 
the target range for the feder al funds rate and conditions the economic outlook on 
“further” gradual adjustments .  Following the acknowledgement o f mixed incoming 
data in paragraph 1, Alternatives B and C emphasize that the Co mmittee “views the 
slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory” and Alternative B 
reports that the Committee “continues to expect” the stated outlook and policy rate 
path; this language was not in the  March statement.  The formul ations in Alternatives 
B and C are intended to indicate that the Committee views the r ecent data as not 
having appreciably changed the l ikelihood of an increase in the  target range in June. 
 All of the draft statements ret ain the assessment that near-ter m risks to the economic 
outlook “appear roughly balanced.” 
 Under Alternatives A and B, the Committee would maintain the cu rrent ¾ to 1 
percent target range for the f ederal funds rate.  Under Alterna tive C, the Committee 
would raise the target range t o 1 to 1¼ percent.  The three dra ft statements continue to 
indicate that the stance of monetary policy “remains accommodat ive” thereby 
supporting “a sustained retur n to 2 percent inflation.”

 In broad terms, the Alternatives pr ovide similar descriptions o f the prospects for 
future increases in the federal funds rate.  However, while Alternatives A and B note 
that the Committee expects that  economic conditions will warrant “gradual increases” 
in the federal funds rate, Altern ative C uses, instead, “additi onal gradual increases,” 
suggesting a somewhat steeper path for the federal funds rate. 
 None of the three draft statemen ts incorporates a change in the  description of the 
Committee’s reinvestment policy.  Should the Committee prefer t o indicate that it 
anticipates changing its reinvest ment policy in the near future , it could draw on 
illustrative language contained in the memos on reinvestment th at were distributed on 
April 21.

MARCH 2017  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee me t in February 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic activity 
has continued to expand at a m oderate pace. Job gains remained solid and the 
unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.  Househo ld spending has 
continued to rise moderately wh ile business fixed investment ap pears to have firmed 
somewhat.  Inflation has increas ed in recent quarters, moving c lose to the 
Committee’s 2 percent longer-run obj ective; excluding energy an d food prices, 
inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat belo w 2 percent. Market-
based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-bas ed measures of 
longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balan ce. 
2. Consistent with its statutory m andate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee expects that, wi th gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace, labor market c onditions will strengthen somewhat further, and 
inflation will stabilize around 2 p ercent over the medium term.   Near-term risks to the 
economic outlook appear roughly bala nced.  The Committee contin ues to closely 
monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. 
3. In view of realized and expecte d labor market conditions and in flation, the Committee 
decided to raise the  target range for the  federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent. The 
stance of monetary policy rema ins accommodative, thereby suppor ting some further 
strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return  to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and si ze of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committ ee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its objectiv es of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pr essures and inflation 
expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative 
to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that eco nomic conditions will 
evolve in a manner that will wa rrant gradual increases in the f ederal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to r emain, for some time, below le vels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the fede ral funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 
5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed sec urities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of  rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doi ng so until normalization of the  level of the federal funds 
rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of longer-
term securities at sizable level s, should help maintain accommo dative financial 
conditions.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Although data released during the  intermeeting period were mixe d, the staff and 
private sector forecasters have generally not made large change s to their medium-
term economic projections. 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen.  Payroll 
growth slowed in March after a l arge increase in February.  Unu sually mild weather 
boosted the gains in February and held them down in March; the increase in March 
was further restrained by unusually severe weather during the March survey’s 
reference period.  The three-month average of total payroll gai ns for the first quarter 
was 178,000 per month, above the staff’s estimate of trend growth in the labor force.  
The labor force participation rat e has held steady, despite the  downward pressure 
associated with the aging of the population.  The unemployment rate declined in 
March and lies below most partic ipants’ estimat es of its longer -run normal level 
reported in the March SEP. 
 Real GDP growth for the fir st quarter of 2017 is estimated by t he staff to be around 1 
percent.  Notably, growth of personal consumption expenditures slowed substantially 
in the first quarter, but househol ds’ real income and wealth continued to increase and 
consumer sentiment remained elevated.  Consequently, the staff expects growth of 
personal consumption expenditures and real GDP to bounce back in the current quarter. 
 Total PCE price inflation is st ill projected to stabilize around 2 percent in the medium 
term.  Twelve-month headline PCE inflation, at 2.1 percent in F ebruary, moved a bit 
above the FOMC’s 2 percent object ive.  However, as the increase over recent quarters 
in large part reflects a tempor ary rise in consumer energy pric es, the increase of total 
inflation above 2 percent ma y be short-lived.  If upcoming data  are in line with the 
staff’s projections, the 12-mont h change in PCE prices will mov e down to 1.9 percent 
in March and then average ar ound 1.8 percent over the next six months as energy 
prices level off.  The staff pr ojects headline inflation to slo wly rise to 1.9 percent in 
2019 and to 2 percent thereafter.  
 The staff projects that the 12-m onth change in core PCE prices,  which has been 
running close to 1.75 percent recently, will move down to 1.6 p ercent in March and 
April, reflecting the recent surprise decline in total and core  CPI inflation.  The staff 
Alternatives

expects 12-month core PCE inflation to run near 1.7 percent fro m June through 
September and to move up to 2 percent by 2019. 
 Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation rem ain low by 
historical standards, with 5-year , 5-year-forward CPI inflation  compensation a bit 
below 2 percent, essentially the same as at the time of the Mar ch FOMC meeting.  
Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are mixed:  Although 
the median 10-year inflation proje ction for PCE prices reported  in the latest reading 
of the Survey of Professional Forecasters ticked up 0.1 percent age point in February, 
it has been essentially flat at 2 percent sinc e early 2013.  Th e 3-year-ahead measure of 
inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations decrea sed by ¼ percentage point to 2.7 percent in March, 
after a series of increases s ince October 2016.  Median 5-year inflation expectations 
in the Michigan survey decline d from 2.6 percent in January to 2.5 percent in 
February and to 2.4 percent in M arch, then held steady in the p reliminary April 
reading.

Policy Strategy 
 If policymakers viewed the sof ter spending and inflation data r eceived over the 
intermeeting period as primarily r eflecting transitory factors,  they may prefer to 
indicate no appreciable change i n their outlook for the economy  or in their assessment 
of the appropriate path for monetary policy.  Alternatively, if  policymakers are 
uncertain about the reasons for the unexpected weakness in cons umer spending and 
inflation, they may decide that it is premature to reach or exp ress a judgment about 
the implications for the outlook.  
 The continuing uncertainty about the timing, size, and composit ion of prospective 
changes in fiscal policy is anot her reason policymakers may sti ll consider it 
premature to communicate that the y see an apprecia ble change in the path of the 
federal funds rate that would be  consistent with achieving thei r statutory goals.   
 Even if they judge that the appr opriate path for the federal fu nds rate has steepened, 
participants may still see the pace of likely rate increases as  gradual by historical 
standards, although faster than observed in 2016.

 Reflecting an expectation that the  neutral rate of interest wil l rise only gradually 
toward its longer-run level, polic ymakers might expect that the  appropriate pace of 
further increases in the target range will continue to be gradu al.   
 Accordingly, policymakers may pref er a statement like Alternati ve B in which they 
leave unchanged, for now, both the t arget range for the federal  funds rate and their 
communications about the likely f uture path of that rate.  Issu ing a statement like 
Alternative B likely would kee p the option of a rate hike at th e June meeting firmly 
on the table. 
 As shown in figure 1 of the box “Mo netary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty,” 
financial market quotes embed a zero probability that the Commi ttee will raise the 
target range at the May mee ting and about a 70 percent probability of a rate hike at 
the June meeting (figure 1).  Res pondents to the Desk’s latest Surveys of Primary 
Dealers and Market Participants largely concur w ith this assess ment and assign a 
probability of about 60 percent to a rate increase in June (fig ure 2).   
o Given current expectations, the decision to leave the target range unchanged 
in this Alternative is unlikely to generate appreciable reactio ns in financial 
markets. 
 Some respondents to the Desk Surveys indicated that they expect  the Committee to 
acknowledge slowing growth in eco nomic activity in the first qu arter but to also point 
to transitory factors.  Some al so expect the statement to note further improvement in 
labor market conditions, reflecting the decline in the unemploy ment rate in the March 
employment report.  Respondents  do not expect material change t o the language on 
forward guidance or the Committee’s reinvestment policy.  Respondents broadly 
expect the Committee to maintai n its characterization of risks to the economic 
outlook. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Labor market conditions, already tight at the time of the March  meeting, have 
continued to tighten.  The unemp loyment rate declined to 4.5 pe rcent in March—
below most participants’ estim ates of its longer-run normal lev el.  The three-month 
moving average of total payroll ga ins remains well above estima tes of the pace 
needed to maintain a constant  unemployment rate over time.

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Market participants  appear to see negligible  probability  of a rate hike at the May FOMC 
meeting and more than even odds  on the next rate increase occurring  at the June 
meeting.   The market‐implied probability  of a June rate hike declined earlier in the period, 
but moved  up following  the first round of the French  presidential elections  to about 70 
percent, a little over  10 percentage  points higher than at the time  of the March meeting 
(figure 1).  The Desk’s May Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants  show a 
similar  distribution  for the timing  of the next rate hike (figure 2). 
Looking further ahead, the probability  distribution  of the federal funds  rate at the end of 
2017 implied  by quotes on Eurodollar  futures options  under the assumption  of zero term 
premiums  shifted  to the left; it now shows  about equal odds  of one or two more 25‐basis‐
point  rate hikes  this year (figure 3).  The distribution from the May Desk Surveys also 
shifted  slightly to the left but still attaches the highest  odds  to two more rate hikes by 
year‐end (figure 4).  Beyond the current year, the median of survey respondents’  modal 
expectations  (not shown) continues  to imply three rate hikes in 2018 and two in 2019 as 
the most  likely outcome.    
On net over the intermeeting  period,  the federal funds rate path through the end of 2020 
implied  by a straight read of OIS quotes (the  blue lines  in figure 5) rotated down by 38 
basis points, contributing  to the about 30 basis point  decline in five‐ and ten‐year nominal 
Treasury yields over the same period.  Prior  to the March meeting,  investors  had marked 
up their policy expectations,  reportedly  in response  to the strong February  employment 
report and FOMC communications  in early March that were read as signaling more near‐
term rate increases  than had been expect ed.  The FOMC’s  communications  following  the 
March meeting were interpreted  as more accommodative  than expected,  however,  and 
the market‐based policy path flattened.   Subsequently,  the implied  path declined further, 
reflecting  waning  investor  optimism  about potential  expansionary  fiscal policy and rising 
concerns  about geopolitical  risks,  although  the implied  path rebounded  somewhat  
following  the first round of the French  presidential elections.   
Assuming  zero term premiums,  market‐implied  forward rates  currently  indicate  that the 
target rate will reach around 1.3 and 1.6 percent  by the end of 2017 and 2018,  respectively, 
and 1.9 percent by the end of 2020.  The staff’s OIS‐based  term structure  model, which 
takes  the effective lower  bound into account  and incorporates  information  from Blue Chip 
survey forecasts  of the federal funds rate,  attributes  about half of the decline in the 
market‐implied rates  over the intermeeting  period to more negative term premiums.   The 
expect ed path from that model (the black lines  in figure 5) suggests  that the federal funds 
rate will rise at a somewhat  faster pace, with  the funds rate reaching 1.6 and 2.3 percent 
by the end of 2017 and 2018, and 3 percent by the end of 2020.   The expected  rates 
unadjusted  and adjusted for term premiums at the end of 2020 remain up to 65 and 34 
basis points higher than their pre‐U.S.‐election levels,  respectively,  on net.  
As shown in figure 6, the model‐based  path for the federal funds rate (the black line) is 
roughly consistent  with the modal path from the Desk Surveys (in red) and the 
Committee’s  March median SEP projections  through 2019 (the golden dots).

 Results from the model and the surveys also shed light  on market  participants’  
expectations  of the longer‐run level of the federal funds rate (the far‐right dots  in 
figure 6).  The staff’s  term structure  model continues  to estimate that the federal funds 
rate will reach about 3¾ percent over the next five to ten years, ¾ and 1 percentage  points 
above the median projections  for the longer‐run federal  funds rate from the March SEP 
and from the May  Desk Surveys,  respectively.   The gap between  the estimates  from the 
model and from the Desk Surveys widened a bit compared  with March, as the median 
survey projection  declined 25 basis points while the model estimate  remained  unchanged.  
The Desk’s May Surveys also asked respondents  about their assessment  of the current 
level of the neutral  real federal funds rate,  as well  as its levels at the end of the next three 
years.  Compared  with the results of the December  surveys which last included this 
question,  the median estimate of the current level and the levels at the end of 2017 and 
2019 were unchanged  at ¼, ½, and 1 percent, respectively,  while the level  for the end of 
2018 was revised down by 17½ basis points to ¾ percent. 
With respect  to reinvestmen t policy,  respondents  generally  pulled forward their expected  
timing  when the Committee  first announces  a policy change and revised down the level  of 
the federal funds rate that is expected  to prevail at the time of the announcement.   
Compared  with the March surveys,  respo ndents on average attached higher probabilities  
to an announc ement  of a policy change before the end of this year, and lower 
probabilities  to an announcement  in the second quarter of next year or beyond.  The 
fourth quarter of 2017 was seen as the most likely time  for such an announcement,  with an 
average probability  of nearly 40 percent, up from just below 25 percent in the March 
surveys.   In addition, the probability  distribution  for the level of the federal funds rate at 
the time  of the announcement  (not shown) shifted  slightly to the left and became  a bit 
less diffuse, with respondents  on average attaching  the highest  probability,  at 40 percent, 
to the federal funds rate being between  1.26 and 1.50 percent when a change in 
reinvestment  policy is announced.     
Respondents  on average attached  a 75 percent probability  to reinvestments  being phased 
out rather than stopped all at once or left unchanged,  a bit higher than in the March 
surveys,  and the median estimate suggested that  survey respondents  view 12 months as 
the most  likely length of the phaseout  period for both Treasury securities  and MBS, 
unchanged  from the March surveys.

 The staff estimates growth in r eal GDP in the first quarter of 2017 to be around 1 
percent, largely reflecting slo wer-than-expected growth in pers onal consumption 
expenditures.  The staff sees the slowing as transitory and pro jects strong growth of 
personal consumption expenditures for the rest of the year.  Accordingly, real GDP is 
expected to grow at 2.1 percent  on average this year, a rate that is in excess of growth 
in potential output as estimate d by the staff and FOMC participants.   
 Housing investment has been expanding at a rapid pace and busin ess fixed investment 
has firmed.  Moreover, indicators  of business sentiment continu e to send an upbeat 
signal. 
 Twelve-month headline PCE inflation has risen in recent quarter s and lately has been 
running close to the FOMC’s 2 perc ent objective.  While the sta ff projections for 
headline and core inflation are a  touch lower tha n in the March  Tealbook—in part due 
to the transitory effect of a drop i n the price of  wireless tel ephone services—headline 
PCE inflation is still expected  to run close to 2 percent in th e near term.  Furthermore, 
the trimmed mean PCE inflation measure published by the Federal  Reserve Bank of 
Dallas stands at 1.9 percent for February. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may conclude that the information accumulated since the March 
meeting, in combination with earlie r data, provides ample evidence that the labor 
market is tightening more rapidly than had been expected, and t hat inflation has 
reached 2 percent sooner than had been anticipated, so that a further removal of 
policy accommodation at next week’s  meeting is appropriate.  Th ey might judge that 
with house and equity prices, and t hus household wealth, having climbed 
substantially in the past few  months, and with business and con sumer confidence at 
elevated levels, there is an i ncreasing risk of policymakers “f alling behind the curve” 
if policy firming does not proceed promptly. 
 In addition, policymakers might regard it as prudent for the Committee’s statement to 
include language signaling that the federal funds rate may rise  more quickly than 
previously expected, though stil l at a gradual pace.  To that e nd, the draft statement 
for Alternative C contains additions to the March statement’s description of the gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate:  the word “furth er” in paragraph 2 and 
the word “additional” in paragraph 4.

 Policymakers may be concerned th at, with an economy projected to be operating 
above its longer-run potential, inflation might well increase m ore than the staff 
expects.  This view is consis tent with the possibility of a non linear response of 
inflation to the output gap—a possibility that is explored in t he alternative scenario 
“Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and More Sensitive Long-Run Inflat ion Expectations” 
in the “Risks and Uncertainty ” section of Tealbook A.  Policyma kers may also note 
that when the wage Phillips curve is assumed to be steeper than  under the Tealbook 
baseline, a more rapid pace of po licy tightening can limit the undershooting of 
unemployment below its natural rate and thereby forestall the r ise in inflation, as 
described in the “Monetary Po licy Strategies” section of Tealbo ok A. 
 Policymakers may also be worried that maintaining the federal f unds rate at its 
current low level, or raising it too slowly, will lead to exces sive risk-taking in 
financial markets and that this could pose risks to financial s tability.  
 Respondents to the Desk’s latest  surveys perceive no material o dds that the 
Committee will change the target range at this meeting, and so a decision to increase 
the target range would be very surprising.  
o Signaling that the federal funds  rate may rise more quickly, as  is done in this 
Alternative, could induce financia l market participants to expe ct a somewhat 
more rapid removal of policy a ccommodation, which in turn might  trigger an 
increase in medium- and longer- term yields, a drop in stock pri ces and 
inflation compensation as well as a strengthening of the dollar .  
o If the statement is primarily i nterpreted as signaling a more u pbeat assessment 
of the economic outlook, equ ity prices could rise. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The unemployment rate has decreas ed further, and the labor forc e participation rate 
has held steady, on net, since 2013 even as the population ages .  Meanwhile, 
measures of labor compensation h ave shown hardly any acceleration in recent years.  
These readings, taken together , suggest that there might be mor e “room to run” in the 
labor market. 
 The staff estimates GDP to have increased at an annual rate of only 1 percent in the 
first quarter of 2017, about ½ perc entage point lower than proj ected in the March 
Tealbook, because of an unexpected slowdown in growth of real p ersonal

consumption expenditures.  Althoug h the slowing in consumer spe nding may be 
attributed in part t o transitory factors, non-auto retail sales  were especially weak in 
February and failed to fully rev erse the disappointment in Marc h. 
 Although total PCE price inflati on increased in recent months, the increase largely 
reflected rising consumer energy p rices; core inflation has bee n essentially constant at 
1.7 percent.  In addition, the CPI release for March showed sof tness in components 
other than wireless telephone services, including some that may  carry over into 
coming months.  Total PCE infla tion is now projected to remain below the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective this year. 
 Survey measures of longer-run in flation expectations and readin gs on longer-term 
inflation compensation are stil l low by historical standards. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may view informati on received since the March FOMC  meeting as 
indicating that opportuni ties remain for further improvement in  labor market 
outcomes, particularly for those marginally attached to the workforce.  Moreover, in 
light of how long inflation has b een running below 2 percent, t hey might elect to 
defer any additional increases in the federal funds rate until more evidence emerges 
of sustained progress toward t he Committee’s inflation objectiv e.  They might view 
this approach as helpful in maintaining the credibility of the Committee’s symmetric 
2 percent inflation goal. 
 Policymakers may also prefer t o delay any additional increase i n the policy rate until 
it has been firmly established that the recent weakness in job gains, real activity, and 
inflation is temporary.  Moreove r, they may be concerned that t his weakness in job 
gains and real activity persists in light of the recent slowdow n in bank credit and 
lending. 
 Policymakers may also judge that inflation dynamics in recent d ecades demonstrate 
that the Phillips curve is fairly flat, implying that greater r esource utilization will 
generate only a muted response of inflation and allowing ample time to adopt a policy 
response if one is needed. 
 Policymakers may be concerned that if forecasts of a pickup in inflation prove too 
optimistic, longer-run inflation expectations could decrease.  If this were to occur 
now, after a lengthy period of inflation running below 2 percen t, the credibility of the 
Committee’s commitment to its i nflation objective could suffer.

 Policymakers may estimate that the neutral federal funds rate i s currently well below 
its longer-run level, reflecting restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and 
financial developments abroad, a sustained period of low productivity growth, or 
borrowing conditions that remain tight for some households and businesses.  
Policymakers may see such headwinds as unlikely to subside quic kly. 
 Some policymakers may regard the  prospects of legislative passa ge of a fiscal-
stimulus program, as well as the composition of such a program,  as still highly 
uncertain.  They might therefore think that the optimism built into asset prices 
following the election is over done and likely to be reversed, a t least in part, along the 
lines described in the alternati ve scenario “Broad Policy Disap pointment” in the 
“Risks and Uncertainty ” section of Tealbook A.  
 A decision to maintain the targ et range for the federal funds r ate would be consistent 
with the expectations of marke t participants, but the downbeat characterization of the 
recent data offered by Alternative A might come as a surprise:  Responses to the 
Desk’s latest surveys, like fi nancial market quotes, indicate t hat market participants 
now see no material odds that the Committee will raise the targ et range at this 
meeting.  With respect to langua ge, while respondents generally  do not expect 
significant changes to the FOMC statement, some expect that the  Committee will 
acknowledge a temporary slowing i n economic activity in the fir st quarter. 
o Financial market participants would likely push further into th e future the 
expected date of the next rate increase, the expected path for the federal funds 
rate would likely flatten, and longer-term yields would likely decline.  
o If the statement is primarily i nterpreted as signaling a more a ccommodative 
stance than anticipated, equit y prices and inflation compensati on would likely 
rise, and the dollar w ould depreciate.  Conversely, if investor s read the 
statement as reflecting an unexp ectedly downbeat assessment of the economic 
outlook, equity prices and inflati on compensation could fall.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and key 
elements of the associated income statement under a baseline sc enario and an alternative 
that are consistent with the path s for the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates 
incorporated in the staff’s base line economic outlook presented  in Tealbook A.1   
The two scenarios have differe nt key assumptions about the nature of the change in 
reinvestment policy and the leve l of longer-run reserve balance s:  
 As in the March Tealbook, under the baseline balance sheet scen ario the staff 
assumes that reinvestments of principal repayments of securitie s will cease all at once 
and that the longer-run level  of reserve balances is $100 billion.2   
 In the alternative s cenario—labeled “18-month phaseout”—it is a ssumed that 
reinvestments are gradually re duced over an 18-month period and  that the longer-run 
level of reserve balances is $500 billion.3,4   
The key policy assumptions co mmon to both projections are highl ighted below: 
 Reinvestment policy:   We continue to assume that the FOMC will change its 
reinvestment policy when the tar get range for the federal funds  rate reaches 1¼ to 
                                                 
1 In these scenarios, the respons e of the federal funds rate to deviations of inflation and the output 
gap from their baseline values i s determined by the inertial Taylor (1999) policy rule. 
2 “Principal repayments of secur ities” refers to maturing Treasu ry securities and agency debt as 
well as principal repayments of M BS in the System Open Market A ccount. 
3 The phaseout scenario is consistent with the plan outlined in the memo “Reinvestment Proposal,” 
distributed to the FOMC on April 21, 2017.  Under this plan, th e share of maturing Tr easury securities and 
agency debt as well as principal repayments of MBS that are rei nvested is reduced through decrements of 
15 percentage points every three months, before a final reducti on of 10 percentage points, with all 
reinvestments ceasin g in April 2019. 
4 As indicated in the box “Monetary Policy Expectations and Unce rtainty,” respondents to the 
May Desk Surveys of Primary Deal ers and Market Participants att ached, on average, a 75 percent 
probability to outcomes in which the FOMC chooses to phaseout r einvestments over time.  The median 
expectation for the most likely length of a phaseout period was  12 months, six months shorter than assumed 
in the phaseout scenario.  About one third of the respondents i ndicated 12 months a s the most likely 
phaseout duration, whereas another one third of them expected the phaseout to last longer than one year.

 1½ percent.  As in the previous  Tealbook, the change in policy is assumed to occur in 
October of this year.5 
 Use of policy normalization tools:   We continue to assume that take-up of overnight 
reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion un til the level of 
reserve balances is within $500 billion of its assumed longer-r un level.  Once that 
occurs, ON RRP take-up declines to zero over the course of one year.6  
Key features of the two scenar ios are described below: 
 Balance sheet.   In the baseline scenario, normali zation of the size of the bala nce sheet 
occurs in the first quarter of 2022, when reserve balances reac h $100 billion (see the 
exhibit titled “Tota l Assets and Selected B alance Sheet Items” and the table that 
follows the exhibit).7  At that point, total assets are  projected to stand at roughly  
$2.4 trillion, with about  $2.3 trillion in tot al SOMA securitie s holdings composed of 
$1.1 trillion of Treasury secu rities and $1.2 tri llion of MBS.  Total assets and SOMA 
holdings rise thereafter, keepi ng pace with the projected incre ases in Federal Reserve 
notes in circulation and Fede ral Reserve Bank capital. 
Under the phaseout scenario, th e size of the portf olio is norma lized in the third 
quarter of 2021, about two quarters earlier  than projected in the  baseline scenario (see 
the dotted red lines and the corresponding table that follows).   This feature reflects 
the net effect of two assumpti ons that pull the timing of norma lization in opposite 
directions—the higher assumed level of longer-run reserve balan ces that pulls the 
timing of normalization forward more than offsets the delay in normalization implied 
                                                 
5 In the May Desk Surveys, the me dian respondent’s modal expectation is that the change in 
reinvestment policy will be anno unced when the federal funds ra te reaches the target range of 1¼ to 
1½ percent, which is the same as the target range assumed in both scenarios considered here.  Respondents 
also placed the highest probab ility, on average, of a change be ing announced in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
6 The use of ON RRPs results in a shift in the composition of Fe deral Reserve liabilities—a 
decline in reserve balances and a corresponding increase in RRP s—but does not produ ce an overall change 
in the size of the balance sheet  unless ON RRP take-up continue s after the size of the balance sheet is 
normalized.  Separately, we assu me that RRPs associated with fo reign official and international accounts 
remain throughout the projection period near their March 31, 20 17, level of $253 billion. 
7 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized at t he point when maintaining the

 by the gradual cessation of reinvestments.8  At the time of normalization, total assets 
are projected to be about $2.8 t rillion—about $400 billion larg er than in the baseline 
scenario mostly in light of the assumed higher level of reserve  balances in the 
alternative scenario.  Total SOMA securities holdings at the ti me of normalization 
stand at nearly $2.7 trillion, c onsisting of $1.4 trillion in T reasury securities and 
$1.3 trillion in agency MBS.9 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   In both scenarios, remittances  are projected to decline 
from $92 billion in 2016 to about $75 billion this year (see th e “Income Projections” 
exhibit).  The step-down reflects increased interest expense re sulting from the 
increase in the target range for the feder al funds rate in March and the assumption of 
further increases later this year.10  Under the baseline, remittances are projected to 
continue to decline in coming years, reaching a low of about $3 0 billion in 2019 as 
the size of the SOMA portfolio f alls and the target range for t he federal funds rate 
increases further.  Subsequentl y, remittances gradually increas e as higher-yielding 
Treasury securities are added to the SOMA portfolio.  The path for remittances 
implied by the alternative scenario is broadly similar, even as underlying interest 
income and expense differ after 2020.  No deferred asset is pro jected under either 
scenario.11  
 Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of a bout $70 billion at the end of Mar ch.12  The net 
                                                 
8 Under a scenario with cessation all at once and a level of lon ger-run reserves of $500 billion, the 
size of the balance sh eet is normalized about four quarters ear lier than in the baseline. 
9 The May Desk Survey of Primary Dealers asked a new question about the most likely size and 
composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, on average,  in 2025 (and conditional on not returning 
to the zero lower bound before t he end of 2025).  The median es timate across dealers for the size of the 
balance sheet in 2025 is $3.1 trillion, while the median estimate for the level of reserves was $600 billion.  
For assets, the median estimate for the portfolio share of Trea sury securities is 75 per cent, while the share 
for agency MBS is 20 percent.  In  the phaseout scenario, the si ze of the Federal Reser ve’s balance sheet in 
2025 is also $3.1 trillion, while  the portfolio shares for Trea sury securities and MB S are about 70 and 
30 percent, respectively. 
10 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the 
effective federal funds rate.  We  also continue to assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve 
balances and the offering rate o n ON RRPs will be set at the top and the bottom of the range, respectively.  
11 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury.  
12 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

 unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio going forward  will depend primarily 
on the path of longer-term interest rates.  In both scenarios, it is assumed that these 
rates will rise over the next sev eral years, and as a result, the portfolio is projected to 
shift to an unrealized loss position at the end of this year.  The portfolio is expected to 
record a peak unrealized lo ss of roughly $200 billion at the end of 2019, about 
$70 billion of which is attributab le to holdings of Treasury securities and $130 billion 
to holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position then narrows through the 
remainder of the projection peri od, as the value of securities previously acquired 
under the large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) returns t o par with those 
securities approaching maturity. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” under the baseline scenario, the securities held in the SOMA 
portfolio as a result of the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs and reinve stments are estimated 
to be depressing the term prem ium embedded in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield 
by 83 basis points in the current  quarter.  The evolution of th e estimated term 
premium effect depends importa ntly on how the expected path of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet in coming years departs from a benchmar k counterfactual 
projection for the balance sheet that excludes the effects of a sset purchases.  The term 
premium effect gradually fades  over time, reflecting the conver gence of the balance 
sheet to the path implied by the  counterfactual projection. 
Under the phaseout scenario, the estimated term premium effect is about 9 basis 
points more negative throughout the  projection period than unde r the baseline 
projection, with the difference reflecting two factors that dep ress the term premium 
embedded in longer-term Treasury securities.  First, the securi ties portfolio declines 
at a slower pace if reinvestments are phased out.  Second, rela tive to the baseline 
scenario, the Federal Reserve pe rmanently holds a larger securities portfolio after the 
size of the balance sheet normalizes.   
SOMA redemptions.  In both scenarios, the value of  Treasury securities maturing 
each month varies over time, with large maturities occurring du ring mid-quarter 
refunding months; the value of mat uring Treasury securities is known by the public 
and the Federal Reserve with certainty.  MBS paydowns are projected to run at a 
fairly steady monthly pace, give n the assumed path of longer-te rm interest rates.

 However, realized MBS paydowns reflect the evolution of interes t rates and other 
factors and thus could differ si gnificantly from projected values. 
A key difference across the two s cenarios, by construction, is the amount of 
redemptions of Treasury securi ties and agency MBS through the m edium term.  
These differences are illustrate d in the “Redemptions” exhibit.   The top panel shows 
maturing Treasury securities and projected principal repayments  of MBS for the 
baseline scenario in which reinvestments are assumed to cease a ll at once, while the 
bottom panel shows redemptions for the phaseout scenario.    
Under the baseline scenario, a total of $426 billion of Treasur y securities is projected 
to mature in 2018, while in the phaseout scenario redemptions a re almost half that 
level over the same period.  Sim ilarly, projected MBS redemptio ns next year are 
nearly twice as large in the ba seline scenario as in the phaseo ut scenario.  
Reinvestments decline to zero i n the phaseout scenario in April  2019; after that, 
redemptions are slightly higher under the phaseout scenario than under the baseline, 
reflecting the principal repaymen ts of securities that were rol led over between 
October 2017 and March 2019.   
 SOMA characteristics.  The weighted-average dur ation of the SOMA Treasury 
portfolio is currently about 6¼ y ears (see the top panel of “Pr ojections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Holdings” exhibit).  In the baseline sc enario, the weighted-
average duration is projected to d ecline slightly this year as the securities in the 
portfolio approach maturity, a nd to rise subsequently until lat e 2021.13  Under the 
phaseout scenario, the projected weighted-average duration foll ows a similar path but 
at a lower level than in the ba seline scenario, reflecting reinvestments into some 
shorter-tenor securities during the 18-month phaseout period.14 
After reaching its peak in both the baseline and phaseout scena rios, duration is 
projected to resume its decline as the Des k restarts open marke t purchases of 
Treasury securities to keep pace w ith the increase in Federal R eserve notes in 
                                                 
13 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 when the pace of  roll-offs picks up and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o, causing duration to increase until the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized.  
14 As in the baseline scenario, po rtfolio duration under the phas eout scenario rises s tarting in 2018.  
However, since a portion of the m aturing securities is reinvest ed in 2-, 5-, and 7-year Treasury securities, 
the resulting larger holdings of  these shorter-tenor securities  than in the baseline imply a lower duration 
path.

 circulation and Federal Reserve  Bank capital.  The duration con tour in this latter 
portion of each projection is base d on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will 
limit its purchases to Treasur y bills until they account for one-third of the Treasury 
portfolio, similar to its pre-crisis composition (currently SOMA holds no Treasury 
bills).  Thereafter, purchases of Treasury securities are assum ed to be spread across 
the maturity spectrum (see the bot tom panel, “Maturity Composit ion of SOMA 
Treasury Portfolio”).15
