Monetary Policy Alternatives 
Data received since the Committee met in May indicate that the labor market 
continued to strengthen and that growth in economic activity has picked up appreciably 
during the current quarter.  How ever, recent readings on total and core PCE price 
inflation have been noticeabl y below 2 percent.  Two key questi ons for the Committee as 
it makes its policy decisions at this meeting ar e:  first, whet her the available information 
on the labor market and inflation w arrants raising the federal funds rate immediately; and 
second, whether the Committee should announce, in its June post meeting statement, that 
it expects to change its reinve stment policy either at this mee ting or later this year.  For 
the Committee’s consideration as it deliberates, this Tealbook contains three draft 
statements, labeled Alternatives A, B, and C. 
 The Alternatives offer somewhat different characterizations of the most recent 
information on labor market condi tions, economic activity, and inflation. 
o Each Alternative notes that the unemployment rate has declined,  but the 
Alternatives differ in their ass essment of the state of the lab or market.  
Alternatives A and B characteri ze the labor market as continuin g to 
“strengthen,” while Alternative C says that the labor market has continued to 
“tighten.”  Alternatives B and C characterize job gains as “solid, on average, since the beginning of the year,”  though Alternative B notes th at job gains 
have “moderated.”  Alternative A indicates that job gains have “slowed in 
recent months” and adds that wage pressures “remained subdued.” 
o Alternatives A and B indicate that  economic activity “has been rising 
moderately so far this year,” whi le Alternative C states that “ growth in 
economic activity has picked up.”  With regard to household spending, Alternative C says that it has “strengthened,” while Alternativ es A and B say 
that it has “picked up” in recent months.  All three Alternativ es state that 
business fixed investment “continued to expand.” 
o Alternatives A and B note that  inflation, on a 12-month basis, “declined 
recently.”  Alternative A indicat es that both total and core inflation are 
“running below” 2 percent, while Alternative B notes that both measures of 
inflation are “running somewhat below” 2 percent.  Alternative C instead 
reports that inflation has “bee n running close to” 2 percent “i n recent months” 
and drops the specific reference to core inflation being below 2 percent.

In Alternatives A and B, the desc ription of longer-term inflati on expectations 
is unchanged from the Committee’s statement in May, whereas in Alternative 
C market-based measures of inflation compensation are described  as “little 
changed” rather than “low.”  
 When characterizing the econom ic outlook, each Alternative reaf firms the 
Committee’s expectation that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor 
market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflati on will stabilize 
around 2 percent over the medium ter m.  However, Alternative B acknowledges that 
inflation “is expected to remai n somewhat below 2 percent in th e near term,” while 
Alternative C notes that recent lower readings on inflation lik ely reflect “transitory 
factors.”  Alternative A articu lates less confidence about the evolution of inflation by 
stating that the Committee will be assessing whether the recent lower readings on 
inflation were due to transitory factors. 
o Alternatives A and B continue to condition the economic outlook on “gradual 
adjustments” to the stance of m onetary policy.  Alternative C c onditions the 
economic outlook on “further” gradual adjustments. 
o All of the Alternatives retain the assessment that near-term risks to the 
economic outlook “appear roughly balanced,” though Alternative A suggests 
increased concern about downside risks to inflation by emphasiz ing that the 
Committee is “monitoring inflation developments closely.” 
 Based on their differing assessments of the strength of the lab or market and 
interpretations of recent inflation readings, the three Alterna tives contain different 
policy decisions. 
o Alternatives B and C conclude tha t the medium-term outlook is e ssentially 
unchanged and that it is appropriate  to increase the target ran ge for the federal 
funds rate to 1 to 1¼ percent.  Under Alternative A, the Commit tee would 
express less confidence in the inflation outlook and therefore maintain the 
current target range for t he federal funds rate. 
o Under Alternative B, the Comm ittee would announce that it expec ts to begin 
to reduce the reinvestment of prin cipal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings “this year, provided that the economy evolv es broadly as 
anticipated.”  Under A lternative C, the Committee would begin to implement 
the program in July and would emphasize that the program will “ begin a 
gradual decline in the Federal  Reserve’s securities holdings.”  By contrast,

Alternative A retains the langua ge regarding reinvestment conta ined in the 
Committee’s statement in May. 
 All of the draft statements continue to indicate that the stanc e of monetary policy 
“remains accommodative,” and tha t such a stance supports “a sus tained return to 
2 percent inflation.” 
 The prospects for future increas es in the federal funds rate di ffer somewhat among 
the Alternatives.  Alternative B notes that the Committee expec ts that economic 
conditions will warrant “gradual increases” in the federal fund s rate.  Alternative C 
indicates instead that the Committee expects “additional gradual increases,” 
suggesting that policy accommoda tion might be removed at a some what faster pace 
than previously expected even after the Committee begins its ba lance sheet 
normalization program.  Like Altern ative B, Alternative A indic ates that the 
Committee expects “gradual increas es” in the federal funds rate.  However, by 
emphasizing subdued wage pressures and stating that the Committ ee will maintain 
the current target range for the  federal funds rate “while asse ssing whether the recent 
lower readings on inflation were  due to transitory factors,” Al ternative A suggests a 
somewhat shallower path for the federal funds rate than the oth er Alternatives.

MAY 2017 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in March 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in 
economic activity slowed.  Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and 
the unemployment rate declined.  Household spending rose only m odestly, but the 
fundamentals underpinning the c ontinued growth of consumption r emained solid.  
Business fixed investment fir med.  Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently 
has been running close to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.  Excluding 
energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation c ompensation remain 
low; survey-based measures of l onger-term inflation expectations are little changed, 
on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee views the slowin g in growth during 
the first quarter as likely t o be transitory and continues to e xpect that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat  further, and 
inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.   Near-term risks to the 
economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee contin ues to closely 
monitor inflation indicators a nd global economic and financial developments. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3/4 to 
1 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative , thereby 
supporting some further strengthe ning in labor market condition s and a sustained 
return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  The 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative 
to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the f ederal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below le vels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  Howev er, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the  level of the federal 
funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Comm ittee’s holdings of

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen.  The 
unemployment rate ticked down t o 4.4 percent in April and to 4. 3 percent in May.  
Payroll employment increase d by an average of 156,000 jobs per month in April and 
May, up from a subdued rise in Mar ch.  Since the beginning of t he year, job gains 
have averaged 162,000 per month. 
 Real GDP growth is now estimate d to have increased at an annual  rate of 1.2 percent 
in the first quarter of 2017, somew hat better than reported at the time of the 
Committee’s May meeting.  Consum ption spending has picked up, supporting the 
Committee’s earlier judgment that  the first-quarter weakness in  real GDP growth was 
likely to be transitory.  The staff expects real GDP growth to exceed 2.5 percent in the 
second quarter and to average abou t 2 percent in the first half  of the year. 
 Although PCE price inflation, measured on a 12-month basis, dec reased to 
1.9 percent in March and to 1.7 per cent in April, these lower r eadings likely reflect, at 
least in part, trans itory factors such as a sharp decline in pr ices for wireless telephone 
services.  Additionally, the r ecent depreciation of the dollar has begun to put upward 
pressure on import prices.  While  the low monthly inflation rea dings in March and 
April will continue to affect i nflation on a 12-month basis thr ough next winter, the 
staff expects core inflatio n, on a quarterly basis, to step up to 1.8 percent in the third 
quarter and has not materially changed its inflation forecast for 2018 and beyond. 
 Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are  little changed since 
April:  The median 10-year infla tion projection for PCE prices reported in the latest 
reading of the Survey of Professional Forecasters stayed at 2.1  percent.  Median 
5-year inflation expectations i n the Michigan survey remained a t 2.4 percent in May.  
Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation rem ain low by 
historical standards. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may conclude that th e further decline in the unemp loyment rate and the 
stronger spending data received over the intermeeting period in dicate that, despite 
recent lower readings on inflation and lackluster real GDP grow th in the first quarter, 
the medium-term outlook for economic activity, the labor market , and inflation is 
fundamentally unchanged and that a nother step in the removal of  policy 
accommodation is appropriate in June.

 Reflecting the expectation that tighter resource utilization wi ll help bring inflation up 
to 2 percent on a sustained basis  over the medium-term, policymakers may want to 
communicate that, although inflation on a 12-month basis has declined and is likely to 
remain below 2 percent in the near -term, their medium-term outl ook for inflation is 
little changed. 
 Policymakers may judge that the neutral rate of interest will r ise only gradually 
toward its longer-run level and t hey, therefore, might continue  to expect that the 
appropriate pace of further incr eases in the target range for t he federal funds rate will 
be gradual. 
 The faster-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate might  make some 
policymakers concerned that not raising the target range for th e federal funds rate in 
June would increase the probability that they will have to act more aggressively in the 
future than would be desirable. 
 If the economy continues to evolve broadly as anticipated, policymakers may see it as appropriate to begin to reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities  holdings this year, 
although not at this meeting.  A s part of the ongoing communication of this likely 
change in its balance sheet pol icy, and to avoid an adverse mar ket reaction, 
policymakers may regard it as pr udent for the Committee’s state ment to indicate this 
expectation. 
 Accordingly, policymakers may pref er a statement like Alternati ve B, in which they 
increase the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼  percent, leave largely 
unchanged their communications a bout the economic outlook and the likely future 
path of the federal funds rate,  and announce their expectation that, this year, they will 
begin to implement a balance sheet normalization program that decreases reinvestment of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s s ecurities holdings. 
 As shown in figure 1 of the box “Mo netary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty,” 
financial market quotes embed an almost 95 percent probability that the Committee 
will raise the target range at the June meeting.  Given current  market expectations, the 
decision to increase the target  range in Alternative B is highly unlikely to generate an 
appreciable response in financi al markets.  Market participants and commentators 
generally anticipate that the Committee will release, after it meets next week, 
additional details about its pla n for reducing reinvestment, th ough not necessarily in 
the postmeeting statement.  Most respondents to the Desk’s June  surveys see the 
September or December FOMC meeting as the most likely time for an announcement

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty 
Over the intermeeting period, market participants’ perceptions of the probability that the 
next increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will occur at the June FOMC 
meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, rose from 65 percent to 
almost 95 percent (figure 1). The Desk’s June Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market 
Participants also showed high odds of a rate increase in June (not shown). 
Looking further ahead, the probability distribution of the federal funds rate at the end of 
2017 that is implied by quotes on federal funds futures options under the assumption of 
zero term premiums (figure 2) became a bit less diffuse over the intermeeting period, 
while continuing to show about equal odds of one or two more rate hikes of 25 basis 
points each this year (including the June meeting). The average distribution from the June 
Desk surveys (figure 3) was little changed from the May surveys and continues to attach 
the highest odds to two more hikes in the federal funds rate by year end (again including 
June). Similarly, the median of respondents’ modal expectations (not shown) suggests 
that respondents view two rate hikes between June and December 2017 as the most likely 
outcome, unchanged from the May surveys. 
Beyond the current year, the expected value of the federal funds rate implied by OIS 
quotes under the assumption of zero term premiums (the black line in figure 4) rises by 
about 50 basis points between the end of 2017 and the end of 2020. The implied level of 
the target rate at the end of 2020, at 1.75 percent, is about 15 basis points lower than at 
the time of the May FOMC meeting (not shown). While market participants have 
characterized FOMC communications over the period as reinforcing their views of a high 
likelihood of an increase in the federal funds rate at the June meeting, they have 
reportedly marked down their expectations at horizons beyond 2017 as a result of the 
weak April CPI release, the May Employment Situation report, and reduced optimism 
about the potential for expansionary fiscal policy. 
Relative to the OISbased path under the assumption of zero term premiums, the staff’s 
term structure model—which takes the effective lower bound into account and 
incorporates information from Blue Chip survey forecasts of the federal funds rate— 
suggests that the federal funds rate is expected to rise at a somewhat faster pace of two 
more hikes in 2017 (including June) and three in 2018, with the funds rate reaching 
3 percent by the end of 2020 (the light blue line in figure 4). The difference between the 
term premium adjusted and unadjusted paths widened a bit over the intermeeting period 
and continues to suggest that forward rates implied by OIS quotes contain a negative 
term premium. The adjusted and the unadjusted paths remain respectively about 30 and 
50 basis points higher at the end of 2020 than their preelection levels. 
As also shown in figure 4, the model based path for the federal funds rate is roughly 
consistent with the modal path from the June Desk Surveys (the brown line) and the

Committee’s March median SEP projections through 2019 (the dark blue dots).1 Results 
from the model and the surveys also shed light on market participants’ expectations of 
the longer run level of the federal funds rate (the farright dots in figure 4). The staff’s 
term structure model estimates that the federal funds rate will average about 3¾ percent 
over the period five to ten years ahead, little changed from the May FOMC meeting. This 
level remains about ¾ percentage point and 1 percentage points above the median 
projections for the longer run federal funds rate from the March SEP and from the June 
Desk Surveys, respectively.2 
The June Desk surveys also again asked several questions pertaining to the Committee’s 
reinvestment policy. Respondents on average attached a roughly 90 percent probability 
to reinvestments being phased out rather than stopped all at once or left unchanged, up 
from 75 percent in the May surveys, with respondents generally citing the May FOMC 
minutes as having informed this change. Conditional on the FOMC announcing a set of 
gradually increasing caps on the maximum allowable monthly declines in the Federal 
Reserve’s holding of Treasury and agency debt and MBS securities, respondents were 
asked to provide estimates of the most likely initial and fully phased in levels of these caps, 
as well as the most likely number of months from when caps are initially implemented 
until they are fully phased in. Figure 5 shows that the medians of respondents’ modal 
expectations for the initial caps were $5 billion per month for both Treasury and agency 
securities, rising to fully phased in levels of $25 and $20 billion per month, respectiv ely.3 Of 
note, whereas respondents mostly agreed on the size of the initial caps, they had quite 
diverse views about the final, fully phased in levels. As also shown in figure 5, the median 
of respondents’ modal expectation for the length of the phase in period was 12 months 
for both Treasury and agency securities, but here, too, responses to the survey indicated 
somewha t diverse views. 
The probability distribution from the June surveys for the timing of the Committee’s first 
announcement of a change in reinvestment policy, shown in figure 6, indicates that 
respondents, on average, assigned odds of 33 percent each to an announcement 
occurring at the September or at the December meeting, and odds of only 15 percent to an 
1 The model based path is a mean expectation of the federal funds rate whereas the 
survey based path is based on respondents’ modal expectations. Computing a mean path from the 
surveys (based on the surveys’ conditional probability distribution results) requires making a number 
of assumptions. Under some reasonable assumptions, the survey implied mean path would lie 
noticeably below the modal path. 
2 Median estimates suggested that Desk survey respondents expected little change in the 
Committee’s median June SEP projections for the federal funds rate in 2017–2019, or over the longer 
run. 
3 In figure 5, the size of the green bubbles represents the number of respondents who indicated 
the levels shown on the left vertical axis as most likely for the initial and phase in cap levels for 
Treasury and agency debt and MBS securities while the size of the light blue bubbles represents the 
number of respondents who indicated the duration in months (shown on the right vertical axis) as 
most likely for the length of the phase in period. The horizontal dashes show medians of 
respondents’ modal estimates of cap levels and the length of the phase in period.

announcement occurring in the first quarter of 2018 or beyond.4 These results suggest 
that respondents have generally pulled forward their expected timing and are now 
assigning, on average, an 85 percent probability to an announcement occurring this year, 
compared with 58 percent in the May surveys. Consistent with expectations for a likely 
earlier announcement of a change to reinvestments, the probability distribution for the 
level of the federal funds rate at the time of the announcement (not shown) shifted 
slightly lower, with respondents, on average, continuing to attach the highest probability, 
about 42 percent, to the federal funds rate being between 1.26 and 1.50 percent when a 
change in reinvestment policy is announc ed, while the probability assigned to a federal 
funds rate between 1.01 and 1.25 percent increased to close to 35 percent. About 
75 percent of respondents indicated that they expect the target range to be left 
unchanged at the meeting at which the Committee first announces a change to 
reinvestment policy. 
4 The size of the bubbles in figure 6 represents the number of respondents who assigned the 
probability (as indicated on the vertical axis) to the scenario in which a change in reinvestment policy

that the Committee decided to c hange its reinvestment policy.  The reaction in 
financial markets to language i n the Committee’s June statement  indicating that it 
expects to begin normalizing the  balance sheet this year is unc ertain.  Including such 
language in the June statement c ould lead market participants t o assign a greater 
probability to an earlier start of the balance sheet normalizat ion process.  However, 
the reaction in financial marke ts could well be muted:  Partici pants in the Desk’s 
surveys already expect an announcement of a change to reinvestm ent policy this year, 
and participants’ expectations ( median) of the caps on redempti ons from principal 
payments are broadly in line wi th the caps specified in the pro posed balance sheet 
normalization program. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Incoming data indicate that the l abor market, already tight at the time of the May 
meeting, continued to tighten.  The  unemployment rate declined to 4.3 percent in 
May—lower than all participants ’ estimates of its longer-run no rmal level and below 
all participants’ projections of its level at the end of 2017 u nder appropriate policy, as 
reported in the March Summary of  Economic Projections.  In addition, the broader 
U-6 measure of labor underutili zation fell from  8.9 percent in March to 8.6 percent in 
April and to 8.4 percent in Ma y.  Average monthly payroll gains  since the beginning 
of the year have been well above estimates of the pace needed t o maintain a constant 
unemployment rate over time.  Furth ermore, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 
Wage Growth Tracker averaged 3.5 percent in the 12-month period  ending in April, 
up from an average of 3.1 percent in the same period one year e arlier, and the 
employment cost index increas ed 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in March, up 
from 1.8 percent over the preceding 12 months. 
 Spending data received during the intermeeting period have been  stronger than the 
staff anticipated.  Accordingly, t he staff continues to see the slowdown in real GDP 
growth in the first quarter as transitory and projects real GDP  growth to be about 
2.5 percent in the second quarter and over the year as a whole,  a rate that is in excess 
of growth in potential output as estimated by the staff and FOM C participants. 
 Indicators of business sentiment remain upbeat, with the headli ne indexes of the 
Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing I SM reports and the Business Outlook 
Survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia all signaling expansion.  In 
addition, financing conditions remain supportive of economic activity.

 Recent declines in 12-month headline PCE price inflation appear  to be mostly the 
result of transitory and idiosyncratic factors.  The trimmed me an PCE inflation 
measure published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas did not decline by as much 
in March and April as the headli ne PCE price inflation measure,  and the recent 
depreciation of the dollar will continue to put upward pressure  on import prices. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may conclude that the information accumulated sinc e the May meeting, 
in combination with earlier data, pr ovides ample evidence that the labor market is 
tightening more rapidly than the y had expected.  Policymakers m ight further judge 
that recent low readings on headline inflation likely reflect t ransitory factors and that 
inflation will move up as resource  utilization tightens further  and the recent 
depreciation of the dollar pushe s up import prices.  As a resul t, they may conclude 
that an increase in the federa l funds rate is appropriate and, further, that the 
Committee should begin implementing, next month, a program of g radual reduction 
in the Federal Reserve ’s securities holdings.1 
 Policymakers may feel that there is a risk of the Committee “fa lling behind the curve” 
if it fails to raise short-term interest rates at this meeting and to announce steps to start 
normalizing the size of the Feder al Reserve’s balance sheet.  T hese concerns may be 
reinforced by the fact that house and equity prices have climbe d substantially in the 
past few months and indexes of bus iness and consumer confidence  are at elevated 
levels. 
 With the unemployment rate below its longer-run normal level, p olicymakers may be 
concerned that inflation might  move up quickly and rise well ab ove 2 percent.  This 
view is consistent with the possibility of a nonlinear response  of inflation to the 
output gap—a possibility that is explored in the alternative sc enario “Stronger 
Aggregate Demand and Higher Infla tion” in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of 
Tealbook A. 
 Policymakers may also be worried that maintaining the federal f unds rate at its 
current low level, or delaying implementation of the Committee’ s plan to reduce the 
1 Alternatively, the Committee might view the language in paragraph 5 of the draft statement for 
Alternative C as premature in present circumstances but might nonetheless discuss whether this language 
would be appropriate when the time arrives to change the Commit tee’s policy on the reinvestment of 
principal payments from the Fede ral Reserve’s securities holdin gs.

Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, could promote excessive risk-taking in 
financial markets and pose risks to financial stability. 
 In addition, policymakers might regard it as prudent for the Committee’s statement to 
include language that opens the door to removing policy accommo dation at a faster 
pace than previously expected, albeit still at a gradual pace.  To that end, the draft 
statement for Alternative C c ontains additions to the May state ment’s description of 
the gradual adjustments in the f ederal funds rate:  the word “f urther” in paragraph 2 
and the word “additional” in paragraph 4. 
 Both announcing an earlier-than-expected change to the Committe e’s reinvestment 
policy and doing it alongside an increase in the federal funds rate would be surprises 
to financial market participan ts.  Respondents to the Desk’s Ju ne surveys place no 
material odds on the Committee an nouncing an immediate change to reinvestment 
policy at this meeting.  As a result, financial market particip ants might come to expect 
a more rapid removal of polic y accommodation, which might in tu rn trigger an 
increase in medium- and longer- term yields, a drop in stock pri ces and inflation 
compensation, and a strengthening of  the dollar.  Alternatively , to the extent that the 
statement is interpreted as signaling a more upbeat economic ou tlook, equity prices 
could rise. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 While the labor market is strengthening and the unemployment ra te has decreased, 
job gains have slowed and wage  pressures remain subdued.  Avera ge hourly earnings 
rose by 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in May, the same as over the same 
period a year ago.  Additionally, c ompensation per hour in the business sector 
decreased in the fourth quart er of 2016 at an annual rate of 2.1 percent and increased 
only 1.6 percent for 2016 as a whole. 
 Moreover, the employment-to -population ratio among 25-54 year o lds remains below 
pre-crisis levels, indicating t hat there might be more “room to  run” in the labor 
market. 
 Both the total and core PCE pri ce indexes declined appreciably in March.  Although 
those declines may have been one-time events, on a 12-month bas is both total and 
core PCE inflation declined furth er in April, with core inflati on running at 
1.5 percent.  As a result, the s taff has revised down its forecast for inflation over the

rest of the year and now projects t otal PCE price inflation to average only 1.6 percent 
in 2017.  Additionally, inflation is expected to reach 2 percen t on a sustained basis 
only in 2019 despite a steeper pro jected decline in the unemplo yment rate below its 
natural rate. 
 Market-based measures of longer-t erm inflation compensation hav e declined 
somewhat, with 5-year, 5-year -forward CPI falling by about 15 b asis points, to 
around 1.8 percent, since the Commit tee’s May meeting, even as the unemployment 
rate declined.  Survey-based meas ures of longer-run inflation e xpectations remain 
low by historical standards. 
Policy Strategy 
 Although the unemployment rate has moved down, policymakers may  view the 
available information on labor force participation, employment rates of prime-aged 
workers, wage growth, and inflati on as indicating that there ma y be slack remaining 
along other margins.  Additionally, some policymakers may judge  that the natural rate 
of unemployment is likely lower  than previously thought.  Seeing slack remaining in 
the labor market, and in light of recent low readings of headli ne PCE price inflation, 
the Committee might elect to defe r any additional increases in the federal funds rate 
until evidence emerges of sustained progress toward the Committ ee’s 2 percent 
inflation objective. 
 Some policymakers may be concer ned that longer -run inflation ex pectations could 
drift down further if inflation does not move toward 2 percent in the near future.  
They may judge that, to support the credibilit y of its inflatio n goal, the Committee 
should maintain the current tar get range until it has more conf idence that recent low 
inflation readings were, in fact, due to transitory factors.  A dditionally, these 
policymakers may be concerned th at tightening policy now, when inflation and  
far-forward inflation compensati on are below 2 pe rcent and decl ining, could harm the 
credibility of the Committee’ s 2 percent infl ation goal. 
 Because of the uncertainties su rrounding the evolution of infla tion, these 
policymakers may also view it as premature to announce a change to the Committee’s policy regarding reinvestment of principal payments from securi ties held by the 
Federal Reserve. 
 Policymakers may also judge that inflation dynamics in recent d ecades demonstrate 
that the short-run Phillips curv e is fairly flat, implying that greater resource utilization 
Alternatives

will generate only a muted response of inflation and allowing ample time to adopt a 
less accommodative policy s tance if one is needed. 
 Policymakers may estimate that the neutral federal funds rate i s currently well below 
its likely longer-run le vel, reflecting rest raint on U.S. economic activity from 
economic and financial developments abroad, a sustained period of low productivity 
growth, or borrowing conditions that remain tight for some hous eholds and 
businesses.  Policymakers may s ee such headwinds as unlikely to subside quickly. 
 Both the decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate and the 
downbeat characterization of the  recent inflation data offered by Alternative A would 
come as surprises to financial market participants, who would l ikely push the 
expected date of the next rate increase, as well as any change to the Committee’s 
policy on reinvestment of principal payments from the Federal R eserve’s securities 
holdings, into the future.  As a result, the expected path for the federal funds rate 
would likely flatten, leading longer-term yields  to decline and the dollar to depreciate.  
If the Committee’s characteriza tion of recent inflation data ca used financial market 
participants to rethink the grow th prospects for the economy, e quity prices could fall.  
Alternatively, if financial mark et participants interpret the C ommittee’s statement as 
indicating that the economy will strengthen as previously antic ipated, but that interest 
rates will be on a shallower tra jectory, then equity prices cou ld rise.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES 
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range f or the federal funds 
rate and to continue reinvesting all principal received on securities held in the System 
Open Market Account (SOMA), as in Alternative A , an implementat ion note that 
indicates no change in the Federa l Reserve’s administered rates —the interest rates on 
required and excess reserves, the offering rate on overnight re verse repurchase 
agreements, and the primary cred it rate—would be issued.  If th e Committee instead 
decides to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate bu t to continue reinvesting all 
principal, as in Alternative B , an implementation note that com municates the changes the 
Federal Reserve decided to make to its administered rates would  be issued.  If the 
Committee decides both to raise t he target range and to begin the process of balance sheet 
normalization, as in Alternative C , the directive to the Desk w ould be revised to describe 
how reinvestments are to be conducted over the intermeeting per iod. 
Draft implementation notes that correspond to these three cases  appear on the 
following pages.  Struck-out text indicates language deleted fr om the May directive and 
implementation note, bold red underl ined text indicates added language, and blue 
underlined text indicates text that will link to websites. 
The draft implementation note for Alternative C includes new la nguage in the 
domestic policy directive that i nstructs the Desk about reinves tments during the 
intermeeting period.  The second para graph of the directive for  Alternative C instructs the 
Desk to continue the current pol icy of reinvestments until the end of June.  The third 
paragraph directs the Desk to be gin, in July, reinvesting princ ipal payments received each 
month from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury and agency securities only to the 
extent that such payments e xceed $6 billion and $4 billion, res pectively. 
The reinvestment of principal pa yments in amounts above the cap s would not 
always occur entirely in the m onth in which the principal payme nts are received, 
particularly for agency MBS.  C onsistent with the Desk’s existi ng practice, the 
reinvestment of principal paym ents on existing agency securitie s received in a particular 
month could be reinvested in new agency MBS over the subsequent  few months. 
As noted in the proposed addendum to the Policy Normalization P rinciples and 
Plans, the monthly caps on the a mounts by which the SOMA’s hold ings of Treasury and 
agency securities are allowed t o decline would increase every three months, so the

language in the domestic policy d irective will need to be adjus ted appropriately over 
time.  At meetings when the exis ting caps are maintained, the d omestic policy directive 
will instruct the Desk to continue executing reinvestments unde r the current caps.  At 
meetings when the caps are raised effective in the following month, the directive will 
instruct the Desk to continue rei nvestments under the existing caps through the end of the 
current month and to conduct rei nvestments thereafter based on the scheduled increase in 
caps.  Once the monthly caps for Treasury and agency securities have reached their maximum values of $30 billion and $20 billion, respectively, th e domestic policy 
directive at subsequent meetings will instruct the Desk to cont inue to conduct 
reinvestments under thos e values of the caps.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation 
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on May 3 June 
14, 2017: 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to 
maintain raise  the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances  at 
1.00 to 1.25 percent , effective June 15, 2017 . 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open 
Market Account in accordance with  the following domestic policy  directive: 
“Effective May 4 June 15, 2017, the Federal Open Market Committee 
directs the Desk to undertake ope n market operations as necessa ry to 
maintain the federal funds rat e in a target range of 3/4 to 1 to 1-1/4 
percent, including overnight rever se repurchase operations (and  reverse 
repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 0.75 1.00 percent, in amounts limited 
only by the value of Treasury secu rities held outright in the S ystem Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a 
per-counterparty limit  of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over m aturin g 
reinvesting in new  Treasury securities at auction the principal payments 
from the F ederal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities matu ring 
during June, and to continue reinvesting principal paym ents on all 
agency debt and agency mortgage-b acked securities in agency mor tgage-
backed securities the principal payments received during June from 
the Federal Reserve’s h oldings of agency debt and agency 
mortgage-backed securities . 
The Committee directs the Desk, effective in July, to reinvest in new 
Treasury securities at auction on ly the amount of principal pay ments 
from the F ederal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities that 
exceeds $6 billion during each calendar month, and to reinvest in 
agency mortgage-backed securities  only the amount of principal 
payments received from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency 
debt and agency mortg age-backed securities that exceeds $4 bill ion 
during each calendar month.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has prepared a projection of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet and key 
elements of the associated income statement that is consistent with the economic 
projections as well as the paths for the federal funds rate and longer-term interest rates in 
the staff’s baseline economic outlook presented in Tealbook A. 
In this Tealbook, staff has made changes to a few key assumptio ns that affect the contour 
of the projection.  These changes are as follows. 
 Reinvestment policy:   The staff now assumes that the C ommittee, when it changes its 
reinvestment policy, will instruct the Desk to reinvest princip al payments received 
from Treasury and agency securiti es held in the SOMA portfolio only to the extent 
that those payments exceed gr adually rising dollar caps.1  The cap on redemptions of 
Treasury securities is  assumed to rise, in quarterly steps, fro m an initial value of 
$6 billion per month to a full y phased-in value of $30 billion per month, and the cap 
on monthly reductions of holdings of agency debt and MBS is assumed to rise from 
an initial value of $4 billion per month to $20 billion per mon th.  The caps, once they 
reach their respective fully phased-in values, are assumed to r emain in place until the 
size of the balance sheet is normalized so that the Federal Res erve’s securities 
holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner.2  The change in 
policy is assumed to be announced at the September 2017 meeting and implemented in October.  In contrast, in t he April Tealbook balance sheet projection, the staff 
assumed a shift from full rei nvestment to zero reinvestment on October 1. 
1 This revised reinvestment assumption is consistent with the re investment plan outlined in the 
memo, “Reinvestment Policy,” distributed to the FOMC on June 2, 2017. 
2 The size of the balance sheet i s assumed to be normalized at t he point when the Desk is required 
to resume purchasing T reasury securities so as to attain the de sired longer-run level of reserve balances and 
accommodate the expansion of oth er key non-reserve liability it ems such as currency in circulation, the 
Treasury General Account, and the foreign repo pool.

 Liabilities 
 Longer-run reserve balances:3  The staff has raised its assumption for the 
longer-run level of reserve bala nces from $100 bill ion in the A pril Tealbook 
to $500 billion.4  There is a great deal of uncertainty about the longer-run 
level of reserves, which could be affected by factors such as s tructural 
changes in the banking system, the effects of regulation on ban k demand for 
reserves, and the Committee’s ultimate choice of a long-run ope rating 
framework.  The current level of required  reserve balances is on the order of 
$100 billion.  That figure could c hange over time, but assuming  that required 
reserve balances remain close t o current levels, the staff’s ea rlier assumption 
of a longer-run level of total reserves of $100 billion implied  a longer-run 
level of excess reserves of zero.  By this same rough accounting, the revised 
assumption of $500 billion in total reserves would imply a long er-run level of 
$400 billion in excess reserves—a l evel that could be consistent with either a 
floor system or a corridor sy stem depending on a range of factors that could 
affect bank reserve demand.  Of c ourse, the actual longer-run l evel of reserves 
may turn out to be appreciably smaller or larger than this revi sed staff 
assumption. 
 Designated Financial Market Utili ties’ (DFMUs) account balances :  The staff 
assumes that DFMU account balances , which are part of “other de posits,” will 
remain throughout the proje ction period (from 2017 through 2025) near their 
April 30, 2017, aggregate level  of about $70 billion.  This lev el includes 
DFMUs’ own holdings as well as customer segregated funds.  In t he April 
Tealbook, the staff had projected D FMU balances to be zero throughout the 
projection period. 
3 Assumptions about a few other k ey liability items are unchange d.  Currency is assumed to 
increase at the same rate as nominal GDP; the Treasury General Account is assumed to be steady at 
$150 billion throughout the projection period; repurchase agree ments associated with foreign official and 
international accounts remain throughout the projection period near their April 30, 2017, level of 
$241 billion; and take-up of overnight RRPs is assumed to run a t $100 billion until the level of reserve 
balances is within $500 billion of its assumed longer-run level , before declining to zero over the course of 
one year. 
4 The interest rate paths associated with a higher longer-run le vel of reserves do not significantly 
differ from those prevailing in a scenario of a $100 billion lo nger-run level of reserve balances.  The 
January Tealbook presented bal ance sheet and income projections  under a $100 billion and a $500 billion 
longer-run level of reserves.

Key features of the balance sheet and income projection are des cribed below: 
 SOMA redemptions.  The “SOMA Redemptions and Reinvestments” figure in the 
exhibit titled “Tota l Assets and Selected B alance Sheet Items” illustrates historical 
reinvestments as well as the implied monthly runoffs (above the horizontal axis) and reinvestments (below the horizon tal axis) of Treasury and agency securities under the 
12-month phase-in of dollar caps.  The value of Treasury securi ties maturing each 
month is known with certainty, va ries over time, and is large d uring midquarter 
refunding months.  The staff assumes the target range for the f ederal funds rate 
reaches 1¼ to 1½ percent at the start of the phase-in of the do llar caps in October of 
this year.  Once the fully phased-in cap of $30 billion is in p lace, reinvestments of 
Treasury securities would occur only during the middle month of each quarter; those 
reinvestments would reduce the large runoffs that would otherwise occur during the 
months in which large amounts of  securities held in the SOMA wi ll mature.  In 
contrast, MBS paydowns are uncerta in but are projected to run at a fairly steady 
monthly pace, even though, as shown in the figure, historical M BS prepayments have 
displayed considerable variab ility.  While the $20 billion fully phased-in cap is not 
projected to bind, realized MBS  paydowns will reflect the evolu tion of interest rates 
and other factors and thus coul d differ significantly from projected values. 
Total redemptions during the first  12 months after the implemen tation of the revised 
policy (October 2017 to September 2018) are projected to be $25 6 billion.  
Cumulative redemptions from the onset of the ph ase-in until nor malization are 
$1.5 trillion, of which $914 billion is in Treasury securities and $556 billion is in agency securities. 
 Balance sheet. Normalization of the size of the  balance sheet is projected to occur in 
the first quarter of 2022, when r eserve balances reach $500 billion (see the exhibit 
titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows the 
exhibit).  At that time, total a ssets are projected to stand at  roughly $2.9 trillion, 
equivalent to 13 percent of no minal GDP, with about $2.7 trilli on in total SOMA 
securities holdings composed of  $1.5 trillion of Treasury securities and $1.2 trillion of 
MBS.  The size of the balance sh eet is larger than in the April  Tealbook, reflecting 
the revised assumptions about longe r-run reserve and DFMU balan ces.  The 
normalization date, however, is r oughly unchanged from the Apri l Tealbook baseline 
scenario, reflecting the offse tting effects of two assumptions that pull the timing of 
normalization in opposite directions:  The higher assumed level  of longer-run reserve

balances that pulls the timing o f normalization forward is offs et by the delay in 
normalization implied by the more  gradual reduction in the Federal Reserve’s 
securities holdings that results  from phasing in the caps rather than bringing 
reinvestments to a sudden stop. 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   The exhibit “Income Pr ojections” shows the 
implications of the balance shee t and income projection as well as the interest rate 
assumptions for Federal Reserve income.  Remittances are projec ted to decline from 
$92 billion in 2016 to about $80 billion this year.  The step-d own reflects higher 
interest expense resulting from t he increase in the target rang e for the federal funds 
rate in March and the assumption of  further increases this year .5  Remittances are 
projected to continue to decline in coming years, reaching a tr ough of $29 billion in 
2020, as the size of the SOMA por tfolio decreases and the target range for the federal 
funds rate increases further.  Subsequently, remittances gradua lly increase as 
higher-yielding Treasury securiti es are added to the SOMA portf olio.  The Federal 
Reserve’s cumulative remittances from 2009 through 2025 are abo ut $1.1 trillion. 
Compared with the April Tealbook baseline, projected remittance s for 2017 are 
nearly unchanged and cumulative remittances over the projection  period are about 
$35 billion lower.  This decrease in cumulative remittances pri marily reflects the 
larger interest expense arising f rom the slightly higher projec ted level of the federal 
funds rate during the period in whi ch reserve balances remain elevated. No deferred 
asset is projected under this scenario.6 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of about $90 billion at the end of Apr il.7  The net unrealized 
gain or loss position of the portf olio going forward will depen d primarily on the path 
of longer-term interest rates.  I n the June Tealbook, these rat es are expected to rise 
over the next several years, and as a result, the portfolio is projected to shift to an 
5 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the 
effective federal funds rate.  We  also continue to assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve 
balances and the offering rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON  RRPs) will be set at the top 
and the bottom of the range, respectively.  
6 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury.  
7 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

unrealized loss position at the  end of this year.  Going forwar d, the portfolio is 
expected to record a peak unr ealized loss of roughly $220 billion at the end of 2019.  
This is about $20 billion highe r than in the April Tealbook baseline as a result of the 
more gradual reduction in the SOMA securities holdings in the current projection.  Of 
the overall projected peak unreal ized loss, about $80 billion i s attributable to holdings 
of Treasury securities and $140 billion to holdings of agency M BS.  The unrealized 
loss position subsequently narro ws through the remainder of the  projection period 
because the value of securities previously acquired under the l arge-scale asset 
purchase programs (LSAPs) return s to par as those securities ap proach maturity. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” the $4.2 t rillion of securities held in t he SOMA as a result of 
the Federal Reserve’s LSAPs are estimated to be currently reduc ing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treasury y ield (and thus the level of th at yield) by 95 basis 
points.  That term premium effect  is projected to become gradua lly less negative over 
time.8  However, relative to the A pril Tealbook baseline projection, the estimated 
term premium effect is, on ave rage, a little more than 10 basis  points more negative 
throughout the projection period, w ith the difference reflectin g two sources of 
downward pressure on the term prem ium embedded in longer-term T reasury 
securities.  The first is the s lower future pace of reduction in the securitie s portfolio 
implied by the new assumption about reinvestment policy.  The s econd is the fact that 
the assumed size of the securi ties portfolio permanently held b y the Federal Reserve, 
once the size of the balance shee t normalizes, is larger than i n the April Tealbook. 
 SOMA characteristics.  The weighted-average dur ation of the SOMA Treasury 
portfolio is currently about 6¼ y ears (see the top panel of “Pr ojections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Holdings” exhibit).  The weighted-avera ge duration is 
projected to decline sl ightly this year as the securities in th e portfolio approach 
maturity, and to rise subsequently until early 2022.9 
8 The evolution of the estimated t erm premium effect depends imp ortantly on how the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in coming years departs from a benchmark counterfactual 
projection for the balance sheet that excludes the effects of a sset purchases.  In the benchmark 
counterfactual balance sheet projection, staff continues to ass ume a longer-run level of reserves of 
$100 billion. 
9 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 when the pace of  runoffs picks up and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o; duration increases until the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized.

After reaching its peak, duration is projected to resume its de cline as the Desk 
resumes open market purchases of  Treasury securities to keep pace with the increase 
in Federal Reserve notes in cir culation and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  The 
duration contour in this later portion of the projection is bas ed on the assumption that 
the Federal Reserve will limit its purchases to Treasury bills until they account for 
one-third of the Treasury portfo lio, similar to its pre-crisis composition (currently 
SOMA holds no Treasury bills).  Ther eafter, purchases of Treasu ry securities are 
assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bott om panel, “Maturity 
Composition of SOMA Treasury Portfolio”).10 
10 We assume no purchases of agency MBS after reinvestments of pr incipal from such securities 
cease once the size of the bal ance sheet is normalized.
