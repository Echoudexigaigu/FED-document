Monetary Policy Alternatives 
Incoming data since the June FOMC meeting indicate that overall  and core 
inflation continue to run below the 2 percent objective.  By co ntrast, the labor market has 
strengthened further, and real GDP appears to be growing faster  than potential output.  In 
light of the tension between ongoing  strengthening of the labor  market and soft inflation 
readings, two key questions for the Committee at this meeting a re:  First, whether the 
anticipated path for the federal funds rate communicated by recent postmeeting 
statements remains appropriate f or achieving the Committee’s objectives; and, second, 
whether to set and announce the  date for beginning to implement caps on reinvestment.   
For the Committee’s considera tion, this Tealbook contains three  draft statements.  The 
Alternatives offer somewhat diffe rent assessments of the recent  information on labor 
market conditions, inflation, and economic activity; accordingl y they differ with respect 
to the policy decision or the sig nal they provide about the sta nce of monetary policy 
going forward.   
 In characterizing the labor mar ket, the Alternatives note that it has continued to either 
“strengthen” (Alternatives A and B) or “tighten” (Alternative C ). 
o However, the Alternatives differ in their perspective on the da ta.  Alternative 
A acknowledges that job gains “h ave been solid” and the unemplo yment rate 
“has changed little in recent mont hs,” but adds that wage gains  “remained 
subdued.”  In contrast, Alternativ e B notes that job gains “hav e been solid, on 
average, since the beginning of t he year,” and the unemployment rate “has 
declined.”  Alterna tive C states that job gains “remained stron g this year” and 
the unemployment rate “has decl ined to a low level by historica l standards.”  
 All three Alternatives recognize that overall a nd core inflation have been running 
below the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, but they d iffer in their 
description of the shortfall.  A lternatives A and B note that the two measures of 
inflation “have declined” and are running “below” 2 percent; Al ternative C maintains 
the assessment in the Committee’ s June statement that they have been running 
“somewhat below” 2 percent.     
o In describing inflation expecta tions, Alternative A characterizes market-based 
measures of inflation compensati on as “low” and as having “decl ined this

year;” in Alternative B they are  described as remaining low, an d in 
Alternative C as “little change d.”  All three Alternatives note that survey-
based measures of expected inf lation are “little changed, on ba lance.” 
 With regard to economic activity, the three Alternatives agree that household 
spending and business fixed invest ment “have continued to expan d.”     
o However, while Alternatives A a nd B retain the language of the June 
statement that economic activit y has been rising “moderately so  far this year,” 
Alternative C emphasizes that “growth of” economic activity “re bounded in 
recent months.”   
 When characterizing the economic outlook:  
o Each Alternative reaffirms the Committee’s expectation in the J une statement 
that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace.  
o Regarding the labor market, Alte rnatives A and B indicate that conditions will 
“strengthen somewhat further,” while Alternative C expects that  employment 
“will rise at a sustainable pace,” indicating a need to slow th e pace of labor 
market strengthening. 
o On the outlook for inflation, Alternatives B and C repeat the l anguage of the 
June statement that inflati on on a 12-month basis is expected t o “remain 
somewhat below” 2 percent in the ne ar term, and reiterate that inflation in the 
medium term will “stabilize ar ound” the Committee’s 2 percent o bjective.  
Alternative A, instead, suggests a more gradual return of infla tion to 2 
percent, by stating that the Committee expects inflation to “re main below” 2 
percent in the near term but t o “rise to” 2 percent over the me dium term. 
o Each Alternative retains the asse ssment of the June statement that while near-
term risks to the economic outl ook appear roughly balanced, the  Committee is 
monitoring inflation developments closely. 
 The differences in the economi c outlook under the three Alterna tives are reflected in 
somewhat different policy assumptions.   
o Alternative B retains the langua ge of the June statement that e conomic 
conditions will warrant “gradual increases” in the federal fund s rate.  
Alternative C indicates, instead, that the evol ution of economi c conditions will 
warrant “further gradual increases” in the federal funds rate, suggesting that 
policy accommodation might be remove d at a somewhat faster pace , or that

the longer-run level of the fed eral funds rate may be higher, t han previously 
expected.  In contrast, Alterna tive A suggests a somewhat shall ower path for 
the federal funds rate than the  other Alternatives, as it stres ses that the 
Committee will maintain the current target range “while assessing the 
likelihood that recent low readings on inflation will persist,”  and that 
economic conditions will likely warrant “only modest further in creases” in the 
federal funds rate. 
 Turning to policy decisions: 
o The three Alternatives conclude that, in view of the realized a nd expected 
economic conditions, it is appropriate, at this meeting, to mai ntain the current 
target range of the federal f unds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 percent.  
o On reinvestment policy, Alternativ e C announces that the Committee will 
begin implementing, on September 1, the balance sheet normaliza tion 
program described in the June  2017 Addendum to the Committee’s Policy 
Normalization Principles and Pla ns.  In contrast, under Alterna tive B the 
Committee maintains its existing reinvestment policy and, as in  June, 
indicates that it expects to i mplement the balance sheet normal ization program 
“this year” provided that “the economy evolves broadly as antic ipated.”  
Under Alternative A, the Comm ittee states that it will begin im plementing the 
balance sheet normalization program “later this year;” the insertion of “later” 
signals a likely delay in starti ng to shrink the balance sheet. 
 Each Alternative retains the asse ssment of the June statement that the stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative and that such a stance su pports some further 
strengthening in labor market c onditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

JUNE 2017 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in May indicates 
that the labor market has conti nued to strengthen and that economic activity has been 
rising moderately so far this y ear.  Job gains have moderated b ut have been solid, on 
average, since the beginning of  the year, and the unemployment rate has declined.  
Household spending has picked up in recent months, and business  fixed investment 
has continued to expand.  On a 12-month basis, inflation has de clined recently and, 
like the measure excluding food a nd energy prices, is running s omewhat below 2 
percent.  Market-based measures  of inflation comp ensation remai n low; survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little chang ed, on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  T he Committee continues to exp ect that, with 
gradual adjustments in the sta nce of monetar y policy, economic activity will expand 
at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen  somewhat further.  
Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the 
near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent obj ective over the 
medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear ro ughly balanced, but 
the Committee is monitoring inf lation developments closely. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 1 to 1-1/4 
percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sus tained return to 2 
percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  The 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative 
to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the f ederal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below le vels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  Howev er, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 
5. The Committee is maintaining its  existing policy of reinvesting  principal payments 
from its holdings of agency debt a nd agency mortgage-backed securities in agency 
mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasur y securities at 
auction.  The Committee currently expects to begin implementing  a balance sheet 
normalization program this year , provided that the economy evolves broadly as 
anticipated.  This program, whi ch would gradually reduce the Fe deral Reserve’s 
securities holdings by decreasing reinvestment of principal pay ments from those

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Data received during the interm eeting period indicate that the labor market 
strengthened further while  inflation remained soft.  
 Nonfarm payroll employment increased 222,000 in June, and job gains in April and 
May were revised upward.  The unemployment rate ticked up to 4. 4 percent in June 
from 4.3 percent in May as the labor force participation rate e dged up, but the 
unemployment rate remains below each participant’s estimate of its longer-run 
normal level.  Even so, wage growth continued to be subdued. 
 Inflation has remained below the Committee’s 2 percent objectiv e.  Over the 12 
months ending in May, overall PCE  price inflation ran at 1.4 pe rcent, down from 1.7 
percent in April.  While the decl ine may reflect, in part, idio syncratic and temporary 
factors, the unexpectedly low  readings on PCE and CPI inflation in recent months 
will hold down 12-month inflation m easures for some time.  As a  result, the staff has 
revised down somewhat its forecast for inflation through the fi rst quarter of 2018.  
Meanwhile, market-based measures of longer-run inflation compen sation and survey-
based measures of longer-term inf lation expectations were littl e changed.  
 Economic activity appears to have expanded at a moderate pace d uring the second 
quarter, supported by rising personal consumption expenditures and business 
investment.   
 Policymakers may note that the staff continues to see the mediu m-term outlook for 
inflation and the labor mark et as essentially unchanged, with t he unemployment rate 
falling somewhat further below estimates of its longer-run norm al level, and inflation 
reaching 2 percent by 2019. 
 Policymakers might continue to j udge that the risks to the outl ook in the near term 
remain roughly balanced but that th e downside risks stemming fr om the recent soft 
readings on inflation b ear close watching.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may view the information received over the interme eting period as 
indicating that the labor market is close to maximum sustainabl e employment while 
inflation continues to run below the 2 pe rcent objective.  Poli cymakers also may view 
the available information as indicating, on balanc e, that the economy is evolving

about in line with their modal forecast.  Accordingly, policyma kers may judge that 
maintaining the current target  range and policy communications is appropriate, at 
least for now, in light of the tension between the strong labor  market and subdued 
wage and price inflation.   
 They may also judge that more data  are needed to assess whether  the apparent low 
sensitivity of inflation to tight er resource utilization is only a temporary phenomenon.  
Over the next intermeeting peri od, the Committee will receive t wo additional 
readings on employment, PCE and CPI inflation, as well as other  indicators.   
 Policymakers may also wish to signal that, on net, the economic  outlook continues to 
support the case for implementi ng the balance sheet adjustment program this year.  
They may see a statement like A lternative B as preserving flexibility by conditioning 
the balance sheet normalization on the Committee’s assessment o f incoming data.   
 A decision to keep the current t arget range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this 
meeting and to maintain the option to start implementing the ba lance sheet 
normalization program this year is in line with the current vie ws of financial market 
participants.  As shown in the “M onetary Policy Expectations an d Uncertainty” box, 
federal funds futures quotes imply that market participants on average see about a 40 
percent probability that the federal funds rate will be raised by the end of the year, but 
see only negligible odds of a rate hike at the July meeting.  A dditionally, respondents 
to the Desk’s July surveys on ave rage see the September meeting  as the most likely 
timing for the announcement of a change in the Committee’s rein vestment policy.  A 
statement like Alternative B w ould be roughly in line with the expectations of 
financial market participants a nd thus would likely generate a muted response in 
financial markets.  However, some market participants may be su rprised that the 
statement language does not signa l explicitly that a change in reinvestments is coming 
soon.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty 
Over the intermeeting period, market participants’ views appeared to coalesce 
around a later date for the next policy rate increase but an earlier date for an 
announcement of a change to the FOMC’s reinvestment policy, relative to their views 
before the June FOMC meeting. Under the assumption of zero term premiums, 
quotes on federal funds futures contracts suggest that investors shifted to December 
some of the probability of a rate hike that they previously attached to the September 
meeting (figure 1). They now see essentially zero probability of an increase in the 
target range next week, a probability of about 25 percent that the next rate hike will 
occur in December, and about 60 percent that it will not occur until after year end. 
Respondents to the Desk’s July Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants 
also see little chance of a rate hike next week and placed 50 percent odds on the 
next rate hike occurring at the October November or December meetings (not 
shown). They assigned about 30 percent probability to no further change in the 
federal funds rate this year, lower than the probability implied by futures rates under 
the assumption of zero term premiums.1 
Regarding reinvestment policy, respondents to the Desk’s Surveys on average see 
the September meeting as the most likely time for an announcement of a change to 
the Committee’s reinvestment policy (figure 2).2 By comparison, in the June Surveys, 
respondents assigned equal odds to the reinvestment policy change being 
announced at the September and the December meetings. Respondents generally 
pointed to Federal Reserve communications over this intermeeting period as the 
reason for the changes in their expectations. In addition, almost no respondents 
expect the Committee to raise the target range at the same time that it announces a 
reduction in reinvestments. In response to a special question on the likely market 
impact of the implementation of the Committee’s program for normalizing the 
balance sheet, respondents’ median expectation is for the 10year Treasury yield and 
the 30year MBS option adjusted spread to increase 25 and 15 basis points, 
respectively, over the twoyear period following implementation, although 
respondents appeared to hold fairly diverse views. 
The probability distribution of the federal funds rate at the end of 2018 that is implied 
by options quotes under the assumption of zero term premiums (figure 3) assigns 
about equal probability to the federal funds rate falling into the 1 to 1½ percent range 
or the 1½ to 2 percent range. The average distribution from the July Desk Surveys is 
more diffuse and suggests that respondents see about a 40 percent probability that 
the federal funds rate will be above 2 percent by the end of 2018 (figure 4), 
1 Using OIS rates and adjusting for term premiums using a staff term structure model suggests 
a probability of about 20 percent of no rate increase until after year end.

The market based path of the expected federal funds rate is dependent on the term 
premium assumed in the analysis, as shown in figure 5. The federal funds path 
implied by a straight read of OIS quotes (the black line) was little changed on net 
over the intermeeting period. Under the assumption of zero term premiums, these 
market implied forward rates are consistent with one hike of 25 basis points in 2018, 
with the federal funds rate reaching 1.8 percent by the end of 2020. However, a staff 
term structure model—a model that takes the effective lower bound into account 
and incorporates information from Blue Chip survey forecasts of the federal funds 
rate— suggests that the federal funds rate is expected to rise at a faster pace of 
three hikes in 2018, with the funds rate reaching about 3 percent by the end of 2020 
(the light blue line). The model based path for the federal funds rate is roughly 
consistent with the modal path from the July Desk Surveys (the brown line) and the 
Committee’s June median SEP projections through 2019 (the dark blue dots).3 
Results from the model and the surveys also shed light on market participants’ 
expectations of the longer run level of the federal funds rate (the farright dots in 
figure 5). The staff term structure model estimates that the federal funds rate will 
average about 3¾ percent over the period five to ten years ahead, about unch anged 
from the June FOMC meeting. This level remains about ¾ percentage point above 
the median projection for the longer run federal funds rate from the June SEP and 
1 percentage point above the median from the July Desk Surveys. 
The July survey also asked respondents to assess the current level of the neutral real 
federal funds rate, as well as its level at the end of each of the next three years. As 
shown by the orange horizontal lines in figure 6, the median estimate of the current 
level was ¼ percent, unchanged from the May surveys when this question was last 
asked. The median estimates for the ends of 2017, 2018, and 2019 were 0.38, 0.55, 
and 0.81 percent, respectively, between 12 to 20 basis points lower than those from 
the May surveys. Looking over a longer history, the end2017 and end2018 estimates 
have fallen by 62 and 70 basis points since October 2015, when the Desk first asked 
respondents for their projections of neutral real rates at those dates. That said, 
respondents appeared to hold quite diverse views about the current and future levels 
of the neutral real rate, as is evident from the wide range of estimates shown in 
figure 6. 
3 The model based path is a mean expectation of the federal funds rate whereas the 
survey based path is based on respondents’ modal expectations. Computing a mean path from the 
surveys (based on the surveys’ conditional probability distribution results) requires making a 
number of assumptions. Under some reasonable assumptions, the survey implied mean path 
would lie noticeably below the modal path.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The latest employment report c onfirmed that the labor market ha s continued to 
tighten, so far this year, at about the same pace as during the  second half of 2016.  Job 
gains in April, May, and June w ere substantially above the pace  that likely will be 
required to absorb new entrants into the workforce over the med ium term.  Although 
the unemployment rate ticked up slightly in June, this move was  accompanied by an 
increase in the labor force part icipation rate, which rose modestly above estimates of 
its trend level.  The unemployment rate remains below the staff ’s estimate of the 
natural rate, and somewhat belo w all participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal 
level, consistent with the view  that the economy is operating b eyond maximum 
sustainable employment. 
 The apparent rebound in personal consumption expenditures in the second quarter 
confirms the Committee’s earlier  assessment that real GDP growth would pick up 
from the low rate recorded in t he first quarter.  The economy’s  recent momentum 
may lead policymakers to expect that aggregate demand in the se cond half of 2017 
and in 2018 could grow appreciably faster than the economy’s po tential output, 
supported by solid growth in personal consumption expenditures and business 
investment. 
 The factors that have held down PCE inflation in recent months may be transitory and may have little bearing on the outlook for inflation over the m edium term.  Some 
measures of inflation, such as th e Dallas Fed’s 12-month trimme d mean inflation rate, 
held steady at 1.7 percent for a third consecutive month in May .  Moreover, 
policymakers may note that the staff has not materially changed  its inflation forecast 
beyond this year; headline PCE price inflation is still project ed to run just under 2 
percent in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019.  
 Measures of financial conditions  eased over the past six months even though the 
Committee reduced policy accommodation over the same period and  market 
participants continued to expect  further steps to tighten monet ary policy.  
Policy Strategy 
 In light of continued strong job gains in recent months, policy makers may be 
concerned that reducing accommodation at the gradual pace commu nicated by the 
Committee’s recent statements and actions could lead to substan tial undershooting of

the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  Policymakers may j udge that such 
undershooting would pose upside risks to inflation and apprecia bly raise the 
likelihood that policy may need to be  tightened relatively abruptly, possibly cutting 
short the economic expansion.  
 Policymakers may also be concerned that delaying a further redu ction of policy 
accommodation will spur additional risk-taking in financial mar kets that could 
eventually endanger financial stability.  Furthermore, despite three rate increases 
since December 2016, broad measures  of financial conditions hav e remained 
accommodative—a state of affairs that might bolster the case fo r some policy firming 
at this meeting. 
 For all of the above reasons , and given the outlook for inflati on beyond this year, 
policymakers may favor removing some policy accommodation at this meeting.  They 
may view it appropriate to announce that they will begin implem enting, in September, 
the program of gradual reduction in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings that is 
described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee’s Policy N ormalization 
Principles and Plans.  They may also wish to signal that, while  the target range for the 
federal funds rate is unchanged at this meeting, further increa ses are likely in the near 
term if the economy continues t o evolve as expected.  Moreover,  they may wish to 
indicate that beginning the reduc tion in the size of the balanc e sheet will not warrant a 
flatter path for the feder al funds rate going forward. 
 Policymakers may also find it prudent for the Committee’s state ment to include 
language signaling that further gradual adjustments in the stan ce of monetary policy 
likely will be needed to ensure that job growth moderates to a sustainable pace and 
that inflation stabilizes around the 2 percent objective in the  medium term.   
 Respondents to the Desk’s July surveys place only small odds on  the Committee 
announcing a change to reinvest ment policy at this meeting.  As  a result, a statement 
like Alternative C may surprise market participants considerabl y.  If they infer that 
the Committee intends to pursue a less accommodative stance of policy going 
forward than they had expected given their current outlook for the economy, then 
medium- and longer-term real inter est rates would likely rise, and inflation 
compensation and equity prices dec line.  However, if investors see a statement like 
Alternative C as primarily refle cting an upbeat assessment of t he strength of the U.S. 
expansion then equity prices a nd inflation compensation might fall less than 
otherwise, or even rise.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Both headline and core inflati on continue to run noticeably bel ow the Committee’s 2 
percent inflation object ive.  In every report since March, CPI and PCE price indexes 
were softer than staff expect ed.  While the weak inflation read ings may partly or 
largely be due to one-off or tempor ary factors, the staff has revised down its forecast 
for total and core PCE infla tion over the rest of the year to 1.5 percent, to take on 
board the weakness in some cate gories—such as housing services and other market-
based services—that has been mor e persistent than anticipated. 
 Recent readings on market-based measures of inflation compensat ion and survey-
based measures of longer-term inf lation expectations are little changed and remain 
low by historical standards. 
 While the labor market continue s to strengthen, wage pressures remain subdued.  Job 
gains have been solid in recent months, but the June reading of  average hourly 
earnings indicated continued softness and the May reading of th e Atlanta Fed wage 
tracker edged down.  In addition, rev isions to estimates of com pensation per hour in 
the business sector do not point to a noticeable increase in wa ge pressures. The 
combination of solid job gains and subdued growth in wages suggests that the labor 
market has not yet reached maximum employment.   
 While spending data received dur ing the intermeeting period poi nt to a pickup in 
growth of consumer spending in t he second quarter relative to t he first quarter, retail 
sales declined in June.  Moreover, residential investment has s lowed.  
Policy Strategy 
 Although economic activity has be en rising moderately on averag e in the last few 
months, the absence of inflation pr essures allows the Committee  to remain patient in 
removing accommodation.  Taking into account the soft inflation  readings of late and 
the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, policymakers  may judge that tighter 
resource utilization is necessa ry for inflation to step up.  Th us policymakers might 
want to communicate that an incre ase in the target range for th e federal funds rate 
will not be warranted until there is evidence that the recent s oftness in inflation is 
unlikely to persist.  For the sam e reasons, policymakers may al so view it as premature 
to start implementing changes in the Committee’s reinvestment p olicy.

 Additionally, policymakers may be concerned that removing polic y accommodation 
too quickly may harm the credibility of the Committee’s 2 perce nt inflation objective 
and of policymakers’ statements that positive and negative devi ations from this 
objective are treated symmetrically. 
 Moreover, in light of the recent 50 basis point reduction in th e staff estimate of the 
longer-run equilibrium interest rate, policymakers may judge th at the current stance 
of monetary policy is less accommodative than previously though t.1 
 For all of these reasons, polic ymakers may now see little need to tighten policy 
further in the near term and may prefer a statement along the lines of Alternative A. 
 Decisions to maintain the target range for the federal funds ra te and to continue 
reinvesting maturing and prepayi ng securities would be consiste nt with the 
expectations of market particip ants.  Financial market quotes and the Desk’s July 
surveys indicate that market participants see no material odds that the Committee will 
raise the target range at this meeting; and, according to the D esk’s July surveys, 
nearly all respondents attach the highest probability to a chan ge in the reinvestment 
policy to be announced at the September meeting.  However, the downbeat 
characterization on inflation offe red under Alternative A, together with the indication 
that the Committee will continue  to assess the likelihood that recent low readings on 
inflation will persist, likely w ould surprise the markets.  The  indication that a change 
in reinvestment policy may come “later” this year could also su rprise market 
participants.  The expected path f or the federal funds rate wou ld likely flatten, and 
longer-term yields would likely decline.  
1 The staff has lowered its estimate of the longer-run equilibri um interest rate for two reasons: 
First, to reverse a portion of the fiscal-policy-related increa se introduced in the D ecember 2016 Tealbook; 
and second, to reflect  recent model-based estimates that show t he longer-run neutral real interest rate has 
declined.  These estimates are reviewed in the Box “The Equilib rium Real Rate in the Longer Run” in 
Tealbook A.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and key 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the interest rate 
paths incorporated in the sta ff’s baseline economic outlook pre sented in Tealbook A. 
The “July Tealbook baseline” scenario incorporates paths for in terest rates that are 
noticeably lower than those in t he June Tealbook.  The federal funds rate path is lower by 
about ½ percentage point over the forecast period, with the rat e projected to rise to 3.9 
percent at the end of 2021 before moving down to about 2.6 perc ent by the end of the 
projection period.1  Longer-term interest rates are m arkedly lower than in the June 
Tealbook, reflecting both the downward revision to the projected path of short-term 
interest rates and a decrease in projected term premiums.  
The key changes to our baseline  projection that result from the se revisions, explained in 
detail below, are as follows:  T he size of the balance sheet no rmalizes one quarter earlier, 
in 2021:Q4, due to slightly faster MBS prepayments; annual remi ttances to the Treasury 
are higher through 2023, but lower further out, with cumulative  remittances through the 
projection period about unchanged; and unrealized losses on the  SOMA portfolio are 
smaller throughout the forecast period.  
The key policy assumptions associated with the projections are highlighted below. 
 Reinvestment policy:   Consistent with the Committee’s June 2017 Addendum to its 
Policy Normalization Principles an d Plans, we assume that when the FOMC decides 
to change its reinvestment policy, it will instruct the Desk to  reinvest principal 
repayments received from Treasur y and agency securities held in  the SOMA portfolio 
only to the extent that those pa yments exceed gradually rising dollar caps. As 
specified in that Addendum, we assume that the cap on redemptio ns of Treasury 
securities will rise , in quarterly steps, from an initial value  of $6 billion per month to 
a fully phased-in value of $30 bill ion per month, and the cap o n monthly reductions 
1 See the box “The Equilibrium Rea l Rate in the Longer Run” in T ealbook A for a discussion of 
some of the estimates of the real  federal funds rate in the lon g run.

of holdings of agency debt and MBS will rise from an initial value of $4 billion per 
month to $20 billion per month.  Once the caps reach their resp ective fully phased-in 
values, they will remain in place until the size of the balance  sheet is normalized, 
implying that the Federal Reserv e’s securities holdings will continue to decline in a 
gradual and pred ictable manner.2  The change in reinvestment policy is assumed to be 
announced at the September 2017 FOMC meeting and implemented at the beginning of October, at which time the target range for the federal fund s rate is projected to be 
1¼ to 1½ percent.  Shifting the date  for the program initiation a few months earlier or 
later leads to only negligible cha nges to the pro jections for t he balance sheet and 
income. 
 Longer-run reserve balances:  As in our June projections, we assume that the 
longer-run level of reserve balances is $500 billion.
3  There is a great deal of 
uncertainty about the longer-run level of reserves, which could  be affected by factors 
such as structural changes in the banking system, the effects o f regulation on banks’ 
demand for reserves, and the Committee’s ultimate choice of a l ong-run operating 
framework.  The actual longer-run level of reserves may turn ou t to be appreciably 
smaller or larger than the staff assumption. 
Key features of the balance sheet and income projections are de scribed below: 
 SOMA redemptions .  As shown in the upper left panel  of the exhibit titled “Tota l 
Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items,” once the fully phased -in cap on 
redemptions of $30 billion is in place, reinvestment of some pr incipal from maturing 
Treasury securities would occur mostly in the middle month of each quarter, when 
large amounts of such securities held in the SOMA will mature.  In contrast, the 
$20 billion fully phased-in cap f or agency securities is not projected to bind. 
2 The size of the balance sheet is assumed to be normalized when the Desk is required to resume 
purchases of Treasury securities so as to maintain the desired longer-run level of re serve balances while 
accommodating the expansion of oth er key liability items such a s Federal Reserve notes in circulation, 
Federal Reserve Bank capital, the Treasury General Account, and  reverse repurchase agreements associated 
with foreign official and international accounts (the foreign r epo pool). 
3 Some other noteworthy assumptions concerning our projections of  liabilities are as follows:  
Federal Reserve notes in circula tion are assumed to increase at  the same rate as nominal GDP; the Treasury 
General Account is assumed to be steady at $150 billion; the fo reign repo pool and balances in the accounts 
of designated financial market utilities (DFMUs) remain at thei r June 30, 2017, levels of about $250 billion 
and $75 billion, respectively; and take-up at daily overnight R RP operations is assumed to run at $100 
billion until the level of reserve balances  reaches $1 trillion —a value within $500 billion of its assumed 
longer-run level—and then to decline to zero over the course of one year.

MBS paydowns, which are uncertain, are projected to run at a fa irly steady monthly 
pace, even though, as shown by the blue bars in the figure, rec eipts and reinvestments 
of principal from MBS  securities have historically displayed co nsiderable variability.  
Realized MBS paydowns will reflect the evolution of interest ra tes and other factors, 
and thus could differ significantly from projected values. 
Total redemptions during the first  12 months after the implemen tation of the change 
in reinvestment policy (Octobe r 2017 to September 2018) are pro jected to be 
$293 billion.  Cumulative redemptions over the period from the onset of the phase-in 
until the time when the size of the balance sheet is normalized  are projected to be 
$1.5 trillion, of which about $900 billion is in Treasury securities and $600 billion in 
agency securities. 
 Balance sheet. Normalization of the size of the  balance sheet is projected to occur in 
the fourth quarter of 2021, one quart er earlier t han projected in the June Tealbook 
(see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Shee t Items” and the table 
that follows the exhibit).  T he balance sheet normalizes earlie r in the current 
Tealbook projection because of the  slightly faster pay-down of MBS holdings that 
results from the lower path of m ortgage rates.  At the time reserve balances reach 
$500 billion, total assets are  projected to stand at roughly $2 .9 trillion, with about 
$2.8 trillion in total SOMA secu rities holdings composed of $1. 6 trillion of Treasury 
securities and $1.2 tri llion of MBS.  Total assets and SOMA hol dings rise thereafter, 
keeping pace with the projected increases in Federal Reserve notes in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  
When the size of the balance sheet is normalized, assets and li abilities are each 
projected to stand at roughl y 12½ percent of nominal GDP, down from about 
25 percent at its peak.  Focusing on liabilities, the assumed $ 500 billion longer-run 
level of reserve balances woul d amount to 2 percent of nominal GDP in 2021; this 
share declines modestly over the remainder of the forecast peri od as GDP continues 
to grow.  Federal Reserve notes in circulation are assumed to r emain 8½ percent of 
nominal GDP.  Other liabilities, i ncluding the Treasury’s Gener al Account, the 
foreign repo pool, and DFMU bala nces, amount to roughly 2 perce nt of GDP.  Prior 
to the financial crisis, the  balance sheet equaled about 6 perc ent of nominal GDP, 
with liabilities almost entirel y composed of Federal Reserve notes in circulation.

 Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to decline 
from $92 billion in 2016 to about $78 billion this year (see th e “Income Projections” 
exhibit).  The step-down reflects  higher interest expense resul ting from the recent 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate and th e associated increases in 
interest on reserves as well as the projection for further rate hikes this year.4 
Remittances are projected to continue to decline in coming year s, reaching a trough of 
$36 billion in 2020, as the size of the SOMA portfolio decreases and the target range 
for the federal funds rate move s up further.  Subsequently, rem ittances gradually 
increase as Treasury securities are added to the SOMA portfolio  to match the 
expansion of currency.  The Federa l Reserve’s cu mulative remitt ances from 
2009 through 2025 are about $1.1 trillion. 
Projected cumulative remittances from 2017 through 2023 are $27 billion higher than 
in the June Tealbook, reflecting lower interest expense due to the lower projected 
path of the federal funds rate.  A fter the size of the balance sheet is normalized, 
securities are added to the SOMA p ortfolio at yields lower than  projected in June, 
which reduces interest income.  T his downward revision to inter est income is larger 
than the reduction in interest expense after  2023, resulting in remittances to the 
Treasury that are lower than previously projected.  On net, cum ulative remittances to 
the Treasury through the projec tion period are $3 billion lower  than in the June 
Tealbook.  No deferred asset is projected.5 
 Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of a bout $91 billion at the end of Jun e.6  The net unrealized 
gain or loss position of the portf olio going forward will depen d primarily on the path 
of longer-term interest rates.  I n the July Tealbook, these rat es are expected to rise 
over the next couple of years, and as a result, the portfolio i s projected to shift to an 
unrealized loss position at the s tart of next year.  The portfolio is expected to record a 
peak unrealized loss of $120 b illion in 2019:Q3.  This is about  $100 billion smaller 
4 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate.  We also continue to assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances and the 
offering rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RR Ps) will be set at th e top and the bottom 
of the range, respectively. 
5 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury.  
6 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

than in the June Tealbook baseline  as a result of the currently forecasted lower path 
for longer-term interest rates .  Of the overall projected peak unrealized loss, about 
$29 billion is attributable to holdings of Treasury securities and $91 billion to 
holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position subsequen tly narrows and 
returns to an unrealized gai n position by the end of the projec tion period for two 
reasons:  First, the value of s ecurities acquired under successive large-scale asset 
purchase programs (LSAPs) return s to par as those securities ap proach maturity; 
second, securities purchased after  normalization are projected to increase in value 
above par as interest rates appr oach their longer-run levels. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” the $4.2 t rillion of securities held in t he SOMA are estimated 
to be currently reducing the ter m premium in the 10-year Treasu ry yield (and thus the 
level of that yield) by 90 basis  points.  This effect, little c hanged from the previous 
Tealbook, is projected to become gr adually less negative over time.7  The evolution 
of the estimated term premium effect depends importantly on the  difference between 
the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s balan ce sheet over c oming years and a 
benchmark counterfactual projectio n for the balance sheet that excludes the effects of 
asset purchases.8  The effect gradually fades over time, reflecting the converge nce of 
the balance sheet to the path i mplied by the counterfactual pro jection. 
 SOMA characteristics.  The weighted-average dur ation of the SOMA Treasury 
portfolio is currently about 6¼ y ears (see the top panel of “Pr ojections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Holdings” exhibit).  The weighted-avera ge duration is 
projected to decline sl ightly this year as the securities in th e portfolio approach 
7 The term premium effect in the Tealbook B projections is about  the same as in June because the 
assumed evolution of the SOMA portfolio is about unchanged.  Ju ne Tealbook B incorporated a new 
assumed path for the balance sheet based on the information inc luded in the Addendum that was released 
after the June meeting and an upward revision to the assumed lo nger-run level of reserve balances.  
However, July Tealbook A includes a downward revision to the te rm premium effect.  This revision 
reflects the fact that the June Tealbook A did not incorporate these new balance sheet assumptions. 
Consequently, Tealbook A now includes a downward revision to th e term premium effect as its path for the 
balance sheet “catches up” to the higher path incorporated in T ealbook B. 
8 In the benchmark counterfactual balance sheet projection, the staff continues to assume a longer-
run level of reserves of $100 billion.

late 2021.9 
After reaching its peak, durati on is projected to decline as th e Desk purchases 
Treasury securities to keep pace w ith the increase in Federal R eserve notes in 
circulation and Federal Reserve B ank capital, as well as the on going principal 
repayments of MBS.  The durati on contour in this later portion of the projection is 
based on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will limit its  purchases to Treasury 
bills until they account for one-third of the Treasury portfoli o, close to the pre-crisis 
composition (currently the SOMA portfolio holds no Treasury bil ls).  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread acros s the maturity 
spectrum (see the bottom panel, “ Maturity Composition of SOMA T reasury 
Portfolio”). 
9 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 when the pace of  runoffs picks up and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o; duration increases until the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized.
