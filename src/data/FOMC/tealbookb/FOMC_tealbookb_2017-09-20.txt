The data received over the intermeeting period have continued t o underscore a 
tension between ongoing strengthening of the labor market and economic activity, on the 
one hand, and soft inflation read ings, on the other.  The two employment reports received 
since the July meeting indicate th at the labor market has stren gthened further.  Moreover, 
other data releases suggest tha t real GDP growth stepped up in the second quarter to a 
pace notably above that of potential output.  Meanwhile, 12-mon th changes in headline 
and core PCE prices have contin ued to run near 1½ percent.  Mor e recently, the country 
has borne the effects of hurrica nes Harvey and Irma, particular ly in Texas and Florida.  
Although information is incomplete and assessments are subject to change, the staff 
currently anticipates that ther e will be appreciable effects on  quarter-to-quarter outcomes 
for output and inflation in the  second half of the year, but th at the implications over the 
medium term will be minimal. 
As discussed in the box “Monetary  Policy Expectations and Uncer tainty,” market 
participants seem to have interpr eted previous communications a s indicating that it is 
highly likely the Committee will announce, in its September sta tement, that it will initiate 
its program for balance sheet  normalization, but would defer to  a later date an increase in 
the target range for the feder al funds rate.  Over the intermee ting period, financial 
conditions have eased further including a decline in the broad dollar of about 1.5 percent, 
a decline in the 10-year Treas ury rate of about 15 basis points, and an increase in stock 
prices of almost 1 percent, while the perceived probability of another increase in the 
federal funds rate before year end is slightly lower than at th e time of the July meeting.   
The principal policy questions tha t the Committee faces at this  meeting are, first, 
whether the condition specified i n the July postmeeting stateme nt for commencing the 
balance sheet normalization program —namely that “the economy ev olves broadly as 
anticipated”—has been satisfie d, and second, whether the incomi ng data and expectations 
about future monetary policy sugg est a need to change the Commi ttee’s communications 
regarding the likely paths of the  economy or the federal funds rate.   
This Tealbook contains three draft statements for the Committee ’s consideration.  
They offer somewhat different ass essments of the recent informa tion on labor market 
conditions, economic activity, and inflation.  All three statem ents have the Committee 
announce the initiation of the program of balance sheet reducti on.  They also leave the

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty 
Over the intermeeting period, market participants’ expectations appeared to 
converge on the view that the Committee will announce the beginning of its 
balance sheet normalization plan in the September postmeeting statement. 
Respondents to the Desk’s Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants 
attached a median probability of 90 percent to such an annou ncement being 
made at the upcoming meeting (not shown). 
Under the assumption of zero term premiums, quotes on federal funds futures 
contracts suggest that investors now attach a probability of about 40 percent to 
a 25basis point rate hike by year end (with virtually all probability concentrated 
on the December meeting), down from 50 percent just prior to the July FOMC 
meeting (figure 1). Using a staff term structure model to adjust for term 
premiums, the implied probability of a rate hike before year end stands at about 
65 percent, 15 percentage points lower than at the time of the July FOMC 
meeting (figure 2).1 Respondents to the Desk’s surveys on average assigned 
about a 55 percent probability to another rate increase this year, with most of 
this probability attached to the December meeting (not shown). The average 
survey based probability was 65 percent in the July survey. 
The probability distribution of the level of the federal funds rate at the end of 
2018 implied by options quotes under the assumption of zero term premiums has 
shifted slightly to the left since the July meeting (figure 3). The distribution 
attaches the highest odds, at about 40 percent probability, to scenarios in which 
the federal funds rate is in the 1¼ to 1½ percent rang e. The average distribution 
across respondents to the September Desk surveys (figure 4) is notably more 
diffuse than its counterpart from the options markets. 
The estimated market based path of the expected federal funds rate depends on 
the term premium assumed in the analysis. The federal funds rate path implied 
by a straight read of OIS quotes assuming zero term premiums (the black line in 
figure 5) moved down over the intermeeting period, declining up to 20 basis 
points by the end of 2020. These market implied forward rates are consistent 
with an expected federal funds rate of about 1.4 percent at the end of 2018 and 
1.7 percent at the end of 2020. The expected path of the federal funds rate 
adjusting for term premiums as estimated by the staff term structure model (the 
light blue line) has also declined a bit since the July FOMC meeting. However, the 
model based path continues to suggest a faster pace of rate increases than the 
unadjusted path, with an expected federal funds rate of 2.1 percent at the end of 
2018 and almost 2.9 percent at the end of 2020. The model based path for the

information from Blue Chip survey forecasts of the federal funds rate, also generates the blue 
line shown in figure 5.

federal funds rate is roughly consistent with the modal path from the September 
Desk surveys (the brown line) and the Committee’s June median SEP projections 
(the dark blue dots) for 2017 and 2018. Of note, however, the model based path 
is a mean expectation of the federal funds rate whereas the survey based path is 
based on respondents’ modal expectations. Computing a mean path from the 
surveys (based on the surveys’ unconditional and conditional probability 
distribution results) requires making a number of assumptions. Under a set of 
reasonable assumptions, the survey implied mean path constructed from 
respondents’ probability distributions (the golden squares) lies noticeably below 
both the modal path from the surveys and the model implied mean path.2 
Results from the model and the surveys also shed light on market participants’ 
expectations  of the longer run level of the federal funds rate (the farright dots in 
figure 5). The staff term structure model estimates that the federal funds rate 
will average 3.7 percent over the period five to ten years ahead, a downward 
revision of about 5 basis points relative to estimates before the July FOMC 
meeting. This level remains 0.7 percentage points above the median projection 
for the longer run federal funds rate from the June SEP and almost 1 percentage 
point above the median from the September Desk surveys. 
Recent market commentary on the likely path of the federal funds rate has 
focused on the implications of the soft inflation readings since the spring for the 
inflation outlook. The Survey of Primary Dealers asks respondents to assess the 
most likely level of future core PCE inflation. As shown by the golden horizontal 
bars in figure 6, the median estimate of core PCE inflation in 2017 was 1.5 percent 
in the September survey, 0.1 percentage points lower than in July. Although the 
median forecast for 2018, at 1.9 percent, was unchanged from the July survey, 
forecasts have, on average , shifted down slightly in the September survey. 
2 The estimation of this mean path requires assigning numerical values to bins of federal 
funds rate outcomes that are quite wide and in some cases open ended.

target range for the federal f unds rate unchanged at this meeti ng, but they differ on the 
signal they provide the public about the future stance of monet ary policy.   
 In characterizing the labor mar ket, the Alternatives note that it has continued either to 
“strengthen,” in Alternatives A  and B, or “tighten,” as in Alte rnative C. 
o Alternative A acknowledges that job gains “have remained solid,  on average,” 
but adds that the unemployment rate “has changed little in rece nt months” and 
wage gains “have continued to be  subdued.”  In contrast, Altern ative B notes 
that job gains “have remained solid in recent months” and the u nemployment 
rate “has stayed low.”  Alternat ive C states that job gains “have remained 
strong” and that the unemployment rate “remains at a low level. ” 
 The three Alternatives are ide ntical in their descriptions of i nflation, stating that 
overall and core inflation rates “ have declined this year,” and  “are running below” the 
Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. 
o In describing inflation expectations, Alternatives A and B are unchanged from 
the July postmeeting statement, saying that market-based measur es of 
inflation compensation “remain l ow” and that survey-based measu res are 
“little changed, on balance.”  Alte rnative C describes both mar ket-based 
measures of inflation compensation and survey-based measures of  inflation 
expectations as “little changed, on balance.” 
 With regard to economic activity, the three Alternatives differ modestly in how they 
describe household spending and bus iness fixed investment. 
o Alternative A states that  both household spending and business fixed 
investment “have been expanding a t moderate rat es.”  Alternativ es B and C 
have the same description as Alternative A for household spending but note 
that growth in business fixed inve stment “has picked up in recent quarters.”  
The July statement merely note d that both household spending an d business 
fixed investment “have continued to expand.” 
 When characterizing the economic outlook:  
o The principal addition to the th ree statements is an assessment of the effects of 
hurricanes Harvey and Irma, whic h appears in identical form in all three 
Alternatives.  After acknowle dging the hardship inflicted by th e hurricanes, it 
indicates that, while the storm s and the recovery from them “wi ll affect 
economic activity in the near term,” it is not likely that “the  course of the

national economy over the medium term” will be altered material ly.  In 
addition, the three Alternatives acknowledge the temporary effe ct of the 
hurricanes on inflation due to increases in the prices of gasoline and some 
other items. 
o After allowing for the effects of  the hurricanes, Alternatives A and B reaffirm 
the Committee’s expectation that economic activity will expand at a moderate 
pace; Alternative C suggests that growth of employment and econ omic 
activity will moderate to “sustainable rates in the medium term.” 
o With regard to the labor market, Alternatives A and B indicate that conditions will “strengthen somewhat further,” while Alternative C, as alr eady noted, 
suggests that employment growth w ill “moderate” to a “sustainab le” rate. 
o On the outlook for inf lation, Alternatives B and C repeat the w ording of the 
July statement that inflati on on a 12-month basis is expected t o “remain 
somewhat below” 2 percent in the near term.  Alternative A hint s at a more 
gradual return of inflation to 2 percent , by dropping the word “somewhat” to 
state that the Committee expect s inflation to “remain below” 2 percent in the 
near term.  Over the medium term, however, the three Alternativ es all reaffirm 
the forecast that inflation will “stabilize around” the Committ ee’s 2 percent 
objective, just as in the July statement. 
o Each Alternative retains the a ssessment of the July statement that the near-
term risks to the economic outl ook appear roughly balanced, and  that the 
Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. 
 With regard to the policy decisions for this meeting, all three  alternatives announce 
that the balance sheet normali zation program will begin in Octo ber.  In addition, all 
three Alternatives state that the Committee decided it is appro priate to maintain the 
current target range of the fed eral funds rate at 1 to 1¼ percent.  However, the three 
Alternatives differ in notewort hy ways on the expected path for  the federal funds rate 
that is judged necessary to achieve the economic outcomes noted  above.   
o Alternative B retains the langua ge from earlier statements, nam ely that 
“gradual increases” in the federal funds rate will be warranted  and that the 
funds rate is likely to remain, “for some time,” below its long er-run normal 
level.   
o Alternative A is silent on wha t adjustments, if any, would be r equired for the 
Committee to achieve its objectives, stating simply that “appro priate monetary

policy accommodation” would suffi ce, and noting that it is “ass essing the 
likelihood that recent low readings on inflation will persist.”   In this way, 
Alternative A, while  not closing the door to a dditional rate hi kes, introduces 
the possibility that that no further rate hikes may be necessary, or even that a 
reduction might become appropriate.  
o In contrast, Alternative C suggest s that “further gradual incre ases” in the 
stance of policy are expected.  It also adds the words “for the  time being” 
immediately after the policy announcement in paragraph 3, hinti ng at a rate 
hike as soon as at the next m eeting.  Finally, Alternative C de letes the text that 
says the federal funds rate is “ likely to remain, for some time,” below longer-
run normal levels.  In conjuncti on with the addition of the wor d “further” in 
paragraph 2, noted above, these cha nges would in all likelihood  be taken as 
saying that policy accommodation would be removed somewhat more quickly, or that the federal f unds rate might climb to a higher  level during this 
tightening cycle, than previously suggested.

JULY 2017 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in June indicates 
that the labor market has conti nued to strengthen and that economic activity has been 
rising moderately so far this year . Job gains have been solid, on average, since the 
beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined. Household spending 
and business fixed investment have continued to expand. On a 12 -month basis, 
overall inflation and the meas ure excluding food and energy prices have declined and 
are running below 2 percent. Mar ket-based measures of inflation  compensation 
remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expe ctations are little 
changed, on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability. T he Committee continues to expe ct that, with gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen some what further. 
Inflation on a 12-month basis is e xpected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the 
near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent obj ective over the 
medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear rou ghly balanced, but 
the Committee is monitoring inf lation developments closely. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the  target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 
percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, t hereby supporting 
some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sus tained return to 2 
percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation. 
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments. The 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative 
to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that eco nomic conditions will 
evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the f ederal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below le vels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run. Howev er, the actual path of the fede ral funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. 
5. For the time being, the Committee is maintaining its existing p olicy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its hol dings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage- backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction. The Comm ittee expects to begin implement ing its balance sheet 
normalization program relatively soon, provided that the econom y evolves broadly as 
anticipated; this program is de scribed in the June 2017 Addendu m to the Committee's 
Policy Normalization Pri nciples and Plans.

has been expanding at a moderate rate,  and growth in  business fixed investment 
have continued to expand has picked up in recent quarters .  On a 12-month basis, 
overall inflation and the meas ure excluding food and energy prices have declined this 
year  and are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inf lation 
compensation rem ain low; and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation 
expectations are lit tle changed, on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have devastated 
many communities, inflicting sev ere hardship.  Storm-related di sruptions and 
rebuilding w ill affect economic ac tivity in the near term, but past experience 
suggests th at the storms are unl ikely to materially alter the course of the 
national economy over the mediu m term.   The Committee continues to expect s 
that, with further  gradual adjustments in the  stance of monetary policy, grow th in 
economic activity and employment will expand at a moderate pace to sustainable 
rates in the medium term , and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat 
further.  Higher prices for gasoline and so me other items in the aftermath of the 
hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation 
on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 perc ent in the near term 
but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective ove r the medium term.  
Near-term risks to the econo mic outlook appear roughly balanced , but the Committee 
is monitoring inflation developments closely. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1-1/4 
percent for the time being.  The stance of monetary polic y remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting some further st rengthening in labor market c onditions and a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  The 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative 
to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will 
evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds 
rate; the federal funds rate is  likely to remain, for some time , below levels that are

expected to prevail in the longe r run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds 
rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incomin g data. 
5. For the time being, the Committee is maintaining its existing p olicy of reinvesting 
principal payments from its hol dings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed 
securities in agency mortgage- backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury 
securities at auction.  In October, the Committee expects to begin implementing its 
will initiate the balance sheet norm alization program relatively soon, provided that 
the econom y evolves broadly as anticipated; this program is des cribed in the June 
2017 Addendum to the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principle s and Plans.   
In future FOMC statements, paragraph 5 could become:  “Balance sheet normalization is 
proceeding in accordance with the program that the Committee in itiated in O ctober 2017; 
that program is described in t he June 2017 Addendum to the Comm ittee’s Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans.”

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The two employment reports that were received during the interm eeting period 
indicate that the labor market  strengthened further, about as e xpected.   
o Nonfarm payroll employment rose an average of 185,000 over the three 
months ending in August, well abov e estimates of the level nece ssary to 
maintain a constant unemployment  rate.  Even so, the labor force participation 
rate climbed 0.2 percentage point  to 62.9 percent, and thus the  unemployment 
rate remained about flat, albeit at a level below all participa nts’ estimates of 
its longer-run normal level in the  June SEP.  Finally, wage growth continued 
to be subdued. 
 Over the 12 months ending in July, both headline and core PCE p rice inflation were 
at 1.4 percent. 
o Prior to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, headline and core PCE infl ation had both 
come in very close to expectati ons.  While inflation readings h ad been 
surprisingly low during the spri ng and early summer months, tha t decline is 
believed to reflect, in part, idi osyncratic factors; as a matte r of simple 
accounting, these unexpectedly l ow prior readings on PCE and CP I inflation 
will hold down 12-month inflation m easures for some time.  The idiosyncratic 
factors, and the effects of the storm-related disruptions, have  not changed the 
staff’s view that the underlyi ng trend in inflation remains at a rate of about 1¾ 
percent. 
o The economic effects of the hurricanes are expected to include a sizable 
increase in prices of gasoline that will temporarily raise head line inflation, but 
the effects on other items will likely be too small to leave an  imprint on core 
inflation. 
o Measures of longer-run inflation e xpectations, both market- and  survey-based, 
were little changed over the intermeeting period. 
 Economic activity expanded at a moderate pace, on average, over  the first half of the 
year, with contributions coming f rom a broad set of expenditure  categories including 
personal consumption expenditure s and business fixed investment .  Hurricane Harvey 
is estimated to have had a subs tantial negative effect on the e xtraction of crude oil 
and natural gas, on chemical production and refining, and on tr ansportation, in south

Texas.  Hurricane Irma, on the ot her hand, is currently estimat ed to have smaller 
effects.  For national output and e mployment, the implications of the two storms, 
taken together, are expected to be modest and temporary. 
 Financial conditions eased over the intermeeti ng period, as cap tured by a decline of 
the 10-year Treasury rate of 15 ba sis points since the Committe e met in July, a fall in 
the exchange value of the dollar of about 1½ percent, and a rise in stock prices of 
about 1 percent.  Meanwhile, financi al market participants have marked down slightly 
the likelihood of an increase in t he target range for the feder al funds rate before year-
end.  Respondents to the Desk’s su rveys in September also reduc ed their estimates of 
the likelihood of an increase in t he federal funds rate before year-end, on average.   
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may view the information received over the interme eting period as 
indicating that the labor market is close to maximum sustainabl e employment, if not 
somewhat beyond it, while inflati on continues to run below the 2 percent objective.  
Policymakers also may view the a vailable information as indicat ing, on balance, that 
economic activity is growing about  as expected and along lines consistent with the 
medium-term achievement of the ir policy objectives.  On that ba sis, they may judge 
that the course of policies they sketched out in previous meeti ngs, including a 
gradually rising path f or the target range f or the federal fund s rate and prompt 
commencement of the balance sh eet normalization program, remain s appropriate.   
 Policymakers may see the medium-term outlook for inflation and the labor market as little changed since their previ ous meeting, with the unemployment rate falling a bit 
further below their estimates  of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and 
inflation reaching 2 percent by 2019.  They may also concur wit h the judgment of the 
staff, described elsewhere in th is Tealbook, that there is suff icient evidence to reduce 
their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  They may therefore 
judge that the economy is on essent ially the same course as it was in July and thus a 
statement like that in Alternative B is appropriate. 
 Policymakers might also regard the current meeting as a propiti ous time for initiating 
their balance sheet normalizati on program without a simultaneous change in the 
target range for the federal  funds rate.  They may judge such a  combination as 
maximizing the chances that the program’s commencement will go smoothly, while also enabling them to observe the  initial stages of the process  before raising the 
federal funds rate further.

 Policymakers may also judge that some additional data would be helpful for assessing 
whether the Consumer  Price Index report for August presages the end of the recent 
string of low readings on core PC E price inflation.  That might be the case if those 
low readings were largely the result of idiosyncratic price cha nges; if so, the 12-
month measure of PCE inflation could be expecte d to establish an upward course 
toward policymakers’ 2 percent  objective in the coming year.  S imilarly, although 
policymakers may agree with the staff’s assessment of the likel y effects of the 
hurricanes on employment and output, they might choose to wait until it has been 
established that the effects will prove to be as limited as pre dicted. 
 Policymakers might continue to j udge that the risks to the outl ook in the near term 
remain roughly balanced, amid expect ed near-term fluctuations a ssociated with the 
effects of the hurricanes and recent inflation developments tha t bear close watching. 
 Policymakers may judge that mark et expectations regarding the f uture path of the 
federal funds rate are broadly consistent with the Committee ac hieving its objectives 
over the medium term.  Or they m ight believe that, in light of the information 
becoming available over the next  couple of intermeeting periods, it would be 
premature to be concerned with the  market’s current assessment of the Committee’s 
next adjustment to monetary polic y.  For either of these reasons, these policymakers 
might conclude that no change in s tatement language aimed at in ducing a 
reassessment by markets of future monetary policy actions would  be appropriate at 
this time. 
 As shown in the “Monetary Polic y Expectations and Uncertainty” box, federal funds 
futures quotes (without adjustme nt for term premiums) imply tha t market participants 
on average regard the odds of a rat e hike at the September meet ing as negligible and 
see about a 40 percent probability that the federal funds rate will be raised again by 
the end of the year.  Results from the September Desk’s surveys show that the average expectation of the like lihood of a further  increase in the federal funds rate 
before year-end is 55 percent.  The  surveys also show that mark et participants 
perceive a very high likelihood that the FOMC will announce, ne xt week, the 
initiation date for its balance sh eet normalization plan.  Take n together, this suggests 
that the unchanged language i n paragraphs 3 and  4 of Alternativ e B would likely 
generate a muted response in financial markets.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The Committee’s assessment, earlier this year, that real GDP growth would pick up 
from the low rate reported in t he first quarter proved to be ac curate.  Much, but not 
all, of the rebound has come in the  form of increased consumer spending.  Indeed, 
there has been a broad strength a cross expenditure categories.  The economy’s recent 
momentum may lead policymakers to expect that aggregate demand in the second 
half of 2017 and in 2018 could grow considerably faster than th e economy’s potential 
output. 
 Total nonfarm payroll employment  continued to rise at a pace that is well above what 
is commonly regarded as necessar y to maintain a constant unempl oyment rate.  The 
moderation over the three mont hs ending in August was entirely due to weak 
government employment which might be a statistical anomaly; in contrast, private 
payrolls rose 191,000 per month, on average, over the last thre e months.  The 
momentum in the labor market pos es the risk of a significant ov ershooting of 
maximum employment. 
 The unemployment rate was about flat over the intermeeting peri od, but this move 
was accompanied by an increase in the labor force participation  rate of 0.2 percentage 
point to 62.9 percent.  The increas e in the labor force participation rate runs against a 
downward trend reflecting demographic forces and could be one sign that labor is becoming scarce.  Other signs of i ncipient labor shortages may include the dwindling 
proportion of individuals who are  employed part time for econom ic reasons, the 
apparent reduction in geographical labor force mobility, and th e prospective 
curtailment of immigration.  These observations are consistent with the fact that the 
projected unemployment rate remain s below all participants’ est imates of its longer-
run normal level in the June SEP.  Accordingly, some policymake rs may judge that 
an overly gradual reduction in policy accommodation could resul t in either a 
noteworthy overshooting of the C ommittee’s inflation objective that could be costly 
to reverse, or to imbalances t hat might prove difficult to unwi nd without a rapid and 
disruptive tighten ing in policy. 
 Although most measures of nominal wages have yet to show much a cceleration, the 
Atlanta Fed wage tracker, whic h measures wage growth of a class  of employees who 
have been in continuous employment, has registered stronger gro wth.  Consequently, 
some policymakers might be persuaded that the “Steeper Phillips  Curve” alternative

scenario shown in the “Risks and Uncertainties” section of Tealbook A might be 
germane to the current situation. 
Policy Strategy 
 In light of continued strong job gains in recent months, policy makers may be 
concerned that reducing accommodation at the pace communicated by the 
Committee’s recent statements and actions could lead to substan tial undershooting of 
the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  Policymakers may j udge that such 
undershooting would pose upside risk s to inflation and raise th e likelihood that policy 
may need to be tightened relatively abruptly.  
 Some policymakers might note that  the staff projects a somewhat  stronger economy 
in this Tealbook than was the case in July, with conventional m easures of resource 
utilization showing greater tightness at the end of the projection period, despite a slightly steeper projected path f or the federal funds rate.  On  this basis, these 
policymakers might conclude that  upside risks that were present  in July have been 
exacerbated. 
 Policymakers may note that the intermeeting period has seen a f urther marked 
decrease in longer-term bond rates  as well as in mortgage rates , more depreciation of 
the exchange value of the dollar , and continuing low levels of financial market 
volatility.  Noting that financia l conditions have eased for th e past year and a half, 
some policymakers might conclude that financial market conditio ns have not been 
moving in a manner consistent with  the actual and expected futu re stance of monetary 
policy.  Against this background, they may be concerned that re peating recent 
communications about future monetary policy will reinforce mark et expectations of a 
very gradual reduction of policy a ccommodation which could spur undue risk-taking 
in financial markets that might  ultimately endanger financial s tability. 
 For all of the above reasons, and in view of the outlook for in flation beyond this year, 
policymakers may opt to signal a n increased likelihood of an in crease in the federal 
funds rate in the not-too-distan t future, and to reinforce this  signal with the suggestion 
that either more increases in t he federal funds rate might be w arranted than previously 
thought, or that increases could come more rapidly.  Accordingly, policymakers might favor a statement along the  lines of Alternative C which,  among other things, 
removes the existing language suggesting that th e policy rate w ould remain below 
normal levels for some time.

 A statement like Alternative C would surprise market participan ts.  If the public were 
to infer that the Committee intends to pursue a less accommodative policy stance in 
the future as a matter of policy preferences—that is, holding c onstant their outlook for 
the economy—then medium- and longer-term real interest rates wo uld likely rise, as 
would the exchange value of the  dollar, and equity prices and i nflation compensation 
would probably fall.  If instead i nvestors were to see a statement like Alternative C as 
primarily reflecting an upbeat ass essment of the strength of th e U.S. economic 
expansion, and not a revelation abou t policymaker preferences, then equity prices 
might fall less than otherwise , or even rise, and inflation com pensation might rise as 
well. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Both headline and core inflati on continue to run noticeably bel ow the Committee’s 2 
percent inflation object ive.  In nearly every report from March  through July, CPI and 
PCE price indexes were softer than generally expected.  The weak inflation readings 
may partly or largely be due t o one-off or temporary factors.  However, the staff 
projects headline and core PCE pr ice inflation rates to stand n ear 1.5 percent by the 
end of the year, reflecting in part  weakness in some price cate gories—such as housing 
services and other market-based s ervices—that has been more persistent than 
anticipated. 
 Recent readings on market-based measures of inflation compensat ion and survey-
based measures of longer-term inf lation expectations are little changed over the 
intermeeting period but are low  by historical standards.  Moreo ver, the Michigan 
survey of inflation expectations over the next five to ten years has steadily declined 
over the past four years. 
 The combination of solid job ga ins and subdued growth in wages suggests that the 
labor market may not yet have reached maximum employment.  Rece nt increases in 
payroll employment have been w ell above what is commonly though t to be necessary 
to maintain a constant unemploym ent rate, and yet that was also  true last year, but 
rising labor force participation last year kept the unemploymen t rate almost 
unchanged; indeed, a string of positi ve surprises in labor force participation this year 
have induced upward revisions by th e staff to estimates of tren d labor force 
participation.

 The factors that have held down PCE price inflation in recent m onths may well be 
transitory, but the Dallas Fed’ s 12-month trimmed mean inflatio n rate slipped 0.1 
percentage points t o 1.6 percent in July after having held stea dy for three months.  
Moreover, policymakers may note th at despite the surprising near-term strength in 
economic activity, the staff has  not materially changed its inf lation forecast beyond 
this year:  Headline PCE price inflation, measured on a four-qu arter basis, is 
projected to be very low this  year, at 1.5 percent, and remain a bit below 2 percent in 
2018.  If the staff assessment that the output gap has now been  positive for over a 
year is correct, it might mean that the output sensitivity in t he short-run Phillips curve 
is weak and that inflation will dr ift downward with long-term inflation expectations, 
along the lines of the “Different  Inflation Process” alternativ e simulation shown in the 
Risks & Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.  
 The bulk of the news on expenditures and production over the pa st few months has 
been either consistent with exp ectations or a touch to the stro ng side.  But the weak 
spots recently have been in the most interest-sensitive compone nts of the economy, 
namely, residential investment and automobile sales.  This weak ness could indicate 
that the neutral rate of interes t is lower than thought.  The f act that longer-term 
interest rates have declined s ince the beginning of the year, w ithout any concomitant 
indications of significant dete rioration in long-term inflation  expectations, could be 
taken as supporting this conclu sion.  A lower neutral rate woul d point to a more 
gradual, or a more abbreviated, p ace of increases in the target  range for the federal 
funds rate. 
Policy Strategy 
 Although economic activity has be en rising moderately on averag e in the last few 
quarters, the absence of inflati on pressures allows the Committ ee to remain patient in 
removing accommodation.  Taking into account the soft inflation  readings of late, and 
the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook, policymakers  may judge that tighter 
resource utilization is necessa ry for inflation to step up, or that allowing higher levels 
of activity would be an acceptable risk for policymakers to take.   
 The uncertainties associated with quantifying the effects of re cent hurricanes on 
activity and prices would also suppo rt a cautious approach to r emoving policy 
accommodation, all else equal. 
 Additionally, policymakers may be concerned that removing polic y accommodation 
too quickly may harm the credibility of the Committee’s 2 perce nt longer-run 
Alternatives    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Authorized for Public Release
inflation objective and of the Co mmittee’s statement that posit ive and negative 
deviations from this objective are treated symmetrically.  
 Moreover, if policymakers, like the staff, have revised down th eir estimates of the 
longer-run normal interest rate since June, they may judge that the current stance of 
monetary policy is le ss accommodative than pr eviously thought.  They might also 
note that a lower longer-run normal interest rate, all else equ al, implies a higher 
likelihood of the federal funds rat e returning to the effective lower bound, which 
would argue for greater cauti on in removing accommodation. 
 On the basis of these arguments , policymakers might want to com municate not just 
that no increase in the target r ange for the federal funds rate  is warranted at this 
meeting, but also to suggest that no further tightening will be forthcoming until there 
is evidence that the recent softness in inflation is unlikely t o persist.  They might wish 
to pair this change with removi ng the language, contained in ma ny previous 
statements, that “gradual increases” in the federal funds rate are warranted to achieve 
the Committee goals.  
 Financial market quotes and the D esk’s September surveys indica te that market 
participants see little or no chance of an adjustment in the fe deral funds rate at this 
meeting.  Nevertheless, a statement along the lines of Alternat ive A would likely be 
regarded as a significant change in the Committee’s policy outl ook.  If the public 
were to take the changes outlined in Alternative A as reflectin g Committee pessimism 
regarding the future course of  inflation, then market-based mea sures of inflation 
compensation would presumably fall.  In addition, medium- and l onger-term real 
interest rates would likely fall , as would the exchange value of the dollar and equity 
prices.  If instead investors were  to see this statement as primarily reflecting a 
clarification of polic y preferences—perhaps as a statement of r enewed resolve to get 
inflation rapidly and consisten tly up to 2 percent—then inflati on compensation could 
rise, real longer-term interest  rates would probably fall less than under the alternative 
interpretation, and equity prices  might rise as well.  The effe ct on the dollar would be 
ambiguous, with lower real rates  and higher future inflation po inting to depreciation, 
but stronger economic activ ity suggesting the opposite.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
Inasmuch as all of the Alterna tives incorporate a decision to i nitiate the balance 
sheet normalization plan in Oct ober, and none includes an incre ase in the target range for 
the federal funds rate at this meeting, only one implementation  note is shown on the 
following pages.  It indicates no changes in the target range f or the federal funds rate or 
in the Federal Reserve’s adm inistered rates.  A decision to ini tiate the change in 
reinvestment policy described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee’s Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans would be reflected in new la nguage in the domestic 
policy directive, which, as usual , will be released as part of the implementation note.  The 
necessary new language is includ ed in the directive portion of the implementation note 
that begins on the next page.  In that note, struck-out text indicates language deleted from 
the July implementation note , bold red underlined  text indicate s added language, and blue 
underlined text indicates tex t that links to websites. 
There are two noteworthy aspects of  the red language.  First, t he draft directive 
instructs the Desk to implement  the balance sheet reduction plan “in October 2017” 
rather than “on October 1, 2017.”  T he reasons for specifying “October” rather than 
“October 1” are:  (1) the SOMA  holds Treasury securities that m ature in October, but 
none that mature before October  31; (2) the Desk receives a fin al (though not always 
accurate) estimate of the amount of  MBS principal that it is li kely to receive during a 
month on the 8th business day of that month, and it announces o n the 9th business day 
the operations that it plans t o conduct to reinvest that princi pal (moreover, in early 
October the Desk will still be r einvesting MBS principal receiv ed in September); and (3) 
October 1 is a Sunday.  Second, the d raft directive includes a short sentence stating that:  
“Small deviations from these am ounts for operational reasons ar e acceptable.”  The 
reason for including the “small de viations” sentence is that, while the Desk should be 
able to reinvest precisely all but $6 billion of maturing Treasury securities (unless the 
Treasury cannot auction new debt to redeem maturing securities) , it may not be 
operationally feasible to reinve st exactly all but $4 billion o f principal from MBS, though 
the Desk normally should be able to come close.  This sentence is intended to allow the 
Desk some modest operational flex ibility.  If the Desk anticipa tes that it will not be 
feasible to come close, it would consult with the Chair and Com mittee.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation 
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 26 
September 20, 2017: 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to 
maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 1.25 
percent. 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open 
Market Account in accordance with  the following domestic policy  directive: 
“Effective July 27 September 21, 2017, the Federal Open Market 
Committee directs the Desk to unde rtake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain the federal  funds rate in a target range of 1 to 1-1/4 
percent, including overnight rever se repurchase operations (and  reverse 
repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading 
conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 percent, in amounts li mited only 
by the value of Treasury securi ties held outright in the System  Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over m aturin g 
Treasury securities at auction Treasury securities maturing during 
September, and to continue reinvesting prin cipal payments on all agency 
debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-b acked 
securities the principal payments received through September from 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings  of agency debt and agency mortga ge-
backed securities.   
Effective in October 2017, the Co mmittee directs the Desk to ro ll over 
at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each 
calendar month that exceeds $6 billion, and to reinvest in agen cy 
mortgage-backed securities the am ount of principal payments fro m 
the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-
backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds 
$4 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts for operationa l 
reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll an d coupon 
swap transactions as necessary t o facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve's agency mortgage-back ed securities transactions.” 
 In a related action, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Rese rve System voted 
unanimously to approve the estab lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing 
level of 1.75 percent.

elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the interest rate 
paths incorporated in the sta ff’s baseline economic outlook pre sented in Tealbook A. 
The “September Tealbook baseline” scenario incorporates a revis ed assumption 
for the Treasury General Account ( TGA) to capture the Treasury’s current policy to 
“hold a level of cash generally s ufficient to cover one week of  outflows.”1  In line with 
the average of weekly outflows over the past five years, we now assume that the TGA 
will be equal to 1.3 percent of nom inal GDP, replacing the prev ious assumption of a 
constant level of $150 billion.  Consequently, we forecast that  the TGA will increase 
from about $260 billion in the  current quarter to about $425 bi llion by the end of the 
projection period.2  This change moves the projec ted timing of normalization of th e size 
of the balance sheet to the  summer of 2021, one quarter earlier than in the July Tealbook, 
because the longer-run path of SOMA holdings will be boosted by  the larger TGA.  
Annual remittances will also be slightly larger after normaliza tion. 
In addition, the September baselin e includes paths for interest  rates that are 
generally a bit higher than i n the July Tealbook.  The path for the federal funds rate is 
slightly steeper and about 14 basi s points higher on average over the forecast period, with 
the rate projected to rise t o just above 4 percent in 2021 befo re moving down to about 
2½ percent by the end of the projection period.  The path for l onger-term interest rates 
has been revised lower for the next three quarters, but is gene rally higher than in the July 
forecast for the remainder of the projection period. 
The key policy assumptions associated with the balance sheet projections are highlighted 
below.

 Reinvestment policy. We assume that the Committee will announce a change in its 
reinvestment policy at the Septem ber meeting and that, in Octob er, it will begin 
implementing the balance sheet normalization program as describ ed in the June 2017 
Addendum to the Committee’s Polic y Normalization Principles and  Plans.3 
 Longer-run reserve balances.  As in our July projections, we assume that the 
longer-run level of reserve balances is $500 billion.4  There is a great deal of 
uncertainty about the longer-run level of reserves, which could  be affected by factors 
such as structural changes in the banking system, the effects o f regulation on banks’ 
demand for reserves, and the Committee’s ultimate choice of a l ong-run operating 
framework.  The actual longer-run level of reserves may turn ou t to be appreciably 
smaller or larger than the staff assumption. 
Key features of the balance sheet and income projections are de scribed below: 
 SOMA redemptions and reinvestment.   As reported in the ta ble below, under our 
assumption that the new reinvestment policy will begin in Octob er, $18 billion and 
$12 billion in Treasury and agency securities, res pectively, ar e projected to be 
redeemed in the fourth qua rter of this year.  In 2018, $229 billion and $146 billion in 
Treasury and agency securities, r espectively, are projected to be redeemed.  
Cumulative redemptions from the onset of the ph ase-in until nor malization of the size 
of the balance sheet are proj ected to be near ly $1.4 trillion, of which $838 billion are 
in Treasury securities and $541 billion are in agency debt and MBS. 
3 As specified in that Addendum, w e assume that the cap on redem ptions of Treasury securities 
will rise, in quarterly steps, fro m an initial value of $6 billion per month to a fully phased-in value of 
$30 billion per month, and the cap on monthly reductions of holdings of agency debt and MBS will rise 
from an initial value of $4 billion per month to $20 billion per month. 
4 Some other noteworthy assumptions concerning our projections o f liabilities are as follows:  
Federal Reserve notes in circula tion are assumed to increase at  the same rate as nominal GDP; the foreign 
repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated financial market utilities (DFMUs) remain at their 
August 31, 2017, levels of abou t $245 billion and $70 billion, respectively; and take-up at daily overnight 
RRP operations is assumed to run  at $100 billion until the level of reserve balances reaches $1 trillion—a 
value within $500 billion of its assumed longer-run level—and then to decline to zero over the course of 
one year.

As shown in the upper left panel of the exhibit titled “Total A ssets and Selected 
Balance Sheet Items,” once the cap for monthly reductions in SO MA holdings of 
Treasury securities ha s been fully phased i n, reinvestment of some principal from 
maturing Treasury securities would occur mostly in the middle m onth of each quarter, 
when large amounts of such securi ties held in the SOMA will mature.  In contrast, the 
$20 billion fully phased-in cap f or agency securities is not projected to bind with the 
assumed path for interest rates .  MBS paydowns, which are uncertain, are projected to 
run at a fairly steady mont hly pace, even though, as shown by t he blue bars in the 
figure, receipts and reinvestments of principal from MBS securi ties have historically 
displayed considerable variab ility.  In light of the projected rise in longer-term 
interest rates, they are also expected to run at lower monthly amounts further along 
the projection horizon.  Realized MBS paydowns will reflect the  evolution of interest 
rates and other factors, and thus could differ significantly from projected values. 
 Balance sheet.   Normalization of the size of the balance sheet is projected t o occur in 
the third quarter of 2021,  one quarter earlier than projected in the July Tealbook, with 
the revision reflecting the assumed increase in the level of th e TGA (see the exhibit 
titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows the 
exhibit).  At the time reserve balances reach $500 billion, tot al assets are projected to 
stand at roughly $3 trillion, w ith about $2.9 trillion in total  SOMA securities holdings 
composed of $1.6 trillion of T reasury securities and $1.2 trill ion of MBS.  Total 
assets and SOMA holdings rise thereafter, keeping pace with the  projected increases 
in Federal Reserve notes in c irculation, the TGA, and Federal Reserve Bank capital. 
When the size of the balance sheet is normalized, assets and li abilities are each 
projected to stand at roughly 13 pe rcent of nominal GDP, after having reached a peak 
of 23 percent in the third qua rter of 2017.  Focusing on liabil ities, the assumed

$500 billion longer-run level of r eserve balances would amount to 2 percent of 
nominal GDP in 2021; this share declines modestly over the rema inder of the forecast 
period with reserve balances assumed constant at $500 billion w hile nominal GDP 
continues to rise.  Federal Res erve notes in circulation are as sumed to remain at  
8½ percent of nominal GDP.  Other liabilities, including the TG A, foreign repo pool, 
and DFMU balances, amount to ro ughly 2½ percent of GDP at the end of the 
projection period.5 
 Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to decline 
from $92 billion in 2016 to about $78 billion this year (See th e “Income Projections” 
exhibit).  The step-down reflects  higher interest expense resul ting from the recent 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate and th e associated increases in 
interest on reserves as well as the projection for another rate hike this year.6 
Remittances are projected to continue to decline in coming year s, reaching a trough of 
$38 billion in 2019, as the size of the SOMA portfolio decreases and the target range 
for the federal funds rate move s up further.  Subsequently, rem ittances gradually 
increase as Treasury securities are added to the SOMA portfolio  to match the 
expansion of currency and other lia bility items.  The Federal R eserve’s cumulative 
remittances from 2009 through 2030 are nearly $1.5 trillion.  T hroughout the 
projection period, annual remittan ces are equivalent, on averag e, to about 
0.25 percent of nominal GDP, which i s slightly higher than the pre-crisis average 
share, as shown in the bottom left  panel of the “Income Project ions” exhibit.  No 
deferred asset is projected.7 
Relative to the July Tealbook, proj ected cumulative remittances  from 2017 through 
2021 are $12 billion higher.  Interest expense is slightly lowe r as reserves are roughly 
$100 billion lower through 2021 due t o the assumption for a hig her TGA level.  
Additionally, interest income is a bit higher as the path for l onger-term interest rates 
was revised upward compared to the July Tealbook.  After the si ze of the balance 
5 Before the financial crisis, the  balance sheet equaled about 6 percent of nomin al GDP, with 
liabilities almost entirely compos ed of Federal Reserve notes i n circulation. 
6 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate.  We also continue to assume that the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances and the 
offering rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RR Ps) will be set at th e top and the bottom 
of the range, respectively. 
7 In the event that a Federal Res erve Bank’s earnings fall short  of the amount necessary to cover 
its operating costs and pay dividends, a deferred asset would b e recorded as a claim against future earnings 
remittances due to the U.S. Treasury.

sheet is normalized, SOMA securities holdings will be larger th an projected in the 
July Tealbook, primarily due to the  change in the TGA assumptio n, and as a result, 
interest income will be highe r compared with July.  On net, thr oughout the projection 
period cumulative remittances t o the Treasury are $70 billion h igher than in the July 
Tealbook.   
 Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net 
unrealized gain position of a bout $126 billion at the end of Au gust.8  The net 
unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio going forward  will depend primarily 
on the path of longer-term interest rates.  In the September Te albook, these rates are 
expected to rise over the next c ouple of years, and as a result, the portfolio is 
projected to shift t o an unrealized loss pos ition at the start of next year.  The portfolio 
is expected to record a peak unr ealized loss of $142 billion in 2019:Q3.  This is about 
$22 billion larger than in the Ju ly Tealbook as a result of the  higher path for longer-
term interest rates this T ealbook.  Of the overall projected pe ak unrealized loss, 
$41 billion is attributable to holdings of Treasury securities and $102 billion to 
holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position subsequen tly narrows and 
returns to an unrealized gai n position by the end of the projec tion period for two 
reasons:  First, the value of s ecurities acquired under successive large-scale asset 
purchase programs (LSAPs) return s to par as those securities ap proach maturity; 
second, securities purchased after  normalization are projected to increase in value 
above par as interest rates, whi ch are elevated for some time, move down toward their 
longer-run levels. 
 Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Projec tions for the 10-Year Treasury 
Term Premium Effect,” the eleva ted amount of securities held in the SOMA is 
estimated to be currently reducing the term premium in the 10-y ear Treasury yield 
(and thus the level of that yiel d) by 90 basis points in the th ird quarter of 2017, 
unchanged from the previous Tealbook.9  The term premium e ffect is a touch more 
8 The Federal Reserve reports the  quarter-end net unrealized gai n/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio to the public in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Financial Reports,” available on 
the Board’s website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly . 
9 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends importan tly on the difference between 
the expected path for the configuration of t he Federal Reserve’ s balance sheet over coming years and a 
benchmark counterfactual projection for the balance sheet that incorporates assumpti ons reflecting the 
configuration of the balance sheet prevailing before the Financ ial Crisis of 2007-2008.  In the benchmark 
counterfactual balance sheet pro jection, the staff continues to  assume a longer-run l evel of reserves of 
$100 billion and a constant, mini mal TGA level, consistent with  the pre-crisis Treasury cash balance 
policy.

negative than in the previous T ealbook throughout the remainder  of the projection 
period.  This revision is primaril y due to the assumed increase in the TGA and the 
resulting higher proj ected securities holdings after normalizat ion.  The term premium 
effect gradually fades over the projection period. 
 SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Holdings” exhibit, at the time of norma lization the SOMA 
portfolio holds 57 percent and 43 pe rcent in Treasury and agenc y securities, 
respectively.  After normalizati on, the share of Treasury secur ities increases so that 
Treasury securities account for about 85 percent of total SOMA holdings by the end 
of the projection period. 
The weighted-average duration of  the SOMA Treasury portfolio is  currently about 
6¼ years (see the middle panel of  “Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA 
Holdings” exhibit).  It is subsequently projected to decline slightly this year as the 
securities in the por tfolio approach matur ity, and to rise thereafter until the size of the 
balance sheet is normalize d in the third quarter of 2021.10 
After reaching its peak, the durat ion of the SOMA Treasury port folio is projected to 
decline as the Desk resumes purchases of Treasury securities to keep pace with the 
increase in Federal Reserve notes in circulation, Federal Reserve Bank capital, and other liability items, as well as the ongoing replacement of MB S principal 
repayments.  The duration contour in this later portion of the projection is based on the assumption that, for some tim e after purchases of Treasury securities resume in 
2021, the Federal Reserve will limit its purchases to Treasury bills until they account 
for one-third of the Treasury por tfolio, close to the pre-crisi s composition (currently 
the SOMA portfolio holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, purch ases of Treasury 
securities are assumed to be spread  across the maturity spectru m (see the bottom 
panel, “Maturity Composition of  SOMA Treasury Portfolio”).  
10 The rise in portfolio duration starts in 2018 when the pace of  runoffs picks up and longer-tenor 
securities account for a larger share of the remaining portfoli o; duration increases until the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized.
