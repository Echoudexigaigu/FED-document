Incoming data since the September FOMC meeting show solid growth in 
economic activity and a strengtheni ng labor market alongside so ft readings on inflation 
(aside from a hurricane-relate d spike in gasoline prices).  In light of this continuing 
tension, the key question facing the Committee is whether the a nticipated path for the 
federal funds rate implied by recent communications remains app ropriate for achieving 
the Committee’s objectives, and in pa rticular what signal to se nd about the likelihood of a 
rate increase in the near term. 
 Alternative C emphasizes the strength of both economic activity  and the labor market 
and signals that further gradual rate hikes will be needed—with  one likely in the near 
future—to return output and employm ent growth to sustainable ra tes and to stabilize 
inflation around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the m edium term.  
Alternative C is consistent wit h either confidence that soft in flation readings will not 
persist or concern that conti nued strong growth of the real sid e of the economy may 
ultimately undermine price stability and lead to a need to tigh ten monetary policy 
rapidly. 
 By contrast, Alternative A places greater emphasis on the conti nuing softness in core 
inflation and signals that th e Committee is unlikely to increas e the federal funds rate 
until incoming information gives policymakers greater confidence that inflation will 
rise to 2 percent.  Moreover, Alternative A raises the possibil ity that the Committee 
might lower the federal funds rate if the softness in inflation  continues in coming 
months. 
 Balancing the strength of the real economy and the softness in inflation, Alternative B 
repeats the Committee’s inten tion to withdraw monetary policy a ccommodation 
gradually as inflation rises t o 2 percent and the labor market strengthens somewhat 
further. 
With regard to the specifics of  the draft statement language: 
 The Alternatives differ only modestly in their assessments of c urrent conditions and 
the economic outlook:

   o In characterizing the labor mar ket, Alternatives A and B note t hat it has 
continued to “strengthen.”  By c ontrast, Alternative C states t hat the labor 
market has continued to “tighten.” 
o Alternatives B and C refer to ec onomic activity as “rising at a solid rate,” 
whereas Alternative A continues to refer to economic activity a s “rising 
moderately so far this year.” 
o All three alternatives acknowle dge that the 12-month measures o f overall and 
core inflation have declined this year.  All three also note the effect of higher 
gasoline prices on overall infla tion in September, but Alternat ives A and B 
add that recent readings on inflation excluding food and energy  have 
“remained soft” while Alternative C omits those words. 
 All three Alternatives maintain the current 1 to 1¼ percent tar get range for the federal 
funds rate.  However, they give  different signals concerning th e future path of the 
federal funds rate: 
o Alternative B maintains the message of recent postmeeting state ments by 
repeating the Committee’s expect ation that, with “gradual adjus tments in the 
stance of monetary policy,” the economy will expand at a modera te pace, 
labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will 
stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the m edium term.  
Alternative B also retains the l anguage that the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, “for some time,” below its longer-run normal level. 
o Alternative A does not take a  position on the pace—or even the direction—of 
future policy actions.  Instead, it states that “appropriate monetary policy 
accommodation” is required for the economy to expand at a moder ate pace 
and for labor market conditions to strengthen somewhat further.   In addition, 
Alternative A signals that an i ncrease in the federal funds rat e will not be 
warranted until the data indicate that inflation is moving towa rd the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective.  M oreover, Alternative A admits the 
possibility that the Committee might even lower the federal fun ds rate if the 
softness in inflation continues. 
o Alternative C states that with “ further gradual reductions in m onetary policy 
accommodation,” growth in economic activity and employment “wil l 
moderate to sustainable rates i n the medium term.”  This langua ge indicates 
greater concern that economic gr owth will remain unsustainably strong and 
Alternatives

   less worry that inflation will continue to be soft.  By adding the words “for the 
time being” immediately after  the policy announcement in paragr aph 3, 
Alternative C suggests that a r ate increase will take place as soon as at the 
next meeting.  Finally, the statement for this Alternative omit s the language 
that “the federal funds rate is  likely to remain, for some time ,” below longer-
run normal levels. 
 All three Alternatives offer the choice of keeping or deleting a final paragraph that 
says, “The balance sheet normalization program initiated in Oct ober 2017 is 
proceeding.”

   SEPTEMBER 2017  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in July indicates 
that the labor market has conti nued to strengthen and that economic activity has been 
rising moderately so far this y ear.  Job gains have remained so lid in recent months, 
and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Household spending h as been expanding 
at a moderate rate, and growth i n business fixed investment has  picked up in recent 
quarters.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measu re excluding food and 
energy prices have declined thi s year and are running below 2 percent.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensati on remain low; survey-based mea sures of longer-
term inflation expectations a re little changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stabilit y.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and M aria have devastated 
many communities, inflicting severe hardship.  Storm-related di sruptions and 
rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests 
that the storms are unlikely to m aterially alter the course of the national economy 
over the medium term.  Consequently, the Committee continues to  expect that, with 
gradual adjustments in the sta nce of monetar y policy, economic activity will expand 
at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen  somewhat further.  
Higher prices for gasoline and som e other items in the aftermat h of the hurricanes 
will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect , inflation on a 12-month 
basis is expected to remain som ewhat below 2 percent in the nea r term but to stabilize 
around the Committee’s 2 percent ob jective over the medium term .  Near-term risks 
to the economic outlook appear r oughly balanced, but the Commit tee is monitoring 
inflation developments closely. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 
1- 1/4 percent.  The stance of m onetary policy remains accommod ative, thereby 
supporting some further strengthe ning in labor market condition s and a sustained 
return to 2 percent inflation. 
 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent inflation.  
This assessment will take into account a wide range of informat ion, including 
measures of labor market conditi ons, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation 
expectations, and readin gs on financial and international devel opments.  The 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative 
to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the f ederal funds rate; the 
federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below le vels that are expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  Howev er, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

Although the hurricanes caused a drop in payroll employment in September , 
and the unemployment rate has stayed low declined further .  Household

   THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Though hurricane-related disruptions  distorted some labor marke t data, the September 
employment report indicated tha t, on balance, the labor market strengthened further. 
o The unemployment rate fell to 4.2 percent in September even as the labor 
force participation rate ros e to 63.1 percent from 62.9 percent .  The BLS noted 
no discernible effect of the  hurricanes on these rates. 
o Other information in the employment report, however, reflected the effects of 
hurricane-related disruptions.  T otal nonfarm payroll employmen t fell by 
33,000 and private nonfarm payroll employment fell by 40,000.  The staff 
estimates that, abstracting from  hurricane-related disruptions,  the monthly 
gain in private payrolls was  near 160,000.  The negative effects of the 
hurricanes on private payrolls a re expected to be reversed in t he next few 
months. 
o Average hourly earnings of emp loyees on private nonfarm payrolls rose faster 
than expected in September, and e arnings in previous months were revised up, 
boosting the 12-month change to 2.9 pe rcent.  The September ris e, which in 
part reflected a hurri cane-related reduction in the employment of low-wage 
workers, is likely to be partl y reversed in coming months.  The  staff projects 
that the 12-month change in ave rage hourly earnings will be 2.8  percent in 
December of this year, the same as in December 2016, but higher  than in the 
preceding several years. 
o Although the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s Wage Growth Trac ker 
reports a higher growth rate fo r wages than suggested by the da ta on average 
hourly earnings due to differen ces in methodology between the t wo series, 
neither series indicates strong acceleration in wage growth relative to a year 
ago. 
 Over the 12 months ending in August, headline PCE inflation was 1.4 percent, the 
same as in July.  Core PCE inflation edged down 0.1 percentage point, reaching 
1.3 percent in August.  Core inflation is expected to pick up i n March of next year as 
the unusually large decline in the price of cell phone service seen in March 2017 
drops out of the 12-month window  underlying the computation of these inflation 
series.  Some other factors that  have contributed to the recent  soft inflation readings 
are also expected to be transitory. 
Alternatives

   o The hurricanes led to temporaril y higher prices of gasoline.  T he sizable 
increase in gasoline prices boosted headline CPI inflation in S eptember.  
Prices of other goods and servi ces, however, seem not to have been affected 
by the hurricanes. 
o Measures of longer-run inflation e xpectations, both market- and  survey-based, 
were little changed over the intermeeting period. 
 Economic activity has been expanding at a solid pace despite th e hurricane-related 
disruptions, with increases in a  broad set of expenditure categ ories including those for 
personal consumption and business fixed investment. 
 Despite the continuing tension be tween the developments on the real side of the 
economy and inflation, policymaker s may nonetheless see the med ium-term outlook 
for inflation and the labor mar ket as essentially unchanged, wi th the unemployment 
rate falling somewhat further be low its longer-run normal value  next year, and with 
inflation reaching 2 percent by 2019. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may view the ava ilable information, although somew hat distorted by 
the hurricanes, as indicating, on balance, that the economy is evolving about in line 
with their modal forecast.  They m ay continue to believe that t he labor market will 
strengthen somewhat further and that inflation will likely rise  toward 2 percent next 
year as the factors currentl y holding down core inflation fade.  
 Policymakers may continue to see the risks to the outlook for inflation as roughly 
balanced:  On the one hand, the c ontinued soft readings on infl ation could indicate 
that more pressure on resource ut ilization is needed to return inflation to the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective .  On the other hand, the streng th of the labor market 
could result in the unemployment rate falling even farther belo w its longer-run 
normal level, a development th at could prove difficult to rever se without tipping the 
economy into recession. 
 Furthermore, policymakers may want to obtain additional informa tion on the effects 
of the start of balance sheet  normalization on financial market s, or to gain more 
clarity on the distortions in the data that arose from the hurricanes, before reassessing 
the path of the federal funds rate. 
 Policymakers may judge that mark et expectations regarding the f uture path of the 
federal funds rate are broadly consistent with the Committee ac hieving its objectives 
Alternatives

   over the medium term.  Alternatively, policymakers may hold the  view that it is 
premature to try to re align market expecta tions before seeing h ow incoming data 
affect the perceived probabiliti es of future rate increases.  I n either case, policymakers 
might conclude that a change in s tatement language designed to induce a 
reassessment by markets of future monetary policy actions is no t necessary at this 
meeting. 
 For the reasons stated above, polic ymakers may view adopting th e draft statement of 
Alternative B as appropriate at this meeting. 
 As shown in the “Monetary Polic y Expectations and Uncertainty” box, federal funds 
futures quotes imply that market  participants, on average, rega rd the odds of a rate 
hike at the upcoming meeting a s negligible but see a high proba bility that the federal 
funds rate will be raised by the end of the year.  Respondents to the Desk’s latest 
surveys have broadly similar expectations.  Thus, maintaining t he current target range 
and repeating September’s langua ge about the likely future path  of the federal funds 
rate, as in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Alternative B, would probably generate a muted 
response in financial markets.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 The staff projects that, despite  hurricane-related disruptions,  real GDP growth will 
step up from 2.1 percent at an annua l rate in the first half of  the year to around 
3 percent in the second half.  The solid expansion in economic activity is broad-
based. 
 The labor market continues to t ighten.  The unemployment rate d eclined to 
4.2 percent in September, below all FOMC participants’ estimate s of its longer-run 
normal level, even as the labor f orce participation rate rose a nother 0.2 percentage 
point to reach 63.1 percent.  The increase in the labor force p articipation rate, against 
the backdrop of a downward trend ar ising from demographic force s, may not be 
sustainable.  The payroll employ ment data for September were depressed by the 
effects of hurricanes; the reported reduction in payrolls will likely completely 
dissipate in coming months.  Mor eover, total nonfarm payrolls a re projected to rise in 
coming quarters at a pace that is  well above that commonly rega rded as necessary to 
deliver a constant unemployment rate.  Policymakers may view th e tightening labor 
market as evidence that the ec onomy is at risk of  overheating.

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Over the intermeeting  period, market participants  appeared  to become  increasingly  
confident  that the Committee  will announce  a 25‐ basis‐point rate hike  at the 
December  FOMC meeting (the black line in figure 1).  Quotes on federal funds futures 
contracts  assuming  zero term premiums  suggest that investors  now attach a 
probability  of about 80 percent to such  an outcome,  while seeing virtually no chance 
of a rate hike  at the upcomi ng FOMC meeting (not shown).1  The probability  of a 
December  rate increase is  about 10 to 15 percentage points  above  where the 
corresponding  probability  stood at this time in 2015 and 2016 (the blue and red lines in 
figure 1), even though the September  SEP projections  in all three years  showed that 
most FOMC participants  viewed it as appropriate to raise  the federal funds  rate a 
quarter percentage  point by year‐ end.  The higher  conviction  this year likely  reflects 
recent FOMC and policymaker communications  that were interpreted  as indicating  
support among  FOMC participants  for another  rate increase by December, as  well as 
reduced downside  risks to the econ omic outlook both in the United States and 
abroad.  
As shown in  figure 2, conditional  on a rate increase occurring  in December  and 
assuming  zero term premiums,  federal funds  futures quotes imply that market 
participants  assign a probability  of close to 40 percent to a subsequent  rate hike  in 
March 2018; this  probabilit y is higher than at the time of the September  meeting.   
Looking further ahead, the  probability  distribution  of the level of the federal funds  
rate at the end  of 2018 implied  by options quotes assuming  zero term premiums 
shifted somewhat  to higher values  over the  intermeeting  period.  That distribution  
now attaches  about equal probabilities  to the federal  funds rate falling  into the 1½ to 
1¾ percent range or the  1¾ to 2 percent range at the  end of 2018 (figure  3).  The 
average distribution  across respondents  to the Desk’s latest surveys  similarly assigns 
the highest odds to the  funds rate being  in the 1.51 to 2 percent range at that ti me 
(figure 4). 
The forward rates  implied by OIS quotes  (the black line in figure 5) moved up over the  
intermeeting  period, increasing  up to 25 basis  points by the end of 2020.  Under the  
assumption  of zero term premiums, these market ‐implied forward rates  are 
consistent  with an expected  federal funds  rate of about 1.7 percent at the end  of 2018 
and 2.0 percent at the end  of 2020.  The  expected  path of the federal funds rate 
adjusting  for term premiums as  estimated  by a staff term structure  model (the  light‐
blue line) also  increased  since the September  FOMC meeting,  albeit to a lesser  extent.  
The model‐ based path continues  to suggest  a faster pace of rate increases  than the 
unadjusted  path, with an expected  federal funds  rate of 2.2 percent  at the end  of 2018 
and 3.0 percent at th e end of 2020.   The model‐ based path is similar to the 
                                                 
1 Respondents  to the October/November  Desk surveys on average  also assigned negligible  odds 
to the next rate increase occurring  at the October/November  meeting and high odds to the next rate 
increase occurring  at the December  meeting.

  Committee’s  September  median SEP  projections  (the dark blue dots) and to the 
modal path from the Desk’s latest surveys  (the brown line). 
The staff term structure  model assumes  that shocks to the economy  are normally  
distributed  and therefore  implies mean and  modal short rate paths  that largely 
coincide when the short rate is sufficiently  away from the zero lower bound (ZLB).  
However, the  median respondent  to the Desk surveys continues  to attach about  20 
percent probability  to a return  to the ZLB sometime  over the next three years, 
suggesting  that investors  perceive  risks to the outlook to be skewed towards the 
downside.  Consistent  with this view, the survey ‐implied mean path  (the golden 
squares in figure 5),  which is constructe d from respondents’ probability  distributions  
under certain assumptions,  lies noticeably  below the survey‐implied modal path and 
coincides  with the unadjusted  path.2   
Results from the model and  the surveys also offer different  perspectives  on 
expectations  of the longer‐run level of  the federal funds  rate (the far ‐right dots  in 
figure 5).  The staff  term structure model  estimates  that the federal funds rate will 
average 3.8 percent over the  period five to ten years  ahead, largely  unchanged  since 
before the September  FOMC meeting.   This level remains  about 1 percentage point  
above the median projection  for the longer ‐run federal funds  rate from  the 
September  SEP and the median projection  from the latest Desk surveys. 
Survey respondents  estimated  that the neutral real federal  funds rate is currentl y ¼ 
percent and will rise gradually  over time,  reaching  1 percent by the end of 2020.  The 
estimates  of the current level as well as the levels at the end  of 2018 and  2019 were 
largely unchanged  from July when these  questions  were last asked.  Responses  to a 
new question  indicated  that investors  appear to hold quite diverse views about the 
level of the neutral real rate at the  end of 2018.  While respondents  on average 
assigned a 50 percent probability  to the neutral rate falling between 0 and  1 percent,  
they also assigned  a 16 percent probability  to the neutral rate being  negative  and a 9 
percent probability  to the rate exceeding  2 percent.    
The Desk’s  latest surveys also returned  to a July question  on the distribution  of PCE 
inflation between two and  three years  from now.  Respondents’  average distribution  
was largely unchanged  from July (figure 6).  The median responden t viewed PCE 
inflation of 1.9 percent as the most likely outcome  two to three  years hence,  about 0.1 
percentage point lower than  in July.   
                                                 
2 A new question in the most recent Desk surveys asked respondents  to decompose  the 2‐year 
OIS rate (1.6 percent at the time of the surveys) into two components—the  market’s  expectation  of 
the average effective federal funds rate over  the next two years and the term premium.  
Respondents’  estimates  of the term premium  spanned a wide range; the median estimate of ‐0.14 
percent is consistent  with a path that lies between  the survey‐based modal and mean paths, 
although  much closer to the latter.  Of note, the corresponding  term premium  based on the staff 
term structure  model is ‐0.46 percent.

    Some information points to the possi bility that wages are growi ng more rapidly than 
is evident in most aggregate wage  series.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 
Wage Growth Tracker, which measures growth of the wages receive d by individuals 
that are continuously full-time em ployed, reports faster wage g rowth than other 
measures.  Furthermore, related r esearch at the Federal Reserve  Bank of San 
Francisco shows that demographic shifts may have held down the growth in wages 
measured by most aggregate wage series.  Policymakers may see t his information, in 
combination with strong growth in e mployment, as evidence of a tight labor market.   
 The staff’s October QS Assessment  of Financial Stability indicated that asset 
valuation pressures remain eleva ted.  Over the intermeeting per iod, broad equity 
prices continued to increase from their already high levels.  A s a result, the equity 
price-earnings ratio is near its highest value outside of the d ot-com era.  Spreads on 
yields of both investment- and spe culative-grade corporate bond s over comparable-
maturity Treasury securities are quite narrow. 
 A range of indexes continue to cha racterize financial condition s as more 
accommodative than average, and in particular as looser than in  late 2015.1  Over the 
intermeeting period, all of them re gistered a small further loo sening in financial 
conditions. 
Policy Strategy  
 In light of the continued tighten ing of the labor market and the solid expansion of real 
economic activity, policymakers ma y be concerned that reducing accommodation at 
the very gradual pace that market participants currently seem t o anticipate could 
result in the economy continuing to grow at an unsustainably ra pid rate.  In particular, 
they may see the unemployment rate as on course to undershoot the longer-run 
normal rate of unemployment substantially.  Policymakers may ju dge that such an 
undershooting poses significant ups ide risks to inflation and a ppreciably raises the 
likelihood that policy may need t o be tightened abruptly in the  future. 
 Policymakers may also be concerned that the undershooting of th e longer-run normal 
rate of unemployment and loose fi nancial conditions could contr ibute to an inefficient 
allocation of resources and pose ri sks to financial stability.  
                                                            
1 These financial conditions indexes include:  the National Fina ncial Conditions Index (NFCI) 
compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the Kansas Cit y Financial Stress Index (KCFSI), the St. 
Louis Fed Financial Stress Index (STLFSI), and Goldman Sachs’ F inancial Conditions Index.

    Policymakers may interpret the recent decline in inflation as h aving been caused 
largely or entirely by idiosyncra tic and temporary factors.  Th ey may be confident 
that inflation will rise to the Committee’s 2 percent objective  over time even as policy 
accommodation is withdrawn at a faster pace than communicated b y the Committee’s 
recent statements. 
 For all of the above reasons, po licymakers may opt to reinforce  market expectations 
of an increase in the federal f unds rate in the near future, an d to suggest that more 
increases in the federal funds r ate might be warranted than policymakers previously 
thought, or that increases could come more rapidly.  Accordingly, policymakers 
might favor a statement along the lines of Alte rnative C. 
 A statement like Alternative C would quite likely surprise mark et participants.  If the 
public were to infer that the Committee intends to pursue a les s accommodative 
policy stance in the future as a matter of policy preferences—t hat is, given their 
outlook for the economy—then med ium- and longer-term real inter est rates would 
likely rise, as would the excha nge value of the dollar, and equ ity prices and inflation 
compensation would probably fall .  If the public were instead t o interpret a statement 
like Alternative C as primarily reflecting a more upbeat assess ment of the strength of 
the economy, then equity prices might fall less than otherwise or even rise, and 
inflation compensation might rise as well.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 On a 12-month basis, both headline and core inflation rates con tinue to run noticeably 
below the Committee’s 2 percen t inflation objective.  In nearly every reading from 
March through September, both the CPI and PCE price indexes hav e come in softer 
than generally expected.  Furth ermore, the 12-month trimmed mea n inflation rate 
calculated by the Federal Reserve  Bank of Dallas, a measure of the trend in core 
inflation, remained at only 1.6 perc ent in August after slippin g 0.1 percentage point in 
July.  Policymakers may note that , notwithstanding the recent a nd projected strength 
in economic activity, the sta ff has revised down its forecasts for both headline and 
core PCE inflation in 2018.  Headlin e PCE inflation, measured on a four-quarter 
basis, is projected to be low t his year, at 1.5 percent, and to  remain somewhat below 
2 percent in 2018.

    Recent readings on market-based measures of inflation compensat ion and survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain low  by historical 
standards. 
 Although the labor market continue s to strengthen, the combination of low wage 
pressures and solid job gains over the recent months suggests t hat the labor market 
may not yet have reached maximum sustainable employment and tha t available 
estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment may be too high.2  Recent 
increases in payroll employment have been well above what is co mmonly thought to 
be necessary to deliver a constant unemployment rate, but at th e same time there has 
been a string of positive surprises in the extent of labor forc e participation this year. 
 The evidence discussed in the “M onetary Policy St rategies” section of Tealbook A 
suggests that the equilibrium r eal federal funds rate in the lo nger run, rLR, stepped 
down markedly since prior to the  Global Financial Crisis in 200 72008 and has 
stayed at historically low lev els since.  Policymakers may conc lude that rLR is more 
likely to remain near its current l ow level than to return to e arlier levels. 
Policy Strategy 
 Although economic activity has be en rising moderately on averag e in the last few 
quarters, policymakers may see th e absence of inflation pressur es as allowing the 
Committee to be even more patient in removing accommodation.  T aking into 
account this year’s generally sof t inflation readings and the uncertainty surrounding 
the inflation outlook, policymakers may judge that a prolonged period of even lower 
unemployment is necessary for inflation to step up, or that all owing higher levels of 
activity would be an acceptable ris k for policymakers to take. 
 Inflation continues to run persistently below the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  
The softness in inflation could cause longer-term inflation exp ectations to drift down, 
along the lines of the “Different  Inflation Process” alternativ e scenario shown in the 
“Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A.  In turn, such a  decline in inflation 
expectations could offset the modest upward pressure on actual inflation from high 
resource utilization.  Policymak ers may see a non-negligible pr obability of such 
outcomes and be concerned that removing policy accommodation to o quickly could 
harm the credibility of the Com mittee’s 2 percent longer-run in flation objective and 
                                                            
2 The memo to the FOMC “Some Implications of Uncertainty and Mis perception for Monetary 
Policy” offers a broader perspec tive on the consequences of unc ertainty and misperception about the true 
value of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment for monetary policy.

   of its statement that positive a nd negative deviations from thi s objective are treated 
symmetrically. 
 If policymakers conclude tha t the factors holding down rLR will not abate, they may 
judge that the current stance  of monetary policy is only modest ly accommodative.  
Furthermore, estimates of rLR are subject to considerable uncertainty; policymakers 
may worry that rLR might be even lower than sugge sted by these estimates.  All el se 
equal, a lower value of rLR would imply a higher likelihood o f the federal funds rate 
returning to the effective lo wer bound after a negative shock t o the economy.  Such 
an outcome could further slow convergence of inflation to 2 per cent. 
 Policymakers also might judge t hat uncertainty about the effect s of recent hurricanes 
on activity, employment, and pric es would support a cautious ap proach to removing 
policy accommodation. 
 On the basis of these arguments , policymakers may want to commu nicate that an 
increase in the target range f or the federal funds rate is not warranted at this meeting 
and that future increases are unlikely until it becomes evident  that the recent softness 
in inflation is being reversed.  T hey may also want to suggest that the Committee 
would consider reducing the targ et range if inflation does not increase as expected.  
Policymakers may therefore prefer a statement along the lines of Alternative A.  
 Financial market quotes and the D esk’s latest surveys indicate that market 
participants see little or no chance of an adjustment in the fe deral funds rate at this 
meeting, but they assign a high pr obability of a rate increase in December.  Thus, a 
statement along the lines of Alte rnative A would likely be rega rded as a significant 
change in the Committee’s policy outlook.  If the public inferred that the Committee 
had lowered its outlook for infla tion, then market-based measur es of inflation 
compensation would presumably decline.  In addition, medium- an d longer-term real 
interest rates would likely fall , as would the exchange value of the dollar and equity 
prices.  If instead the public s aw this statement as primarily reflecting policymakers’ 
determination to push inflation up t o 2 percent, then inflation  compensation could 
rise, real longer-term interest  rates would probably fall less than under the alternative 
interpretation, and equity prices  might rise as well.  The effe ct on the dollar would be 
ambiguous, with lower real rates  and higher future inflation po inting to depreciation, 
but stronger economic activ ity suggesting the opposite.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation  
The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy 
stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on September 
20 November 1, 2017: 
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to 
maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 
1.25 percent.  
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New 
York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in th e System Open 
Market Account in accordance with  the following domestic policy  directive:  
“Effective September 21 November 2, 2017, the Federal Open Market 
Committee directs the Desk to unde rtake open market operations as 
necessary to maintain the federal  funds rate in a target range of 1 to 
1- 1/4 percent, including overnight  reverse repurchase operatio ns (and 
reverse repurchase operations w ith maturities of m ore than one day when 
necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 percent, in amounts li mited only 
by the value of Treasury securi ties held outright in the System  Open 
Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-
counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. 
The Committee directs the Des k to continue rolli ng over at auct ion 
Treasury securities maturing dur ing September, and to continue 
reinvesting in agency mortgage- backed securities the principal payments 
received through September from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of 
agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.   
Effective in October 2017, The Committee directs the Desk to continue  
rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Fede ral 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar 
month that exceeds $6 billion, and to continue  reinvest ing in agency 
mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal paym ents fro m the 
Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-b acked 
securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $4 billion.  
Small deviations from these am ounts for operational reasons are  
acceptable.

   The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll an d coupon 
swap transactions as necessary t o facilitate settlement of the Federal 
Reserve’s agency mortgage-back ed securities transactions.” 
 
 In a related action, the Board of  Governors of the Federal Rese rve System voted 
unanimously to approve the estab lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing 
level of 1.75 percent.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and key 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the staff’s baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below. 
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in a new exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” und er the balance 
sheet normalization program initiated in October 2017, $18 bill ion in Treasury securities 
and $12 billion in agency securities are projected to be redeem ed in the fourth quarter of 
this year.  Over the first twel ve months of this program, $175 billion in Treasury 
securities and about $117 billi on in agency securities are proj ected to be redeemed.1 
While the timing and amount of prin cipal payments of existing T reasury securities 
holdings are known, agency MBS paydow ns are uncertain and have historically displayed 
considerable variability.   
Normalization of the size of the balance sheet.   The size of the balance sheet is 
projected to normalize in the t hird quarter of 2021, the same q uarter as projected in the 
September Tealbook (see the exhi bit titled “Total Assets and Se lected Balance Sheet 
Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).  At the time th at the size of the balance 
sheet is normalized: 
 Reserve balances reach the assumed longer-run level of $500 bil lion;2 
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestment of principal from maturing Treasury securities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each q uarter.  In contrast,  the maximum $20 bil lion cap on monthly redemptions of 
agency securities is not projected to bind under the staff’s cu rrent baseline path of rising longer-term 
interest rates. 
2 Other noteworthy assumptions u nderlying the liabilities projections are as follows:  Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and the Treasury General Account a re assumed to increase at the same rate as 
nominal GDP; the foreign repo poo l and balances in the accounts  of designated financial market utilities 
(DFMUs) remain at their September 30, 2017, levels of about $24 0 billion and $75 billion, respectively; 
and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to maintai n a value of $100 billion until the level of 
reserve balances reaches $1 trillion, at which point it declines to zero over the course of one year.

 Total assets are projected t o stand at roughly $3 trillion, with about $2.9 trillion in 
total SOMA securities holdings composed of $1.6 trillion of Tre asury securities 
and $1.3 trillion of MBS;   
 Assets and liabilities are each projected to stand at roughly 1 3 percent of nominal 
GDP, compared with a peak rati o of about 25 percent in late 201 4 and a pre-crisis 
average of about 6 percent;   
 SOMA redemptions from October  2017 to the date when the size of  the balance 
sheet is normalized are projecte d to total near ly $1.4 trillion , consisting of about 
$830 billion of Treasury securi ties and $530 billion of agency debt and MBS.   
After the size of the balance sh eet is normalized, SOMA holding s rise, keeping 
pace with the projected increases in Federal Reserve Bank capit al and in Federal Reserve 
liabilities including currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account (TGA). 
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline this year to about $78 billion from $92 billion in 2016 , reflecting hi gher interest 
expense as a result of the incre ase in the interest rate paid o n reserves (see the “Income 
Projections” exhibit).3  As the size of the SOMA portfo lio decreases and the target range 
for the federal funds rate moves up further, remittances reach a low of $38 billion in 
2020.  Thereafter, remittances begin to increase, particularly once the size of the balance 
sheet is normalized and Treasury s ecurities are added to the SO MA portfolio.  As shown 
in the bottom left panel of the “ Income Projections” exhibit, a nnual remittances average 
about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the projection period, s lightly higher than the 
pre-crisis average share.  
Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of  about $94 billion at the end of September.4  With longer-
term interest rates expected t o rise over the next couple of years in the October Tealbook 
baseline projection, the portfolio is expected to shift to an u nrealized loss position at the 
start of next year and to reco rd a peak unrealized loss of $160  billion in 2019:Q2; $50 
billion of this amount is attri butable to Treasury securities and $110 billion to agency 
3 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate and that the interest  rate paid on excess reserve balances and the offering rate on overnight RRPs 
will be set at the top and botto m of the range, respectively. 
4 The Federal Reserve publishes the quarter-end n et unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Fina ncial Reports,” available on the Board’s 
website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/m onetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

MBS.  The unrealized loss positi on subsequently narrows, primar ily because the value of 
securities acquired under the Federal Reserve’s la rge-scale asset purchase programs 
returns to par as thos e securities approach maturity.  This pro jection is similar to that in 
the September Tealbook. 
Term premium effects.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” the elevated amount of securitie s held in the SOMA is 
currently estimated to be reduci ng the term premium in the 10-y ear Treasury yield by 87 
basis points, and this effect will gradually fade over time.5  This projection is nearly 
identical to that in the previous Tealbook. 
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about 6 ye ars.  The weighted-
average duration of the portfolio  is projected to increase during the balance sheet 
normalization process as the pace of redemptions picks up and l onger-duration securities 
account for a larger share of  the remaining portfolio.  
After normalization of the size of  the balance sheet, the durat ion of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is projected t o decline as the Federal Reser ve resumes purchases of 
Treasury securities.  The initial  sharp decline in duration at that time results from the 
staff’s assumption that these purchases will be limited to Trea sury bills until they account 
for one-third of the Treasury por tfolio, close to the pre-crisi s composition (currently the 
SOMA portfolio holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, purchases  of Treasury securities 
are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bottom panel of the 
exhibit).  
5 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
for the balance sheet based on th e configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial 
crisis of 2007-2008.  In particular, in the benchmark counterfactual balance sheet projection, the staff 
assumes a longer-run level of r eserves of $100 billion and a constant, minimal TGA level, consistent with 
the pre-crisis behavio r of reserve balances and Treasury’s pre- crisis cash management policy.
