Data received over the intermeeti ng period indicate that the la bor market has 
continued to strengthen.  The average pace of job gains in rece nt months has been solid 
and well above estimates of the pace sustainable over the longe r run; the unemployment 
rate and some broader measures  of labor underutilization have d eclined further.  In 
addition, real GDP has been growin g faster than the staff’s est imate of potential GDP and 
is projected to continue to do so.  However, 12-month headline and core inflation have 
continued to run below 2 percen t, though they are projected to rise toward 2 percent once 
last spring’s idiosyncratic decr eases in the PCE price index dr op out of the calculation.1 
There are two key questions for the Committee at this meeting:  First, whether the 
available information warrants raising the federal funds rate; and second, whether the 
economic outlook, and associated r isks, indicate that the funds  rate path suggested by 
recent FOMC communications remai ns appropriate or, instead, justify signaling a 
different outlook for the funds rate. 
This Tealbook contains three alternative draft statements for t he Committee’s 
consideration.  The three alternatives provi de varying interpretations of the ongoing 
tension between the strength in t he labor market and the softne ss in inflation.  
Correspondingly, the alternatives differ with regard to the fed eral funds rate path 
expected to be necessary to achieve the Committee’s objectives. 
Alternative B indicates that ec onomic conditions are likely to warrant gradual 
increases in the federal funds r ate and that the FOMC has decid ed to take the next step 
along that path by raising the t arget range 25 basis points.  Alternative C also involves a 
25 basis point increase in the t arget range for the funds rate,  but it accompanies this 
announcement with an indication tha t a somewhat steeper path fo r the federal funds rate 
than previously expected will likely be needed to slow growth i n economic activity and 
employment to a sustainable pa ce.  In contrast, under Alternati ve A the Committee leaves 
the target range unchanged and emphasizes the possibility that the federal funds rate may 
need to remain steady, or even be  lowered at coming meetings, i n order to achieve the 
Committee’s inflation objective. 
1 Note that the payroll report fo r November will be released on the Friday before the FOMC 
meeting and the consumer price index for November will be published on the second d ay of the meeting.

With respect to the specifics of the draft statement language: 
 The three alternatives charact erize incoming data as indicating  solid growth in 
economic activity and a strengthening labor market—or a “tightening” labor market, 
in the case of  Alternative C.  In particular, all three note that, averaging through 
hurricane-related fluctuations , job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate 
declined further.  
 In describing the data on inflati on and measures  of inflation e xpectations, the three 
alternatives differ slightly.   
o Like the November FOMC statement, all three alternatives state that 
12- month core and headline infla tion have declined this year a nd are running 
below 2 percent.  In addition, a ll three alternatives no longer  mention the rise 
in gasoline prices after the hurricanes.  Alternatives B and C also drop the 
description of core inflation as having “remained soft” in September.  
Alternative A explicitly contrasts strong labor market developm ents with 
“soft” inflation. 
o Alternative C describes market-based measures of inflation comp ensation as 
“little changed, on balance,” wher eas Alternatives A and B say these measures 
“remain low,” as in the November FOMC statement. 
 The outlook for economic activity a nd the labor market is somew hat different across 
the three alternatives, but th e inflation outlook is similar.  However, each alternative 
conditions its outlook on different  expectations for monetary p olicy.  
o Alternative B indicates that labor market conditions will “rema in strong,” in 
contrast to the November postmeeting statement and many previou s 
Committee statements indicating t hat labor market conditions wi ll “strengthen 
somewhat further.”  Similarly, Alternative B says that monetary  policy 
accommodation supports “strong” labor market conditions, rather  than “some 
further strengthening in” the labor market.  These changes sugg est that the 
Committee no longer sees additiona l tightening in the labor mar ket as 
necessary for achieving its emp loyment and inf lation objectives.  
o Alternative C conveys that “fur ther gradual reductions in monet ary policy 
accommodation” are expected to be required so that “growth in e conomic 
activity and employment will moderate to sustainable rates in t he medium 
term.”  Alternative C, like Alternative B, state s that “strong” labor market

conditions are being supported by monetary policy accommodation , dropping 
the reference to “some further s trengthening in” the labor mark et. 
o Alternative A focuses primar ily on inflation, removing the sent ence conveying 
that the Committee expects infl ation “to remain somewhat below 2 percent in 
the near term but to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent  objective over 
the medium term.”  Instead, Altern ative A indicates that inflat ion will 
“gradually rise” to 2 percent over the medium term, suggesting that the 
Committee now expects a slower c onvergence to 2 percent than pr eviously.  
Moreover, Alternative A no longer conditions the Committee’s ou tlook on 
“gradual adjustments in the sta nce of monetar y policy,” but rat her on 
“appropriately accommodative monetary policy.”  
o All three alternatives note that “hurricane-rela ted disruptions and rebuilding 
have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months,” 
but emphasize that this summer’s  hurricanes “have not materiall y altered the 
outlook for the national economy.” 
 With respect to the current  policy decision and the outlook for  monetary policy: 
o Alternatives B and C raise the t arget range for t he federal fun ds rate to 1¼ to 
1½ percent.  In contrast, Alterna tive A maintains the current t arget range 
while the Committee is “assessi ng incoming information that bears on the 
outlook for inflation.”  
o Alternative B continues to signa l an expectation that “gradual increases” in 
the federal funds rate will be a ppropriate.  Alternative C inst ead conveys an 
expectation of “further gradual increases,” while Alternative A removes the 
sentence describing the Committee’s expectation of gradual incr eases in the 
federal funds rate.   
o Alternative A no longer describe s how “the timing and size of f uture 
adjustments” to the target rang e will be determined; instead, i t focuses on how 
the FOMC will determine “whether ” to adjust the target range.  This provides 
an additional signal that the f ederal funds rate may need to re main on hold at 
coming meetings—or even be reduce d—in order to achieve the Comm ittee’s 
objectives.

NOVEMBER 2017 FOMC STATEMENT 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in September 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been rising at a solid rate despite hurricane-rela ted disruptions.  
Although the hurricanes caused a d rop in payroll employment in September, the 
unemployment rate declined fur ther.  Household spending has been expanding at 
a moderate rate, and growth in bus iness fixed investment has pi cked up in recent 
quarters.  Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurrica nes, boosting overall 
inflation in September; however, inflation for items other than  food and energy 
remained soft.  On a 12-month basis, both inflation measures ha ve declined this 
year and are running below 2 percen t.  Market-based measures of  inflation 
compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term i nflation 
expectations are lit tle changed, on balance. 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  H urricane-related disruptions and rebuilding will 
continue to affect economic ac tivity, employment, and inflation  in the near term, 
but past experience suggests tha t the storms are unlikely to ma terially alter the 
course of the national economy over the medium term.  Consequen tly, the 
Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in  the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pa ce, and labor 
market conditions will strengthe n somewhat further.  Inflation on a 12-month 
basis is expected to remain som ewhat below 2 percent in the nea r term but to 
stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the m edium term.  
Near-term risks to the econo mic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the 
Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 
1-1/4  percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommod ative, thereby 
supporting some further strengthe ning in labor market condition s and a sustained 
return to 2 percent inflation. 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, 
including measures of labor marke t conditions, indicators of in flation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and r eadings on financial and inter national 
developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .  The Committee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen.   
o Payroll gains averaged 160,000 per month from August through Oc tober, only 
slightly below their average p ace earlier in the year.  Adjusti ng for the staff’s 
estimates of hurricane-related effects, average payroll gains over those three 
months would have been roughly the same. 
o The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1 percent in October, below all 
FOMC participants’ estimates of  the longer-run normal rate of u nemployment 
in the September Summary of Ec onomic Projections (SEP) and abou t ¾ 
percentage point lower than one y ear earlier.  There were also declines in 
October in the share of workers  who report being part-time for economic 
reasons and the share of the  population out of the labor force but who report 
wanting a job. 
o Despite the strong pace of job ga ins and the decline in unemplo yment this 
year, policymakers may not yet see signs of labor market overheating.  In 
particular, compensation data point to little acceleration in w ages.  Thus, 
policymakers may judge that upward pressures on wages from a tightening 
labor market are likely to be  moderate over the near term. 
 Although headline and core infla tion have continued to run belo w 2 percent, they are 
still projected to rise to ward 2 percent next year.   
o Over the 12 months ending in October, core PCE inflation was 1. 4 percent.  
The staff projects that 12-month core PCE inflation will rise to 1.7 percent in 
March, when the unusual decline in  core prices seen in March 2017 drops out 
of the 12-month window.  
o Twelve-month headline PCE inflation was 1.6 percent in October and the staff 
expects it to fluctuate bet ween 1.5 and 1.8 percent in the next  several months, 
supported by recent increases in oil and gasoline prices. 
o The staff forecast of core infl ation in 2018 is 1.8 percent, while the median 
projection in the September S EP was 1.9 percent.  These forecas ts are fairly 
close to the Committee’s longe r-run objective  of 2 percent head line PCE 
inflation.

 GDP growth in the second and thir d quarter was solid and broad- based, supported by 
increases in consumer spending and business investment.  The st aff forecasts GDP 
growth at an annual rate of 2¼ pe rcent in the fourth quarter an d 2½ percent next 
year—in both cases in excess of  the staff estimate and median September SEP 
estimate of longer-run potential growth. 
 Survey measures of inflation exp ectations and the TIPS-based measure of inflation 
compensation 5 years to 10 years ahead have continued to be sta ble over the 
intermeeting period.   
 This summer’s hurricanes have left little impr int on the outloo k for the national 
economy.  A variety of indicators —including job gains, initial claims for 
unemployment insurance, and industrial production—show that eco nomic activity 
bounced back from hurricane- related disruptions. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may see strong recent readings on the labor market  as reinforcing their 
expectation that, with gradual in creases in the federal funds r ate, activity will expand 
at a moderate pace and inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.  In 
addition, they may anticipate th at 12-month headline and core i nflation will soon run 
closer to 2 percent as the effect s of the factors currently hol ding down core inflation 
fade.  Thus, if the November employment and CPI reports are bro adly in line with 
their expectations, policymakers may judge that another step in  removing 
accommodation is warranted at this meeting. 
 Policymakers may see two-sided r isks to the inflation outlook a nd therefore judge it 
prudent to continue on their pat h of gradual removal of accommo dation despite low 
current inflation readings.   
o Policymakers may view the economy as near or already somewhat b eyond full 
employment and they might anticip ate that the labor market will  continue to 
tighten next year.  Thus, they ma y see a risk that labor market  tightness will 
push up wage and price inflation next year more than they curre ntly 
anticipate.  
o However, inflation has been pers istently soft.  If incoming data reduce 
policymakers’ confidence that inflation will return to 2 percen t over the 
medium term even with gradual in creases in the federal funds rate, a 
shallower path of rate hikes ne xt year might become appropriate .

o Policymakers may view Alternativ e B as preserving flexibility to respond 
appropriately to developments bearing on the outlook for inflat ion. 
 Policymakers may wish to acknowle dge the strength in the labor market and signal 
that the FOMC no longer sees add itional tightening in the labor  market as necessary 
to achieve its employment and inflation objectives.  However, w ith wage growth 
having picked up only gently over th e past few years, and with job gains having 
moderated during the same pe riod, policymakers may see no need to suggest at this 
meeting that the FOMC is seeking less-tight labor market condit ions.   
 As shown in the “Monetary Polic y Expectations and Uncertainty” box, a straight read 
of quotes on federal funds futures  contracts implies an approxi mately 95 percent 
probability that the Committee will raise the target range at i ts December meeting.  
Thus, under current market expecta tions, a statement like Alter native B that increases 
the target range but makes no major revisions to the outlook fo r monetary policy is 
unlikely by itself to generate an a ppreciable response in finan cial markets.      
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is already appreci ably beyond full 
employment and that the economy r etains significant momentum.  
o The unemployment rate declined i n October to 4.1 percent, a lev el below all 
FOMC participants’ estimates of  its longer-run normal level in the September 
Summary of Economic Projections.  The broader U-6 unemployment rate also 
declined in October, reachi ng its lowest level since 2001.   
o The average pace of payroll gains this year and in recent months has 
significantly exceeded the pace commonly regarded as necessary to absorb 
new entrants (and reentrants) t o the labor force and maintain a  constant 
unemployment rate over the medium run.   
o The staff forecasts that average payroll gains will slow only g radually over the 
next three years.  Accordingly, the staff expects that the unem ployment rate 
will continue to decline, reaching 3.5 percent in 2019 and rema ining at that 
level in 2020.  An unemployment rate  that low has not been reac hed for 
almost half a century.  
o Other indicators pointing to an unsustainably tight labor marke t include job 
openings, survey measures of job availability and the difficult y of hiring

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty 
Over the intermeeting period, market participants appeared to have become 
virtually certain that the Committee will announce a 25basis point rate hike at 
the December FOMC meeting. A straight read of quotes on federal funds futures 
contracts implies that investors attach a probability of about 95 percent to such 
an outcome, 10 percentage points higher than at the time of the previous 
meeting (the black line in figure 1). The probability of a December rate increase is 
similar to the estimated probabilities of a rate increase just before the December 
FOMC meetings in 2015 and 2016 (the green and red lines, respectively). 
Respondents to the most recent Desk surveys on average assigned similarly high 
odds to a December rate increase. 
As shown in figure 2, conditional on a 25 basis point rate increase in December, 
and assuming zero term premiums, federal funds futures quotes imply that 
market participants assign a probability of close to 60 percent to a subsequent 
rate hike by the March 2018 FOMC meeting, up from about 45 percent at the time 
of the October–November FOMC meeting. Of note, adjusting for term premiums 
using a staff term structure model currently implies an 88 percent probability 
(not shown) of an additional rate increase by the March meeting.1 
Looking further ahead, the probability distribution of the level of the federal 
funds rate at the end of 2018 implied by options quotes, assuming zero term 
premiums, shifted somewhat to the right over the intermeeting period (figure 3). 
That distribution now indicates that market participants attach the highest odds 
to the federal funds rate falling into the 1¾ to 2 percent range. Aver aging across 
respondents, the distribution from the Desk’s December surveys also shifted to 
the right (figure 4). 
The forward rates implied by OIS quotes (the black line in figure 5) moved up 
over the intermeeting period, increasing by 13, 9, and 4 basis points at the end of 
2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Under the assumption of zero term 
premiums, these market implied forward rates translate to an expected federal 
funds rate of about 1.8 percent at the end of 2018 and around 2 percent at the 
end of both 2019 and 2020. The expecte d path of the federal funds rate with 
adjustments for term premiums as estimated by a staff term structure model 
(the light blue line in figure 5) is little changed since the October–November 
FOMC meeting. The model based path continues to suggest a faster pace of rate 
increases than the unadjusted path, with an expected federal funds rate of about 
2.3 percent at the end of 2018 and about 3 percent at the end of 2020. The 
model based path is similar to the Committee’s September median SEP 
1 Also of note, 33 out of 47 respondents in the Desk’s December surveys viewed a 
sequence of a December rate hike followed by another rate increase at the March 2018 
meeting as the most likely outcome.

projections (the dark blue dots) and to the median modal path from the Desk’s 
latest survey (the brown line). 
The staff term structure model assumes that shocks to the economy are normally 
distributed and therefore implies mean and modal short rate paths that largely 
coincide when the short rate is sufficiently away from the zero lower bound 
(ZLB). However, the survey implied mean path (the golden squares in figure 5), 
which is constructed from respondents’ probability distributions under certain 
assumptions, lies noticeably below the survey implied modal path and is close to 
the unadjusted path implied by OIS quotes, suggesting that investors perceive 
risks to the outlook to be skewed towards the downside. Of note, the December 
survey implied mean path moved up somewhat from the previous survey, about 
in line with the intermeeting changes in the unadjusted path for the federal funds 
rate. The median respondent to the December Desk surveys continued to attach 
about 20 percent probability to a return to the ZLB sometime over the next three 
years, unchanged from the previous survey. 
The Desk’s surveys pointed to only a modest increase in respondents’ 
expectations for monetary policy rates over the next three years, even as 
respondents revised up their projection s for the U.S. federal fiscal deficit over the 
same period, with several citing an increased likelihood of tax reform legislation 
as the reason for the revision. As shown by the red bars in figure 6, the median 
respondent to the Desk’s December surveys projected that the budget deficit 
will rise to 3.5, 4 and 4.25 percent of GDP by the end of fiscal year 2018, 2019, and 
2020, respectively. These medians are 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5 percentage point higher 
for those three years than reported in the October surveys (the orange bars). 
In the Desk’s December surveys, respondents were also asked to decompose the 
flattening of the Treasury yield curve since December 2015—measured as the 100 
basis point narrowing in the spread between the 2and 30year yield—into 
several components and to rate the importance of various factors in explaining 
this change in the spread.2 On average, respondents attributed close to 70 basis 
points of the decline in the spread to an increase in market expectations for the 
average effective federal funds rate over the next 2 years and about 25 basis 
points to a decline in the 30year nominal term premium. Overall, respondents 
did not appear to view the decline in the slope of the curve as signaling a 
heightened probability of a near term recession. 
2 The box “The Flattening of the U.S. Yield Curve since December 2015” in the Financial 
Market Developments chapter of the Tealbook put the flattening of the Treasury yield curve 
into historical perspective, discussed factors that appear to explain the movements in short 
and longer dated yields, and described the signal that may be taken for the near term growth 
outlook.

workers, and initial claims for  unemployment insurance.  Thus, even if the 
November employment report is no t as strong as t he October report, the 
cumulative strengthening already observed will likely still poi nt to a tight and 
tightening labor market.   
 Twelve-month headline and core PCE inflation, which have been running about 
1½  percent in recent months, a re expected to rise to 1¾ percen t next spring when the 
large drop in the price of cell  phone service observed last Mar ch drops out of the 
12- month calculation.  Thus, policym akers may see the projecte d inflation rate as not 
very far from the Committee’s longer-run objective for headline  inflation.  In the near 
term, recent increases in oil and gasoline prices are likely to  boost headline inflation.  
Moreover, policymakers may an ticipate that a prolonged period o f labor market 
tightness will put sustaine d upward pressure on wages.   
 Despite three increases in the f ederal funds rate target range since December 2016, 
financial conditions remain broadly accommodative.  The stock m arket has registered 
additional gains in recent months from already high levels, while stock market 
volatility has been very low.  Spreads on investment-grade and high-yield bonds have 
declined over the past year and a re roughly in line with their pre-crisis levels.   
 Policymakers may see notable up side risks to the outlook for ec onomic activity, 
resource utilization and inflation.   
o Tax policy changes may soon be enact ed that could imply a larger fiscal 
stimulus than assumed by the staff.     
o Measures of consumer and business sentiment, including Michigan  consumer 
sentiment, the ISM manufacturi ng index, and the Philadelphia Fe d future 
capital spending index, have been extremely buoyant; to the extent that such 
“soft indicators” are discounte d in the formulation of point fo recasts, they 
suggest an upside risk t o aggregate demand.   
Policy Strategy 
 Despite three rate hikes since December 2016 and recent FOMC statements noting an expectation of additional gradua l hikes, the labor market and a ctivity continue to 
expand more rapidly than is sustai nable in the longer run, with  the labor market 
already beyond full employment.  M eanwhile, broad financial conditions have 
remained quite accommodative.  Policymakers may consequently be  concerned that 
reducing accommodation at the very  gradual pace that market par ticipants anticipate

poses significant upside risks to inflation and appreciably rai ses the likelihood that 
policy may need to be tightened abruptly in the future.   
 Policymakers may view valuation pr essures together with low vol atility in financial 
markets as encouraging or refle cting excessive risk-taking.  Po licymakers might be 
concerned that significant undershooting of the longer-run norm al rate of 
unemployment together with loose financial conditions could lea d to a buildup of 
financial vulnerabilities.  Policymakers may see such a vulnera bility, for example, in 
historically high levels of leverage in the nonfinancial corpor ate sector, noting that 
interest expense ratios could rise rapidly if monetary policy n eeded to be tightened 
quickly.     
 For all of the above reasons, po licymakers may opt to increase the federal funds rate 
at this meeting and communicate th at further gradual increases are expected to be 
necessary to moderate growth in economic activity to a sustaina ble pace.   
 Both financial market quotes and responses to the Desk’s latest  surveys suggest that 
financial market participants vi ew an increase in the federal f unds rate at this meeting 
as almost certain.  Thus, the in crease in the federal funds rate in Alternative C is 
unlikely on its own to generate a l arge response in financial m arkets.  However, 
market participants likely would i nfer from Alternative C’s adjustments to the 
economic and policy outlook that the Committee foresees a somewhat steeper path 
than before for the federal f unds rate as appropriate to modera te the growth of 
economic activity.  Assuming there were broadly corresponding changes in the 
December SEP, medium and long-term  real interest rates would likely rise, as would 
market expectations for the n ear-term policy rate path.  In add ition, inflation 
compensation and stock prices would likely fall, unless investo rs viewed Alternative 
C as a very upbeat signal regardi ng the strength of the U.S. ex pansion.   
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 On a 12-month basis, both headline and core inflation continue to run notably below 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  Twelve-month core PCE inf lation including 
only market-based prices was 1.1 percent in October; the 12-mon th trimmed mean 
inflation rate calculated by the  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  remained at 1.6 
percent.  Policymakers may see th ese readings as indicating that inflation this year 
has been held down by persistent f actors, at least in part.

 One factor holding down inflation m ay be that the labor market has not yet reached 
maximum sustainable employment.  The unemployment rate has decl ined about ¾ 
percentage point this year and a verage job gains have been soli d; nonetheless, 12-
month inflation has remained soft.   
o The employment-to-population ratio  for prime-age workers remain s below its 
pre-recession level, suggesting that further labor market stren gthening may be 
needed to bring inflation back to 2 percent on a sustainable ba sis.  Moreover, a 
strong labor market might continue  to draw workers back into th e labor 
market without notable wage acceleration.  
 The Michigan survey of inflation expectations over the next fiv e to ten years ticked 
down in November, extending the d ownward trend over the past fo ur years.  Market-
based measures of inflation compe nsation 5 to 10 y ears ahead we re little changed 
over the intermeeting period and r emain low by historical stand ards.   
o The probability that CPI inflation will notably exceed 2 percent over the 
medium term, based on inflation cap s and floors, has shifted do wn over the 
past year.  In contrast, the probability that CPI inflation wil l be significantly 
below 2 percent over the medium term is roughly unchanged from a year ago. 
 The evidence discussed in the “M onetary Policy St rategies” section of Tealbook A 
suggests that the balance sheet normalization initiated in October is likely to have 
roughly the same macroeconomic  effects as adding 50 basis points to the federal 
funds rate over the next five y ears.  Thus, even with the federal funds rate remaining 
unchanged, monetary policy accomm odation is being removed throu gh balance sheet 
normalization. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may be concerned that  inflation exp ectations have already declined 
notably in recent years and could drift down further if inflati on continues to run 
persistently below 2 percent.   
o While the “Lower Inflation Expect ations” scenario shown in the “Risks and 
Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A  contemplates inflation expec tations 
¼ percentage point below the sta ff’s baseline estimates, policymakers may see 
the downside risk to inflation a s much greater, especially if a n adverse shock 
to aggregate demand necessitates  bringing the federal funds rate back to its 
effective lower bound.

o Since the last recession, 12-month core PCE inflation has exceeded 2 percent 
for only four months.  Policymakers may favor a statement like Alternative A 
in order to reduce the risk tha t the public comes to see 2 perc ent inflation as a 
ceiling rather than the Committee’s symmetric objective.  In ad dition, 
policymakers may judge that the past decade’s experience of low inflation 
makes it unlikely that the opposit e risk—that inflation expecta tions rise 
significantly—would become a reality.   
 Policymakers may view any buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, partly reflecting a judgment that the ba nking system is well capitalized and that broad 
measures of leverage and credit growth remain contained.  In addition, policymakers may see some scope to address fina ncial stability concerns thro ugh macroprudential 
policies and supervisory actions t hat target specific risks.   
 On the basis of these arguments , policymakers may want to commu nicate that an 
increase in the target range f or the federal funds rate is not warranted at this meeting 
and that future increases are unlikely until the Committee is m ore confident that the 
recent softness in inflation is being reversed.  They may also want to suggest that the 
Committee would consider reducing the target range if inflation  does not increase as 
expected.  Policymakers may there fore prefer a statement along the lines of 
Alternative A.  
 Financial market quotes indicate that market participants see a n increase in the federal 
funds rate at this meeting as a  near certainty.  Thus, a statem ent along the lines of 
Alternative A would likely be reg arded as a significant change in the Committee’s 
policy outlook.  If investors inferred that a more accommodativ e stance of policy is 
required to return inflation to 2 percent, then medium- and lon ger-term real interest 
rates would likely fall, as would market expectations for the n ear-term policy rate 
path.  Such a market response may well be a goal of the Committee if it adopts a 
statement like Alternative A.  In addition, inflation compensat ion and stock prices 
would likely rise, unless investor s viewed Alternative A as a s harply negative signal 
regarding the strength of aggreg ate demand or the risks to the economic outlook.

Projections 
BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME  
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the staff’s baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below. 
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October wi ll reduce the Federal 
Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and of agency securit ies by $18 billion and $12 
billion, respectively, during t he current quarter.  In 2018, ho ldings of Treasury and 
agency securities are projecte d to decline about $229 billion a nd $147 billion, 
respectively.1  While the maturities of existing Treasury securities holdings  are known, 
agency MBS paydowns are uncertai n and have historically display ed month-to-month 
variability.   
Normalization of the size of the balance sheet.   The size of the balance sheet is 
projected to normalize in the t hird quarter of 2021, the same a s projected in the October 
Tealbook (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Bal ance Sheet Items” and the 
table that follows the exhibit).  At that time: 
 Reserve balances reach the assumed longer-run level of $500 bil lion;2 
                                                 
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestment of principal from maturing Treasury sec urities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each q uarter.  In contrast,  the maximum $20 bil lion cap on monthly redemptions of 
agency securities is not projected to bind under the staff’s cu rrent baseline path of rising longer-term 
interest rates. 
2 Other noteworthy assumptions u nderlying the liabilities projec tions are as follows: Federal 
Reserve notes in circulation and the Treasury General Account a re assumed to increase at the same rate as 
nominal GDP; the foreign repo poo l and balances in the accounts  of designated financial market utilities 
(DFMUs) remain at their October 31, 2017, levels of about $240 billion and $75 billion, respectively; and 
take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to maintain a value of $100 billion until the level of

  Total assets are projected t o stand at roughly $3 trillion, wit h SOMA securities 
holdings of $1.6 trillion of Treasury securities and $1.3 trill ion of MBS;   
 The Federal Reserve’s securitie s holdings are projected to decl ine roughly 
$1.3 trillion from October 2017 t o the third quarter of 2021, w hen the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized.  Holdings of Treasury securities a re projected to 
shrink about $820 billion and holdi ngs of agency debt and MBS a re projected to 
decline about $520 billion;   
 The size of the balance sheet is  projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of 
nominal GDP, compared with a peak of about 25 percent in late 2 014 and a 
pre-crisis average  of about 6 percent. 
After the size of the balance sh eet is normalized, SOMA holding s rise, keeping 
pace with the projected increases in Federal Reserve Bank capit al and in Federal Reserve 
liabilities including currency in circulation and the Treasury General Account (TGA).   
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline this year to about $79 billion from $92 billion in 2016 , reflecting the increase in 
the interest rate paid on reserve s (see the “Income Projections ” exhibit).3  Total interest 
paid is projected to be $29 billi on this year, while interest income from the SOMA 
holdings is expected to reac h $113 billion.  As the size of the  SOMA portfolio decreases 
and the target range for the federal funds rate moves up furthe r, remittances are expected 
to reach a low of $38 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances  begin to increase, 
particularly once the size of t he balance sheet is normalized a nd Treasury securities are 
added to the SOMA portfolio.  As shown in the bottom left panel of the “Income 
Projections” exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the projection period, slightly high er than the pre-crisis aver age.  
Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of  about $83 billion at the end of October.
4  With longer-term 
interest rates expected to rise  over the next couple of years i n the December Tealbook 
baseline projection, the portfolio is expected to shift to an u nrealized loss position early 
                                                 
3 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate and that the interest  rate paid on excess reserve ba lances and the offering rate on overnight RRPs 
will be set at the top and botto m of the range, respectively. 
4 The Federal Reserve publishes the quarter-end n et unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Fina ncial Reports,” available on the Board’s 
website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/m onetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly .

 next year and to record a peak unrealized loss of $157 billion in 2019:Q3; $53 billion of 
this amount is attributable  to Treasury securities and $104 bil lion to agency MBS.  The 
unrealized loss position subse quently narrows, in part because the value of securities 
acquired under the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs returns to par 
as those securities approach mat urity.  This projection is simi lar to that in the October 
Tealbook. 
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” the elevated amount of securitie s held in the SOMA is 
currently estimated to be reduci ng the term premium in the 10-year Treasury yield 87 
basis points; this effect will gradually fade over time.5  This projection is nearly identical 
to that in the previous Tealbook. 
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  The weighted-
average duration of the portfolio  is projected to increase during the balance sheet 
normalization process as the pace of redemptions picks up and l onger-duration securities 
account for a larger share of  the remaining portfolio.  
After normalization of the size of  the balance sheet, the durat ion of the SOMA 
Treasury portfolio is projected t o decline as the Federal Reser ve resumes purchases of 
Treasury securities.  The initial  sharp decline in duration res ults from the staff’s 
assumption that these purchases  will be limited to Treasury bil ls until they account for 
one-third of the Treasury portfo lio, close to the pre-crisis composition (currently the 
SOMA portfolio holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, purchases  of Treasury securities 
are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bottom panel of the 
exhibit).  
                                                 
5 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007–2008.  In 
particular, in the benchmark counterfactual balance sheet proje ction, the staff assumes a longer-run level of 
reserves of $100 billion and a constant, minimal TGA level, con sistent with the pre-crisis minimum level of 
excess reserve balances and the T reasury’s pre-crisis cash mana gement policy.
