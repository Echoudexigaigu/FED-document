Data received over the intermeeti ng period indicate that the la bor market and the 
broader economy have continued to strengthen.  Although job gai ns slowed somewhat in 
December, average job gains in recent months have been solid an d remained well above 
estimates of the pace that is likely to be sustainable over the  longer run.  The 
unemployment rate remained quite  low, and some broader measures  of labor market 
conditions also point to high and r ising levels of labor utiliz ation.  In addition, real GDP 
has been increasing at a rate that appreciably exceeds the staf f’s estimate of potential 
GDP growth and is projected to continue to do so through next y ear.  Many forecasters, 
including the staff, have revis ed up their projections of econo mic growth in response to 
the recent data, more accommodative financial conditions, stron ger expansion abroad, 
and the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Measures of 12-m onth headline and core 
inflation have continued t o run below 2 percent, though both edged up since the summer 
and are projected to be close  to 2 percent by mid-year, once la st spring’s unusually large 
decrease in the price of cell  phone services no longer enters the calculation of 12-month 
inflation.1 
The key question for the Committee at the January meeting is wh ether, in light of 
incoming information and its implications for the economic outl ook, communications 
about the appropriate policy rate path should be altered, possibly in conjunction with an 
increase in the target range f or the federal funds rate.  Again st this background, three 
alternative draft statements are given below for the Committee’ s consideration.  The 
alternatives provide varying interpretations of the ongoing tension between the softness 
in inflation and the strength in economic activity and the labo r market.  Correspondingly, 
the alternatives differ on the t arget range to be announced nex t week and in the message 
conveyed about the federal funds  rate path expected to be neces sary to achieve the 
Committee’s objectives.  
Alternative B continues to note the solid performance of the la bor market, and in 
light of incoming data, it upgrad es the characterization of hou sehold spending and 
business investment.  It indicates that economic conditions are likely to warrant “further” gradual increases in the federal funds rate but holds the curre nt target range at 1¼ to 1½

percent and retains language i ndicating that near-term risks to  the outlook appear roughly 
balanced.  Thus, Alternative B signals that the Committee now s ees a somewhat steeper, 
ultimately higher, or both steeper  and higher path for the federal funds rate as likely to be 
necessary to achieve its objectives.   
Alternative C cites the same so lid incoming real-side data and adds language to 
note recent increases in infla tion.  Moreover, Alternative C ch aracterizes risks to the 
near-term outlook for economic activity as tilted to the upside .  Alternative C includes a 
25-basis-point increase in the t arget range for the federal fun ds rate in January and
indicates that “further” gradual increases in the funds rate li kely will be needed to achieve
“sustainable” rates of expansion in economic activity and emplo yment over the medium
term.  By combining these language  changes with an immediate in crease in the target
range for the federal funds rate , Alternative C signals substan tially greater conviction
than Alternative B that a steeper, an ultimately higher, or bot h steeper and higher path for
the federal funds rate than prev iously expected is needed.
In contrast, Alternative A empha sizes that inflation declined during 2017 and is 
still below the Committee’s long er-term objective.  In light of persistently low inflation, 
Alternative A indicates that the federal funds rate target will  be maintained for the time 
being and opens the possibility that the target range may need to be lowered in order to 
achieve the Committee’s inflation objective. 
With regard to the specifics of  the draft statement language: 
The three alternatives differ only slightly in their assessm
ent of the strength of
incoming real-side data.  The bigge r differences lie in the ass essments of the state of
the labor market.
oAlternative B describes the labo r market as having “continued t o strengthen”
and economic activity as having ris en “at a solid rate.”  This characterization
is informed by payroll gains that have exceeded the pace consid ered
sustainable over the longer r un as well as by broader indicatio ns of strength in
the labor market.  Gains in employment, household spending, and  business
fixed investment are characteri zed as having “been solid” while  the
unemployment rate “has stayed low.”
oAlternative C uses the same desc riptions of the labor market an d real activity.
Alternatives

oIn contrast, Alternativ e A describes the labor market as having  “remained
strong.”  This characterization of  the labor market reflects th e recent leveling
off in the unemployment rate, and the absence of any firming in  wage growth.
As do Alternatives B and C, Alterna tive A acknowledges the rece nt strong
spending data.
The alternatives also differ in  their characterization of infla tion and measures of
inflation compensation.
oAlternative B states that on a 12-m
onth basis, both total and c ore inflation
have “continued to” run below  2 percent—deleting the mention of  the decline
over 2017.  There is no change from the December FOMC statement  in the
description of market-based meas ures of inflation compensation or of survey-
based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.
oAlternative C also states th at on a 12-month basis, both total and core inflation
rates have “continued to” run below 2 percent—again omitting th e mention of
the decline over 2017.  However, in contrast to Alternative B, Alternative C
notes that inflation readings have  increased since last summer.   Similarly,
Alternative C notes that market-based measures of inflation com pensation
“have increased in recent months ” and drops the phrase that the se measures
“remain low.”  There is no change from the December FOMC statem ent in the
description of survey-based m easures of longer-term inflation e xpectations.
oAlternative A retains the reference to the decline in total and core inflation
rates (on a 12-month basis) i n 2017 and omits mention of the mi ld upward
trend in readings since last su mmer.  As does Alternative B, th e
characterizations of inflation com pensation and survey-based me asures of
inflation expectations are uncha nged from the December FOMC sta tement.
The outlook for economi
c activity a nd the labor market is somew hat different across
the three alternatives, as is  the inflation outlook.  In additi on, the outlook associated
with each alternative is conditioned on a different expectation  for monetary policy.
oAlternative B indicates that ec onomic activity will expand at a  “moderate
pace” and that labor market conditions will “remain strong,” wi th “further”
gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.  The incl usion of the
qualifier “further” is intended to suggest that, in light of recent data, the policyrate path may need to be somewhat  higher than previously antici pated.
Alternatives

oAlternative C indicates greater urgency for slowing the momentu m of the
economy by stating that economic activity and employment will e xpand at
“sustainable rates over the medium term” with “further” gradual  adjustments
in the stance of monetary polic y.  This language is intended to  signal that in
the absence of a rate  path that is either steeper, eventually h igher, or both
steeper and eventually higher than previously expected, overhea ting could
pose risks to the continuation of  the expansion.  To reinforce the message that
a higher policy path may be neede d, Alternative C characterizes  risks to the
near-term outlook for economic activity as tilted to the upside .
oAlternative A focuses primaril y on the persistent shortfall in inflation.  It
removes the sentence that said t he Committee expects inflation “to remain
somewhat below 2 percent in the ne ar term but to stabilize arou nd the
Committee’s 2 percent objective ove r the medium term.”  Instead , Alternative
A indicates that inflation will “gradually rise” to 2 percent o ver the medium
term—a formulation that could be taken as suggesting a Committe e
expectation of a slower converg ence to the objective than previ ously
anticipated.  Moreover, Altern ative A no longer conditions the Committee’s
outlook on “gradual adjustments i n the stance of monetary polic y,” but rather
on “appropriately accommodative monetary policy.”
With respect to the current policy decision and the outlook for  m
onetary policy:
oAlternative B leaves the targe t range at 1¼ to 1½ percent and s ignals an
expectation that “further gradua l increases” in the federal fun ds rate will be
appropriate.
oAlternative C raises the targe t range to 1½ to 1¾ percent and i n addition
conveys an expectation that “fu rther gradual increases” will be  necessary to
achieve economic growth consis tent with price stability.  In ad dition,
Alternative C drops the indicati on that the federal funds rate is likely to
“remain, for some time, below le vels that are expected to preva il in the longer
run.”  This change conveys the messages that the Committee sees  a need to
raise rates more rapidly than pr eviously anticipated and admits  the possibility
that the federal funds rate in the  medium term will exceed leve ls expected to
prevail in the longer run.
oAlternative A leaves the targe t range at 1¼ to 1½ percent and s uggests that the
current range may be appropriate  for longer than previously exp ected by tying

   it to incoming data that bear s on the outlook for inflation.  A lternative A no 
longer describes how “the timing a nd size of future adjustments” to the target 
range will be determined; instead, it focuses on how the FOMC w ill determine 
“whether” to adjust th e target range.  This provides an additio nal signal that 
the federal funds rate may need to remain on hold at coming mee tings—or 
even be reduced—in order to achie ve the Committee’s objectives.

   DECEMBER 2017  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in November 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a solid rate.  Averaging through hu rricane-related 
fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment r ate declined 
further.  Household spending has been expanding at a moderate r ate, and growth 
in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.  On a 12-month 
basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other tha n food and energy 
have declined this year and are  running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures 
of inflation compensation remain l ow; survey-based measures of longer-term 
inflation expectations are  little changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  H urricane-related disruptions and rebuilding 
have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but 
have not materially altered the outlook for the na tional econom y.  Consequently, 
the Committee continues to expect  that, with gradual adjustment s in the stance of 
monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pa ce and labor 
market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected 
to remain somewhat below 2 percen t in the near term but to stab ilize around the 
Committee’s 2 percent objective  over the medium term.  Near-ter m risks to the 
economic outlook appear roughly bal anced, but the Committee is monitoring 
inflation developments closely. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 1-1/4 to 
1-1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommoda tive, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation. 
 4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, 
including measures of labor marke t conditions, indicators of in flation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and r eadings on financial and inter national 
developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .  The Committee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the  federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data.

   ALTERNATIVE A FOR JANUARY 2018 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in Novem ber 
December indicates that the labor market  has continued to strengthen remained 
strong  and that economic activity has b een rising at a solid rate.  A veraging 
through hurricane-related flu ctuations, job Gains in employment, household 
spending, and business fixed investment  have been solid, and the 
unemployment rate declined further has stayed low .  Household spending has 
been expanding at a moderate rat e, and growth in business fixed investment has 
picked up in recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis, both overal l inflation and 
inflation for items other tha n food and energy have declined th is last year and are 
running below 2 percent.  Market- based measures of inflation co mpensation 
remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expe ctations are little 
changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  H urricane-related disruptions and rebuilding 
have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but 
have not materially altered the outlook for the na tional econom y.  Consequently, 
The Committee continues to expect s that, with gradual adjustments in the stance 
of appropriately accommodative  monetary policy, inflation will gradually rise 
to the Committee’s 2 percent obje ctive over the medium term, economic 
activity will expand at a moderate pace , and labor market conditions will remain 
strong.  Inflation on a 12-m onth basis is expected to remain so mewhat below 
2 percent in the near term but t o stabilize around the Committe e’s 2 percent 
objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear 
roughly balanced, but the Committ ee is monitoring inflation dev elopments 
closely.  
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to raise maintain  the target range for the federal funds rate to 
at 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent while continuing to assess incoming information that 
bears on the outlook for inflation .  The stance of monetary policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market condition s and a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation. 
 4. In determining the tim ing and size of future whether to  adjustm ents to the target 
range for the federal funds rate,  the Committee will assess rea lized and expected 
economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum emplo yment and 
2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of 
information, including measures of labor market conditions, ind icators of inflation 
pressures and inflation expect ations, and readings on financial  and international 
developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .  The Comm ittee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant

   THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen.   
o Payroll gains averaged 162,000 per month from September through  
December, only slightly below the ir average pace earlier in the year.  Both the 
average level of job gains and the job gains reported in Decemb er (148,000) 
were well above the staff’s estimate of the pace that is sustai nable over the 
longer run.  
o The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent in December (the same as in 
October and November), below all FOMC participants’ estimates o f the 
longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the December Summary of 
Economic Projections (SEP).  The  share of workers who reported being part 
time for economic reasons and t he share of the population out o f the labor 
force, but who reported wanti ng a job, also held steady.  In ad dition, the labor 
force participation rate was f lat despite downward pressure fro m secular 
factors such as aging of the population.  
o Notwithstanding the strong pace of  job gains and the low unemployment rate, 
compensation data continued to point  to little accel eration in wages.   
 Although readings on headline and core inflation have continued  to run below 2 
percent, both rates are project ed to be near 2 percent by mid-2 018.   
o Over the 12 months ending in Novemb er, the core PCE inflation r ate was 1.5 
percent, up about 0.2 percentage poi nt from its low last summer .  The staff 
projects that 12-month core PC E inflation will rise to 1.8 perc ent in March, 
when the unusual decline in core  prices recorded for March 2017  drops out of 
the 12-month window.  The projecte d increase over the medium te rm also 
reflects the tightening econom y and recent depreciation of the dollar. 
o Over the 12 months ending in Nove mber, headline PCE inflation w as 1.8 
percent, up 0.4 percenta ge point since last summer.  The staff projects that 12-
month headline PCE inflation wi ll rise to 2.0 percent in March.   The projected 
increase in headline inflation ref lects in part the anticipated  effect of the recent 
increase in the price  of oil on gasoline prices. 
o The staff forecasts that the 12-month rates of both core and he adline inflation 
will be 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, close to the Committee’ s longer-run 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

   objective of 2 percent.  This aspect of the staff forecast coin cides with the 
median projection in the December SEP. 
o Survey measures of inflation exp ectations changed little over t he intermeeting 
period.  The 5-year, 5-year forward TIPS-based measure of infla tion 
compensation is now 13 basis points higher than at the time of the December 
FOMC meeting.   
 Real GDP growth appears to have  exceeded 3 percent at an annual  rate in the third 
and fourth quarters of 2017.  Further more, the staff forecasts GDP to increase at an 
annual rate of 3 percent in the f irst half of this year—a pace well in excess of the 
staff’s estimate of potential GDP growth and of the median Dece mber SEP estimate 
of the economy’s longer-run growth rate.  
 While the macroeconomic effects of  the recent tax reform are uncertain, the staff now 
estimates that the tax policy cha nges imply a larger fiscal sti mulus than anticipated on 
the basis of information availab le at the time of the December Tealbook or FOMC 
meeting. 
 Since the December FOMC meetin g, information on economic activity abroad has 
been upbeat and stronger than expe cted, and the broad dollar in dex has declined 4¾ 
percent.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may view the economy as having somewhat exceeded i ts full-
employment level, and they might a nticipate that the labor mark et will continue to 
tighten this year as the recent easing in financial conditions and tax cuts support 
strong growth in demand for goods and services.  That being so, they may see a 
somewhat steeper or higher pat h for the federal funds rate as l ikely to be appropriate 
to achieve the outlook for modera te growth and a return to 2 percent inflation, but not 
regard an increase in the target range for the federal funds ra te as necessary at this 
meeting.  
 The recent strength in economic activity may have bolstered pol icymakers’ 
confidence that inflation will  gradually rise to 2 percent.  Co nsequently, policymakers 
may judge it prudent to continue w ith a gradual removal of acco mmodation even 
against a background of low curre nt inflation readings.  Howeve r, inflation has been 
persistently below the Committ ee’s 2 percent objective.  Policy makers may therefore 
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
January 25, 2018
Page 13 of 40
Authorized for Public Release
   
   view Alternative B as preserv ing flexibility to respond appropriately should inflation 
fail to rise as anticipated. 
 Policymakers may wish to acknowle dge the strength in incoming r eal-side data and 
continue to signal that the FOM C no longer sees additional tigh tening in the labor 
market as necessary to achieve its employment and inflation objectives.  However, 
with nominal wage growth ha ving picked up only gently over the past few years, and 
with job gains having moderated som ewhat during the same period , policymakers 
may see no need for an indication t hat the FOMC is seeking to bring about less-tight 
labor market conditions.   
 As shown in the “Monetary Polic y Expectations and Uncertainty” box, federal funds 
futures quotes imply that market  participants, on average, rega rd the odds of a rate 
hike at the upcoming meeting a s negligible but see a high proba bility that the federal 
funds rate will be raised at the March meeting.  Respondents to  the Desk’s latest 
surveys have broadly similar expectations.  Predicting the mark et response to the 
statement in Alternative B is  difficult.  Maintaining the current target range while 
conveying a stronger outlook for t he economy and the possibilit y of a somewhat 
steeper policy rate path than suggested by December’s language— by inserting 
“further” before “gradual” in paragraphs 2 and 4—would probably  boost interest rates 
and the foreign exchange value of  the dollar modestly and put s ome downward 
pressure on stock prices.  The upward pressure on interest rate s would be more 
pronounced if market participants  viewed the language as signaling a higher funds

Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is already appreci ably beyond full 
employment and that economic activ ity—which was already growing at a faster-than-

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Over the intermeeting  period, market participants  appeared  to become  
increasingly  confident  that the Committee  will keep  the target range for the 
federal funds  rate unchanged  at the upcoming  FOMC meeting and announce  a 
25‐basis‐point rate increase  at the March  meeting.   As shown by  the black line in 
figure 1, a str aight read of quotes on federal funds futures contracts  suggests  
that the probability  attached  to a rate hike  at the March  meeting rose from 
around 60 percent immediately  following  the December  meeting to about  85 
percent.  This increase occurred  against a backdrop  of economic  data releases, 
both domestically  and abroad, that were generally  stronger  than consensus  
expectations.   As was the case ahead of the December  2017 rate hike, the  odds of 
a hike at the  March 2018 meeting  have firmed above 80  percent well ahead  of 
the meeting.   Respondents  to the Desk’s January surveys assigned, on  average,  
similarly high odds to a March rate increase  and virtually no odds to a rate hike  in 
January. 
Looking further ahead, the  probability  distribution  of the level of the federal 
funds rate at  the end of 2018 implied by options quotes, assuming  zero term 
premiums,  shifted to the right over the  intermeeting  period (figure 2).  That 
distribution  indicates  that market participants  now attach the highest odds to 
the federal funds rate falling  in the 2 to 2¼ percent range at year ‐end, which 
corresponds  to three  25‐basis‐point rate hikes  this year.  Averaging  across 
respondents,  the comparable distribution  from the Desk’s January surveys 
(figure 3) also shifted to th e right. 
Overall, the  forward rates  implied by OIS quotes  (the blue lines in figure 4) 
moved up significantly  over the  intermeeting  period, increasing  14, 29, and 28 
basis points at the end of 2018, 2019, and  2020, respectively.   Under the 
assumption  of zero term premiums,  these market ‐implied forward rates  translate  
to an expected  federal funds  rate of about 2 percent at the end of 2018 and  2.3 
percent at the end  of both 2019 and 2020.  The expected  path of the federal 
funds rate with adjustments  for term premiums as  estimated  by a staff term  
structure model  (the red lines in figure 4) increased  by less since the  December  
FOMC meeting;  the model attributes  most of the increase in the market‐implied  
forward rates to less negative  term premiums.   The model‐ based path suggests  
an expected  federal funds  rate of about 2.4 percent at the end of 2018 and about 
3.1 percent at the end of 2020, and so continues  to show a faster pace of rate 
increases  than the unadjusted  path.   
As shown in  figure 5, the model‐ based path (the light‐ blue line) is similar to the  
Committee’s  December  median SEP  projections  (the dark‐blue dots) and to the 
median of  Desk survey respondents’  modal path (the brown line).  However, the 
survey‐implied modal path lies noticeably  above the survey ‐implied mean path  
(the golden squares).   The  survey‐implied mean path  is constructed  from

  respondents’  probability  distributions  under certain assumptions  and is close to 
the unadjusted  path implied by OIS quotes.  While the  mean path  moved up 
some since December  (not shown), the fact that it remains well below  the modal 
path suggests  that investors  continue  to perceive  risks to the economic  outlook 
as skewed towards the downside.1  The median respondent  to the January Desk 
surveys continued  to attach  about 20 percent probability  to a return to the  zero 
lower bound  sometime  over the  next three years,  unchanged  from the previous  
surveys. 
Part of the increase in both the market‐based and survey‐based expected  policy 
rate paths  may reflect the anticipated  expansionary  effects of the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act (TCJA).  The median survey  respondent in  the January  Desk surveys 
indicated  that, compared  with previously  existing law, the TCJA is expected  to 
increase the  budget deficit by 0.5 to 1 percentage point  of GDP during each of the 
current year  and the next two.  While respondents  held somewhat  diverse views 
on the economic  effects of the TCJA, the median respondent  in the Dealer  survey 
expected  the TCJA to provide  only a modest  boost to  near‐term GDP growth, 
adding 0.3 and 0.2 percentage point to  GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 but havin g 
no impact on  GDP growth in 2020.  In addition,  the median survey respondent 
estimated  that the TCJA would have no effect on core PCE inflation over the 
2018–2020  period.   
The January surveys asked  respondents  to assess the  current level  of the neutral 
real federal funds  rate, as well as its level at the en d of each of the next  three 
years.  As in the October–November  2017 surveys, when these questions  were 
last asked, respondents  held quite diverse views about the current and future 
levels of the neutral real rate,  as is evident from the wide range  of estimates  
shown in  figure 6.  Although  some respondents  indicated  they had marked up 
their estimates  in response  to the passage of the TCJA, the median estimates  of 
the current level, as well as those for the  end of 2018 and  2019 (the orange 
horizontal  bars), were unchanged  at 0.25, 0.5  and 0.75 percent,  respectively, 
while the median estimate for the  end of 2020 edged down.  Taking a somewhat  
longer perspective,  the median estimates  of the neutral real rate at  the end of 
2018 and 2019 are currently  about 30 and 25 basis points lower, respectively, than  
they were in December  2016. 
                                                 
1 Of note, the staff  term structure  model may not adequately  capture  such a feature as it 
assumes that shocks  to the economy  are normally distributed  and therefore  implies  mean and 
modal short  rate paths  that  largely coincide when the short  rate is sufficiently  away from the

   o Despite four increases in the ta rget range for the federal fund s rate from 
December 2016 to December 2017, the a verage pace of payroll gains in 2017, 
including in recent months, significantly exceeded the pace com monly 
regarded as necessary to absorb new entrants (and reentrants) i nto the labor 
force and maintain a constant un employment rate over the medium  run.   
o The staff forecasts that average  payroll gains will continue to  be strong in the 
coming three years.  Accordingly, t he staff expects that the un employment 
rate will continue to declin e, reaching 3¼ percent in 2019 and 2020.  Such a 
low rate of unemployment has not been reached in the United States for more 
than half a century.  
o Other indicators pointing to a t ight labor market include job o penings, survey 
measures of job availability, w idespread indications of difficu lty of firms in 
hiring workers, and low initial cla ims for unemployment insuran ce.   
 Policymakers may see projected inflation as soon closing in on the Committee’s 
longer-run objective.  Twelve-m onth rates of headline and core PCE inflation, which 
have been running at about 1¾ and 1½ percent, respectively, in recent months, are 
expected to rise this spring as March 2017’s larg e recorded dro p in the price of cell 
phone services drops out of the 12-month calculation.  Notably,  headline inflation is 
projected to rise just above 2 percent in the f irst half of 201 8, in part reflecting 
increases in gasoline prices.  In addition, the most recent inflation measures show a moderate rise since the summer and the 5-year, 5-year forward T IPS-based measure 
of inflation compensation is now  13 basis points higher than at  the time of the 
December FOMC meeting and is up about 25 basis points relative to its average from 
June through November of last year .  Policymakers may believe t hat more concerted 
upward pressures on both wages and prices are likely to emerge following a 
prolonged period of labor market tightness.  
 Despite the four increases in the target range for the federal funds rate from 
December 2016 to December 2017, aggregate financial conditions appear to have eased.  Equity prices have risen f urther in recent months, whil e stock market volatility 
has been very low.  Spreads on investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds have 
declined over the past year and a re roughly in line with their pre-crisis levels.  In 
addition, the trade-weighted dolla r has depreciated considerably since early 
November.

    Policymakers may see notable up side risks to the outlook for ec onomic activity, 
resource utilization, and inflation. 
o Indicators of consumer and business sentiment—including as meas ured by the  
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the ISM manufactur ing index, 
and the Philadelphia Fed futur e capital spending index—have bee n extremely 
buoyant.  In addition, the interm eeting reports on retail sales  and sales of light 
motor vehicles came in stronger than expected.  Taken together,  these 
indicators suggest upside risk to aggregate demand. 
o Since the December FOMC meeting, positive foreign economic data , AFE 
central bank communications, and improved risk sentiment pushed  foreign 
yields and equity prices higher .  These developments also likel y weighed on 
the foreign exchange value of t he dollar, which declined 4¾ per cent over the 
intermeeting period.  In the curren t synchronized global expans ion, it is 
possible that foreign growth will  be stronger than currently ex pected, thus 
posing further upside risks to the U.S. outlook. 
o The macroeconomic effects of the  legislated tax changes are unc ertain and 
may turn out to be more stimulative than currently anticipated.   
Policy Strategy  
 Despite past rate increases and r ecent FOMC statements noting a n expectation of 
additional gradual hikes, the labor market and economic activit y continue to expand 
more rapidly than is sustaina ble in the longer run.  In light o f higher equity prices, 
narrower risk spreads, and depr eciation of the dollar, policyma kers may judge that 
broad financial conditions have eased despite the increase in l onger-term interest 
rates.  Policymakers may conseque ntly be concerned that reducin g accommodation at 
the slow pace that market partic ipants anticipate poses significant risks of overheating 
and too-high inflation, and appreciably raises the likelihood t hat policy may need to 
tighten abruptly in the future.   
 Policymakers may view valuation pr essures together with low vol atility in financial 
markets as encouraging or refle cting excessive risk-taking.  Po licymakers might be 
concerned that significant undershooting of the longer-run norm al rate of 
unemployment, alongside loose fi nancial conditions, could lead to a buildup of 
financial vulnerabilities.  For example, policymakers may see a s one such 
vulnerability the historically high levels of leverage in the n onfinancial corporate

   sector, and the accompanying dange r that interest-expense ratio s could rise rapidly if 
monetary policy needed to be tightened quickly. 
 For all of the above reasons, po licymakers may opt to raise the  target range of the 
federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ per cent while emphasizing that “ the stance of 
monetary policy remains accommodative.” 
 A statement like Alternative C would surprise market participants, not least because 
the federal funds futures quotes imply that market participants, on average, regard the 
odds of a rate hike at the upcom ing meeting as negligible.  If the public were to infer 
that the newly composed Committee has a less accommodative “rea ction function,” 
then medium- and longer-term real interest rates would likely r ise, as would the 
exchange value of the dollar, a nd equity prices a nd inflation c ompensation would 
probably fall.  If, however, the pub lic were instead to interpret a statement like 
Alternative C as primarily ref lecting a more upbeat assessment of the strength of the 
economy, then equity prices might f all less than otherwise.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 On a 12-month basis, core infla tion has continued to run notably below 2 percent.  
Twelve-month core PCE inflati on including only market-based prices was 1.2 percent 
in November; the 12-month trimm ed mean inflation rate calculate d by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Dallas remaine d at 1.7 percent.  Policymakers m ay see these 
readings as indicating that inflation this year has been held down, at least in part, by persistent factors.  
 One factor holding down inflation m ay be that the labor market has not yet reached 
maximum sustainable employment.  The unemployment rate has decl ined about ¾ 
percentage point over the past ye ar and average job gains have been solid; 
nonetheless, wages have shown little sign of accelerating.  The  employment-to-
population ratio for prime-age work ers remains below its pre-re cession level, 
suggesting scope for further labor market strengthening.   
 Low expected inflation may be a nother factor holding down infla tion.  Recent 
readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation and  survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflati on expectations remain low by historical standards.

   Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may be concerned that  inflation exp ectations have already declined 
materially in recent years and could drift down further if infl ation continues to run 
persistently below 2 percent.2   
o Since the 2007-09 recession, 12-mont h core PCE inflation has ex ceeded 2 
percent in only four months.  A gainst that background, policyma kers may 
favor a statement like Alterna tive A in order to solidify the C ommittee’s 
commitment to its inflation objective and to prevent further er osion in 
inflation expectati ons.  In addition, policymakers may judge th at the past 
decade’s experience of low inf lation reduces the likelihood tha t inflation 
expectations will rise significantly.   
 Policymakers may view any buildup of risks to financial stability as limited, partly 
reflecting a judgment that the ba nking system is well capitalized and that broad 
measures of leverage and credit growth remain contained.  In addition, policymakers 
may see scope to address financial stability concerns through m acroprudential 
policies and supervisory actions t hat target specific risks.   
 Policymakers may view the effects  of the newly enacted tax chan ges as uncertain 
with possible surprises to either  the upside or the downside, b ut judge that their 
ability to react to unexpected out comes is skewed due to proxim ity to the effective 
lower bound. 
 Despite recent positive surprise s in real-side data, the staff currently projects an 
inversion in the yield curve.  C onsequently, policymakers may j udge that the 
currently expected policy rate path may, if anything, be too high or too steep. 
 On the basis of these arguments , policymakers may want to commu nicate that an 
increase in the target range f or the federal funds rate is not warranted at this meeting 
and that future increases are unlikely until the Committee is m ore confident that the 
recent softness in inflation is being reversed.  They may also wish to suggest that, if 
inflation does not increase by as much as expected, the Committ ee would consider 
reducing the target range f or the federal funds rate.   
 Financial market quotes and the D esk’s latest surveys indicate that market 
participants see little or no cha nce of an adjustment in the ta rget range for the federal

   funds rate at this meeting, but they assign a high probability of a rate increase at the 
March meeting.  Thus, a statement along the lines of Alternative A would likely be 
regarded as a significant change in the Committee’s policy outl ook and would likely 
bring down expectations of a rate hike in March.  If the public  saw this statement as 
primarily reflecting policymaker s’ resolve to push inflation up  to 2 percent, then 
inflation compensation could ris e, real longer-term interest rates would probably fall 
somewhat, and equity prices might r ise as well.  Lower real rat es and the prospect of 
higher inflation likely would enc ourage depreciation of the dol lar.

2017 will lead to the redemption of $36 billion in Treasury sec urities and $24 billion of 
agency securities.  Over 2018 as a whole, holdings of Treasury and agency securities are 
projected to decline abou t $240 billion and $120 billion, respectively; about $200 billion 
of Treasury securities and a bout $60 billion of agency securiti es will be reinvested.1  The 
projections for agency securitie s are uncertain as unscheduled prepayments depend 
heavily on the paths of mortgage rates, which are difficult to predict.   
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   The size of the balance sheet is 
projected to normalize in the second quarter of 2021, one quart er earlier than in the 
December Tealbook (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Sel ected Balance Sheet 
Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).2  The earlier normaliza tion date reflects a 
slight upward revision to the proj ection for Federal Reserve notes in circulation in 2020. 
From the start of the balance sheet normalization program in October 2017 to the 
time the balance sheet normalizes , the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings are projected 
to decline by about $1.3 trilli on, with its holdings of Treasur y and agency securities 
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury se curities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each q uarter.  In contrast,  under the staff’s c urrent baseline forecast of rising longer-term 
interest rates, the maximum $20 billion cap on monthly redempti ons of agency securities is not projected to 
bind. 
2 Many factors will influence th e size at which the balance shee t will be normalized, including 
banks’ post-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally s peaking, the size of the balance sheet is 
considered to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of  Treasury securities is  required in order to 
maintain the desired longer-run level of reserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key  
non-reserve liability items suc h as Federal Reserve notes.

 shrinking by about $800 billion and $470 billion, respectively.   At the time of 
normalization: 
 Reserve balances reach the assumed longer-run level of $500 bil lion;3 
 Total assets are projected t o stand at roughly $3 trillion, wit h the SOMA portfolio 
consisting of about $1.7 trillion in Treasury securities and $1 .3 trillion in MBS.   
Once these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the siz e of the balance 
sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GD P, compared with a peak 
of about 25 percent in late 2014 and a pre-crisis average of ab out 6 percent.  After the 
size of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings rise, keeping pace with the 
projected increases in Federal R eserve liabilities including Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation, the Treasury Genera l Account (TGA), and Federal Reserve Bank capital,  but 
Federal Reserve assets and lia bilities are pr ojected to edge do wn as a share of GDP.  
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to about $50 billion this year from $80 billion in 2017 .4  This reflects the 
projected increases in the inte rest rate paid on reserve balanc es associated with the rate 
hikes in the January baseline pr ojection (see the “Income Proje ctions” exhibit).5  Total 
interest expense is projecte d to be about $52 billion this year  and to increase thereafter, 
while interest income from SOMA  holdings is expected to be $110  billion this year and 
to decline thereafter .  As the target range for the federal fun ds rate moves up further 
while the size of the SOMA portf olio decreases, remittances are  expected to reach a 
trough of about $32 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances begin to increase, particularly once the size of t he balance sheet is normalized a nd higher-yielding Treasury 
securities are added to the SOMA portfolio. 
                                                 
3 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h the requirement to represent a constant 
fraction of nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in circulation a re assumed to increase at an average annual 
pace of about 6 percen t through 2020 and at the same pace as no minal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo 
pool and balances in the accounts of designated financial marke t utilities (DFMUs) remain at their 
December 2017 levels of about $240 billion and $70 billion, res pectively; and take-up  at the overnight RRP 
facility is assumed to maintain a value of $100 billion until t he level of reserve bala nces reaches $1 trillion, 
at which point take-up starts declining to zero over the course  of one year. 
4 The Federal Reserve Board’s pub lic announcement of remittances  to the Treasury for 2017 is 
available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/ newsevents/pressreleases/other20 180110a.htm.  
5 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate and that the interest  rate paid on excess reserve ba lances and the offering rate on overnight RRPs 
will be set at the top and botto m of the range, respectively.

 The contour of projected remittances over the next few years is  lower than in the 
December Tealbook baseline.  Over that period, the increase in interest expense due to 
the upward revision in the pat h of the federal funds rate is gr eater than the increase in 
interest income due to the upward r evision to longer-term inter est rates.  Subsequently, 
projected remittances are higher primarily because of the upward revisions to longer-term 
rates.  As shown in the bottom left panel of the “Income Projections” exhibit, annual 
remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal GDP over the projection period, 
slightly higher than th e pre-crisis average. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized gain position of  about $80 billion at the end of  December.  As longer-term 
interest rates rose in the fir st few weeks of this year, the position diminished to about   
$20 billion by mid-January.6  The portfolio is projected t o shift to an unrealized loss 
position later this quar ter and, with longer-term rates expecte d to continue to rise over the 
next several years, ultimately to reach an unrealized loss position of about $255 billion in 
2020:Q1; $100 billion of this amount is attributable to Treasur y securities and $155 
billion to agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position subsequent ly narrows, in part 
because the value of securitie s acquired under the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset 
purchase programs returns to par as those securities approach m aturity.  By the end of 
this year and through the end of t he projection, the net unrealized position is more 
negative than in the December Tealbook baseline.  This change i s due to upward 
revisions to the paths of mediu m- and longer-term interest rate s.   
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by 84 basis points; this effect will gradually fade 
over time.7  This projection is essentially unchanged from the previous Te albook. 
                                                 
6 The Federal Reserve publishes the quarter-end n et unrealized gain/loss position of the SOMA 
portfolio in the “Federal Reserve Banks Combined Quarterly Fina ncial Reports,” available on the Board’s 
website at http://www.federalreserve.gov/m onetarypolicy/bst_fedfinancials. htm#quarterly . 
7 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007–2008.  In 
particular, in the benchmark counterfactual balance sheet proje ction, the staff assumes a longer-run level of 
reserves of $100 billion and a constant, minimal TGA level, con sistent with the pre-crisis minimum level of 
excess reserve balances and the T reasury’s pre-crisis cash mana gement policy.

 SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  The weighted-
average duration of that portfo lio is projected to increase during the process of balance 
sheet normalization, as the pace of redemptions picks up and lo nger-duration securities 
become a larger share of the portfolio.  
After normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet in 2021, t he duration of the 
SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Federal Reserve resumes 
purchases of Treasury securitie s.  The initial sharp decline in duration results from the 
staff’s assumption that these purchases will be limited to Trea sury bills until they account 
for one-third of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities port folio, close to the pre-crisis 
composition (currently the SOMA portfolio contains no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
(see the bottom panel  of the exhibit).
