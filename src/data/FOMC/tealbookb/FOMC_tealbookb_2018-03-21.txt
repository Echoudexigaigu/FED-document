Data received over the intermeeti ng period indicate that the ec onomy has 
continued to expand at a faster-t han-potential pace and that th e labor market has 
continued to strengthen.  The average pace of job gains in rece nt months has been 
stronger than earlier last year  and the unemployment rate has r emained quite low.  A 
number of other measures of labor  market conditions also point to high and rising levels 
of labor utilization.  Recent sp ending indicators, on balance, point to a moderation in real 
GDP growth in the current quart er.  This moderation appears lik ely to be temporary, for 
two reasons.  First, ongoing strengthening in the labor market, which is continuing to 
bolster income and confidence, a s well as stronger expansions abroad and 
accommodative financial conditions, continue to support growth in consumer spending, 
business investment, and exports .  Second, the increased federal government spending 
that will result from last month’s passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 is expected to provide an additional boost to aggregate demand goi ng forward.  Inflation 
has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective,  but recent monthly 
readings are consistent with the  staff’s expectation that infla tion will step up in coming 
months and run close to 2 percent this year. 
There are two key questions for the Committee at this meeting:  first, whether the 
available information warrants raising the federal funds rate; and second, whether the 
economic outlook and associated risks  indicate that the federal  funds rate path suggested 
by recent FOMC statements remain s appropriate.  Against this ba ckground, three 
alternative draft statements are given below for the Committee’ s consideration.  The 
alternative policy statements di ffer in the views expressed abo ut tightening resource 
utilization and its implicati on for the inflation outlook and, hence, for the appropriate 
message to convey about the federal  funds rate path expected to  be necessary to achieve 
the Committee’s objectives.  
Alternative B notes a stronger economic outlook but signals that this upgrade has 
not substantially changed the Committee’s judgement about the p ace of rate hikes that 
will most likely prove appropria te.  Alternative B includes a 2 5-basis-point increase in 
the target range for the feder al funds rate in March but leaves  the guidance about the 
future course of policy unchanged from the January statement.

Alternative C also acknowledges a stronger economic outlook but, unlike 
Alternative B, is predicate d on the view that allowing resource  utilization to tighten much 
further would create too large a risk that monetary policy will  eventually need to tighten 
abruptly.  Consequently, Alterna tive C conveys the Committee’s intention to continue 
gradually increasing the feder al funds rate until it is high en ough to slow growth in 
employment and economic activit y to sustainable rates.     
In contrast, Alternative A is m otivated by the view that longer -run inflation 
expectations may be too low.  It t hus indicates that “A temporary period of inflation 
modestly above 2 percent would be  consistent with the Committee ’s symmetric inflation 
objective and may be needed to ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are 
consistent with that objective.” 
With regard to the specifics of  the draft statement language: 
 The three Alternatives agree in their assessment of the state o f the labor market but 
differ slightly in the assessmen t of the strength of incoming s pending data. 
o Each of the Alternatives recognizes  that the labor market has c ontinued to 
strengthen and characterizes j ob gains as being “strong in rece nt months.” 
o The Alternatives differ in their  characterization of consumer s pending and 
business investment.  Alternative A simply states that “Household spending 
and business fixed investment app ear to be expanding at a moderate pace.”  
Alternative B notes t hat the moderation f ollows strong growth i n the fourth 
quarter.  Alternative C states that “Household spending and business fixed 
investment have been growing at solid rates, on average, in rec ent quarters.” 
o Consistent with the recent spendi ng indicators, A lternative B n otes that 
growth in economic activity has be en “moderate” while Alternati ve A states 
that it has “moderated.”  Alterna tive C retains the language from January and 
characterizes economic activit y as “rising at a solid rate.” 
 Regarding recent inflation developments, all three Alternatives  note that inflation 
continued to run below 2 percen t, with Alternative C adding tha t both overall 
inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy ha ve “increased from their 
lows last summer.” 
 The three Alternatives indicate that survey-based measures of l onger-term inflation 
expectations “are little cha nged, on balance,” as in the Januar y statement, but differ

slightly in the language concerni ng market-based measures of in flation compensation. 
Alternative B retains the langua ge from January, Alternative C strikes the words “but 
remain low,” and Alternative A instead deletes the language ind icating that these 
measures “have increas ed in recent months.” 
 The outlook for economic activity a nd the labor market is somew hat different across 
the three alternatives, as is  the inflation outlook.  In additi on, the outlook associated 
with each alternative is conditioned on a different expectation for monetary policy, 
reflecting different views about the risks associated with redu cing policy 
accommodation at the pace currently anticipated by market parti cipants.  
o Alternatives B and C include a new sentence, “The economic outl ook has 
strengthened in recent months.”  T his sentence is meant to capt ure the various 
factors that have contribute d to a stronger outlook, including changes in fiscal 
policy, stronger and more synchr onous growth abroad, and financial 
conditions that remain highly s upportive of growth despite rece nt market 
volatility.  Moreover, the outlook p aragraph in Alternative C s ignals more 
strongly that the Committee sees  further increases in the feder al funds rate as 
necessary to achieve sustainable  growth rates of economic activ ity and 
employment.  
o Regarding the outlook for inflati on, Alternative B now states that inflation is 
expected to move up “in coming mo nths” rather than “this year.”   (The latter 
words were used in the January s tatement.)  This modification i s not meant to 
signal a change in the infla tion outlook but rather to acknowle dge that the 
time when inflation is expect ed to step up closer to 2 percent is drawing near.  
Alternative C also notes that inflation is expected to move up “in coming 
months” but then conveys that, on ce the increase occurs, the Co mmittee will 
essentially have achieved its inflation objective.  In contrast , Alternative A 
signals a greater intention to achieve higher inflation by cond itioning the 
outlook on “appropriate monetar y policy accommodation” and noti ng that “A 
temporary period of inflation mode stly above 2 percent … may be needed to 
ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are consistent wi th” the 
Committee’s objective.  
o The three Alternatives retain the view that “Near-term risks to the economic 
outlook appear roughly balanced.”  Alternatives A and B, but no t C, keep the 
statement that “the Committee is monitoring inflation developme nts closely.”

 With respect to the c urrent policy decision: 
o Alternatives B and C raise the  target range to 1½ to 1¾ percent and continue 
to note that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodativ e. 
o Alternative A leaves the tar get range at 1¼ to 1½ percent.  
 With respect to the outlo ok for monetary policy: 
o Alternative B makes no changes from the January statement. 
o Alternative C drops the statement that “the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer 
run,” thus suggesting that the f ederal funds rate may need to rise to its normal 
longer-run level faster than otherwise. 
o Alternative A drops a ll of the guidance about the path of the f ederal funds 
rate, thus conveying a more a gnostic view of how policy will need to evolve 
in order to achieve the Committee’s objectives.

JANUARY 2018  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in December 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been risi ng at a solid rate.  Gains in employment,  household spending, 
and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemploy ment rate has 
stayed low.  On a 12-month basis , both overall in flation and in flation for items 
other than food and energy have c ontinued to run below 2 percen t.  Market-based 
measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent mon ths but remain 
low; survey-based measures of l onger-term inflation expectation s are little 
changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 
12‐month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize a round the 
Comm ittee’s 2 percent objective  over the medium term.  Near-ter m risks to the 
econom ic outlook appear roughly bal anced, but the Committee is monitoring 
inflation developm ents closely. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 
to 1‐1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodati ve, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation. 
 4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, 
including measures of labor marke t conditions, indicators of in flation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and r eadings on financial and inter national 
developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .  The Committee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant further 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the  federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR MARCH 2018 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in Decem ber 
January  indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen remained 
strong  and that while growth in  economic activity has been  rising at a solid rate 
moderated .  Job gains in em ployment, household spending, and business fixed 
investment have been solid strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate 
has stayed low.  Household spending and busine ss fixed investment appear to 
be expanding at a moderate pace.   On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation 
and inflation for items other than food and energy have continu ed to run below 2 
percent.  Market-based measures  of inflation comp ensation have increased in 
recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-t erm inflation 
expectations are lit tle changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual 
adjustments in the stance of appropriate  monetary policy accommodation , 
economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor mark et conditions 
will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12 ‐month basis is expected to move up this year 
and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective ove r the medium 
term.  Near-term risks to the  economic outlook appear roughly b alanced, but the 
Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 
to 1‐1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodati ve, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation.  A temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be 
consistent with the Committee’s symmetric inflation objective a nd may be 
needed to ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are con sistent with 
that objective.  
 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the

ALTERNATIVE B FOR MARCH 2018 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in Decem ber 
January  indicates that the labor market  has continued to strengthen an d that 
economic activity has been rising at a solid moderate  rate.  Job gains in  
employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid 
strong in recent months , and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent 
data suggest that growth of hou sehold spending and business fix ed 
investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter rate s.  On a 12-
month basis, both overall inflati on and inflation for items oth er than food and 
energy have continued to run below 2 percent.   Market-based measures of 
inflation compensation have increased in recent months but rema in low; survey-

Near-term risks to the econo mic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the 
Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.  
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the

1-1/4 to 1‐ 1/2 to 1-3/4  percent.  The stance of  monetary policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market condition s and a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen but does not 
yet appear to be overheating.   
o Over the past three months, payrolls have increased by an avera ge of 242,000 
per month, well above the pace estimated to be consistent with an unchanged 
unemployment rate if the labor force participation rate decline s in line with its 
estimated trend path.   
o The unemployment rate in February was 4.1 percent for the fifth  consecutive 
month, below all FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run  normal rate 
of unemployment in the December Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).   
o The labor force participation r ate jumped 0.3 percentage point to 63.0 percent 
in February.  While the staff pr ojects this increase to be reversed by year end, 
the labor force participation r ate is projected to continue to run above its 
estimated trend level.  
o Notwithstanding the strong pace of job gains, the low unemploym ent rate, and 
the increase in labor force part icipation, compensation data co ntinued to point 
to moderate wage growth.   
 Although inflation on a 12-month basis remains below the Commit tee’s 2 percent 
objective, the past several monthly readings have corroborated the view that inflation 
is moving up gradually.   
o Over the 12 months ending in January, the core PCE inflation ra te was 
1.5 percent, up about ¼ percentage p oint from its low last summ er.  In coming 
months, when the extraordinaril y low reading from last March dr ops out of 
the calculation of 12-month infla tion, core PCE inflation is qu ite likely to 
move up closer to 2 percent.  There after, with resource utiliza tion tightening 
substantially further  in the staff’s proj ection, core inflation  rises from 
1.9 percent this year to 2.2 percent in 2020. 
o Over the 12 months ending in Janua ry, total PCE inflation was 1 .7 percent.  
Total PCE inflation is project ed to climb to 1.8 percent this y ear and to reach 
2.1 percent in 2020.    
o On balance, longer-term survey-ba sed measures of inflation expe ctations and 
market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved litt le since

January.  Median 10-year inflation expectations for PCE prices in the Survey 
of Professional Forecasters he ld steady at 2.0 percent in the f irst quarter, the 
median of expectations over the next 5 to 10 years from the Mic higan survey 
was stable at 2.5 percent in Feb ruary, and the 3-year-ahead mea sure of median 
inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of 
Consumer Expectations edged up t o 2.9 percent in February, reve rsing the 
previous month’s decline and remaining within the narrow range observed 
since last summer.  The TIPS-base d measure of 5-to-10-year-forw ard inflation 
compensation changed little over th e latest intermeeting period but is up about 
15 basis points since the December FOMC meeting and 25 basis po ints since 
the November FOMC meeting.   
 Real GDP is now estimated to have  increased at an annual rate o f 2.9 percent in the 
fourth quarter of last year and is projected to increase 2.1 pe rcent in the first quarter 
of this year but then to pick up, bringing about a further wide ning of the gap between 
actual and potential ou tput.  Despite somewhat softer readings on consumer spending, 
fundamentals underpinning consumer demand remain sound; most importantly, the ongoing strengthening in the lab or market is continuing to bols ter income and 
confidence.  Moreover, the recently enacted tax bill should boo st spending.  The staff 
projects that the overall effect  of the tax cuts enacted in Dec ember and the spending 
increases authorized in February will be to raise the growth ra te of real GDP by 
½ percentage point in 2018, ¾ pe rcentage point in 2019, and ½ percentage point in 
2020. 
 Real GDP in the foreign economie s averaged a solid 2.7 percent in the fourth quarter.  
More recent foreign economic data  point to an upbeat start to t his year, and the staff 
sees foreign growth picki ng up to 3 percent this quarter. 
Policy Strategy 
 The rates of output growth in the  current quarter and the fourt h quarter of last year—
while lower than expected in the  January Tealbook—nonetheless i mply a further 
widening of the gap between actual and potential output.  This development, together 
with the projected p ick-up in the pace of growth in real activi ty after the current 
quarter, may have bolstered policymakers’ confidence that infla tion will reach 2 
percent this year.  That bei ng so, they may see it as appropria te to continue the 
gradual removal of policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent at t his meeting and to continue to signal that further 
Alternatives

gradual rate hikes are likely appropriate to achieve maximum em ployment and a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation.   
 With the recent fiscal policy ac tions expected to provide signi ficant stimulus to 
growth, financial conditions sti ll supportive of growth (notwit hstanding recent 
volatility in financial market s), and solid growth abroad, poli cymakers may wish to 
upgrade their assessment of the economic outlook by adding a sentence indicating 
that “The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.”     
 Nonetheless, with an increase i n the target range at this meeti ng and further gradual 
increases in the federal funds r ate projected, policymakers may  continue to perceive 
the near-term risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced .     
 As shown in the “Monetary Polic y Expectations and Uncertainty” box, financial 
market quotes indicate that market  participants are nearly certain that the Committee 
will raise the target range by 25 basis points at this meeting,  an assessment shared by 
respondents to the Desk’s latest  surveys of primary dealers and  market participants.  
Looking ahead, federal funds futur es quotes imply that the moda l outlook of market 
participants envisions a total  increase of about 75 basis point s by the end of this year.  
The median of the modal responses to the Desk’s surveys points to four 25-basis-
points rate hikes this year, but respondents see the likelihood of four hikes as only slightly higher than the probability of three.  In light of cur rent market expectations, a 
statement along the lines of Alte rnative B seems unlikely, by i tself, to generate an 
appreciable change in asset prices, though the indication that the outlook has 
strengthened could lead to some steepening of the expected path  for the federal funds 
rate. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the labor market is already appreci ably beyond full 
employment and that economic activ ity—which was already growing at a faster-than-
sustainable rate—will be further spurred by the recently enacte d tax cuts and 
spending legislation. 
o The unemployment rate was 4.1 perc ent in February, well below e ach FOMC 
participant’s estimate of its l onger-run normal level in the De cember SEP.   
o Despite four increases in the ta rget range for the federal fund s rate from 
December 2016 to January 2018, the average pace of payroll gain s in 2017

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Futures markets have almost fully priced in a 25‐ basis‐point increase in  the target 
range for the  federal funds  rate at the FOMC’s  upcoming  March meeting,  and the 
average odds assigned  to this outcome  by respondents  to the Desk’s surveys of 
primary dealers and market participants  are comparably  high.  Expectations  for 
the path of the federal funds  rate based  on market and survey measures  have 
also ticked up, on balance. 
Figure 1 shows the probability  distribution,  derived from  quotes on federal funds  
futures contracts, of  the total number of 25‐basis‐point rate increases  over the  
next three  FOMC meetings  (March, May, and June).  The probability  that there 
will be two rate hikes  has increased  by about 10 percentage points  over the  
intermeeting  period, to around  70 percent.   The probability  of only one rate  hike 
over these three meetings  has come down by a similar amount.  
Looking ahead to the end of 2018, the  probability  distribution for the  level of the 
federal funds  rate, based on options quotes and assuming  zero term premiums,  
has shifted only marginally  to the right (figure 2).  It continues  to suggest that 
investors  place the greatest odds on  the federal funds  rate falling  into the 2 to 2¼ 
percent range—consistent  with three  25‐basis‐point increases  in the target range  
in 2018.  Figure  3 shows the corresponding  average probability  distribution  from 
the Desk’s surveys; respondents  to those surveys see increased  odds of higher

the expected  path of the federal funds rate with adjustments  for term premiums 
as estimated  by a staff term structure  model (the  red line) reflects, in  part, the

nears, and possibly also the diminution  of downside  risks as interest rates  move 
further away from the lower bound.  Based  on the most recent observations,  the 
unadjusted  market‐implied measure,  the December  SEP median, and the Desk 
survey’s implied mean forecast  are consistent  with three 25‐ basis‐point rate 
increases  in 2018, while  the market measure  that adjus ts for term premiums and  
the Desk survey’s latest modal forecast  both reflect an expectation  of four hikes. 
Figure 5 shows market ‐implied measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate path 
beyond 2018.   The path derived from quotes on OIS and not adjuste d for term 
premiums (the  blue line) has shifted up modestly  over the  intermeeting  period, 
mostly in 2019 and 2020.  The staff’s  term structure  model attributes  much of this 
increase to higher  (less negative)  term premiums,  leaving the term‐premium ‐
adjusted path (the red line) only a touch higher. 
Expectations  for the path  of the federal funds  rate have likely  been buoyed,  in 
part, by the prospective  economic  effects of additional  government  spending  
resulting from the passage of  the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 2018.  In the March

deficit in coming years.  As shown by  the two sets  of bars to the left in figure 6, 
since the December  survey, the  median  projection  for the budget deficit  in the 
Survey of Primary Dealers, as a percentage  of GDP, has increased  by roughly 
½ percentage point for 2018 and  1¼ percentage  points for 2019.  The  deficit for 
2020 (not shown) is projected  to remain  at approximately  its 2019 level.  The  bars

respectively.  The median growth estimate for 2020  was little changed  at 1.8

and early 2018 significantly exc eeded the pace necessary to absorb new 
entrants (and reentrants) into t he labor force and to maintain a constant 
unemployment rate over the longe r run.  Moreover, the recent ac celeration in 
payrolls may be seen as a signal that, given accommodative fina ncial 
conditions, monetary policy will ne ed to tighten more than mark et participants 
currently anticipate if the Committee is to succeed in slowing economic 
growth to a sustainable pace. 
o The staff forecasts that, from 2018 through 2020, average payro ll gains will 
continue to run above their longer-run sustainable pace.  Accor dingly, the 
unemployment rate is projecte d to continue to decline, reaching  3.1 percent at 
the end of 2019 and moving sideways throughout 2020.  Such a lo w rate of 
unemployment has not been reach ed in the United States for more  than half a 
century.  
o Other indicators pointing to an a lready tight labor market incl ude an elevated 
rate of job openings, survey meas ures showing a high level of job availability, 
widespread reports of firms having difficulty hiring workers, and near-record-low initial claims for une mployment insurance.   
 Policymakers may project that inflation will soon move above th e Committee’s 
2 percent objective.  Twelve-m onth rates of total and core PCE inflation have been 
held down by an unusually large decline in the price of cell ph one services in March 
2017.  As this reading drops out of the 12-month calculation, i nflation should move 
closer to the target.  Beyond the near term, the staff projects that core PCE price 
inflation will move up to 2.2 percent and total PCE price infla tion to 2.1 percent, 
respectively, in 2020, conditional on a rising path for the fed eral funds rate.  
Policymakers may believe that more concerted upward pressures o n both wages and 
prices are likely to emerge following a prolonged period of lab or market tightness.  
 Despite the four increases in the target range for the federal funds rate implemented 
by the Committee between December 2016 and January 2018, financ ial conditions 
appear to remain highly supportive of growth.  The stock market  experienced 
considerable volatility and a decl ine in equity price indexes e arly in the intermeeting 
period, but those indexes have s ince mostly recovered their los ses.  Spreads on 
investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds over com parable-maturity 
Treasury securities widened mode rately but remained near the lo wer end of their 
historical ranges.

 Policymakers may judge that the economic outlook has strengthened in recent 
months. 
o Indicators of consumer and business sentiment—including as meas ured by the  
University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the ISM manufactur ing index, 
and the Philadelphia Fed and Empir e State future capital spendi ng indexes—
have been buoyant.   
o Foreign economic data released s ince the January FOMC meeting p oint to an 
upbeat start to this year, and t he staff sees foreign growth pi cking up to 3 
percent this quarter.  Despite vo latility in financial markets abroad, overall 
financial conditions continue to be supportive of foreign growt h.   
o Recent tax cuts and spending leg islation will provide significa nt stimulus to 
growth.  The staff projects that the level of real GDP will be about 3½ percent 
above potential GDP by the e nd of 2020, about ¼ percentage point higher 
than in the January Tealbook.  
Policy Strategy  
 Despite past rate increases and a s equence of FOMC statements n oting an expectation 
of further gradual hikes, emplo yment and economic activity cont inue to expand more 
rapidly than is sustainable i n the longer run.  Consequently, p olicymakers may be 
concerned that market particip ants expect too small a cumulativ e increase in the 
federal funds rate, which woul d in turn risk significant overheating, inflation well 
above target, and eventually a n eed to tighten policy abruptly.    
 Policymakers might be concerned that significant undershooting of the longer-run 
normal rate of unemployment, alongside accommodative financial conditions, could 
lead to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities.  For example, in addition to already elevated asset valuations risi ng further, policymakers may also  see the historically 
high levels of leverage in the nonf inancial corporate sector, a nd the accompanying 
danger that interest-expense rati os could rise rapidly if monet ary policy needed to be 
tightened quickly, as a vulnerability. 
 For all of the above reasons, po licymakers may opt not only to raise the target range 
of the federal funds rate t o 1½ to 1¾ percent but also to highl ight that the Committee 
anticipates tightening polic y enough to slow growth of output a nd employment to 
sustainable rates in coming years.

 A statement like Alternative C could surprise market participan ts, particularly if read 
as indicating an intention to rai se the federal funds rate enou gh to slow growth to a 
sustainable pace fairly soon.  If the public were to infer that  the current Committee 
has a less accommodative “reac tion function” than last year’s C ommittee, then 
medium- and longer-term real inter est rates would likely rise, as would the exchange 
value of the dollar, and equity pr ices and inflation compensati on would probably fall. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 On a 12-month basis, core infla tion has continued to run notably below 2 percent.  
Twelve-month core PCE inflati on including only market-based prices was 1.1 percent 
in January.  Policymakers may judge  that inflation this year ha s been held down, at 
least in part, by persistent factors.  
 One factor holding down both core and all-items inflation may b e low expected 
inflation.  Readings on market-based measures of inflation comp ensation remain 
substantially below where they w ere before the middle of 2014, and survey-based 
measures of longer-term inflation expectations a lso remain low by historical 
standards.  
 Moreover, the labor market may not yet have reached maximum sus tainable 
employment.  The unemployment ra te has declined about ¾ percentage point over the 
past year, and average job gains  have been solid; nonetheless, wages have shown 
little sign of accelerating.  The e mployment-to-population rati o for prime-age workers 
has been rising but still remains below its pre-recession level , suggesting scope for 
further labor market strengthe ning.  In addition, the labor for ce participation rate 
jumped 0.3 percentage point t o 63.0 percent in February.  The b ehavior of labor force 
participation rate over the past four years suggests that its t rend may well be higher 
than previously estimated. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may be concerned th at longer-term i nflation expect ations have declined 
materially in recent years and could drift down further if infl ation continues to run 
below 2 percent.  Policymakers ma y further judge that raising t he federal funds rate 
while inflation is below 2 percent runs the risk of creating the perception that the 
Committee sees its longer-run object ive as a ceiling rather than as a symmetric 
objective.

o In order to solidify the Committee’s commitment to its inflatio n objective and 
to prevent further erosion in i nflation expectations, policymak ers may favor a 
statement like Alternative A a nd the addition of the sentence “ A temporary 
period of inflation modestly above  2 percent would be consisten t with the 
Committee’s symmetric inflation ob jective and may be needed to ensure that 
longer-run inflation expectations  are consistent with that objective.”     
 Policymakers may view the current state of the financial system  as sound and see the 
potential for a buildup of risks t o financial stability as limi ted, partly reflecting a 
judgment that the banking syste m is well capitalized and that b road measures of 
leverage and credit growth r emain contained.  In addition, poli cymakers may see 
scope to address any emerging finan cial stability concerns thro ugh macroprudential 
policies and supervisory actions t hat target specific risks.   
 Despite the likely stimulative effects of the recently enacted changes in federal taxes 
and spending, other policies cou ld pose downsid e risk.  Policymakers may judge that 
their ability to react to downs ide outcomes is limited by proxi mity to the effective 
lower bound. 
 On the basis of these arguments , policymakers may want to commu nicate that an 
increase in the target range f or the federal funds rate is not warranted at this meeting 
and that future increases are unlikely until a sustained return  to the 2 percent inflation 
objective has been achieved.     
 Financial market quotes and the D esk’s latest surveys indicate that market 
participants view an increase in  the target range at the March meeting as a near 
certainty.  Thus, a statement al ong the lines of Alternative A would likely be regarded 
as a significant change in the Committee’s policy outlook and b ring down 
expectations of further rate hi kes.  If the public saw this sta tement as primarily 
reflecting policymakers’ resol ve to push inflation up to or abo ve 2 percent, then 
inflation compensation could ris e, real longer-term interest rates would probably fall 
somewhat, and equity prices might r ise.  Lower real rates and t he prospect of higher 
inflation likely would encourage  depreciation of the dollar.  C onversely, if investors 
read the statement as reflecti ng an unexpectedly downbeat asses sment of the 
economic outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation coul d fall.

rate, an implementation note th at indicates no change to its ad ministered rates—the 
interest rates on required and ex cess reserves, the offering ra te on overnight reverse 
repurchase agreements, and the pr imary credit rate—would be iss ued.  If the Committee 
decides to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate, a n implementation note that

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the baseline 
economic outlook presented in Teal book A.  Relative to the January Tealbook, the 
normalization of the size of the  balance sheet occurs one quart er later, and the higher 
interest rate paths in the latest staff economic forecast lead to a larger unrealized loss 
position of the SOMA portfolio.  Key features of these projecti ons are described below.  
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 20 17 will lead to the 
redemption of $36 billion of Treasury securities and $24 billio n of agency securities 
during the current quarter.  Over 2018 as a whole, holdings of Treasury and agency 
securities are projected to decline by about $230 billion and $ 140 billion, respectively.  
During this same period, about $200 billion of Treasury securit ies and about $60 billion 
of agency securities will be reinvested.1  The projections for agency securities are 
particularly uncertain because  unscheduled prepayments depend on a number of factors 
that are difficult to predict, i ncluding the realized path of m ortgage rates.   
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   The size of the balance sheet is 
projected to normalize in the  third quarter of 2021, about one month later than in the 
January Tealbook (see the exhibit titled “Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” 
and the table that follows the exhibit).2  The revision in the timing of normalization 
reflects higher MBS holdings due to lower prepayments, as well as a slower pace of 
                                                 
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury se curities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each q uarter.  In contrast,  under the staff’s c urrent baseline forecast of rising longer-term 
interest rates, the maximum $20 billion cap on monthly redempti ons of agency securities is not projected to 
bind. 
2 Many factors will influence th e size at which the balance shee t will be normalized, including 
banks’ post-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally s peaking, the size of the balance sheet is 
considered to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of  Treasury securities is  required in order to 
maintain the desired longer-run level of reserve balances and accommodate the expansion of other key  
non-reserve liability items.

growth in Federal Reserve notes i n the near term, two factors w hich imply higher reserve 
balances of depository institutions throughout the projection p eriod.3 
From the start of the balance sheet normalization program in Oc tober 2017 to its 
conclusion in 2021, the Federal Res erve’s securities holdings a re projected to decline by 
about $1.3 trillion, with holdings of  Treasury and agency securities shrinking by about 
$800 billion and $475 billion, respe ctively.  At the time of no rmalization: 
Reserve balances reach the assumed longer-run level of $500 bil lion;4
Total assets are projected t o stand at roughly $3 trillion, wit h the SOMA portfolio
consisting of about $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities and $1 .3 trillion in MBS.
Once these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the siz e of the balance
sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GD P, compared with a peak 
of about 25 percent in late 2014 and a pre-crisis average of ab out 6 percent.  After the 
size of the balance sheet is norma lized, SOMA holdings will rise, keeping pace with the 
projected increases in Federal R eserve liabilities including Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation, the Treasury Genera l Account (TGA), and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  
However,  when expressed as a share of nomi nal GDP, Federal Reserve asset s and 
liabilities are projected to edge down, as their pace of expans ion is projected to be 
slightly slower than tha t of current-dollar GDP.  
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to about $55 billion this year from $80 billion in 2017 .5  This decline reflects both 
the projected increases in the i nterest rate paid on reserve balances associated with future 
increases in the target range f or the federal funds rate (see t he “Income Projections” 
3 Other factors contributing to this outcome are a slight decrea se in capital as a result of the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, a s well as a slight decrease in projected foreign rep o pool balances.  
4 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation are assumed to incr ease at an average annual pace o f about 6 percent through 2020 and at the 
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated 
financial market utilities remain a t their February 2018 levels  of about $232 billion and $70 billion, 
respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assu med to maintain a value of $100 billion until 
the level of reserve balances r eaches $1 trillion , at which poi nt take-up declines to zero over the course of 
one year.

 exhibit), and the $2.5 billion reduction in surplus.6  Total interest expense is projected to 
rise to about $51 billion this year, w hile interest income from  SOMA holdings is 
expected to decline slightl y to $110 billion.  As the target range for the federal funds rate 
moves up and the size of the SOM A portfolio decreases, remittan ces are expected to 
bottom out at about $31 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittanc es begin to increase, 
particularly once the size of t he balance sheet is normalized a nd higher-yielding Treasury 
securities are being added to the SOMA portfolio. 
Projected remittances over the next few years are similar to th e January Tealbook 
baseline.  Subsequently, projec ted remittances are higher, larg ely due to the upward 
revision to the projection of the interest rates the SOMA will receive on Treasury 
securities purchase d after normalization.  As shown in the bott om left panel of the 
“Income Projections” exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal 
GDP over the projection period, s lightly higher than the pre-cr isis average. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that th e SOMA portfolio was in a 
net unrealized loss position of  about $40 billion at the end of  February.  With longer-term 
rates expected to continue to ris e over the next several years, the unrealized loss position 
is expected to reach nearly $300 billion in 2020:Q1.  Of this a mount, $120 billion is 
attributable to Treasury securi ties and $180 billion to agency MBS.  The unrealized loss 
position subsequently narrows, in part because the value of securities acquired under the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase programs returns t o par as those securities 
approach maturity.  Relative t o the January Tealbook baseline, the net unrealized position 
is projected to be, on average, a bout $40 billion more negative  along the entire projection 
horizon, with this revision due to hi gher trajectories of medium- and longer-term interest 
rates.   
                                                 
6 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate for the duration of the projection, and that the int erest rate paid on excess reserve balances and 
the offering rate on overnight RRPs will be set at the top and bottom of the range, respectively.

 Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by 86 basis points; this effect is projected to fade 
gradually over time.7  This projection is little chan ged from the previous Tealbook.  
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  The weighted-
average duration of tha t portfolio is projec ted to increase throughout the process of 
balance sheet normalization, as th e pace of redemptions picks u p and longer-duration 
securities become a larger share of the portfolio.  
After normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet in 2021, t he duration of the 
SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Federal Reserve resumes 
purchases of Treasury securitie s.  The initial sharp decline in duration results from the 
staff’s assumption that these purchases will be limited to Trea sury bills until they account 
for one-third of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury securities port folio, close to the pre-crisis 
composition (currently the SOMA portfolio contains no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, 
purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum 
(see the bottom panel  of the exhibit).   
                                                 
7 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007-2008.  In 
particular, in the benchmark counterfactual balance sheet proje ction, the staff assumes a longer-run level of 
reserves of $100 billion and a constant, minimal TGA level, con sistent with the pre-crisis minimum level of 
excess reserve balances and the T reasury’s pre-crisis cash mana gement policy.
