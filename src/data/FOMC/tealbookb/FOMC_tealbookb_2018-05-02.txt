Information received since the Committee met in March indicates  that the 
economy is evolving broadly in line with expectations.  On bala nce, the available 
indicators suggest that the labor market continued to strengthe n in the first quarter.  The 
staff estimates that the 12-m onth change in headline and core P CE prices stepped up to 
2.1 and 1.9 percent, respectively, i n March, a touch higher than was anticipated at the 
March meeting.  The softness in r eal GDP growth in the first quarter appears to have 
been largely transitory, and the staff continues to project abo ve-trend growth and high 
levels of resource utiliza tion over the medium term.1 
There are three key questions for  the Committee at this meeting .  The first is 
whether the available informati on warrants raising the target range for the federal funds 
rate.  The second is whether the economic outlook and associate d risks indicate that the 
federal funds rate path suggested by recent FOMC communications remains appropriate.  
The third question is whether, in light of the evolution of the economic outlook and 
balance of risks over the past f ew quarters, some parts of the FOMC statement need to be 
updated to more clearly express the Committee’s expectations an d intentions.  With these 
issues in mind, three alternativ e draft statements are proposed  below. 
Alternative B characterizes the  labor market and spending data similarly to the 
March statement and notes that bot h total and core measures of 12-month inflation have 
moved close to 2 percent.  It mainta ins the current target rang e for the federal funds rate 
and updates the inflation outlook i n light of the anticipated i ncrease in both measures.  In 
addition, consistent with the update to the inflation language as well as the March 
Summary of Economic Projections  (SEP), in which no participant saw risks to the 
outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, the balance of  risks statement has been 
simplified to state: “Risks to the economic outlook appear roug hly balanced.” 
Alternative A is motivated by the view that, although headline inflation has 
recently moved close to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, th e level of longer-run 
inflation expectations might s till be too low.  It articulates an outlook in which inflation 
modestly exceeds 2 percent for a time, conditioned on “appropri ate monetary policy 
1 The BEA’s first estimate of GDP  for 2018:Q1 will be released on April 27.  PCE inflation data 
for March will be ava ilable on April 30; the  staff’s current es timate is based on CPI and PPI data through 
March.

 accommodation” rather than on further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  This 
alternative maintains the curren t target range for the federal funds rate and removes the 
current forward guidance language  on the grounds that further rate hikes may not be 
necessary and that a period of i nflation modestly above 2 perce nt would be helpful in 
getting longer-run inflation expectations up to a level consist ent with sustained 2 percent 
inflation over the medium run. 
Alternative C can be viewed in two different ways.  By expressing the view that 
economic conditions and the outl ook warrant an immediate hike in the federal funds rate, 
Alternative C can be seen as the less accommodative counterpart  to Alternative B.  If the 
Committee were to increase the fe deral funds rate at this meeting, that step would likely 
be taken as a signal that the C ommittee will pu rsue a higher pa th for the federal funds 
rate than market participants  had been expecting.  Alternativel y, this draft statement 
could serve as a potential template for the statement that the Committee might release in 
June if the economy continues t o develop roughly as expected.  Many FOMC participants 
have said they see a need to upda te parts of the policy statement in light of the evolving 
state of the economy and stance of monetary policy, and Alterna tive C has been written 
with this in mind.  To facilita te consideration of Alternative C as a possible template for 
June, this document includes a  brief discussion of how the lang uage in Alternative C 
might be viewed if the Committee ad opts Alternative B at the Ma y meeting and if the 
economy subsequently evolves roug hly as expected (see pages 16 and 17). 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C:  
 Each alternative removes the st atement that “the economic outlo ok has strengthened 
in recent months.”  This text  reflected an improved outlook at the March meeting; 
removing it indicates that the  outlook has not strengthened fur ther since March. 
 The three alternatives are near ly identical in their assessment of the strength of 
incoming real-side data, and the y all note that inflation has “ moved close to 2 
percent,” while Alternative A a dds that this has occurred “rece ntly.”  The alternatives 
differ slightly with regard t o inflation expectations: 
o Alternative C combines both market-based measures of inflation 
compensation and survey-based measures of inflation expectation s into the 
broader category “indicators of  longer-term inflation expectati ons.”  These 
indicators are little change d, on balance, over the intermeetin g period.

 o Alternatives A and B describe these two measures separately, no ting that 
measures of inflation co mpensation remain low. 
 Although the three statements pr oject roughly similar outcomes for economic activity 
and the labor market, they differ in their descriptions of the inflation outlook and the 
monetary policy upon which the outlook is conditioned: 
o Alternative B states that in flation, having moved close to 2 pe rcent, is 
expected to “run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec tive” and 
continues to condition the outlook on  “further gradual adjustments in stance of 
monetary policy.”  
o Alternative C sim ilarly modifies the  inflation outlook, but sta tes the 
Committee’s expectation that “further gradual increases in the target range for 
the federal funds rate will be c onsistent with sustained expans ion of economic 
activity and employment and with inflation near the Committee’s  symmetric 2 
percent objective over the medium term.”  In addition, Alternat ive C removes 
from paragraph 4 the language abou t carefully monitoring actual and expected 
inflation.  Dropping this language m ay be taken as a signal that the Committee 
currently see the risks to infl ation as more evenly balanced. 
o Alternative A projects inflation to modestly exceed 2 percent f or a time and 
then run near the Committee’s obj ective, and notes that “this inflation 
outcome should help ensure that l onger-term inflation expectati ons rise to a 
level consistent with the Committee’s symmetric objective for 2  percent 
inflation.”  The outlook under Alternative A is conditioned on “appropriate 
monetary policy accommodation” rat her than further gradual incr eases in the 
federal funds rate.   
 Following the update to the in flation outlook under both altern atives, the balance of 
risks in Alternatives  B and C is changed to state that “risks t o the economic outlook 
appear roughly balanced.”  The ba lance of risks given in Alternative A is unchanged 
from the March statement, retai ning the statement that the Comm ittee is monitoring 
inflation developments closely. 
 With respect to the c urrent policy decision: 
o Alternatives A and B leave the target range unchanged at 1½ to 1¾ percent. 
o Alternative C raises the tar get range to 1¾ t o 2 percent but co ntinues to note 
that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.

  With respect to the forward guidance language: 
o Alternative B retains the forw ard guidance language at the end of paragraph 4; 
Alternatives A a nd C delete it.   
o In light of the changes in para graphs 2 and 3 of Alternative A,  dropping the 
final two sentences from paragr aph 4 of Alternative A likely wo uld be read as 
a signal that the Committee is i n no hurry to rais e the federal  funds rate 
further.   
o In contrast, adopting Alternative C at this meeting likely woul d be taken as a 
signal that the Committee now sees  a need to raise the federal funds rate 
somewhat more rapidly than previously anticipated—though still gradually, 
primarily because the timing of th e rate increase would come as  a surprise.  
Alternatively, if adopted in June, a statement along the lines of Alternative C 
would likely not change market  perceptions of the potential pac e of rate hikes.  
As the Committee’s expectation f or further gradual rate increas es has been 
moved into paragraph 2, dropping the same thought from paragrap h 4 should 
not, by itself, alter th e expected path for policy.  However, e liminating the 
clause that the federal funds r ate is expected to remain below its longer-run 
level could increase ex pectations that the federal funds rate m ay move to, or 
possibly above, its estimate d longer-run value in the not too d istant future.

 MARCH 2018  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in January 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been strong in recent 
months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent data suggest that 
growth rates of household spendi ng and business fixed investmen t have 
moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.  On a 12-m onth basis, both 
overall inflation and inflati on for items other than food and e nergy have continued 
to run below 2 percent.  Market-bas ed measures of inflation com pensation have 
increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measure s of longer-term 
inflation expectations are  little changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stabilit y.  The economic outlook has stren gthened in recent 
months.  The Committee expects th at, with further gradual adjustments in the 
stance of monetary policy, economic  activity will expand at a m oderate pace in 
the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.   Inflation on a 
12-month basis is expected to m ove up in coming months and to s tabilize around 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near -term risks to 
the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee  is monitoring 
inflation developments closely. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to rai se the target range for the federal fun ds rate to 1-1/2 to 
1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommoda tive, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation. 
 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, 
including measures of labor marke t conditions, indicators of in flation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and r eadings on financial and inter national 
developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .  The Committee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant further 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the  federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data.

 THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Available data indicate that the  labor market has continued to strengthen on balance.  
Although the March employment report indicated fewer job gains than the staff had 
expected, and the unemployment ra te held at 4.1 percent for the sixth consecutive 
month, payrolls nevertheless in creased an average of about 200,000 per month in the 
first quarter.  The current rat e of job growth is well above th e pace consistent with an 
unchanged unemployment rate if th e labor force pa rticipation ra te were declining in 
line with its estimated trend.  H owever, the participation rate  has held roughly steady 
for the past several years and is projected to continue to do s o over the next few years.  
The wage data that have arrived s ince the March meeting remain consistent with the 
picture of moderate wage gains overall.2 
 Recent data show that inflati on has moved close to the Committe e’s 2 percent goal.  
The staff projects that infla tion will remain near 2 percent in  the medium term. 
o Over the 12 months ending in March , the estimated core PCE inflation rate was 
1.9 percent while total PCE inf lation was 2.1 percent.  Both of  these estimates are 
slightly above the staff’s projec tion in March and reflect the extraordinarily low 
reading from March of last year  dropping out of the calculation . 
o The staff projection of core PC E inflation on a 12-month basis rises to 2.0 percent 
in May and averages 2.1 percent in the third quarter, while the  projection for total 
PCE inflation on a 12-month basis is 2.5 percent at the end of the second quarter 
and 2.2 percent at the conclusi on of the third quarter, slowing to about 2 percent 
afterward as the effects of recent energy price increases wane.  
o The staff projects that total and core PCE inflation will remai n close to 2 percent 
through 2020.   
o Both market- and survey-based ind icators of longer-term inflation expectations 
have moved little, on balance, s ince the March Tealbook, and ar e consistent with 
the view that these expe ctations remain stable. 
 Real GDP growth is projected t o average 2¼ percent at an annual  rate over the first 
half of the year, a little less th an projected in the March Tea lbook but still higher than 
its trend pace.  The staff estimates that the gap between actual and potential output 
                                                            
2 ECI data through March will be released on April 27.  
Alternatives

 will continue to widen over the medium term, with real GDP esti mated to reach a 
level of around 3¼ percent above i ts potential value by the end  of 2020. 
 The staff estimates that for eign real GDP growth was 3 percent in the first quarter, a 
touch higher than in the sec ond half of 2017, and it is project ed to stay close to this 
pace for 2018 before declining slightly toward its potential ra te over the medium 
term.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may see economic conditions as continuing to evolv e about in line with 
the Committee’s expectations.  Given that monetary policy opera tes with a lag, and 
following two policy rate increases  in the past three meetings,  policymakers may see 
the language in Alternative B as signaling that the strength in  the economy continues 
to call for further gradual in creases in the target range but n ot for an adjustment to the 
stance of monetary policy at the May meeting. 
o A gradual removal of monetar y policy accommodation may continue to be 
seen as appropriate to balance the risk of the labor market bec oming unduly 
overheated against the risk of i nflation failing to return to 2  percent on a 
sustained basis.  
 Policymakers may see recent inflation developments as consisten t with the view that 
inflation expectations  are well anchored and that the idiosyncr atic factors that held 
down inflation last year were i ndeed transitory.  If so, they m ay wish to update the 
outlook for inflation by stating that inflation will “run near the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent objective  over the medium term.”  
 With above-trend growth, positive impetus from fiscal policy, solid growth abroad, 
continued strengthening of the l abor market, and inflation clos e to their objective, 
policymakers may perceive that—conditional on further gradual i ncreases in the 
federal funds rate—the risks to  the outlook for both employment  and inflation are 
roughly balanced.  If so, they may wish to remove the emphasis on monitoring 
inflation from their discussi on of the balance of risks.   
 As shown in the “Monetary Polic y Expectations and Uncertainty” box, financial 
market quotes indicate that marke t participants regard the odds  of a rate hike at the 
upcoming meeting as negligible  but see a high probability that the federal funds rate 
will be raised at the June mee ting.  Respondents to the Desk’s latest surveys of 
primary dealers and market participants have broadly similar vi ews.  In light of

Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Over the intermeeting  period, market participants  became increasingly  confident  
that the Committee will keep  the target  range for the  federal funds  rate 
unchanged  at the upcoming  FOMC meeting and announce  a 25‐ basis‐point rate 
increase at the June  meeting.   As shown in  figure 1, a straight read  of quotes on 
federal funds  futures contracts  suggests  that the probability  attached  to a rate 
hike at the June  meeting has risen from around 75 percent immediately  following  
the March meeting  to about 90 percent.   On average,  respondents  to the Desk’s 
May surveys also assigned  virtually no odds to a rate hike  at the May meeting and 
high odds to a June  rate increase.    
The probability  distribution  for the level  of the federal funds rate at the end of 
2018, based  on options quotes and assuming  zero term premiums,  has shifted 
somewhat  to the right (figure 2).  It continues  to suggest  that investors  place the 
highest odds on  the federal funds rate being  in the 2 to 2¼ percent or the 2¼ to 
2½ percent range at year ‐end.  Figure  3 shows the corresponding  average 
probability  distribution  from the Desk’s surveys; respondents  to those surveys 
place about the  same probability  on three additional  25‐basis‐point rate increases  
this year as on two such hi kes.   
Figure 4 shows how different measures  of federal funds  rate expectations  for the 
end of 2018 have  evolved since June  2016.  The figure  displays market‐based  
metrics (with and  without term premium  adjustments)  derived from  quotes on 
overnight index  swap (OIS) contracts,  the median projection  from FOMC 
participants’  Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP) through March 2018, and  
the median of  respondents’  modal forecasts  in the Desk’s surveys as well as the 
average of those respondents’  implied mean forecasts.  Of note,  the latter two 
forecasts  approximately  correspond  to the mode and mean, respectively, of  the 
distribution  shown in  figure 3.  The SEP  median (the  golden squares)  has been 
stable at 2 to 2¼ percent from early 2017 through March of this year, while the 
market‐based measures  (the red and blue lines) and the Desk survey implied 
mean and  modal forecasts  (the grey and black dots, respectively)  have inched up 
steadily.  Although  the forecasts  implied by the May Desk surveys wer e little 
changed relative to the March surveys,  the market‐based measures  ticked up a 
little further  over the intermeeting  period.  The further narrowing  of the gap 
between the  forward rates implied by OIS quotes (the blue line) and  the 
expected  path of the federal funds rate with adjustments  for term premiums as  
estimated  by a staff term structure  model (the  red line) reflects, in  part, negative  
term premiums moving  toward zero as the end of the projection  period nears.  
The diminution  of downside  risks as interest rates move further away from the 
lower bound  may also be a factor.  Based on the  most recent observations, the 
unadjusted  market‐implied measure,  the March SEP  median, and the Desk  
survey’s implied mean forecast  are consistent  with two additional  25‐basis‐point 
rate increases  in 2018, whil e the market measure that adjusts for term premiums

 and the Desk survey’s latest modal forecast both imply an expectation  of three 
more such hikes.  
Figure 5 shows market ‐implied measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate path 
beyond 2018.   The path derived from quotes on OIS and not adjusted  for term 
premiums (the  blue line) shifted  up modestly  over the intermeeting  period.  The 
staff’s term structure  mod el attributes  the near‐term increase about  equally to a 
higher term‐premium ‐adjusted path (the solid red line) and  to higher  (less 
negative) term  premiums.   Beyond 2020, the model attributes  the increases  
predominantly  to less negative  term premiums.  
The May Desk surveys asked respondents  for their projections  for the most likely 
spread between the in terest on excess reserves  (IOER) rate and the effective 
federal funds  rate (EFFR),  conditional  on a range of  possible levels of reserve 
balances.   Figure 6 shows that respondents  expect the IOER–EFFR  spread to 
narrow as reserve balances  decline, with the median projected  spread falling to 
zero when reserve  balances  reach $500 billion.   Respondents  were also asked to 
project the level  of the IOER–EFFR  spread over time.   The median of  
respondents’  modal projections  for this spread (not shown) was 5 basis points at 
the end of 2018, 4 basis points in mid‐ 2019, and 2 basis points at the  end of 2019.1  
Figure 6 indicates  that the median respondent  projects the IOER–EFFR  spread to 
reach 2 basis points when reserve  balances  have declined  to $1 trillion, which 
according  to the Tealbook  baseline projection  will be the case in early 2020 (see

factors in influencing  the projected  change in the IOER–EFFR  spread between  now and the end

 current market expectations, a statement along the lines of Alt ernative B seems 
unlikely, by itself, to generate a n appreciable change in asset prices.  
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the la bor market is operating appre ciably beyond full 
employment and that economic ac tivity—which was already expandi ng at a faster-
than-sustainable rate—will co ntinue to be spurred by the tax cu ts and spending 
legislation enacted over th e last two quarters. 
o The unemployment rate remains below each FOMC participant’s estimate of 
its longer-run normal level and the staff projects it will decl ine further.  Other 
indicators also point to an alrea dy tight labor market—includin g a near-record 
high job openings rate in Februar y, continued widespread reports of firms 
having difficulty hiring workers, and near-record-low initial c laims for 
unemployment insurance.   
 Policymakers may believe that more concerted upward pressure on  both wages and 
prices is likely to emerge if the economy undergoes a prolonged  period of significant 
labor market tightness.  If so, they may project that inflation  will soon move 
persistently above the Committee’s 2 percent objective.   
 Despite six increases in the ta rget range for t he federal funds rate between December 
2015 and March 2018 and some recent financial market volatility , financial 
conditions have eased on net since the Committee first raised t he target range for the 
federal funds rate.  On net, broad equity price indexes have in creased roughly 30 
percent and spreads of investm ent- and speculative grade corpor ate bonds to 
equivalent maturity Treasury s ecurities have d eclined around 80  and 200 basis points, 
respectively, since liftoff.   
o Risk spreads on speculative grade  debt narrowed even as use of leverage by 
speculative grade and unrated firms has increased, on balance, over the past 
several years.  
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that a some what faster removal of policy  accommodation 
than market participants curre ntly expect will be needed to avo id severe overheating 
and an eventual need to tighte n policy abruptly.  An increase i n the target range for

 the federal funds rate at the May meeting would signal the Comm ittee’s intention to 
pursue a steeper path for the pol icy rate than is currently exp ected.  
o Policymakers may be concerned th at above-trend economic growth and an 
already-strong labor market that  continues to tighten could soo n result in more 
notable upward pressures on inflation.   
o They may also judge that a somewh at faster pace of rate hikes is needed to 
prevent the unemployment rate f rom declining significantly furt her below its 
normal longer-run value; such a further decline could be seen a s making the 
challenge of engineering a soft landing in the labor market as inflation picks 
up increasingly difficult.  
o Additionally, amid elevated asset  valuations and an increased u se of debt by 
nonfinancial corporations, policymakers may see a somewhat faster pace of 
rate increases as needed to a void a significant buildup of imba lances in 
financial markets.   
 For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to rai se the target  range of the federal 
funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent.   
 Policymakers might also want to update the statement along the lines of Alternative C 
so that it reflects more clearly  the Committee’s current expect ations for inflation and 
the federal funds rate. 
o The Committee may choose to remove  the language about carefully  
monitoring actual and expected i nflation from paragraph 4.  Dro pping this 
language may be taken as a signal that the Committee currently see the risks 
to inflation as more evenly balanced.   
o In light of the expected path for the policy rate, the Committe e may want to 
delete the statement that “the  federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are exp ected to prevail in the longer run” and to 
conclude with a simpler stateme nt of data dependency regarding the timing 
and size of future adjustme nts to the target range.   
 Federal funds futures quotes and the Desk’s latest surveys indicate that market 
participants anticipate no change  in the target range at the Ma y meeting.  
Consequently, adopting Alternativ e C likely would surprise mark et participants 
considerably.   
Alternatives

 o Market participants might well read such a statement, if issued in May when 
no rate hike is expected, as indicating the Committee’s intenti on to raise the 
federal funds rate more rapidly  than previously expected.  Medi um- and 
longer-term real interest rates would likely rise, as would the  exchange value 
of the dollar; equity prices and i nflation compensation would probably fall. 
THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 On a 12-month basis, core PCE in flation is estimated to have mo ved to 1.9 percent in 
March, just below the 2 percen t objective.  However, the staff’ s estimate of 12-month 
core PCE inflation including only m arket-based prices for March  is only 1.6 percent 
even after the extraordinaril y low reading from last March drop ped out of the 
calculation.  Policymakers may judge that inflation will contin ue to be held down by 
persistent factors.  
 One factor holding down both core and total inflation may be lo w expected inflation.  
Readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation remain substantially 
below where they were before the middle of 2014, and some survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expecta tions are still low by historic al standards.  
 Moreover, the labor market may not yet have reached maximum sus tainable 
employment and may have further r oom for improvement.  While jo b gains have been 
solid, the unemployment rate ha s been unchanged over the past six months and wages 
have shown little sign of accelera ting.  The employment-to-popu lation ratio for 
prime-age workers has been ris ing but still remains below its p re-recession level, 
suggesting scope for further lab or market strengthening.  In ad dition, the behavior of 
the labor force participation r ate over the past four years sug gests that its trend may 
not be declining as fast as previously estimated. 
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may be concerned th at longer-term i nflation expect ations have declined 
materially in recent years and could drift down further if infl ation continues to run 
below 2 percent.  Policymakers ma y further judge that removing the statement’s 
emphasis on monitoring inflati on as soon as the rate nears 2 pe rcent runs the risk of 
creating the perception that the Committee sees its longer-run objective as a ceiling 
rather than as a symmetric objective.  
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

 o Against that background, policymak ers may favor Alternative A in order to 
underscore the Committee’s comm itment to its inflation objectiv e and to 
ensure that longer term inflati on expectations are anchored at a level close to 
the Committee’s 2 percent objective.  In addition, policymakers  may judge 
that the past decade’s experience of low inflation reduces the likelihood that 
inflation expectations will r ise significan tly above 2 percent.    
 Policymakers may view the current state of the financial system  as sound, the 
potential for a buildup of risks t o financial stability as limi ted, and may judge that 
there is scope to address any emerging financial stability conc erns through 
macroprudential policies and superv isory actions that target sp ecific risks.   
 Despite the likely stimulative e ffects of the changes in federal taxes and spending 
enacted over the past two quarter s, other policies—particularly  trade policies—pose 
downside risks.  Policymakers may judge that their ability to react to downside 
outcomes remains limited by proximity of the federal funds rate  to the effective lower 
bound. 
 While financial market quotes and the Desk’s latest surveys ind icate that market 
participants anticipate no change  in the target range at the Ma y meeting, they view an 
increase at the June meeting as highly likely.  Thus, a statement along the lines of 
Alternative A would likely be reg arded as an important change in the Committee’s 
policy outlook and reduce expectati ons of further rate hikes.  If the public saw this 
statement as primarily reflecti ng policymakers’ resolve to push  inflation above 2 
percent for a time, then inflati on compensation could rise, rea l longer-term interest 
rates would probably fall somewhat, and equity prices might ris e.  Lower real rates 
and the prospect of higher infla tion likely would lead to depre ciation of the dollar.  
Conversely, if investors read the  statement as reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat 
assessment of the economic ou tlook, equity prices and inflation  compensation could 
fall.

 ILLUSTRATIVE DRAFT OF A POTENTIAL STATEMENT FOR JUNE 2018   
As noted above, Alternative C has been written with the aim of looking forward 
to how the FOMC statement might a ppear in June.  The text below  shows Alternative C 
in terms of changes from the cur rent Alternative B.  Here strik ethrough shows deletions 
from, and underlined bold blue text shows additions to, Alternative B for the May 
meeting.  While the description of incoming data is omitted fro m paragraph 1 for 
simplicity, a key assumption is th at, between the May and June meetings, the economy 
evolves roughly in line with t he Committee’s expectations. 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in March 
May  indicates that . . . 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that,  with further gradual 
adjustments in the sta nce of monetary policy, increases in the target range for 
the federal funds rate will be con sistent with sustained expans ion of  economic 
activity and employment  will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and 
labor market conditions will remain strong. and with  inflation on a 12-month 
basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 perce nt objective over 
the medium term.  Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to m aintain raise  the target range for the  federal funds rate at 
1-1/2 to 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains 
accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market condition s and a 
sustained return to 2 percent inflation. 
 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to its object ives of maximum employment objective  and its 
symmetric  2 percent inflation goal.  This assessment will take into account a 
wide range of information, including measures of labor market c onditions, 
indicators of inflation pressure s and inflation expectations, and readings on 
financial and international developments.  The C ommittee will c arefully monitor 
actual and expected inflation develo pments relative to its symm etric inflation 
goal.  The Committee expects that  economic conditions will evol ve in a manner 
that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal fund s rate; the federal 
funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels tha t are expected to 
prevail in the longer run.  Howev er, the actual path of the federal funds rate will 
depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

 As shown above, the principal changes from Alternative B in May  would be: 
 Raising the target range for  the federal funds rate. 
 Eliminating the forward guidan ce language in paragraph 4; this language is becoming 
more problematic as the federal funds rate approaches its longe r-run normal level. 
 Also in paragraph 4, removing the sentence on “carefully monito ring actual and 
expected inflation developments r elative to its s ymmetric infla tion goal.”  To guard 
against this deletion being int erpreted as declaring victory on the inflation objective, 
the first sentence of the parag raph has been modified to emphas ize the symmetric 
inflation goal.   
 Being more concrete about the Committee’s monetary policy expec tations in 
paragraph 2 by replacing  “…further gradual adjustments in the s tance of monetary 
policy…” with “…further gradual in creases in the target range f or the federal funds 
rate…”  
These changes reflect an update  of the monetary policy expectat ions and forward 
guidance portions of the statement.  The language changes in the second paragraph are 
intended to increase clarity a nd transparency but not to signal  a change in the 
Committee’s views about the ec onomic outlook or about the polic y path that is likely to 
prove appropriate if the economy e volves largely as expected.  The Committee may soon 
judge that revisions of this so rt are justified by how the econ omic outlook has evolved 
over the period since elements of the present statement languag e were introduced.  The 
changes shown here are intended as a starting point for the Com mittee’s discussion of 
how best to update its postmeeting statement.

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below.  
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 20 17 will lead to the 
redemption of $54 billion of Treasury securities and $36 billio n of agency securities 
during the second quarter.  Over 20 18 as a whole, redemptions o f Treasury and agency 
securities are projected to be $229 billion and $146 billion, r espectively.  During this 
same period, about $200 billion of T reasury securities and about $65 billion of agency 
securities will be reinvested.1  The projections for agency s ecurities are subject to 
considerable uncertainty because unscheduled prepayments depend  on several factors 
that are difficult to predict, i ncluding the realized path of m ortgage rates.  (See the box 
“MBS Reinvestment Uncertainty” for additional discussion of MBS prepayments.) 
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   Based on the baseline economic 
outlook in the April Tealbook, the size of the balance sheet is projected to normalize in 
the third quarter of 2021, unchanged from the March Tealbook (s ee the exhibit titled 
“Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).2   
From the start of the balance sheet normalization program in Oc tober 2017 to its 
projected conclusion in 2021, the  Federal Reserve’s securities holdings are predicted to 
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury se curities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each q uarter.  In contrast,  under the staff’s c urrent baseline forecast of rising longer-term 
interest rates, the maximum $20 billion cap on monthly redempti ons of agency securities is not projected to 
bind. 
2 Many factors will influence th e size of the balance sheet upon  normalization, including banks’ 
post-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally speaking , the size of the balance  sheet is considered 
to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury s ecurities is required to maintain the 
desired longer-run level of rese rve balances and accommodate th e expansion of other key non-reserve 
liability items.

 MBS Reinvestment  Uncertainty  
In the staff’s baseline Tealbook  projection,  reinvestments  of agency debt and agency 
MBS cease in August of this year as principal payments  fall below the monthly 
redemption  cap set by the FOMC.  However,  the actual path of prepayments  is subject

our projections  of MBS principal payments  and thus the date  at which the FOMC’s cap 
on redemptions  may cease to bind.1  
 
Figure 1 presents various projected  paths for the  10‐year Treasury yield, a key variable 
affecting  mortgage  rates and hence MBS  prepayments.   The April Tealbook  baseline 
path and the March  SEP‐consistent  path are represented  by the solid black and green 
lines,  respectively.2  Relative to the  Tealbook  baseline, the SEP‐consistent  path is, on 
average, about 70 basis points lower  through the end of 2022.  The dashed black and 
green lines  denote alternative  paths for the  10‐year Treasury yield that result from a 
permanent negative  shock of 100 basis points, starting in 2018:Q3, applied to the 
interest rate  paths in the original scenarios.3  The corresponding  paths for the  primary 
                                                 
1 Our projections  abstract  from prepayment  model uncertainty—that  is, the fact that models 
typically overestimate  or underestimate  realized prepayments  even after conditioning  on actual 
interest  rate paths. 
2 We project  SEP‐consistent  interest rate paths  using the March 2018 Summary  of Economic  
Projections  and the staff’s FRB/US model.  To construct  a baseline projection  consistent  with median 
SEP responses  for the FRB/US model, the staff interpolated  annual SEP information  to a quarterly  
frequency  subject  to a restriction  that values do not fall below their March 2018  levels.  Beyond 2020 
(the final year reported  in the March 2018 SEP),  the economy  is assumed  to transition  to the longer‐
run values in a smooth and monotonic  way.  The 10‐year Treasury yield is based on the SEP‐
consistent  federal funds  rate path using the expectations  hypothesis.   We also project  an SEP‐
consistent  path for nominal GDP as it is a necessary  input for producing  our model‐based forecasts 
of prepayments.  
3 The set of interest  rates to which the shock is applied includes the federal funds rate, the 
primary mortgage  rate, and the 5‐, 10‐, and 30‐year Treasury yields.

 mortgage  rate  lie, on average, about 160 basis points above  those for  the 10‐ year 
Treasury yield. 
 
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the  associated  effects of the various interest rate  paths on 
MBS principal payments  using the Board and FRBNY prepayment  models.4  Both 
models show that lower  interest rates induce higher principal payments  from SOMA 
agency MBS holdings.   This result reflects the fact that lower  interest rates increase 
refinancing  activity, triggering  a faster pace of mortgage  prepayments.   
As shown by the solid black line in figure 2, using the Board model under the Tealbook  
baseline scenario,  MBS principal payments  are projected  to fall  below the redemption 
cap in August 2018.   With interest  rates 100 basis points lower  than in the Tealbook  
baseline, principal payments  are predicted  to fall  below the redemption  cap two 
months later (the  dashed black line).  A similar response  of prepayment  activity is 
projected  by the FRBNY’s prepayment  model under both the Tealbook  baseline and 
shocked scenarios  (the  solid and dashed black lines in figure 3).   
As the SEP‐consistent  interest rate  path lies close to the  shocked Tealbook  path, MBS 
principal payments  are similar in these  two cases.  In  contrast,  with the shocked SEP‐
consistent  path, principal payments  are notably higher and both the Board and FRBNY 
models predict that the redemption cap  would bind for about  one additional  year.  
Under  this scenario,  the 10‐year Treasury yield falls to 2 percent  and then  rises only 
gradually  to 2½ percent over the project ion period.  Consequently,  mortgage  rates 
also fall appreciably  below recent prevailing  levels,  thereby boosting  refinancing  
activity. 
All in all, the  scenarios  illustrate the  considerable  uncertainty  around projections  of 
MBS principal payments,  which in turn reflects the inherent uncertainty  in forecasts  of 
longer‐term interest  rates. 
                                                 
4 The Board prepayment  model is a relatively  simple framework  using limited inputs.  For a 
discussion  of this model, see Brian Bonis, John Kandrac, and Luke Pardue, “Principal  Payments  on 
the Federal  Reserve's  Securities  Holdings,”  FEDS Notes, June  16, 2017.  Meanwhile,  the FRBNY model 
includes  additional  drivers of prepayments  but still results in prepayment  forecast errors through 
time as a result of factors that are not considered  by either model.

decline about $1.3 tri llion, with holdings of  Treasury and agen cy securities shrinking 
about $800 billion and $500 billion, respectively.  At the time  of normalization: 
Reserve balances reach an assumed longer-run level of $500 bill ion;3
Total assets are projected t o stand at roughly $3 trillion, wit h the SOMA portfolio
consisting of about $1.6 trillion in Treasury securities and $1 .3 trillion in MBS.
Once these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the siz e of the balance
sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GD P, compared with a peak 
of about 25 percent in late 2014 and a pre-crisis average of ab out 6 percent.  After the 
size of the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings rise, keeping pace with the 
projected increases in Federal R eserve liabilities including Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation, the Treasury Genera l Account (TGA), and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  
However,  when expressed as a share of nominal GDP, Federal Reserve asset s and 
liabilities are projected to edge down, as their pace of expans ion is projected to be 
slightly slower than that of nominal GDP.  
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to about $57 billion this  year (including the transfer of $2.5 billion of surplus) 
from $80 billion in 2017, (see the “Income Projections” exhibit ).4  This decline primarily 
reflects the realized and expected increases in the interest ra te paid on reserves in 2018.5  
Total interest expense is projected to rise to $50 billion this year, while interest income 
from SOMA holdings is expected  to decline sl ightly to $110 bill ion.  As the target range 
for the federal funds rate move s up and the size of the SOMA po rtfolio decreases, 
remittances are expected to bottom out at about $33 billion in 2020.  Thereafter, 
3 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation are assumed to incr ease at an average annual pace o f about 6 percent through 2020 and at the 
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated 
financial market utilities remain at their March 2018 levels of  about $230 billion and $75 billion, 
respectively; and take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assu med to maintain a value of $100 billion until 
the level of reserve balances r eaches $1 trillion , at which poi nt take-up declines to zero over the course of 
one year. 
4 The Federal Reserve Board’s pub lic announcement of remittances  to the Treasury for 2017 is 
available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/ newsevents/pressreleases/other20 180110a.htm.  
5 We continue to assume that the FOMC will set a 25  basis-point-w ide target range for the federal 
funds rate throughout the projection period, and that the inter est rate paid on excess reserve balances and 
the offering rate on overnight RRPs will continue to be set at the top and bottom of the range, respectively.

remittances begin to increase as the Desk begins adding higher- yielding Treasury 
securities to the SOMA portfolio. 
The projected path for remittances over the next few years is s imilar to that 
implied by the March Tealbook baseline.  As shown in the bottom  left panel of the 
“Income Projections” exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nominal 
GDP over the projection period, s lightly higher than their pre- crisis average. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio will be 
in a net unrealized loss position of about $20 billion at the e nd of April.  With longer-
term interest rates expected to r ise further over the next seve ral years, the unrealized loss 
position is expected to reach $270 billion in 2020:Q2.  Of this  amount, $110 billion is 
attributable to Treasury securi ties and $160 billion to agency MBS.  The unrealized loss 
position subsequently narrows, in l arge part because the value of securities acquired 
under the Federal Reserve’s larg e-scale asset purchase programs  returns to par as those 
securities approach maturity.  R elative to the March Tealbook, the net unrealized position 
is projected to be, on average, a bout $15 billion less negative over the projection horizon, 
reflecting the lower trajector ies of medium- and longer-term in terest rates.   
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by 82 basis points; this effect is projected to fade 
gradually over time.6  This projection is little chan ged from the previous Tealbook.  
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  This measure is 
projected to increase throughout t he course of balance sheet normalization, as the pace of 
redemptions picks up and longer-dur ation securities become a la rger share of the 
portfolio.  
After normalization of the si ze of the balance sheet in 2021, t he duration of the 
SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Desk beg ins adding to the SOMA 
6 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007 2008.

sharp decline in duration result s from the staff’s assumption that the Desk will purchase 
only Treasury bills until they account for one-third of the Fed eral Reserve’s Treasury 
securities portfolio, close to the  pre-crisis composition (currently the SOMA portfolio 
contains no Treasury bills).  The reafter, purchases of Treasury  securities are assumed to
