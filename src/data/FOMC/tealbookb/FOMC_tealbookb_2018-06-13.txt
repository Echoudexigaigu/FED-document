Information received since the Committee met in May indicates t hat the economy 
is evolving broadly in line wit h expectations.  The labor market has continued to 
strengthen, with the unemploym ent rate declining to 3.8 percent  in May and payrolls 
expanding by an average of 180,000 pe r month over the past thre e months.  Real GDP 
growth appears to have bounced b ack in the curre nt quarter, led by a pickup in household 
spending.  The staff continues t o project above-trend growth th rough 2019 and high 
levels of resource utilization ove r the medium term.  The 12-month changes in headline 
and core PCE prices were 2.0 and 1.8 percent, respectively, in April.  For this year as a 
whole, as well as for 2019 and 2020, t he staff projects both he adline and core PCE 
inflation close to 2 percent.  
There are three key questions that the Committee is likely to f ace at this meeting:  
first, whether the available information warrants raising the t arget range for the federal 
funds rate; second, whether the f ederal funds rate path suggest ed by recent policy 
communications remains appropriate , given the current economic outlook and associated 
risks; and third, whether, in lig ht of the state of the economy  and the ongoing removal of 
policy accommodation, some parts of  the FOMC statement need to be updated so as to 
align the statement with the C ommittee’s current expectations a nd intentions.  With these 
issues in mind, three alternative  draft statements are presente d below. 
Alternative B in this Tealbook is based on the template present ed as Alternative C 
in the previous Tealbook.  Alternative B raises the target range for the federal funds rate 
by 25 basis points and notes the Committee’s expectation that f urther gradual increases 
will be consistent with sustain ed economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation 
near 2 percent.  If the federal f unds rate evolves in line with  expectations, it will soon be 
within the range of participants’ estimates of its normal longe r-run level.  Consequently, 
Alternative B drops the statement that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some 
time, below levels that are exp ected to prevail in the longer run.”   
Alternative C takes the view that a steep er policy rate path th an signaled in the 
Committee’s recent communications will likely be appropriate; i t therefore not only 
raises the target range but als o drops the indication that furt her rate increases are expected 
to be “gradual.”  Moreover, Alternative C conveys some concern about potential 
overheating by adding that “the Committee is closely monitoring  the implications of high

  levels of resource utilization.”  This Alternativ e also removes  the forward guidance that 
suggested that the federal funds rate will remain below its lon ger-run level for some time, 
for the same reason that it is removed in Alternative B.  
Alternative A is motivated by the view that longer-run inflation expectations are 
too low.  The outlook under Alternative A is conditioned on “ap propriate monetary 
policy accommodation” rather than  on further gradual increases in the federal funds rate.  
Accordingly, this alternative maintains the current target rang e for the federal funds rate.  
Alternative A also removes the  forward guidance language—in thi s instance, to signal 
that there is no presumption of fur ther interest rate increases . 
With regard to the specifics of the language in Alternatives A,  B, and C: 
 The three alternatives are simila r in their assessments of the incoming data, though 
Alternative C notes  that growth of household spending has “stre ngthened,” while 
Alternatives A and B note that it has “picked up.”  Alternative s A and B observe that 
inflation has “moved close to 2 pe rcent,” though Alternative A adds that this has only 
occurred “recently.”  Alternati ve C states that overall and core inflation “remain close 
to 2 percent.”  The alternatives a lso differ slightly in charac terizing inflation 
expectations: 
o Alternatives B and C combine mar ket-based measures of inflation  
compensation and survey-based measures of inflation expectation s into the 
broader category of “indicators  of longer-term inflation expect ations.”  These 
indicators are characterized as “little changed, on balance” ov er the 
intermeeting period.  In combining m arket-based and survey-base d measures, 
Alternatives B and C drop the observation that market-based mea sures 
“remain low.” 
o Alternative A continues to describe these two types of indicato rs separately, 
and retains language indicating t hat measures of  inflation comp ensation 
remain low. 
 With respect to the outlook for economic activity and inflation , the associated risks, 
and the monetary policy pat h upon which the outlook is conditio ned:     
o Alternative B projects “sustain ed expansion of economic activit y, strong labor 
market conditions, and inflation ne ar the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent 
inflation objective,” notes that risks to this outlook are roughly balanced, and

  conditions these outcomes on “furthe r gradual” increases in the federal funds 
rate.  Reflecting the view that the risk of inflation running p ersistently below 
2 percent has diminished, Alternative B removes the indication that “the 
Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation 
developments.”   
o Motivated by the risks posed by ove rly tight labor market condi tions, 
Alternative C signals that a st eeper trajectory of the federal funds rate will be 
warranted “to achieve a sustainable expansion of economic activ ity and 
employment and to maintain inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.”  While stati ng that the risks to the outloo k appear to be 
roughly balanced, Alternative C not es that “the Committee is cl osely 
monitoring the implications of hi gh levels of resource utilizat ion.”       
o Alternative A projects that “economic activity will expand at a  moderate 
pace” and that inflation will “move modestly above 2 percent fo r a time and 
then run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective” given 
“appropriate monetary policy acco mmodation.”  Alternative A sta tes that such 
a projected path for inflation s hould “help ensure that longer- term inflation 
expectations rise t o a level consistent w ith the Committee’s symmetric 
objective for 2 percent inflation.”   Reflecting the concern tha t longer-term 
inflation expectations may stil l be too low, Alternative A main tains the 
language that “the Committee w ill carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .”           
 With respect to the c urrent policy decision: 
o Alternatives B and C raise the  target range to 1¾ to 2 percent, and they both 
continue to note that the stan ce of monetary policy remains accommodative; 
Alternative C removes the associ ated rationale, which could suggest that an 
accommodative stance is no longer appropriate. 
o Alternative A leaves the tar get range unchanged at 1½ to 1¾ per cent. 
 All three alternatives drop the forward guidance stating that “ the federal funds rate is 
likely to remain, for some time, be low levels that are expected  to prevail in the longer 
run.”  
o The removal of this forward guidance from Alternatives B and C would signal 
that the federal funds rate coul d well move above its longer-ru n level as the 
Committee continues to increase the target range.

the Committee is in no hurry to ra ise the federal funds rate further.

  MAY 2018  FOMC  STATEMENT  
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in March 
indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and  that economic 
activity has been ris ing at a moderate rate.  Job gains have be en strong, on 
average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed  low.  Recent 
data suggest that growth of household spending moderated from i ts strong fourth-
quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow  strongly.  On a 
12-month basis, both overall inflati on and inflation for items other than food and 
energy have moved close to 2 percent.  Market-based measures of  inflation 
compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term i nflation 
expectations are lit tle changed, on balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual 
adjustments in the stance of m onetary policy, economic activity  will expand at a 
moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions wi ll remain 
strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee's 
symmetric 2 percent objective ove r the medium term.  Risks to t he economic 
outlook appear roughly balanced.  
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/2 
to 1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accomm odative, thereby 
supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained retur n to 2 percent 
inflation.  
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information, 
including measures of labor marke t conditions, indicators of in flation pressures 
and inflation expectations, and r eadings on financial and inter national 
developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected 
inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal .  The Committee 
expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that w ill warrant further 
gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the  federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data.

  ALTERNATIVE A FOR JUNE 2018 
1. Information received since the Fe deral Open Market Committee me t in March 
May  indicates that the labor market  has continued to strengthen an d that 
economic activity has been risi ng at a moderate rate.  Job gain s have been strong, 
on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low 
declined .  Recent data suggest that growth of household spending m odera ted 
from its strong fourth-quarter pace has picked up , while business fixed 
investment has continued to grow strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both overall  
inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy recently  have moved 
close to 2 percent.  Market-base d measures of inflation compens ation remain low; 
survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are  little changed, on 
balance. 
 
2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to f oster maximum 
employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual 
adjustments in the stance of appropriate  monetary policy accommodation , 
economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor 
market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected 
to move modestly above 2 percent for a time and then  run near the 
Committee's symmetric 2 percent ob jective over the m edium term.   Risks to the 
economic outlook appear roughly balanced. 
 
3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and in flation, the 
Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at         
1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.  The sta nce of monetary policy remains accommodative, 
thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustain ed return to 
period of inflation modestly above  2 percent inflation.  This inflation outcome 
should help ensure that longer-te rm inflation expectations rise  to a level 
consistent with the Committee’s symmetric objective for 2 perce nt inflation. 
 
4. In determining the timing and size  of future adjustments to the  target range for the 
federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expe cted economic 
conditions relative to  its objectives of maximum employment and  2 percent 
inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range  of information,

gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  
However, the actual path of the  federal funds rate will depend on the economic 
outlook as informed by incoming data.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B 
Economic Conditions and Outlook  
 Available data indicate that the  unemployment rate is very low and that the labor 
market continues to strengthen.   
o Payroll gains averaged 180,000 i n the three months ending in May, well above 
the pace that the staff estimates is consistent with no change in resource 
utilization.   
o The unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent in April and 3.8 perc ent in May, 
levels below all FOMC participan ts’ estimates of the longer-run  normal rate 
of unemployment in the March Sum mary of Economic Projections.   
o For the past few years, the participation rate has moved essent ially sideways, 
indicating some tightening rel ative to its downward trend.  
o Average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent over the year ending i n May.  ECI 
wages and salaries, measured on a 12-month basis, moved up to 2.9 percent in 
the first quarter, while benefits increased by 2.5 percent.  Th ese readings are 
only modestly higher than they were a year earlier.   
 Inflation recently has been, and is likely to remain, close to the Committee’s 
symmetric 2 percent goal.   
o The 12-month change in core PCE  prices stood at 1.8 percent in April.  Total 
PCE prices rose 2 percent over the 12 months ending in April.   
o The staff projects that core PCE inflation will remain close to  2 percent 
through 2020.  Total PCE inflati on on a 12-month basis is projected to 
increase to 2½ percent by mid-year  as consumer energy prices co ntinue to 
rise, and then slow to 2 per cent by the end of 2018 as energy prices level off; 
thereafter, total PCE inflation is projected to run a bit below  core inflation 
over the medium term with ener gy prices projected to slowly dec line.   
o Both market- and survey-based ind icators of longer-term inflation 
expectations have moved little, on b alance, since the April Tealbook, and are 
consistent with the view that th ese expectations remain stable.  
 The staff estimates that out put stands nearly 2 percent above i ts potential level in the 
current quarter and that the gap between actual and potential output will continue to

  widen through 2019.  In this projec tion, real GDP growth is 2¾ percent this year and 
then gradually slows to 1¾ percent in 2020.    
 Despite increased financial stress in some emerging market econ omies and renewed 
political risks in Italy, the st aff projects that foreign real GDP growth will remain near 
its estimated potential rate of  2¾ percent over the medium term .    
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that furthe r gradual incr eases in the fe deral funds rate are 
appropriate to balance the ris k of overly tight resource utiliz ation against the risk of 
inflation again falling below 2 percent. 
o An increase in the t arget range in June may be seen as consiste nt with the 
Committee’s earlier statements i ndicating that further gradual adjustments in 
the stance of monetary policy woul d be appropriate if the econo my evolved 
about as anticipated.  
 Policymakers may see recent inflation developments as confirming the view that the 
idiosyncratic factors that held dow n inflation last year were t ransitory.  That being so, 
they may expect that, with furth er gradual tightening of moneta ry policy, inflation 
will continue to run close to the Committee’s symmetric 2 perce nt inflation goal.   
 With the target range for the federal funds rate moved up to 1¾  to 2 percent, and in 
light of further antic ipated gradual increases in the federal funds rate, policymakers 
may wish to signal that they no l onger expect that “the federal  funds rate is likely to 
remain, for some time, below lev els that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”   
Removing this language would allow for the possibility that the  federal funds rate 
will rise above its longer-run level.   
 With headline and core measures of inflation running near the C ommittee’s 2 percent 
symmetric goal, policymakers ma y wish to remove the language stating that they will 
“carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments.”     
 A statement along the lines of A lternative B seems unlikely to generate appreciable 
changes in asset prices.  As shown in the “Monetary Policy Expectations and 
Uncertainty” box in this Tealbook, f inancial market quotes indicate that market 
participants regard th e odds of a rate hike  at the upcoming mee ting as near 100 
percent.  Respondents to the Desk’ s latest surveys of primary d ealers and market 
participants have broadly simila r views.  The removal of the fo rward guidance stating 
that “the federal funds rate is  likely to remain, for some time , below levels that are

 Monetary  Policy Expectations  and Uncertainty  
Market participants  are all but certain that the  FOMC will raise the target range 
for the federal funds  rate by 25 basis points at its June meeting.   A straight read 
of quotes on federal funds  futures contracts  implies that investors  attach a 
probability  of close to 100 percent  to such an  outcome  (figure 1).1  The Desk’s 
June Surveys of  Primary Dealers and Market Participants  also showed high odds 
of a rate increase  in June, with an average  probability  across respondents  of 
close to 90 percent  (not shown). 
The May FOMC meeting minutes,  released  on May 23, 2018, noted  that FOMC 
participants  discussed  the possibility  of setting the IOER rate 5 basis  points below 
the top end of the federal funds  target range to keep  the effective  federal funds  
rate well within the  target ra nge.  This discussion  reportedly  caught investors  by 
surprise, and  implied rates on federal funds  futures for July 2018 declined  
discretely  by 3.5 basis poin ts after the minutes were released.   Consistent  with 
the technical  nature of the adjustment,  this decline was reportedly  driven by 
changes in expectations  about the level of the effective  federal funds  rate within 
the target range  rather than by changes in expectations  of the target range 
itself.  Financial  market quotes provide some support for this  interpretation:  
Figure 2 show s the distribution  of the effective  federal funds  rate for July  2018 
implied by options on federal funds futures before and after the release of the 
minutes (not adjusted for risk premiums).   It provides  a granular  view based on 
6¼‐basis‐point‐wide ranges, using the narrowest  increments  in strike prices 
available for these options.   Both distributions  are consistent with  high 
expectations  of an increase in  the target range to 1.75  to 2 percent at the June  
meeting.   However,  the release of the minutes prompted  a leftward move  in the 
distribution,  with  the mod al outcome  shifting from the 1.94 to 2.00 percent range 
to the 1.88 to  1.94 percent range.2 
Looking further ahead, the  probability  distribution  of the level of the federal 
funds rate at  the end of 2018 implied by options quotes, assuming  zero term 
premiums,  shifted marginally  to the left over the intermeeting  period (figure 3).  
It continues  to suggest that investors  place the highest odds on  the federal funds  
rate being  in either the 2 to 2¼ percent range or the 2¼ to 2½ percent range at 
                                                 
1 Our methodology  for computing  this probability  takes into account the anticipated  
effect of the adjustment  in IOER mentioned  in the May FOMC meeting minutes (discussed  in 
the next paragraph). 
2 Prior to the minutes release, options markets appear to have priced in some probability  
that the average effective federal funds  rate in July would exceed 2 percent, and that 
probability  diminished  after the release.  The probability  of about 15 percent seen before the 
release  of the minutes is hard to reconcile  with the experience  of the past several years, during 
which the average  effective rate in any given calendar month remained  firmly within the target 
range.  It  may, in part,  reflect limited liquidity of those out‐of‐money  options, some risk 
premium  built into options quotes,  or investors  perceiving  a small probability  of a 50‐basis 
point  hike at the June meeting.

surveys (figure 4)  shifted to the right a bit, but also continues  to place about  the 
same probability  to either  the 2 to 2¼ percent or  the 2¼ to 2½ percent range at

Figure 5 shows  how differ ent measures  of federal funds  rate expectations  for the

metrics (with and  without term premium  adjustments)  derived from  quotes on 
overnight index  swap contracts  (OIS), the median projection  from FOMC 
participants’  Summary  of Economic  Projections  (SEP) through March 2018, and  
the median of  respondents’  modal forecasts  as well as the average of the 
respondents’  implied mean forecasts  from the Desk survey s.  Of note,  the latter 
two forecasts  approximately  correspond  to the mode and mean, respectively, of  
the distribution  shown in  figure 4.  The SEP  median (the golden  squares)  has 
been stable at  2 to 2¼ percent from early 2017 through March of  this year, while 
the market‐based measures  (the red and blue lines) and the Desk survey–implied  
mean and  modal forecasts  (the gray and black dots, respectively)  have inched up.  
The narrowing of  the gap between  the forward rates implied by OIS quotes (the 
blue line) and  the expected  path of the federal funds rate with adjustments  for 
term premiums as  estimated  by a staff term structure  model (the  red line) 
reflects, in  part, negative  term premiums  that are narrowing  toward zero as the 
projection  horizon shortens,  and possibl y also attenuation  of downside  risks as 
interest rates move further away from the lower bound. 
The forecasts  implied by the June  Desk surveys were little changed  relative to the 
May surveys, and the market‐based measures  were also little changed, on  net, 
over the intermeeting  period.  Notable  decreases  were associated  with flight ‐to‐
safety flows surrounding  political developments  in Italy, but the declines  have 
since retrace d amid an easing  of those concerns  and the release of the stronger ‐
than‐expected  May Employment  Situation  Report.  The latest readings  of the 
unadjusted  market‐implied measure,  the March SEP  Median, and the Desk 
Survey’s impli ed mean forecast  are consistent  with a total  of three  25‐basis‐point 
rate increases  in 2018, while  the market measure that adjusts for term premiums 
and the Desk Survey’s latest  modal forecast both imply an expectation  of four 
rate hikes  in 2018.  Market‐ implied measures  of the expected  federal funds  rate 
path beyond 2018 are little changed, on  net (figure 6).

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that the la bor market is operating appre ciably beyond full 
employment and that economic ac tivity—which is expanding at a f aster-than-
sustainable rate—will conti nue to be spurred by expansionary fi scal policy.   
o The unemployment rate, at 3.8 percent in May, is below each FOM C 
participant’s estimate of its  longer-run normal level and is pr ojected to decline 
further.  Other indicators al so point to an already-tight labor  market; these 
include a record-high job openi ngs rate, continued reports of f irms having 
difficulty hiring workers, and ver y low initial claims for unem ployment 
insurance.   
 Policymakers may judge that more concerted upward pressure on both wages and 
prices is likely to emerge if the  economy experiences a prolong ed period of 
significant labor market tightne ss.  If so, they may be concern ed that inflation will 
move persistently abov e 2 percent unless the federal funds rate soon begins to rise 
more rapidly . 
 Despite six increases in the ta rget range for t he federal funds rate between December 
2015 and March 2018 and some recent financial market volatility  and appreciation of 
the dollar, financial conditions continue to be supportive of above-potential growth and, by some measures, have eased on balance since December 201 5.  On net, broad 
equity price indexes have increased roughly 35 percent and spre ads of investment- 
and speculative grade corporate bonds over equivalent maturity Treasury securities 
have declined around 60 and 250 basi s points, respectively, sin ce the target range was 
first raised above its effective lower bound in December 2015.  The narrowing of 
spreads on high-yield bonds has o ccurred even as use of leverag e by speculative-
grade and unrated firms has increased over the past several years.   
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may judge that a fa ster removal of policy accommod ation is necessary 
in the near term to avoid signi ficant overheati ng and a subsequent need to tighten 
policy abruptly.    
o Policymakers may be concerned that ongoing above-trend economic  growth 
and an already-strong labor market that continues to tighten co uld soon result 
in more notable upward pressure on inflation.   
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
June 7, 2018

  o They may also judge that a steeper  trajectory of rate hikes is needed to prevent 
the unemployment rate from dec lining significantly further belo w its normal 
longer-run value; such a further  decline could make it increasi ngly 
challenging to engineer a soft landing as inflation picks up.  
o Additionally, amid elevated asset  valuations and an increased u se of debt by 
nonfinancial corporations, policymakers may see a somewhat faster pace of 
rate increases as needed to a void a significan t buildup of fina ncial imbalances.   
 For the above reasons, policymak ers may opt to increase the tar get range for the 
federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent and to drop statement lan guage that describes the 
future pace of tightening as gradual.  In addition, policymakers may wish to signal 
that the Committee now judges that a steeper path for the federal funds rate—steeper 
than suggested by the Committee’s previous communications—will be warranted “to 
achieve a sustainable expansion of  economic activity  and employment  and to 
maintain inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective.”      
 Policymakers may also wish to communicate in paragraph 2 that “the Committee is 
closely monitoring the implicati ons of high levels of resource utilization” to signal 
that they are concerned about the  risks from overheating, including the possibility that 
a prolonged period of high resource  utilization might lead to a build-up of financial 
vulnerabilities.     
 While market participants are e xpecting an increase in the fede ral funds rate target 
range to 1¾ to 2 percent, they woul d likely read the change in language in paragraph 
2, in conjunction with the dropping o f the final few sentences in paragraph 4, as a 
signal that the Committee intends  to raise the federal funds rate more rapidly than 
previously expected.  Medium- a nd longer-term real interest rates could rise, as could 
the exchange value of the dollar;  equity prices a nd inflation c ompensation could fall.  
The change in statement language  could also increase investors’  uncertainty about the 
future path of the federal funds rate.

  THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A 
Economic Conditions and Outlook 
 Policymakers may judge that infl ation has not sustainably returned to 2 percent.  On a 
12-month basis, core PCE inflation moved to 1.8 percent in April, still below the 
symmetric 2 percent objective .  The 12-month trimmed mean  PCE inflation rate from 
the Federal Reserve  Bank of  Dallas was 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in 
April, about the same as the preceding 12 months.        
 One factor holding down both core and total inflation may be lo w expected inflation.  
Readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation remain substantially 
below where they were before the middle of 2014, and some survey-based measures 
of longer-term inflation expecta tions are still low by historic al standards.  
 Moreover, the labor market may not yet have reached maximum sus tainable 
employment and may have further r oom for improvement.  While jo b gains have been 
solid, wages have not accelerated much.  The employment-to-popu lation ratio for 
prime-age workers has been ris ing but still remains well below its pre-recession level, 
suggesting scope for further labor market strengthening.   
Policy Strategy 
 Policymakers may be concerned that, because inflation has run p ersistently below 
2 percent in recent years, longer- term inflation expectations a re now too low; 
policymakers also may be concerned that inflatio n expectations could drift down 
further if the Committee conti nues to tighten m onetary policy w ithout clear evidence 
that inflation will remain near 2 percent on a sustained basis.   Policymakers may 
judge that removing the statement ’s emphasis on monitoring infl ation now that 
inflation is near 2 percent runs t he risk of creating the perce ption that the Committee 
sees its longer-run objective as a  ceiling rather than as a sym metric objective.   
o Against that background, policymak ers may favor Alternative A in order to 
underscore the Committee’s comm itment to its inflation objectiv e and to 
ensure that longer-term inflati on expectations become well anch ored at a level 
consistent with the Committee’ s 2 percent objec tive.  In additi on, 
policymakers may judge that the past decade’s experience of low inflation reduces the likelihood that longer-run inflation expectations w ill rise above 2 
percent.     
Alternatives
Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)
June 7, 2018
Page 17 of 40

  o Consequently, policymakers may fa vor the addition of language i n paragraph 
3 to indicate that the Committee would welcome “a period of inf lation 
modestly above 2 percent” in order to “ensure  that longer-term inflation 
expectations rise t o a level consistent w ith the Committee’s symmetric 
objective for 2 percent inflation.” 
 Policymakers may view the current state of the financial system  as sound and the 
potential for a buildup of risks t o financial stability as limi ted, or they may judge that 
interest rate policy is not an effective tool for addressing an y emerging financial 
stability concerns.     
 Despite the likely expansionary effects of recently enacted changes in federal taxes 
and spending, some other policies— particularly trade policies—and recent political 
developments in Europe pose downside risks.  Policymakers may j udge that their 
ability to react to downside outcomes remains limited by the pr oximity of the federal 
funds rate to the e ffective lower bound. 
 Financial market quotes and the D esk’s latest surveys indicate that market 
participants view an increase in  the target range at the June m eeting as a near 
certainty.  Thus, a statement al ong the lines of Alternative A would likely be regarded 
as an important change in the Committee’s policy outlook and re duce expectations of 
further rate hikes.  If the public saw this statement as primar ily reflecting 
policymakers’ resolve to push i nflation above 2 percent for a t ime, then inflation 
compensation could rise, real longe r-term interest rates would probably fall 
somewhat, and equity prices might r ise.  Lower real rates and t he prospect of higher 
inflation likely would lead to de preciation of the dollar.  Con versely, if investors read 
the statement as reflecting a n unexpectedly downbeat assessment  of the economic 
outlook, equity prices and inflati on compensation could fall.

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTE 
If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range f or the federal funds 
rate, an implementation note th at indicates no change in the ad ministered rates—the 
interest rates on required and ex cess reserves, the offering ra te on overnight reverse 
repurchase agreements, and the pr imary credit rate—would be iss ued.  If the Committee 
decides to raise the target range  for the federal funds rate, a n implementation note that 
communicates the changes the Fed eral Reserve decided to make in  these three policy 
tools would be issued.  The changes include a small technical r ealignment of the interest 
rate paid on required and excess re serve balances relative to the top of the target range for 
the federal funds rate, as disc ussed by policymakers during May ’s joint meeting of the 
FOMC and Board.  Draft implementation notes that correspond to these two cases appear

maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 
1.75 percent, effective May 3 June 14, 2018. 
 
 As part of its policy decision, the F ederal Open Market Committee voted to 
authorize and direct the Open Mar ket Desk at the Federal Reserv e Bank of New

“Effective May 3 June 14, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee 
directs the Desk to undertake ope n market operations as necessa ry to

including overnight reverse repurchase opera tions (and reverse repurchase 
operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) a t an 
offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the v alue of 
Treasury securities held  outright in the Sys tem Open Market Account that

Balance Sheet and Income Projections 
The staff has prepared projecti ons of the Federal Reserve’s bal ance sheet and 
elements of the associated incom e statement that are consistent  with the baseline 
economic outlook presented in Tealbook A.  Key features of thes e projections are 
described below.  
SOMA redemptions and reinvestments.   As reported in t he exhibit titled 
“Redemptions and Reinvestments of SOMA Principal Payments,” the  staff projects that 
the balance sheet normalization program initiated in October 20 17 will lead to the 
redemption of $229 billion of Treasury securities and about $14 6 billion of agency 
securities over 2018.  During t his same period, $197 billion of  principal from maturing 
Treasury securities and about  $64 billion of principal from age ncy securities will be 
reinvested.1  Under the staff’s current baseline forecast of rising longer- term interest 
rates, the cap on monthly redemptions of agency securities is n ot projected to bind after it 
rises to its $20 billion maximum on October 1 of this year.  Ho wever, the projections for 
agency securities are subject  to considerable uncertainty because unscheduled 
prepayments depend on several fact ors that are difficult to pre dict, including the realized 
path of mortgage rates.2    
Evolution of the size of the balance sheet.   Based on the baseline economic 
outlook in the June Tealbook, the s ize of the balance sheet is projected to normalize in 
the third quarter of 2021, unchanged from the April Tealbook (s ee the exhibit titled 
“Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items” and the table that follows the exhibit).3   
1 Once the cap on monthly reductions in SOMA holdings of Treasur y securities has been fully 
phased in, reinvestments of principal from maturing Treasury se curities will primarily take place in the 
middle month of each quarter.   
2 If actual principal payments wer e to breach the $20 billion max imum cap before the size of the 
balance sheet is normalized, the n the Desk would reinvest in MBS the amount by which the principal 
payments received during any mont h exceeds the cap.  See the Ju ne FOMC memo titled “Operational 
Readiness for MBS Reinvestme nts” for further details. 
3 Many factors will influence th e size of the balance sheet upon  normalization, including banks’ 
post-crisis underlying demand for reserves.  Generally speaking , the size of the balance  sheet is considered 
to be normalized when the resumption of purchases of Treasury s ecurities is required to maintain the 
desired longer-run level of rese rve balances and accommodate th e expansion of other key non-reserve 
liability items.

From the start of the balance sheet normalization program in Oc tober 2017 to its 
projected conclusion in 2021, the  Federal Reserve’s securities holdings are predicted to 
decline about $1.3 tri llion, with holdings of  Treasury and agen cy securities shrinking 
about $800 billion and $500 billion, respectively.  At the time  of normalization: 
Reserve balances reach an assumed longer-run level of $500 bill ion;4
Total assets of the SOMA portf olio are projected to be roughly $3 trillion,
consisting of about $1.7 trillion in Treasury securities and $1 .3 trillion in agency
securities.
Once these declines in asset holdings have taken place, the siz e of the balance
sheet is projected to stand at roughly 13 percent of nominal GD P, compared with a peak 
of about 25 percent in 2014 and a pr e-crisis average of about 6  percent.  After the size of 
the balance sheet is normalized, SOMA holdings will rise, keepi ng pace with the 
increases in Federal Reserve lia bilities including Federal Rese rve notes in circulation, the 
Treasury General Account (TGA), and Federal Reserve Bank capita l.  As shares of 
nominal GDP, Federal Reserve asse ts and liabilities are expecte d to edge down.  
Federal Reserve remittances.   Remittances to the Treasury are projected to 
decline to $59 billion this year from $80 billion in 2017, (see  the “Income Projections” 
exhibit).5,6  This decline primarily reflect s the realized and expected inc reases in the 
interest rate paid on reserves in 2018.  Total interest expense  is projected to rise to nearly 
$50 billion this year, while inter est income from SOMA holdings  is expected to decline 
slightly, to $111 billion.  As the target range for the federal  funds rate moves up and the 
interest expense on reserve balances increases, remittances are expected to decline further 
4 Other noteworthy assumptions  about liability items underlying the projections are as follows:  
The Treasury General Account is a ssumed to increase in line wit h nominal GDP; Federal Reserve notes in 
circulation are assumed to incr ease at an average annual pace o f about 6 percent through 2020 and at the 
same pace as nominal GDP thereafter; the foreign repo pool and balances in the accounts of designated 
financial market utilities remain at their April 2018 levels of  $250 billion and $70 billion, respectively; and 
take-up at the overnight RRP facility is assumed to maintain a value of $100 billion until the level of 
reserve balances reaches $1 trillion, at which point take-up de clines to zero over the course of one year. 
5 This estimate includes two mandated transfers to the Treasury due to reductions to the statutory 
limit on aggregate Reserve Bank  surplus.  First , $2.5 billion w as transferred in February resulting from the 
Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018.  Second, $675 million is anticip ated to be transferred at the end of June 
reflecting the amendment to The Economic Growth, Regulatory Rel ief, and Consumer Protection Act of 
2018.

  and to bottom out at about $34 bi llion in 2020.  Thereafter, remittances increase as the 
Desk begins to add Treasury securi ties to the SOMA portfolio. 
The projected path for remittances over the next few years is s imilar to that in the 
April Tealbook baseline.  As shown in the bottom left panel of the “Income Projections” 
exhibit, annual remittances average about 0.25 percent of nomin al GDP over the 
projection period, slightly higher than their pre-crisis averag e. 
Unrealized gains or losses.   The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio will be 
in a net unrealized loss po sition of nearly $40 b illion at the end of June. (See the Box 
titled “What Does It Mean for the  SOMA Portfolio to Be in an “U nrealized Loss” 
Position?” for further information about accounting practices r elated to the SOMA 
portfolio).  With longer-term inte rest rates expected to rise f urther over the next several 
years, the unrealized loss position is expected to reach $250 b illion in 2020:Q2.  Of this 
amount, nearly $100 billion is attrib utable to Treasury securities and $150 billion to 
agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position subsequently narrows, in large part because 
the value of securities acquire d under the Federal Reserve’s la rge-scale asset purchase 
programs returns to par as those securities approach maturity.  Relative to the April 
Tealbook, the net unrealized position over the projection horiz on is little changed. 
Term premium effect.   As shown in the table “Pr ojections for the 10-Year 
Treasury Term Premium Effect,” SOMA securities held as a result  of the Federal 
Reserve’s asset purchase program s are currently estimated to be  reducing the term 
premium in the 10-year Treas ury yield by 82 basis points, uncha nged from the previous 
Tealbook; this effect is projec ted to fade gradually over time.7   
SOMA characteristics.  As shown in the top panel of t he “Projections for the 
Characteristics of SOMA Treasury S ecurities Holdings” exhibit, the weighted-average 
duration of the SOMA Treasury port folio is currently about six years.  This measure is 
projected to increase over the co urse of balance sheet normaliz ation, as the pace of 
redemptions picks up and longer-dur ation securities become a la rger share of the 
portfolio.  In terms of compos ition of the portfolio, the share of MBS is expected to peak 
at 44 percent a few months before normalization, reflecting the  faster pace of roll-offs in 
7 The estimated path of the term premium effect depends on the d ifference between the expected 
path of the Federal Reserve’s ba lance sheet over coming years a nd a benchmark counterfactual projection 
based on the configuration of the balance sheet that prevailed before the financial crisis of 2007 2008.

What Does  It Mean for the SOMA Portfolio  to Be in an 
“Unrealized  Loss” Position? 
In May 2018, the  Federal Reserve  Board published  the Federal Reserve Banks Combined  
Quarterly  Financial Report  for the first  quarter of 2018.1  For the first time since 2013,  
the financial report showed an unrealized  loss position  for the overall  SOMA portfolio,  
in the amount of $462 million.  The unrealized  loss is expected  to become larger over 
the next couple of  years and is likely to garner some attention  from the public.  In this 
box, we explain the accounting  notions of unrealized  and realized gain and  loss 
positions,  as well as their implications  for the Federal Reserve’s ability  to meet its 
obligations.   
When the  Federal Reserve purchases  a security,  the market price paid generally  differs 
from the security’s  face value.  If the security is purchased  for more  (less) than its face  
value, the difference  between  the purchase  price and the face value—the  premium  
(the discount)  on that security—is  recorded  separately  on the balance sheet.2  The 
premium  or discount  is amortized  over the  life of the security, and the security’s  
amortized  cost is defined as the purchase price  less the amount of the premium  or 
discount that has already been written down.   If the security is held to maturity,  the 
Federal Reserve  receives the face value, which at that point equals the security’s  
amortized  cost.  
For transparency  purposes,  the Federal Reserve  also includes in its financial reports 
the fair value  of SOMA securities  holdings,  although  it is not required  to do so.3  Fair 
value represents  the price that would be received if the securities  were sold in an 
orderly market transaction.   Along with fair values, the  Federal Reserve  also reports 
the cumulative unrealized  gain or loss position  of the SOMA portfolio,  which is the 
difference  between the  fair value  of the securities  held in the SOMA and their 
amortized  cost. 
The unrealized  position of the SOMA portfolio is  primarily  affected  by movements  in 
interest rates; when interest rates  rise, the fair value  of securities  held declines,  
resulting in a decline  in the unrealized  position.   Figure 1 plots the 10‐year Treasury  
yield against the SOMA’s quarter‐ end unrealized gain or loss position  since 2012.   In 
the aftermath of  the global financial crisis, the SOMA portfolio was  in a large 
1 For the first three quarters in a year, the Board of Governors  publishes  the Federal  Reserve 
Banks’  combined  financial statements  in the unaudited  Federal Reserve Banks Combined  Quarterly  
Financial Report .  Following  each year‐end, the Board of Governors  publishes  the Federal Reserve 
System Audited Annual Financial Statements .  Quarterly  reports and annual statements  are available 
at https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/fed ‐financial‐statements.htm .

Manual for Federal  Reserve Banks (FAM), available at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutth efed/files/bstfinaccountingmanual.pdf.   
3 Fair values of SOMA holdings are presented  in Table 2 of the Supplemental  Financial

unrealized  gain position driven by both the historically  large portfolio size  and the low 
interest rate  environment,  as interest rates at that  time were lower than  when the 
securities  were originally  purchased.   SOMA’s unrealized  position became negative  in 
2013 during the so‐called “taper tantrum,”  and then again in the first quarter of 2018.  
Going forward,  with interest rates  expected  to increase,  the unrealized  loss position  is 
projected  to reach about $250 billion in two years,  before narrowing as  the securities  
acquired under the large‐scale asset purchase programs approach maturity.   
 Figure 1: 10‐year Treasury  Yield and SOMA Unrealized  Gain/Loss  Position 
The SOMA’s  unrealized  gain or loss position  does not affect the ability  of the Federal 
Reserve to meet its  responsibilities—including  the conduct of  monetary  policy—and  
financial obligations.   Moreover,  the unrealized position  has no impact on net  earnings 
of the Federa l Reserve or on its remittances  to the U.S. Treasury. 
When securities  are sold or prepayments  from MBS are received,  the SOMA 
portfolio’s  gains or losses become realized and affect the Reserve  Banks’ net  income 
and remittances  to the Treasury.4  In the unlikely event that realized  losses on the 
SOMA portfolio resulted  in negative net earnings,  the Federal Reserve’s remittances  
to the Treasury  would be suspended.   In this case, a deferred asset  would be recorded  
on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet,  representing  the amount of net earnings  that 
the Reserve Banks would need to realize  before remittances  to the  Treasury would 
4 Any realized gains  and losses are recorded  in the non‐interest  income portion of the Combined  
Statements  of Operations.   For example,  under  the Maturity  Extension  Program,  nearly $700 billion 
of shorter‐term Treasury securities  were sold or redeemed  from October 2011 until the end of 2012.  
As a result, total net gains of about $15 billion were recorded  over the course of this program.

resume.  In  such a circumstance,  the Federal Reserve  would still be able to meet  all of 
its responsibilities  and financial obligations.5 
5 The Federal  Reserve remits its net earnings to the U.S. Treasury,  after providing  for the costs 
of operations,  payment of dividends,  and any amount necessary  to maintain a statutorily  defined 
surplus.  As these  net earnings accrue, they are recorded  on the Federal  Reserve’s  balance sheet in 
the liability account labeled “Accrued  Remittances  to Treasury / Deferred  Asset.”

SOMA Treasury portfolio is project ed to decline as the Desk beg ins adding securities to 
the SOMA portfolio to keep pace with the expansion in non-reser ve liabilities.  The 
initial sharp decline in duration results from the staff’s assu mption that the Desk will 
purchase only Treasury bills until they account for one-third o f the Federal Reserve’s

portfolio contains no Treasury bi lls).  Thereafter, purchases o f Treasury securities are
